"In the weeks since the coronavirus outbreak first reached the United States, @realDonaldTrump has launched a barrage of more than 50 tweets on the growing pandemic, initially offering a rosy assessment of the growing health crisis—assuring Americans that it will “all work out well,” that the outbreak was spreading “very slowly in the U.S.” and that it’s “very much under control”—even as the death toll rose and the number of cases ballooned. In recent days, Trump has taken a more serious tone about the crisis, advocating for policy responses and travel bans, but even the news conference announcing his national emergency declaration ended with a jaunty exclamation point. That’s Trump himself. But what about his Twitterverse? The president follows only 47 accounts on Twitter, a collection of family members, conservative pundits, administration officials and Trump-brand properties.  Even as health experts and mainstream reporters have grown increasingly anxious about the White House’s response to the coronavirus pandemic—and have taken to using their own Twitter accounts to share hand-washing videos and urgent warnings from doctors overseas—when Trump opens his own Twitter feed, he scrolls through something very different. The picture Trump sees, in a nutshell: That the coronavirus crisis is someone else’s fault (China, Joe Biden, etc.), that he’s doing a great job responding to it, and that a Trump-hating media is just fanning the flames.  “The American people have seen once again that President @realDonaldTrump has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people,” tweeted Vice President Mike Pence. “Remember Democrats Pushed Impeachment While Coronavirus Spread,” Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on Friday morning, with a link to a Breitbart column.  “@realDonaldTrump will use every tool available to protect the American worker as he safeguards the health of all,” tweeted Ivanka Trump on Tuesday.  As Trump faces the biggest public health crisis of his presidency, a reading of dozens of tweets from the president’s favorite Twitter users over the past week shows his allies shaping Trump’s feed into five main coronavirus narratives: While Trump has come under increased pressure to respond more forcefully to the outbreak, his allies have taken to Twitter to frame the coronavirus as a foreign threat that spiraled out of control because of a bungled international response.  “Remember, China initially REFUSED to allow the CDC into Wuhan,” conservative activist and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec said in a post retweeted into the president’s feed by his son Donald Jr.  “Inside China's high-stakes campaign to smear the United States over coronavirus,” read the headline of a Fox News article in the president’s feed.  “POTUS was right to restrict travel from China in January, and now there is more evidence that @realDonaldTrump made the right call restricting travel from Europe, too,” tweeted Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee.  “President Trump must take China on here—they created this health crisis, now they’re claiming America is to blame. Typical communist ploy. #Wuhancoronavirus,” tweeted Fox News personality Laura Ingraham.  The president’s allies were also quick to dogpile on 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, who was vice president during the 2009 H1N1/swine flu pandemic and 2014 Ebola epidemic. Even so, former President Barack Obama has remained relatively unscathed by attacks in the Trump Twitterverse, which remains focused on Biden.  “When Biden was vice president, swine flu infected 61 million Americans and killed 12,000,” Ryan Saavedra, a reporter with the conservative online outlet the Daily Wire, wrote in a post retweeted into Trump’s feed. A few hours later, Trump himself took a swipe at Biden, blaming the former vice president for the deaths of thousands of people during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.  “President @realDonaldTrump acted early and decisively... His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens’ fears,” tweeted Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, quoting the campaign's communications director.  “When @JoeBiden was faced with a public health crisis on H1N1, he pushed the panic button and the White House had to cover it,” read a message retweeted by Donald Jr.  Other tweets in the president’s news feed framed recent comments from Biden opposing xenophobia as opposition to Trump’s temporary ban on travel from China.  “If Biden had been in charge, more Americans would have contracted the virus faster,” a Trump campaign account tweeted. And in response to a Biden speech in which the former vice president criticized the president for labeling COVID-19 a “foreign virus,” Laura Ingraham tweeted: “Yeah, Joe! Let’s throw open our borders, our airports, our ports to anyone and everyone—that will really stem the infection rate!” Critique of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is largely absent from his Twitter feed. Instead, his allies have heaped praise on the administration’s response.  “Deeply impressive extraordinary partnership of America’s best and brightest business & government gathered at White House under leadership of @realDonaldTrump & @VP,” tweeted Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera after Friday’s national emergency declaration. “They and we are going to kick #Corona’s ass.” “This is a very good call,” conservative political commentator Eric Bolling tweeted on Friday in response to reports that Trump was planning to declare a national emergency.  “This is the leadership @realDonaldTrump was elected to provide,” tweeted Trump’s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, after the president’s Oval Office address on Wednesday night. “Acting early & decisively he put the U.S. on much better footing than other nations in handling the coronavirus.” “President Trump is exactly right: ‘smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow,’” tweeted Congressman Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican close to the White House. “The President’s actions are proactive and decisive. This is exactly what we need to keep Americans safe and healthy.”  And a tweet from Eric Trump shared simply the headline of an adulatory New York Post column: “Trump passes coronavirus test with flying colors.”  The president’s eldest son, Donald Jr., has led the Trump Twitterverse’s charge against the mainstream press’s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. In his posts and retweets, he’s accused news outlets of stoking panic and helping China spread propaganda. “That the US media is trying to run with the Chinese propaganda that ‘China bought us time’ is a new low even for them,” Donald Jr. tweeted in response to a New York Times op-ed. “F-you!” “The media has thrown everything at [Trump] and none of it has stuck,” said YouTube personality Dave Rubin in a tweet shared by Donald Jr. “So now they have a vested interest in spreading panic, rejoicing over market drops and sewing general chaos.” “This Chinese propaganda about the origin of the coronavirus is being directly amplified and aided by the U.S. media, which is censoring anyone who notes the Wuhan origin of the coronavirus,” said Mike Cernovich, a right-wing activist and conspiracy theorist, in a post retweeted by Donald Jr.  “CNN is literally taking its talking points from the Chinese government,” read another Cernovich tweet shared by the president’s son. Other accounts followed by the president sounded a similar tone. “Erring on the side of maximum transparency is a good thing for the White House given the mass hysteria being stoked by the partisans in media and politics with [the] goal of affecting the election,” tweeted Laura Ingraham.  “I just want to stress to politicians and the media to stop using [coronavirus] as a tool to politicize things and to scare people,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a tweet shared by McDaniel. “It's not responsible. This is not the time for this.” During a March 4 phone call with Sean Hannity, Trump falsely implied the coronavirus outbreak was not as bad as the seasonal flu—an idea he may have picked up from his Twitter followers, who have downplayed the virus’ threat. “They say the mortality rate for Coronavirus is higher than the flu,” tweeted Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. “Consider though that we have a flu vaccine and yet in 2019, 16,000 Americans died from the flu. Imagine if we did not have that vaccine. The flu would be a pandemic.”  “The word ‘pandemic’ is scary, but as @drsanjaygupta points out, it doesn’t speak to mortality rates, only to global scope of infection,” Ingraham tweeted in late February. “As @CDCgov notes, actual mortality rates or coronavirus is very low.” On Friday morning, Ingraham tweeted a link to an article headlined: “Coronavirus: Facts vs. Panic,” which stated “most people who get coronavirus have mild or no symptoms” and “most around the world diagnosed from January-March 1 have already recovered.”  “Great time to fly if not in at-risk population!” Ingraham wrote Friday from the aisle seat of a Chicago-bound United flight.",What Trump’s Twitter Feed Tells Him About the Coronavirus,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-twitter-feed-covid-19-129170,politico
"As Americans brace for the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the U.S., once-booming industries are already suffering from deadly symptoms of an economic downturn.  Consumers, after panic-buying, are expected to hunker down and limit their spending. Sporting events, concerts and other entertainment are now suspended. Businesses are canceling travel and conferences. Airlines and trains are slashing schedules.  The sudden and precipitous shutdowns across the economy are forcing the Trump administration and lawmakers to contemplate which industries need targeted rescues — to keep them from collapsing entirely — and which can get by with broader support for struggling workers across the nation. While lawmakers consider an immediate aid package for workers hashed out by Democratic leaders and the White House, Trump and his aides have been meeting with business leaders and industry groups to design an aid package — through tax relief and emergency loans — for the corporate sector. Core to their challenge: Everyone can’t get special help, so the government must pick winners and losers from a downturn — with a focus on industries whose collapse could ripple through the system most. It’s a debate that will accelerate in the coming days as the economic consequences of the crisis become clearer. Airlines were the first industry that came to mind for Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank.  While strong employment insurance systems and social safety net programs will take care of workers, he said it’s important to think about “what industries have a spillover value to the rest of the economy.”  “I think of transport — whether it’s trains or trucks or airplanes. You want to look at those and where there’s distress that you can help, you want to go in and do that because it spills over to every part of the economy,” said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “I don’t think the same case can be made for restaurants and hotels. I care about the workers and employees, but you know when you build restaurants and invest in hotels, you take business risk. And this will be a bad year for them.”  President Donald Trump has already vowed to help both the cruise line industry and the airline industry, and in a White House sit-down with top health insurance executives, said his administration is already “working very closely” with both.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers this week that the administration was considering loan guarantees and other measures to aid the airline industry amid the pandemic.  “I want to be clear: This is not bailouts. We are not looking for bailouts,” he said. Mnuchin added, “There may be specific industries that are highly impacted by travel that have issues with lending” — and “I would assume the airlines would be on the top of the list,” as well as hotels and cruise lines.  Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said industry-focused measures aren’t the solution, yet.  Instead, he said the administration should focus on people and workers to attack the crisis. “If we don’t do much to respond to it, I think it’s very likely to cause a recession,” Bivens said. If the administration does move to bail out industries such as airlines, Bivens said it should be done through loans — leaving direct fiscal aid for individuals.  “It’s really bad to have a recession, and so doing things that will actually be effective is attractive,” Bivens said. “And I think aid to people and individuals is just more effective, and behind closed doors, their own economic experts will tell them that. And I think in the case of direct cash payments to people and households, how can that not be good politics as well?”  Bivens continued, “I feel like there are some incentives pushing it potentially in the right direction on this stuff, but I think a lot of aid to industries is going to be attempted to be attached to this as well.”  Here’s a look at some of the key industries experiencing the most pain in the early stages of the crisis:  Airlines Flights are being canceled across the board as vacationers halt trips and businesses slash travel. As airlines brace for the downturn, some are comparing the impact to the aftermath of 9/11. The International Air Transport Association says the global industry could lose upwards of $113 billion in 2020. And with another travel ban, this time for foreign travelers coming from Europe, airline stocks plummeted and some companies announced temporary employee layoffs to protect themselves from insolvency. Cruise lines Social distancing does not work on giant cruise ships — especially after passengers were stranded on virus-ridden boats. Carnival stopped voyages on its Princess Cruise lines for two months and cruise ship operator Viking halted operations until May 1, actions that will hit employees and devastate the companies‘ bottom lines.  After the Trump administration pushed for a temporary cruise ship shutdown, the president tweeted late Friday: “At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry — it will be kept that way!” Sports and entertainment  The sports entertainment industry has shut down as lucrative tournaments and sports seasons like March Madness, NBA, MLB and others have been canceled or put on hold. Hundreds of thousands of workers, including vendors, referees and other staff members work events across the country in addition to the athletes.  Other key entertainment industries like film, music and theme parks will be slammed as America shuts down. From Disney World to music festivals, the entertainment industry and its workers will be among those taking the hardest hit as Americans hunker down in their homes.  Hotels Hotel operators have projected major losses as travel plans are canceled across the nation and around the world. With postponed or canceled events, hotels will suffer from fewer overnight visitors. And with a slower pace of bookings, workers will feel the pain as well as companies cut their payrolls.  Restaurants Restaurants across the country are struggling to respond to the fast-paced spread of coronavirus. Bars and restaurants in hot spots like New York and Washington have had to adjust to new state orders for social distancing and lower customer traffic, forcing some to close their doors entirely for the time being — leaving employees without work.  Manufacturing  Coronavirus has disrupted the supply chains for nearly three-quarters of U.S. companies, setting up many for lower annual revenue projections, according to a survey by the leading group for purchasing managers. Companies ranging from retail to technology are sure to feel the losses because of delays in key goods from China, the world’s hub for manufacturing, as the virus kept workers there at home. Energy   Oil and natural gas producers were hit by plummeting oil prices amid the outbreak. A price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia drove oil prices this week to their steepest intraday tumble in nearly 30 years, and numerous U.S. shale companie — already in deep debt — could be pushed out of business if the collapse becomes a prolonged crisis. While a bailout for the industry seems unlikely, Trump gave oil prices a small lift on Friday when he announced that the U.S. would buy additional oil for the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we're going to fill it up,” Trump said. “This is a good time to fill it up.”",Trump’s monumental challenge: Rescuing industries in free fall,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-industry-stimulus-129216,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",Two senators take extreme measures to show fealty to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"Joe Biden has long complained about the crowded debate stage and a restrictive format that doesn’t allow enough time for candidates to speak. Now, in his one-on-one debate Sunday with Bernie Sanders, he finally gets the debate terms he wanted — and an opportunity to convince Democrats the race is effectively over.  Expectations aren’t high for the former vice president after a series of mediocre debate performances during primary season. The Sanders campaign, among other Biden detractors, views the debate as a chance for him to fall flat on his face, reviving questions about the durability of his candidacy just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open with a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. But in years past, Biden has thrived in the one-on-one format during vice presidential debates. His plan Sunday is to focus on his electability and how he’s in sync with the Democratic electorate after winning 15 states, according to aides. In the face of aggressive questioning from Sanders, Biden can now point to record turnout in states like Virginia, which overwhelmingly supported him. Then there’s the fact that he won nearly all of the African American support in Mississippi. What’s more, Biden has won whites by big margins and racked up wins in the cities, suburbs and in rural areas, a fact that advisers hope will give him a sense of confidence against Sanders. “Success builds on success,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s top adviser in charge of debates. In the first debate since Feb. 25 — four days before the South Carolina primary that transformed Biden’s candidacy from hospice patient to juggernaut — Biden is expected to be careful not to come across as too arrogant. “The flip side is this thing, we’ve seen it change before, we’re taking nothing for granted,” Klain said. “I expect a lively contest on Sunday and a lively contest on Tuesday.” Biden is prepared for Sanders to question his shortcomings with reaching out to the youth vote, and to acknowledge he needs to make gains with young voters. But the former vice president’s advisers say he’ll also note that Sanders fell short of his own promise that he had the singular ability to attract new voters and build a coalition that would beat Trump. Biden is also expected to mention how most of the top former presidential candidates in the race endorsed him — and not Sanders. Sanders, meanwhile, is operating under some self-imposed constraints. The Vermont senator likes Biden and loathes Trump, and he doesn’t want to eviscerate Biden out of concern that it would only weaken him and therefore help Trump, Sanders advisers say. And they note the difficulty of being overtly political onstage at a time when coronavirus dominates the nation’s consciousness. Attacking Biden too much could be perceived as just out of step with the moment in which Democrats want unity and seriousness of purpose. “Bernie’s going to be careful about not looking too political — too electoral — and being the guy who says ‘well, I can get this many delegates and go on to the convention...’ No. That’s not where Americans’ heads are at,” an adviser said. “People are worrying about their families. They’re at the grocery store buying batteries.” Because coronavirus has made healthcare an even more important issue, Sanders is expected to press Biden on his opposition to Medicare for all. Sanders also wants Biden to explain why he advocated for cutting Social Security years ago only to inaccurately suggest he never did. “It’s not going to be an all-out assault. It’s going to be a policy debate. And it’s going to be a vigorous one,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders senior adviser. “But it’s going to be on policy.” Klain, said his candidate is ready for whatever Sanders throws at him. “They have met on the debate stage 10 times already. I’m pretty sure I know what Bernie Sanders’ position is on Medicare for All and I know what Joe Biden’s position is on Medicare for All,” Klain said. “If people are expecting some big new thing on Sunday, I don’t think they’re going to get it.”  Klain, who served as Biden’s chief of staff while vice president, earned acclaim as the Obama administration’s czar who successfully managed response to the Ebola virus. Biden has tapped that expertise for his coronavirus response plan, and aides believe the issue is a strength at a moment when President Trump’s unsteady performance has generated criticism. According to NPR, exit polls showed about half of Michigan voters said they believed Biden was best equipped to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 31 percent. In Missouri, 61 percent said they trusted Biden to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 26 percent. Advisers also say Biden would contrast his approach to Trump. Biden, of course, has a well-earned reputation of going off-script, misspeaking or meandering. His first debate performance was arguably his worst. That’s when then-2020 rival Kamala Harris called him out for highlighting his ability to work with Southern segregationists in the 1970s and challenged him on busing policies. The debate went so badly, Biden felt compelled to address his performance at a Chicago event the next day.  “We all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds in a debate can’t do justice to a lifetime commitment to civil rights,” Biden said. Biden’s performances stabilized over time — or critics just became accustomed to his style — and he was praised recently for televised town halls in Nevada and South Carolina as well as the strength of his debates in both of those states.  What also helped Biden was billionaire Mike Bloomberg, a candidate who promised to save Democrats upon Biden’s collapse but instead delivered a disastrous performance in Nevada when Elizabeth Warren shredded him on stage, taking the focus off the then-struggling Biden. Weaver said Biden has benefited from the big debate stages like that one in Las Vegas that have allowed him to avoid engaging in actual debate. “With eight to 10 people onstage,” Weaver said, “it’s very difficult to have the kind of back-and-forth debate that voters need to make a good decision about who they want to pick as their nominee. That’s the problem.” Last week, the two campaigns clashed over the debate format. Sanders campaign wanted a standing debate that was moderated by professionals. Biden’s campaign was more inclined for a seated town hall-style format where citizens could ask questions. Biden has tended to thrive when given more time to argue a point or explain policy ideas. In town halls, potential voters at times would express relief at seeing Biden in person, saying he was far more articulate and cogent than the candidate they’d seen on the debate stage.  Prior to this year’s crowded debates, Biden distinguished himself with several strong performances in vice presidential debates in 2008 and 2012. “Joe Biden is simultaneously the most-experienced presidential campaign debater in modern American life but has the lowest expectations,” said Michael Steel, an adviser to former Rep. Paul Ryan before his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Biden, whose performance was credited with helping to reverse the fortunes of the Obama-Biden ticket.“We expected him to be over the top. We expected him to be blarney-full, if that’s a word. And he just took it to 11.” The dispute with the Sanders campaign over the debate format came as Democrats sympathetic to Biden started privately raising concerns that Biden didn’t have the physical or mental stamina to face Sanders on stage. Rumors circulated that the Democratic National Committee was under pressure to cancel the debate, which both the DNC and Biden’s campaign denied. The debate ultimately wasn’t canceled, but it was moved to Washington, D.C., from Phoenix over concerns about coronavirus contagion. Mike Ceraso, a former adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign, said Biden has captured the feeling of the party better than his opponents, winning a different type of expectations game. “Expectations this time around isn’t about brains or performance. It’s about the story, man. Pete and Warren and Bernie’s stories are okay,” Ceraso said. “Biden’s story hits home. Loss and anger and sense of service and sadness are relatable qualities. They amplify with Trump in the background. Take the intellectual out of it. And focus on the heart. It’s cliche as hell. But...imagine if you’re someone who has a mom with Alzheimer’s or a depressed child or someone addicted to drugs.”",Biden readies plan to finish off Bernie,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/biden-sanders-2020-endorsements-129182,politico

"The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Fair Isaac, the financial company whose credit scores underlie nearly all U.S. consumer credit decisions, according to information obtained by POLITICO. The probe follows years of complaints from rivals about Fair Isaac's dominance, and comes amid efforts by Congress and financial regulators to inject more competition into the credit score market. Fair Isaac's FICO scores are a measure of risk that banks and credit card companies use to make lending decisions, and are used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to determine creditworthiness of mortgage applicants. The exact scope of the DOJ’s antitrust investigation isn’t yet known. The agency recently sent letters to Fair Issac and others in the consumer credit industry asking them to preserve documents, according to a person knowledgeable about the case who was not authorized to speak about it. Such hold-letters are the first step in an investigation. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment Friday night. Fair Isaac founded the FICO score in 1956 and has issued more than 100 billion scores, according to its website. The scores are based on information collected by the three largest credit reporting agencies, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. The credit reporting agencies also sell FICO scores to lenders. In 2006, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion introduced their own credit scoring model, known as VantageScore. Fair Isaac sued the three agencies for antitrust violations, but a court later dismissed those allegations. A federal jury later sided with VantageScore that it didn’t violate Fair Isaac’s trademarks or engage in unfair competition. Fair Isaac also sued TransUnion in 2017 for breach of contract, copyright infringement and other allegations. TransUnion countersued Fair Isaac for antitrust violations. A Chicago federal judge ruled last year that TransUnion can move forward with its antitrust allegations. Congress and regulators, meanwhile, have sought to lessen Fair Isaac's grip on the credit score market. In a 2018 law that sought to roll back some of the banking reforms in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Congress ordered the Federal Housing Finance Agency to establish rules and criteria for the credit scoring models used by Fannie and Freddie. A December 2018 proposed rule by FHFA would have effectively prohibited Fannie and Freddie from using VantageScore over concerns about conflicts of interest. But the final rule, issued in August, switched gears and allowed the government-sponsored entities to make use of VantageScore as an alternative to FICO scores. Fair Isaac and VantageScore didn’t immediately return calls and emails for comment sent after business hours Friday. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion also didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",DOJ opens antitrust probe into credit score giant Fair Isaac,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/justice-fair-isaac-antitrust-129204,politico
"President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency to combat the coronavirus — but he could go much further if he wanted.  Federal law gives Trump vast emergency powers in times of pandemic. He could direct the quarantine of people arriving in the United States who exhibit certain symptoms or even if they’re just suspected of having the virus. He could have the federal government detain individuals if their illness might wind up crossing state lines. And under regulations revised and reissued just before Trump entered office, the government can stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease. Some even interpret the statute as meaning a president could deploy the military to cordon off a city or state.  “The federal public health power is pretty awesome … awe-inspiring in its breadth,” said Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University. “But there’s also obviously a lot of danger.” Indeed, it’s an extraordinary palette of options for a president often mocked as enamored of dictatorial authority and who has claimed, “I have the right to do whatever I want, as president.” And many of these powers remain largely undefined, as they have rarely — if ever — been widely used. It’s a troubling concept for those who are pressing Trump to take more urgent action to combat the coronavirus as it infiltrates American cities, but are wary that he will go too far.  “We can’t divorce this from the context of a president who has shown a willingness to abuse emergency power,” said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.  The conflict was on display Friday as Trump declared a national emergency to unlock funding and bypass regulations to accelerate the lagging development of coronavirus testing options. While even some of Trump’s most ardent opponents praised the move, they were anxious about what might come next. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. Fresh discussion of Trump’s power to isolate regions of the U.S. was spurred Thursday by his comments in response to a question about whether he was considering travel restrictions to the states experiencing some of the most widespread infections, such as Washington and California. “We haven’t discussed that yet. Is it a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,” the president said during an Oval Office photo-op with the Irish prime minister. While experts say such measures would be ineffective — diverting resources better devoted to scaling up hospitals and aiding people in dire straits due to other impacts of the virus — they might be legally possible. Under the Public Health Service Act, federal authorities can quarantine individuals arriving in the U.S. by air, land or ship if they are suspected of infection with a list of diseases and syndromes set by executive order. The law also gives federal officials the power to try to check the spread of disease between states, although this authority is almost never used to fight human illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control, however, maintains that its quarantine powers go quite far. Regulations finalized by the Obama administration claim that federal officials can detain individuals if their illness could spread to other states. The rules essentially give the federal government the authority to stop and seize commuters in a bid to halt the spread of contagious disease. Whether it could allow a president to use the military to cordon off a city or a whole state is less clear, but experts say that the statutes and regulations could be read to allow for that. “The ability to restrain interstate travel is something that could be done, but the question is would it be done?” said Jennifer Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “These are the kinds of scenarios that you think would never happen but here we are.” But in this situation, Nuzzo said, it’s too late for that extreme measure. “There would be no public health benefit,” said Nuzzo, who studies government responses to health crises. “Over 40 states are reporting cases. … The horse is out of the barn. The disease is already here.” On Friday, Trump invoked his first significant emergency power since the coronavirus first appeared in January, declaring a national emergency.  In its declaration, the White House cited two laws — the 1988 Stafford Act, a disaster relief law, and the 1976 National Emergencies Act, the law Trump used to divert government funds to build a southern border wall.  For days, though, Trump had balked at exercising the power, even as he faced a chorus of calls from health groups, disaster relief specialists and Democrats to do so. According to people familiar with the situation, Trump had been reluctant to take the step because it could undermine his contention that the coronavirus outbreak is similar to seasonal flu. But he insisted on Thursday that he was more than willing to invoke any of his emergency authorities. “We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act. … And if I need to do something, I'll do it,” he said, adding cryptically, “I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.”  Trump has not previously been bashful about exercising his emergency powers. He was only seven days into his tenure when he issued the hugely controversial travel ban, sharply restricting the flow of people to the U.S. from mostly-Muslim countries. A series of court rulings blocked enforcement of the original ban, prompting the administration to redraft the order several times. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld a substantially pared-back version of the initial order. The policy — which critics called a “Muslim ban” — was based on the same legal authority Trump has since used to exclude foreign travelers from China and, now, from much of Europe, in response to the current virus. Many White House statements about the new virus-related travel restrictions go out of their way to explicitly cite the precise legal authority tapped in both instances, giving the president the power to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” The mentions seem to echo arguments the Justice Department made in the “Muslim ban” case. Lawyers repeatedly warned judges to be wary about restricting the power because it may be needed in a crisis.  Perhaps Trump’s most aggressive executive actions have involved money, namely his moves to spend billions of dollars on construction of a border wall with Mexico despite Congress’s unwillingness to fund that project — a signature of his 2016 campaign — at anywhere near the levels he has sought. Trump’s lawyers have cited powers Congress gave the president to reallocate military construction funds and to tap other funds for counter-drug activities.  Lower courts halted more than $6 billion of the funding, questioning Trump’s claims of an emergency and noting Congress’s rather explicit refusal to fund expansion of the wall. But the Supreme Court stepped in last year to allow Trump to proceed with the spending as litigation continues. Historically, officials at the state and local level have taken the most aggressive measures to address public health emergencies. In 1899 and 1900, officials in Honolulu and San Francisco cordoned off those cities’ Chinatown districts in a bid to control the bubonic plague, a move now viewed as heavily tainted by racism. Authorities in Hawaii even lit one home on fire in order to try to squelch the disease, but in the process burned down much of the neighborhood. Nothing similar has happened yet in the U.S. during the coronavirus outbreak, although governors are increasingly flexing their legal muscle.  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Thursday ordered the closure of all public schools in the state for two weeks. On the same day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued an executive order directing residents to eschew non-essential gatherings of more than 250 people. Newsom also tapped the state’s power to “commandeer” hotels, if needed, as temporary hospitals or quarantine centers.  And In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared a “containment zone” in New Rochelle, N.Y., to combat a virulent cluster of corona cases there. He even called out the national guard to assist with food distribution and other logistics in the city. Trump weighed in on the move at his photo-op Thursday, noting it isn’t a flat-out ban on movement or work. While he called the action “not very strong,” he seemed to welcome the fact that it would give locals the feeling “they’re being watched.” Some of the more severe travel limits the federal government can impose are quietly wielded in individual cases.  The CDC maintains a little publicized “do-not-board” list for domestic and international airline travel. Details on the list are thin, but it has included people with tuberculosis and measles. In 2015, CDC formally declared that individuals could be added to the list if they were suspected simply of being exposed to hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola. Back in 2007, an Atlanta lawyer drew national attention when he flew to Paris to get married and returned to the U.S. while suffering from drug-resistant tuberculosis. Doctors said they told him not to travel, but he insisted they never told him he could be contagious. He was eventually put under a federal quarantine order, but it turned out his disease was not the type most resistant to treatment. Typically, however, federal officials have relied on state and local health departments to address most disease outbreaks, even sometimes asking them to detain individuals who refuse to cooperate with doctors’ recommendations. But Trump has hostile relationships with the Democratic governors of the most affected states — Washington, California and New York. And if he wanted, he could have the CDC step in. Federal regulations give the CDC sweeping powers if a state’s measures “are insufficient” to prevent a disease from spreading into another state. The CDC chief is authorized to do what he or she “deems reasonably necessary” under those circumstances. Whether that includes widespread restrictions on movement is unclear. Parmet, the Northeastern University law professor, stresses that the Constitution still applies. Aggressive federal government action on such vague authority could face legal challenges, especially if the moves don’t have a scientific basis.  On the other hand, in a crisis judges tend to defer to executive authorities, including health officials. “The real danger is that these moves are taken just for show,” Parmet said. “At this point, where we are in the curve of this pandemic, there’s no magical legal elixir.”",What more could he do?

"The head of the U.S. Agency for International Development will leave the job at the end of this month, two people familiar with the move confirmed Friday, marking a high-level departure from one of the agencies tasked with responding to the global coronavirus outbreak.  Former GOP Rep. Mark Green is expected to submit his resignation to President Donald Trump early next week, according to a senior administration official, who said USAID Deputy Administrator Bonnie Glick, a Trump loyalist and former State Department foreign service officer, will take Green’s place as acting head.  Green already informed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, with whom he has worked closely on women’s global development programs, of his decision to step down.  “His plans have been in place for awhile, but he began telling folks last week,” said a person familiar with Green’s departure.  The outgoing USAID chief, who has been with the agency since Aug. 2017, is expected to be named president of the McCain Institute for International Leadership. Green previously served as president of the International Republican Institute, an organization once chaired by the late Arizona Sen. John McCain. The D.C.-based think tank lost its executive director Kurt Volker, who served as Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, amid the fallout from the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry last fall after he stepped down following his appearance as a witness in the probe.  “I believe the recent media focus on my work as U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations risks becoming a distraction from the accomplishments and continued growth of the Institute,” said Volker, who was involved in the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against Ukraine. The McCain Institute could not be reached for comment.  Green’s exit from the agency, which has been at the center of the Trump administration’s efforts to divert Middle East aid to religious minorities in the region, comes weeks after he announced a $37 million commitment to 25 countries that have been affected by COVID-19, which reached pandemic levels this week and has topped 1,000 confirmed cases inside the United States.  Earlier Friday, Trump declared a national emergency that could free up to $50 billion to fight the rapidly spreading virus by boosting containment efforts and the availability of test kits.

"Suspended schedules. Darkened stages. Empty arenas. As the worsening spread of the coronavirus has forced shot callers in sports, entertainment and politics to nix games, parades, conventions, campaign pit stops and gatherings of almost every sort and size, Donald Trump over these past few dizzying days essentially and begrudgingly has made the same decision—even if he hasn’t made an official announcement. After holding more than 300 rallies during the 2016 campaign and nearly 100 more since he was elected—after going last month to Iowa and New Hampshire and Nevada and South Carolina to “troll” Democrats in the runups to the primaries—the president was not in Michigan, Missouri or Mississippi this past week, and he won’t be in Ohio or Illinois or Florida or Arizona ahead of Tuesday’s votes. He has canceled events in Las Vegas, Denver and Milwaukee. And for the first time in a long, long time, Trump has on his typically merry-go-round docket of rallies … nothing. All of a sudden, we live in a world without crowds. And for Trump, it’s an existential threat—as much a threat as a sinking economy or the virus itself. Because Trump doesn’t just love crowds. He needs them. He needs crowds because of their political utility. Needs them to mine “data gold.” Needs them to be rolling, roiling, visceral focus groups—listening to the ebbs and flows of their roars, serving them what they want, scrapping what they don’t, stoking support with a skilled evangelist’s call and response. He is, after all, at his best and most effective riffing to the rank and file as opposed to monotonously reciting from a teleprompter all alone in the solemnity of the Oval Office. And he needs crowds, too, and perhaps most importantly, on account of psychological necessity. “They are his lifeline,” Bandy Lee, a Yale University psychiatrist and the editor of The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, told me this week. “He’s very good at this,” she said, referring to the catalog of his performances at his rallies, “because his life depends on it, not just the life of his presidency but the life of his psyche.” In the estimation of Lee and other experts of her ilk, as well as the many people who have known him and worked with him for years, the way Trump is ties back to the way he was raised. The “complete emptiness inside,” the “bottomless void” that “can never be filled,” the “psychological defects” and “pathologically narcissistic traits”—all of this, says Lee, is a result of the core particulars of Trump’s upbringing: his distant and demanding father, the disruptive near-death experience of his mother when he was just a toddler, his banishment to military school when he was barely a teenager. “The lack of love translates into desiring accolades,” Lee explained. “And the rallies are really the most critical crutches that he’s had. He needs his followers more than his followers need him.” Trump biographer Gwenda Blair calls “a live audience” his “oxygen machine.” “The crowds,” former Trump casino executive Jack O’Donnell told me the other day, “get him through the night.” And it’s always been like this. Starting in the 1970s and ‘80s, the foundationally lonely Trump cultivated transactional relationships with reporters and gossip columnists, in the same manner as his mentor, Roy Cohn. At times, he used a fake name to do his own PR. He decorated the walls of his office with magazine covers bearing images of his own face. In Atlantic City, at his casinos, he jaunted across gaming floors, feasting on the clamor of the throngs. “They cheered him,” recalled Alan Marcus, a former Trump publicist. “In front of a big crowd, and a big crowd could’ve been 25 people or 25,000 people, he can shine. Because he’s got that Trump persona. The Trump persona takes over the room.” By the middle of the aughts, when the success of “The Apprentice” erased the stain of his personal failures and business busts of the ’90s, he obsessed about the reality show’s ratings. “Ratings,” said Marcus, “are crowds.” And Trump’s political ascent? Implausible to the point of impossible without crowds. In the couple years before 2015, on the precampaign campaign trail, at off-year cattle calls of would-be candidates, Trump tested out talking points. “He would put forth his position or his feelings, and he would judge the level of response,” the late political strategist Pat Caddell once told me. He monitored not internal polling but Twitter mentions and tallies of retweets. He gauged what sizzled on conservative talk radio so he could channel it back. At his campaign kickoff at Trump Tower, when he glided down the escalator to say that he was running, the crowd was so important he paid some people to be there. The next month, he drew approximately 4,000 people to a rally in Phoenix. A month after that, the crowd was roughly five times that size in Mobile, Alabama, where he had his plane circle the stadium to a standing ovation and the wild-eyed appeal of his candidacy became hard to ignore. “Trump’s campaign,” Roger Stone would write, “was centered around a ‘set piece rally.’” At one of them, in New Hampshire, he told the people he had lots of friends, and rich friends, but who no longer would be his friends if and when he got elected. “You know who my friends are?” he said. “You’re my friends.” The crowd. Their cheers. And ever since, all the way up to his last rally, in Charlotte, on the second night of this month, Trump has engaged in an almost hypnotic version of the same, over and over again, using every one of his signature events to draw red-capped crowds, and to talk about the size of the crowds—whether or not, of course, the specifics are true—seldom missing a chance to employ the crowds and their counts as an ongoing contrast to cudgel his Democratic opponents. “An integral, main part of the campaign,” Trump’s campaign spokesman has said. “The driving force,” according to the campaign’s COO. But as America shuts down, as Broadway goes dark and Disney World goes dormant and March Madness goes poof, Trump at the moment has been stripped of arguably his most potent political strength. Entering a new, utterly altered reality, mere weeks after he traveled to India to revel in the adoration of a crowd of 110,000, Trump sat in the White House at a desk called Resolute and appeared out of his element and underprepared—while Joe Biden, his presumptive opponent in the general election, stood the next afternoon in front of a bank of American flags in a hotel in Delaware and spoke to mostly just clicking cameras and seemed not frail or poorly supported but serious and up to the task. Biden’s (small) crowds and Trump’s (large) crowds hardly matter because now there are no crowds at all. “Rallies are important to the Trump campaign, and I’d worry about losing them,” former Trump aide Michael Caputo said, “because it would tilt a bit to Biden’s advantage.” Another former Trump aide pushed back on the premise. “It’s very early in the presidential cycle,” Sam Nunberg told me. “He’s still going to be able to hold rallies eventually, calling the guy ‘Sleepy Joe’ and making fun of him … one way or the other.” Nunberg stressed that Trump still has television and Twitter, platforms on which he has an irrefutable record of mastery of a certain sort, and that his flush campaign is a Facebook juggernaut, too, and that he always has possessed a blithe capacity for surviving crises and skirting consequence. All valid points. He made a prediction. “Trump will end up doing rallies,” Nunberg said. “Pandemic or not, Trump will end up doing rallies.” “What are your plans, Mr. President,” a reporter asked him on Thursday, “about campaign rallies?” “I think the Democrats won’t be having rallies, but nobody shows up to their rallies, anyway,” Trump said. “So, what difference does it make?” “But what about you, sir?” “My rallies are very big,” he said. “On the rallies, we’ll make that decision,” he continued. “But at this moment, we don’t have …” He stopped himself—as if he couldn’t quite bring himself to say it out loud. “I was going to Las Vegas. … I was going to Colorado …” He fantasized about a rally in Tampa on March 25 that reportedly was being planned but had not been publicly announced. That didn’t prevent him from dropping highly dubious details. “All sold out,” Trump said. “We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think we’ll probably not do it because people would say it’s better to not do.” No more rallies. No more crowds. “It’s like, if Don Rickles performed to a room of three people, would he have been funny? You know, insult comics, they need the energy of the discomfort they create for the jokes to work, for the act to work,” Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio told me this week. “It’s very bad for Trump to not have crowds. And I think he knows it.”",What Is Trump Without His Crowds?,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-crowds-129048,politico
"OTTAWA — Over five extraordinary hours on Friday, Canada’s federal government suspended Parliament, delayed its federal budget, imposed new restrictions on international travel and promised a major fiscal stimulus package, while the Bank of Canada slashed interest rates as the country collectively braces for the impact of coronavirus. The announcements rolled out, one after another, while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remained in isolation at his home in Ottawa, dealing with the fallout of a global pandemic that has turned personal — his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Thursday, though her symptoms are mild. Trudeau has no symptoms of the virus, which has so far infected 157 people in Canada and caused one death. Speaking from outside his home at Rideau Cottage, Trudeau assured Canadians the government will take any measures necessary to slow the spread of the disease and to cushion them against its economic impacts. “We do not want any Canadians to have to worry about whether or not they’re going to be able to pay their rent,” he said. “We need to make sure that Canadians have the options and the ability to follow the best public health advice and keep themselves safe.” Friday’s announcements mark a dramatic escalation in the government’s response since the World Health Organization labeled the coronavirus a pandemic two days ago, and a stark change in tone — on Thursday evening, Finance Minister Bill Morneau was still saying the budget would be tabled on March 30, as planned. But on Friday morning at 10 a.m., all five of Canada’s major political parties agreed to a motion to adjourn the House of Commons until April 20, in response to the spread of Covid-19. The suspension could be extended if necessary. Parliament has also passed spending-related bills that will allow the government to keep cash flowing while the House of Commons and Senate aren’t sitting. “We will face this together, and we will get through this together,” Government House Leader Pablo Rodríguez told reporters. The parties have agreed to a process to allow Parliament to be recalled over the coming weeks, if needed, with a skeleton crew of members present — likely those who live within driving distance. Before Parliament shut down, MPs and senators rushed to pass the USMCA, which received royal assent on Friday afternoon, making Canada the last country to endorse the new North American free trade pact. A few procedural steps remain before Canada formally ratifies the deal, and it will be several more months before it goes into force. President Donald Trump said Friday that Trudeau told him during a phone call the day before that Canada was on the cusp of approving the trade deal. The all-party motion on Friday also delayed the federal budget, previously scheduled for March 30. Morneau did not say when the budget might now be introduced, or whether that could happen before April 20. The budget, however, has suddenly become an afterthought as Morneau turns his attention to the far more urgent task of keeping the economy afloat. In an exceptional act of coordination Friday, Morneau held a rare joint press conference with Stephen Poloz, governor of the politically independent Bank of Canada, to introduce emergency measures in an attempt to buttress the economy before it suffers significant damage. Poloz made the biggest splash by introducing an unscheduled interest rate cut of half a percentage point — his second 50-basis-point reduction in nine days — to cushion the economy from the effects of coronavirus and battered crude prices. The governor left the door open to do more, if necessary. Morneau also provided a boost of C$10 billion in available credit for businesses through two business development agencies. Jeremy Rudin, the superintendent of financial institutions, joined them to announce changes that will effectively add more than C$300 billion in lending capacity for major banks. Morneau promised that more help is on the way. Ottawa will unveil a ""significant"" fiscal stimulus package next week, he said, including direct support for individuals. The new measures will come on top of a C$1 billion support package the government unveiled on Wednesday, which included money for provincial health care systems. The finance minister said another volley of economic support could come out of a phone call scheduled for Monday between Trudeau and his fellow G-7 leaders. He added the G-7 is looking for a coordinated approach. Ottawa is also taking new steps to limit the spread of Covid-19 to Canada from beyond its borders. Transport Minister Marc Garneau said international flights arriving in Canada will be restricted to a smaller number of airports to allow for screening of all passengers. The list of airports has not yet been released. Garneau also said all cruise ships carrying more than 500 people, including crew, will not be allowed to dock in Canada before July 1. Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said Canadians should postpone or cancel international travel, and should practice social distancing, including by avoiding crowded places, waving or touching elbows instead of shaking hands and staying two meters away from other people. She warned that anyone who travels internationally will be subject to any new rules suddenly imposed in those countries. “Your one-week trip may become much longer,” she said. However, as of yet there seems to be little discussion of any possible closures along the Canada-U.S. border. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said conversations with U.S. counterparts on Thursday highlighted “how important that border is for both of our countries,” while Trump told reporters the border had not come up during his conversation with Trudeau. “I think what we have to remember is that viruses don't know borders,” Health Minister Patty Hajdu said. “A border is not going to contain the virus.” The new measures come less than 24 hours after Trudeau’s wife tested positive for Covid-19 after returning from a trip to the U.K. and exhibiting mild, flu-like symptoms. Grégoire Trudeau is currently in quarantine, and the prime minister and their three children will remain in isolation for 14 days. Trudeau has no symptoms and therefore has not been tested for the virus. Other parliamentarians, including International Trade Minister Mary Ng and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, are also in self-isolation after experiencing symptoms, though they have not been diagnosed with the virus. Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan had also shown symptoms, but tested negative for coronavirus on Friday. The federal government’s new approach to the coronavirus comes in the wake of tighter restrictions imposed by a number of provinces during the past 48 hours. All four of Canada’s largest provinces have now recommended canceling events with more than 250 people or have banned them outright, and Quebec and Ontario have both closed schools for at least two weeks. Trudeau spoke with provincial and territorial premiers on Friday afternoon, but at least one premier has already made clear he believes Ottawa isn’t doing enough. In a news conference before the call, Quebec Premier François Legault called on Trudeau to ""rapidly limit the entry of visitors to Canada."" On Parliament Hill in Ottawa, the announcements came in a rush, landing in a city that has only seen a few cases of the virus so far, and where there’s a sense that the storm must be coming but somehow isn’t quite real. Just before noon, ministers and public health officials clustered together on a stage in the National Press Theatre, telling Canadians to stand two meters apart and not to gather in large groups. A large group of journalists faced them, sitting side-by-side, passing around a couple of microphones that got a quick wipe-down between each question. And then, a few hours later, everything was quiet on the Hill, except for the strange vestiges of business-as-usual that hadn’t yet ground to a halt. At 3 p.m., two small groups of tourists were being led through the galleries overlooking the empty House of Commons, one numbering just three people. They were among the last visitors to be allowed in, before the building closes to the public. Two floors below, the House of Commons cafeteria was shutting down for the day and staff were getting ready to leave. They didn’t know when they’d be back.

"President Donald Trump on Friday deflected blame for his administration’s lagging ability to test Americans for the coronavirus outbreak, insisting instead — without offering evidence — that fault lies with his predecessor, Barack Obama. “I don't take responsibility at all,” Trump said defiantly, pointing to an unspecified “set of circumstances” and “rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.”  The remarks from the president came in response to questions at a Friday press conference about the lack of widespread access to testing, an aspect of his administration's coronavirus response that has been the subject of widespread, steady criticism. Administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the U.S. tested about 11,000 people during the first seven weeks of the outbreak — roughly as many as South Korea is testing each day.  And Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee on Thursday that “the system is not really geared to what we need right now” in and called the testing system “a failing.”  But Trump, who spent weeks downplaying coronavirus before declaring it a national emergency on Friday, argued that the health care system was not designed for an outbreak on the scale of coronavirus, “with the kind of numbers that we are talking about.”  The president kept his criticism lighter and more forward-looking at first, declaring that his administration is “leaving a very indelible print in the future in case something like this happens again.”  “That's not the fault of anybody — and frankly the old system worked very well for smaller numbers, much smaller numbers but not for these kind of numbers,” he added. But then Fauci stepped up to the mic to clarify his position, arguing that the CDC’s testing system, “for what it was designed for, it worked very well,” and maintaining that an “embrace” of the private sector was necessary for testing at the kind of scale needed for the fast-spreading coronavirus.  Then, Trump began pointing fingers.  “If you go back — please, if you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. they didn't do testing like this,” he interjected, referencing the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that sickened more than 60 million people between April 2009 and 2010. Trump asserted that the Obama administration “didn’t do testing” and that when “they started thinking about testing,” it was “far too late.” He reiterated a claim made on Twitter earlier in the day, calling the Obama administration’s response to the swine flu outbreak “a very big failure,” though the H1N1's fatality rate of .02 percent is much lower than the lowest fatality estimates for the coronavirus thus far.  Trump later got testy with another reporter who pressed him on whether he bore any responsibility for the surge in cases, noting that he’d disbanded the White House’s pandemic office. Trump told the reporter, PBS NewsHour's Yamiche Alcindor — with whom he's butted heads with in the past — that her inquiry was a “nasty question.”  After noting that his administration had quickly acted to restrict travel from China, where the coronavirus outbreak originated, the president said he personally was not responsible for dissolving the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which had been part of the National Security Council until his administration disbanded it and rolled its officials into another office. “And when you say me, I didn't do it. We have a group of people. I could ask — perhaps in my administration — but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don't know anything about it.” Trump said. “You say we did that. I don't know anything about it.” He continued: “I don't know, CDC, perhaps they do that — let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. You know, things like that happen.” Trump then began to move on, before returning to defend his administration’s response.  “We are doing a great job,” he insisted, referencing the health officials and business executives gathered behind him. “Let me tell you, these professionals behind me and these great incredible doctors and business people — the best in the world — and I can say that whether it's retailers or labs or anything you want to say. These are the best in the world.”  He also pointed to the number of fatalities in the U.S. attributed to the virus, which has hit 40 in the several weeks since the first reported case in the U.S., and is significantly lower than other countries hit hardest by the disease.  “Compare that with other countries that are many, many times that amount,” Trump said. “One of the reasons we have 40 and others have and, again, that number is going up just so you understand.” Trump’s criticism of the Obama administration on Friday wasn’t limited to its response to its own pandemic. At another point in the press conference, Trump appeared to work in a shot at healthcare.gov, the website created by the Obama administration for the rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges that was infamously marred by connectivity issues almost instantly when it debuted. Announcing that Google had offered to assist the White House in the creation of a website to better help Americans determine whether they needed to be tested for coronavirus and where to get tested if so, Trump quipped that the tech “is helping to develop a website that will be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past.”",'I don't take responsibility at all': Trump deflects blame for coronavirus testing fumble ,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-coronavirus-testing-128971,politico

"President Donald Trump's emergency declaration on the coronavirus aims to jump-start a lagging federal response by expanding testing, giving hospitals more capacity to deal with a potential flood of new patients and expanding telehealth, so patients in hot spots can be treated virtually. It reflected a growing acknowledgment of the scope of the public health crisis, with Trump himself saying at a Rose Garden rollout of the plan that he will ""most likely"" get tested, without committing to share the results. At the same time, Trump rejected blame for any shortcomings in a testing system that critics say has contributed to community spread of the respiratory disease, saying “I don’t take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.” The various policy moves left many questions unanswered, among them whether a website Trump said Google is developing to screen and test patients could compromise their privacy. Here are some key features: The president said the administration is working with pharmacies and other retailers to make drive-thru testing available ""at critical locations."" And he announced a series of partnerships with private labs to boost testing capacity just one day after top federal infectious disease official Anthony Fauci told House lawmakers that the federal government’s current testing system had been a “failing.” The president said there would be another 1.4 million tests available by next week and 5 million within the months, adding, “I doubt we’ll need anywhere near that.” Public health experts would disagree: Multiple tests are often used on one person, and while federal officials have been hesitant to project case numbers, Fauci himself warned lawmakers that a complacent mitigation response could boost case numbers to the “many, many millions.” Administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that 11,000 Americans had been tested. The FDA approved the first high-volume coronavirus test today. The president also appeared to oversell an effort by an affiliate of Google to help develop a website that will aid the administration’s efforts to screen and test for people with the virus. Trump suggested a sweeping effort, saying Google had 1,700 engineers working on the project and had made ""tremendous progress"" — and that the site will be able ""to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. ... We have many, many locations.""  But Verily, the life-sciences arm of Google's parent company Alphabet, later said in a statement that the website is in ""the early stages of development"" and would be initially tested in the Bay Area, ""with the hope of expanding more broadly over time."" Vice President Mike Pence said the administration by Sunday evening will ""be able to give specific guidance"" on when the website will be available.  The announcement instantly raised red flags for patient privacy groups, which have pushed for greater scrutiny of Google’s use of health data. “It sounds like @Google just figured out how to get the personal health data of every single American,” tweeted Kyle Plotkin, chief of staff for Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), after Trump made the announcement. Trump outlined emergency measures hospitals can take under the declaration, most of which would free up beds for a potential surge in coronavirus patients. “Critical access” hospitals that are limited to 25 beds and get higher Medicare rates can boost their capacity and extend patient stays now limited to 96 hours. The order lifts rules for where hospitals can treat patients within their facilities and lets them add doctors as needed. The hospital industry supports these steps and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to release more detailed guidance later Friday that could expand on Trump’s list. The declaration lets HHS Secretary Alex Azar waive certain laws to expand the use of telehealth, which public health experts say can help reduce risk of transmission. The new order appears to let Azar waive federal licensing requirements so out-of-state doctors can treat patients virtually in states with the greatest need. The $8.3 billion coronavirus emergency funding package Trump signed last week also allows Azar to waive restrictions on Medicare payment for telehealth, as Congress has typically done for past emergencies. Telehealth groups and lawmakers, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the committee overseeing Medicare, have encouraged Azar to activate that authority. Trump in his Rose Garden remarks called telehealth a “fairly new and incredible thing,"" though health care providers have used the technology for over a decade.

"Even as he declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, President Donald Trump couldn't help but shake hands. “I want to encourage everyone to follow the guidelines we have issued by CDC and these common sense measures,” Trump told reporters at a Rose Garden press conference with top health officials and healthcare, retail and pharmacy CEOs. “A lot of it is common sense.”  The CDC’s website says to “avoid touching high-touch surfaces in public places — elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, handshaking with people.” But as Trump introduced CEOs and members of his coronavirus taskforce, he couldn’t resist extending his hand.  First, he grabbed the mic and adjusted it for Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.  He later reached out to Walmart CEO Doug McMillion, who looked down at the president’s hand before grabbing it to shake.  Trump shook hands with three others before Bruce Greenstein, executive vice president of the LHC Group, put a stop to the hand shaking. Greenstein instead offered an elbow bump to the president.  “I like that,” Trump said, after elbow-bumping. “That’s good.”  Trump, who indicated Friday that he had not been tested but ""most likely"" would be, has been exposed to people with the illness. While Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro has disputed a media report that he initially tested positive for the virus less than a week after meeting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, his press secretary, who took photos with Trump, tested positive for coronavirus this week.  Aside from his meeting with Bolsonaro in Florida, Trump has also been exposed to multiple Republican lawmakers who have self-quarantined after their own exposure to someone who tested positive for coronavirus at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump said he had not experienced any symptoms of the disease, but was consulting with his doctors on whether, and when, to get tested.  ""I think I will do it anyway,"" the president said, though he did not commit to sharing the results of a possible test. ""We are working out a schedule.""",Trump can't resist handshakes as he declares a coronavirus national emergency,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-cant-resist-handshakes-as-he-declares-a-coronavirus-national-emergency-128950,politico
"The full bench of the powerful D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to weigh in on two legal fights critical to President Donald Trump: whether the House can use the courts to enforce a subpoena for testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn, and whether the House can sue to block Trump's effort to fund border wall construction over Congressional objections. The Friday afternoon announcement wiped out a major victory Trump scored last month when a smaller panel of the same court ruled, 2-1, that the courts should not wade into subpoena fights between Congress and the White House. The appeals court said it will hear arguments, en banc, April 28 in both the McGahn and border wall disputes. There seems to be little chance that the Supreme Court will resolve the issues definitively before the November election, but rulings in the House's favor could lead the justices to intervene with a stay in the coming months. Prospects for Trump prevailing in the cases at the D.C. Circuit look grim. While the active bench of that court leans toward Democratic appointees by a 7-4 margin, the order Friday indicated that both of Trump's nominees--Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao--have recused themselves from both cases.  As a result, the en banc court for McGahn will have only two Republican appointees. One additional GOP appointee, Judge David Sentelle, will join the en banc court considering the border wall funding dispute, the order said. The renewed debate at the D.C. Circuit over critical separation-of-powers issues is set to play out about a month after the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on a trio of cases involving demands for access to Trump's personal financial records.  Two of those cases involve subpoenas from House committees. The third was triggered by a subpoena that a local grand jury in New York City issued for Trump's tax and business records. A decision from the Supreme Court in those cases is expected by the end of June. The majority opinion the D.C. Circuit issued last month in the McGahn case said the courts should butt out of subpoena fights between Congress and the executive branch because intervening would effectively shut down the usual process of negotiation between the branches and instead send both sides running to court.  Judge Thomas Griffith, an appointee of President George W. Bush, also said blessing the subpoena was likely to trigger endless eddies of litigation over individual questions lawmakers wanted to ask McGahn in connection with their investigation into alleged efforts by Trump to obstruct Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. However, House lawyers pleaded with the full D.C. Circuit to rehear the case, arguing that bowing out of such fights actually amounts to siding with the White House, since it typically has considerable leverage over testimony and records lawmakers want. House Counsel Douglas Letter also warned that trying to foreclose subpoena litigation could lead to more unpleasant conflicts, like efforts by the House to arrest uncooperative witnesses. The Justice Department contended that McGahn, as a close presidential adviser, was absolutely immune from subpoena. Griffith didn't endorse that position. Judge Karen Henderson, who was on the panel and will be the only other GOP appointee on the en banc court, rejected the absolute immunity argument, but concurred with Griffith that courts shouldn't referee such fights. The only dissenter last month was Judge Judith Rogers, an appointee of President Bill Clinton. She said the court was gutting the House's impeachment powers by refusing to enforce the subpoena. The other appeal stems from the House's unsuccessful effort to challenge the plan Trump' announced in 2019 to use over $6 billion from military construction and counterdrug budgets to fund border wall construction even though Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for barrier projects and put strict limits on that money. The move, backed in part by a presidential emergency declaration, spurred a flurry of lawsuits from environmental and human rights groups, states, border residents, and the House itself. All said Trump's actions violated the power of the purse granted to Congress by the Constitution. The House's lawsuit, filed in Washington, found no traction. Last June, U.S. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden tossed it out, finding that Congress had no standing to sue Trump administration officials over allegedly unauthorized spending.  The House appealed that ruling, setting in motion arguments that took place before a three-judge D.C. Circuit panel last month and now scheduled to be reprised before the larger, 10-judge court in April.  No decision was rendered by the three-judge panel before Friday's order taking the border wall case en banc. The order said the issue of the House's standing is ""common"" to that case and the dispute over McGahn's testimony. Other suits aimed at blocking Trump's unusual border wall funding plan found greater purchase in the federal courts. Groups suing in California managed to get an injunction against construction, as did by El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights in a suit brought in Texas. However, those victories proved to be short lived, as the Supreme Court blocked the injunction out of California and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the one in Texas. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.","Full appeals court to hear McGahn, border wall cases",2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/appeals-court-don-mcgahn-border-wall-cases-128914,politico
"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders acknowledged Friday that the novel coronavirus public health crisis had ""radically"" altered the nature of his White House bid ahead a slate of crucial primaries. The remarks from the Vermont senator came after a roughly 15-minute speech he delivered from his hometown of Burlington, where he discussed the “lessons” Americans could learn from the coronavirus and argued that its rapid spread demonstrated the need for his “Medicare for All” policy proposal. But following his brief address, Sanders was pressed by reporters on what the brutal political realities of the pandemic meant for his campaign. “That’s why I’m here today,” he said with a wink and a smile, before turning somber. “You’re right, it has significantly impacted our campaign, as all of you know,” Sanders said, describing his “love” for the massive rallies and more intimate town hall meetings his campaign has begun canceling in the wake of the burgeoning outbreak.  “That is changing, as you’ve indicated correctly,” he said. “Our staff is now, by and large, working at home. So it has radically changed our campaign.”  Leading up to the next four nominating contests Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, Sanders indicated that he would be relying increasingly on the various digital resources of his campaign apparatus in his primary battle against former Vice President Joe Biden.  “What I think we have going for us — which we have always had going for us, but we’re going to have to utilize even more — is our internet capabilities,” Sanders said. He cited his “many, many, many millions” of followers on Twitter and other online platforms, as well as his campaign’s ability to livestream events like his speech Thursday.  “We are in the process of thinking this through,” he added. “But this coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way that we do. And that’s hurting.” Sanders was also asked about his goals moving forward in the primary campaign, and whether the worsening coronavirus threat had forced him to rethink his role in the race given the calls he has already faced from some senior Democrats to concede the nomination to Biden. “Well my long-term goal is to win. The short-term goal is to figure out how we deal with the issues that you guys are appropriately raising,” Sanders replied, conceding that “under normal circumstances, I would not be in Burlington today.”  “I would be probably in Ohio, Florida or another state where a primary is coming up. But we can’t do — we’ve decided not to do under the advice of public health officials, not to do rallies, and that’s the right decision,” he continued. “So we are figuring out a way as to how we can best communicate with people, which will certainly be in a very strong way utilizing our social media capabilities.”",Sanders: Coronavirus has 'radically changed our campaign',2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/bernie-sanders-campaign-coronavirus-128767,politico
"Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both acknowledged discussing potential aid from Washington to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, amid a crisis in air travel unlike anything the industry has seen since Sept. 11, 2001. Delta also announced it is cutting 40 percent of its flight capacity, the steepest in its history. The news comes two days after President Donald Trump announced a monthlong halt to U.S.-bound passengers from most of Europe, a stoppage that in one blow decimated many of the industry’s most lucrative international routes. “We are in discussions with the White House and Congress regarding the support they can provide to help us through this period,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees obtained by POLITICO. ""I’m optimistic we will receive their support."" A spokesperson for American Airlines also said Friday that the carrier was involved in early discussions with the government. Airlines have been struggling financially for weeks because of a steep slump in passenger demand as the global pandemic has spread. But Trump’s European travel restrictions pushed them even further into crisis. (Trump said Friday that he may expand the restrictions to include people coming from the United Kingdom.) ""The speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we’ve seen,"" Bastian wrote, noting that bookings are net negative— meaning canceled bookings are more than new bookings — at Delta. ""We’re currently seeing more cancellations than new bookings over the next month,"" added. On Thursday, an administration official told POLITICO that ""Congress really will have little choice to act or face a significant extinction moment for the airline industry."" Trump's economic aides have been studying how the President George W. Bush administration propped up the airline industry after 9/11. Bastian warned in his memo, though, that the ""form and value"" of help from the government is unpredictable. ""We can’t put our company’s future at risk waiting on aid from our government.""

"President Donald Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump stayed home from work at the White House on Friday as a precaution after meeting with an Australian official who has coronavirus.  “The White House is aware that [Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton] tested positive for COVID-19. He was asymptomatic during the interaction,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. ""Exposures from the case were assessed and the White House Medical Unit confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that Ivanka is exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine. She worked from home today out of an abundance of caution until guidance was given.” Last week Ivanka, Attorney General William Barr and Trump aides including Kellyanne Conway met with Dutton in Washington for a meeting about online child exploitation. In a statement released on Friday on Twitter, Dutton said he “woke up with a temperature and sore throat” and confirmed he has the coronavirus.  “I immediately contacted the Queensland Department of Health and was subsequently tested for COVID-19. I was advised by Queensland Health this afternoon that the test had returned positive,” Dutton said in a statement.  In a photo posted on Twitter by the Australian Embassy in the U.S., Dutton is seen standing next to Ivanka and the other officials. Barr also stayed at home on Friday, according to Department of Justice spokesperson Kerri Kupec, who said he is “feeling great and not showing any symptoms” and has consulted with the CDC. “CDC is not recommending he be tested at this point,” Kupec said.  Ivanka and Barr are the latest people close to the president who have potentially been exposed to the virus and have stayed home as a precaution. Republicans close to the president -- Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rep. Matt Getz of Florida, Rep. Doug Collins of Florida, and incoming Chief of Staff Mark Meadows – all self-quarantined after being exposed to a person with the virus at CPAC.   Trump was in contact last weekend with at least two people who have now tested positive for COVID-19 after a meeting with Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro at his home and sanctuary in Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago. One of Bolsonaro’s aides, communications secretary Fabio Wajngarten, and the Mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, were both at Mar-a-Lago and said they have the virus, although they are reportedly doing well.   Despite the close encounters, the White House has not signaled that the president has been tested for the virus, which has now infected over 1,000 people in the United States and has spread to almost every corner of the world.   Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the lead experts on Trump’s coronavirus task force, said on MSNBC Friday that “yes,” someone who has been exposed to a person with the virus should isolate themselves and find a test, but would not speak directly about the president’s situation.  “You know, I leave that to the president’s physician,” Fauci said. “They have very good White House physician and physician staff there, so when you have a situation of a patient doctor relationship, the advice for that should come from the White House physician.”",Ivanka Trump stayed home from White House after exposure to person with coronavirus ,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/ivanka-trump-coronavirus-exposure-128721,politico
"At 73 years old, President Donald Trump is a prime target for a contagious disease that falls hard on the elderly. Multiple people in the Trump orbit are infected. Trump posed for a picture alongside an aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro who has tested positive. (Bolsonaro, who is in the same picture, denies reports that he’s positive.) The president spoke at the CPAC conference earlier this month where, as was later reported, an attendee carrying a gold-plated VIP ticket was later diagnosed as virus-positive. Other attendees of the conference, including incoming chief of staff Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), and Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) exercised medical caution with self-quarantine. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.),who was at Mar-a-Lago at the same time as the Brazilian visitors, is also self-quarantining. And both Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump recently spent time with an Australian minister who subsequently tested positive. It’s almost as if the virus has circled Trump. At this point, it’s not morbid, just good planning, to say the administration has no excuse not to start making plans for the chance that the virus might incapacitate Trump. The White House has not exactly been transparent about whether Trump has been tested. But his age and his clinical obesity mean that his system would be fighting an infection from a trench: It can put older patients on ventilators, sometimes for four weeks, even if they do recover. The Constitution has a provision for this, of course: The 25th Amendment allows an orderly transfer of power if the president can’t execute his duties. The obstacle to such a smooth transition isn’t the system: It’s Trump. Trump himself never admits weakness. As a businessman and a leader, he resists looking too far ahead, and is known for simply dodging and weaving to keep bad news at bay—a quality that has already served him badly in handling the biggest crisis of his presidency. As for the people around him: He hand-picks his staff for personal loyalty over any particular principles, and replaces them when they fail to exhibit the blind allegiance he desires. The 25th Amendment has been invoked only a few times, always voluntarily by presidents themselves when they’ve undergone surgery. If it’s hard to imagine Trump himself ceding power for any reason, it’s even harder to imagine the amendment’s powerful Section 4 being invoked, transferring power from the president without his consent. It requires consensus of the people close to him—specifically, “the vice president and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide.” The idea that Pence and the Trump Cabinet would automatically step in and unseat their boss should Trump contract the virus—and, say, be hospitalized without handing over the reins—cannot be assumed. Even if they did get together and agree to hand Pence control, it is Trump, and no one else, who has groomed and cultivated the political base that would likely flip out and scream “coup” the moment it happened. The 25th Amendment has already come up in Trump’s presidency. It received heavy review and inspection in the early semesters of Donald Trump’s term when top White House aides fretted that the chief executive might have only one oar in the water. Trump’s erratic, impulsive, unstable ways—his firing of FBI Director James B. Comey; his divulging of classified information to Russian diplomats in the Oval Office; his request for “loyalty” from Comey, in particular—reportedly prompted discussions about using the 1967 amendment to replace him with Vice President Mike Pence. But just because Trump, Pence and the Cabinet might not do the right thing doesn’t mean we shouldn’t secure a promise from them that an orderly transition of power is being sketched out should serious illness strike the president. To prevent a destabilizing vacancy in the most powerful office in the world, Trump must volunteer that he will use the 25th Amendment to turn over the powers of the presidency to Pence if he becomes seriously ill. Under the amendment, he can retrieve these powers by simply writing a letter expressing that he has regained sufficient health to serve as president. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush used the amendment to temporarily delegate presidential powers during medical incidents during their terms. Trump must also encourage Pence to exercise a transition of power should he become gravely ill.  Invoking the 25th Amendment is nowhere near staging a coup, as Trump ultraloyalists might holler.

"President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday to offset lagging coronavirus testing and unlock billions of dollars — accelerating a response plan that has faced weeks of criticism. Trump touted partnerships with private companies that he claimed would allow patients to learn if they need to be tested and locate a testing site, some of which will be drive-thru facilities at big box retailers across the country. “To unleash the full power of the federal government under this effort today, I'm officially declaring a national emergency,” he said at an announcement in the Rose Garden. “Two very big words.” Trump insisted the move would eradicate the testing shortcomings that health experts say hindered the country’s ability to contain the virus when it first appeared on American shores. In recent days, Trump’s health officials have warned Americans to expect the situation to worsen, spurring much of the country’s public spaces to shutter — professional sports have been suspended, concert halls are closed until further notice and many Americans have been asked to self-isolate. Yet even as Trump unleashed $50 billion in government funding, the announcement had a distinct market-first flavor. Trump outlined a series of agreements with private companies, including Google, Target and Walmart, to facilitate swifter coronavirus testing for Americans. Target and Walmart said they will set aside parking lot space for testing sites, while Google pledged to set up a website to determine whether a person needs a test, and where one is available. “Very soon, Americans will be able to go to these drive-in sites,” said Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump put in charge of the administration’s coronavirus task force. Trump said he expected 1.4 million additional tests to be available next week and 5 million within a month — even as he cautioned against everyone rushing to get tested. “We don’t want everybody taking this test,” he said. “It’s totally unnecessary.” Trump has faced condemnation over the administration's failure to provide adequate testing and resources for the coronavirus, which has killed more than 5,000 people worldwide and infected tens of thousands. Health specialists have also reprimanded Trump for repeatedly downplaying what has now been deemed a global pandemic. “I don’t take responsibility at all,” Trump said of the government’s struggles to produce enough tests, blaming existing rules set by prior administration for limiting his options. “We were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.” And he claimed to not know that a pandemic preparedness team within the National Security Council was scrapped in 2018. Trump called a question about it “nasty” at a news conference.  “I didn’t do it,” he said. Still, Trump's executive actions on Friday received a positive response on Wall Street and even among Democrats. A faltering stock market swiftly rebounded as Trump was speaking, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring nearly 2,000 points, or more than 9 percent, the largest percentage gain since the 2008 crisis. The comeback reversed nearly all of Thursday’s tumble, which was the worst since the 1987 market crash. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y,), who had urged Trump to act more forcefully, offered rare praise for the president but warned him not to go too far. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” he said in a statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) offered no comment. In addition to his executive actions, Trump has pressed Congress for an economic stimulus package that could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars. Late Friday, Pelosi announced that she had clinched a deal with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a package meant to provide paid leave for workers, expand food aid and support widespread testing for the illness at no cost to patients. Only hours earlier, Trump had said during his press conference that he did not yet support the latest version of the bill.  “We just don't think they're giving enough,” he said. “We don't think the Democrats are giving enough.” Friday's national emergency declaration was considerably different than one the White House earlier this week had signaled was being prepared. A White House aide involved in the coronavirus response told POLITICO on Wednesday that Trump would sign a limited emergency declaration that only addressed the faltering economy by unleashing billions of dollars for loans to small businesses and to cover missed paychecks for hourly workers. But Democrats and many health care industry leaders were pressuring Trump to declare a more expansive emergency to help hard-hit states build mobile hospitals and shelters, while assisting with public safety and other issues.  White House documents referenced both the Stafford Act, which is designed to activate the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Emergencies Act, the same law he invoked last year to repurpose government funds for construction of a southern border. But the president only said his order would increase the powers of the Department of Health and Human Services, the lead agency thus far in the administration's coronavirus response. Under Friday's order, HHS will be able to waive certain Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program requirements in an effort to bypass time-consuming regulations. Separately, Trump said the federal government will waive interest on federal student loans and would purchase additional crude oil for the nation’s reserves. “This will pass,” he said. “This will pass through. We're going to be even stronger for it. We learned a lot, a tremendous amount has been learned.” Previously, Trump had been reluctant to declare a more sweeping national emergency, fearful of stoking panic with such a dramatic step. But his thinking evolved as the American coronavirus caseload soared past 1,600 this week, with public health officials warning the country to expect a spike in the coming days. For weeks, Trump has tried to reassure Americans that the widening outbreak is under control. But the situation has escalated in recent days. The stock market has dropped in record numbers not seen since the 2008 recession, and much of the country — from Disney World to professional sports leagues, museums and concert halls — has shut down. Across the U.S., the coronavirus has now killed more than 40 people and health officials have warned that the situation will worsen. Trump made another attempt to calm Wall Street during a brief prime-time Oval Office address on Wednesday. But he instead caused more confusion when he misrepresented the contours of a 30-day ban on foreign visitors from Europe and misstated that insurance companies had promised to fully pay for people’s coronavirus treatment. Friday's declaration builds on a previous, agency-specific ""public health emergency"" declaration HHS made in January. The move unlocked some initial federal money and resources. But Friday’s two designations are much broader. Still, some disaster management experts were disappointed that Trump on Friday did not appear to task FEMA — the agency that oversees hurricane, tornado and flood response — with leading the government’s coronavirus response plan. “FEMA has an important role in coordinating the larger response to the crisis,” said Tim Manning, a former FEMA deputy administrator. “If there's an emergency, FEMA needs to be involved. I’m not sure how it could be done mechanically or legally without FEMA.” FEMA has previously helped with government responses to other insidious dangerous outbreaks, including SARS, MERS and Ebola. While previous presidents have made emergency declarations “virus threat” disasters — Bill Clinton did it for West Nile virus under the Stafford Act — it is rare, former FEMA officials say.",Trump declares national emergency in latest bid to combat coronavirus,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/coronavirus-emergency-declaration-trump-128530,politico
"Asia’s richest man announced his intention on Friday to ship 500,000 testing kits and 1 million masks to the U.S. in an effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic.  Jack Ma’s charitable foundation and his China-based company's foundation, the Alibaba Foundation, have also sourced and donated supplies to other countries being hit by the virus, including Japan, Korea, Italy, Iran and Spain.  The donation comes amid testing delays across the U.S. as state officials scramble amid a shortage of lab materials — sparking concerns that health officials are undercounting the number of Americans with the virus.  “Drawing from my own country’s experience, speedy and accurate testing and adequate personal protective equipment for medical professionals are most effective in preventing the spread of the virus,” the statement said. “We hope that our donation can help Americans fight against the pandemic!” Ma’s announcement also comes as Trump aides and allies cast blame on China, with some officials calling it “the Wuhan virus” — a reference to the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the disease. National security adviser Robert O’Brien has accused China of covering up a health crisis, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has labeled the outbreak the “Wuhan coronavirus.”  “The crisis presents a huge challenge to all humankind in a globalized world. The pandemic we face today can no longer be resolved by any individual country,” Ma said in the statement. “Rather, we need to combat the virus by working hand-in-hand. At this moment, we can’t beat this virus unless we eliminate boundaries to resources and share our know-how and hard-earned lessons.”","Chinese businessman to donate 500,000 test kits and 1 million masks to the U.S. ",2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/jack-ma-coronavirus-test-kits-128522,politico
"Louisiana will postpone its presidential primary, which was originally scheduled for April 4, as part of the state government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. The state is the first in the nation to postpone a primary since the outbreak of the virus. Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced the contest will be delayed until June 20.  “Safe and secure elections also mean safety to the people of Louisiana,” Ardoin said at a press conference. Several states are voting before Louisiana, including four holding primaries on Tuesday: Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. But officials in those states indicated that Election Day will go on as planned. “Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,” a joint statement from Arizona Secretary of State Kathy Hobbs, Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee, Illinois Elections Board Chairman Charles Scholz and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose read. The Wyoming Democratic Party, which is holding its caucuses on April 4, also canceled the in-person portion of their upcoming vote. “Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe. Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy, so this is the responsible course of action,"" the state party wrote in a statement. “Voters are highly encouraged to vote by mail; as of now, voters may still vote via ballot pickup and drop off on March 28 and April 4. We will continue to work with public health officials, and assess local conditions, to ensure voters’ health and safety.” Louisiana moving its primary could cause a major headache for the state for the Democratic National Convention. As written, the national party’s delegate selection rules mandate that states hold their nominating contests by June or face delegate penalties. ""We will continue to work with every state party as they adjust their delegate selection plans around coronavirus,” a Democratic National Committee spokesperson said in a statement. “This change would violate our rule on timing which provides that all states hold their contests by June 9th. Any violation of our rules could result in a penalty that would include a state losing at least half of its delegates. This change will be reviewed by the Rules and Bylaws Committee."" State election officials around the country have been scrambling to make adjustments ahead of their primaries, including moving polling places away from locations concentrated with high-risk individuals, like nursing homes. The top election official in Arizona's Maricopa County, where just under 60 percent of the state's registered Democrats live, announced that his office would mail ballots to ""traditional Election Day voters"" eligible to vote in Tuesday's Democratic primary but who do not normally get absentee ballots mailed to them. Voters are encouraged to not mail the ballots back. Instead, officials say mailing out ballots before Election Day will allow voters to drop off already filled-out ballots in an effort to limit interactions and promote social distancing. Ohio, which is holding its primary on Tuesday, is moving nearly 150 polling places. Similar measures have been taken by some municipalities in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, which will also vote that day. “We’re seeing that this public health moment presents challenges for elections officials,” Kristen Clarke, the president & executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said. “And its having a cascading effect … By next week, on Tuesday, we’ll see coronavirus having an even broader impact on how elections are playing out.” Aaron M. Sellers, a spokesperson for the Franklin County Board of Elections in Ohio, said he started receiving panicked calls over the weekend from directors of elder care facilities.  “They want to limit residents’ exposure to visitors because that’s such a vulnerable population,” he said in an interview with POLITICO.  The Centers for Disease Control recently issued guidance targeted to election officials that urges states and counties to encourage mail-in voting and early voting as much as possible, in an effort to “minimize direct contact with other people and reduce crowd size at polling stations.” The CDC also urged poll workers to routinely clean and disinfect polling stations, “limit nonessential visitors” and encourage as much social distancing as possible. Election administrators and party officials in most states have also been pushing voters to take advantage of early and mail voting, when possible. However, laws regulating voting in any other way other than in person, on Election Day, vary wildly by state. “Staffing [flexibility], more utilization of mail ballots, being concerned about infection, providing disinfectant, all of these things are ideas that supervisors of elections are trying to implement,” Ion Sancho, a former longtime supervisor of elections in Leon County, Fla., said. “And at the last second, this is not going to be simple. This is not going to be easy. But we're going to get through it.” But the last-minute changes present significant challenges as well. In Ohio, Sellers said his county was not able to find replacement polling sites on such short notice, and will instead consolidate with neighboring precincts.  “It’s incredibly difficult to find good locations that are ADA-compliant and have ample parking on such short notice, plus they have to want us to be there,” he said.  Election administrators are also grappling with another coronavirus-related challenge: a dependence on elderly poll workers. “We’re getting people calling us who are apprehensive, saying, ‘Hey I just don’t feel comfortable working the polls,’” Sellers said. “So we’re finding additional people to chip in.”",Louisiana postpones primary as states scramble to adjust to coronavirus,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/louisiana-postpones-presidential-primary-due-to-coronavirus-128514,politico
"The leader of a libertarian-leaning tech group is stepping down as its president after tweeting that it would be “poetic justice” if President Donald Trump died from the coronavirus, the group confirmed Friday. Berin Szóka, president of Washington-based think tank TechFreedom, will be taking an indefinite sabbatical to write a book on tech policy, as first reported by POLITICO earlier Friday. Shane Tews, a longtime member of the group's board, will lead the organization in his stead.  The move deals a blow to one of the tech industry’s staunchest defenders in Washington, where Szóka has served as its combative and outspoken leader for nearly a decade. Szóka and TechFreedom, which receives funding from at least one tech giant, Google, have been relentless allies of Silicon Valley, particularly as it has faced calls for increased regulation in Washington in recent years. The group has opposed efforts to create more stringent rules for privacy and online speech, among other issues. But Szóka has also been a frequent critic of the president, delivering at times scathing rebukes of his actions on social media. The planned shake-up comes just four days after Szóka prompted a firestorm of criticism online by suggesting that the president succumbing to the virus would be fitting. “Serious question: could there possibly [sic] any greater poetic justice in the universe than for Trump to die of the #CPACvirus?” Szóka tweeted late Monday. Recent reports that an attendee at the Conservative Political Action Conference was later diagnosed with Covid-19 sparked fears that the president may have been exposed to the virus. Reps. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had contact with the president as well before entering self-quarantine due to possible exposure. The Szóka tweet immediately drew condemnations online, racking up hundreds of negative replies within minutes and some calls for his resignation. Szóka later deleted the tweet, and has since issued an apology. “Earlier this week, I sent a thoughtless tweet making an inappropriate comment about the President that I deeply regret,” he tweeted Thursday. “I was wrong to tweet it and deleted it. Again, I apologize.”",Tech think tank chief to step down after Trump death tweet,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/think-tank-chief-to-step-down-after-trump-death-tweet-128397,politico
"In the early hours of Friday, U.S. and British aircraft conducted multiple airstrikes on the missile storage sites of the Iraqi militia group Kataib Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian group that was also hit by unclaimed airstrikes in Syria the day before. Until Wednesday, when a rocket attack killed two Americans and one British service member on a sprawling base north of Baghdad, there hadn’t been much noise from Tehran since its reprisal in early January after the U.S. killed Qassem Soleimani. This week’s attack, which was meticulously planned and clearly not the work of the ramshackle remnants of the Islamic State, changed that. A truck with two rows of rocket-launching tubes discreetly installed in the flatbed, approached the base undetected and fired the rockets in one sudden salvo.  As someone who has gotten lost while walking around the maze of concrete barriers that make up the 15-square-mile Camp Taji base, I can attest to the great accuracy of the strike. Taji is massive, and the strike hit at just the right moment and just the right spot, probably guided by a drone or human agent.  The next day, Kataib Hezbollah (KH), the Iraqi Shiite militia closest to Iran, praised the attack as an act of the pro-Iranian “resistance” against U.S. “occupation”, a surefire sign that pro-Iranian militias were behind the strike and the Shiite militia version of “humble bragging.” By that stage, either U.S. or Israeli aircraft had already struck back at KH and other Shiite militias, albeit just over the border in Syria late on Wednesday, killing around two dozen fighters and wounding many more. The strikes, and the subsequent round launched very early Friday morning, were reminiscent of the United States’ retaliatory attacks in late December on KH after the militia group caused the last U.S. death in Iraq in a rocket attack on December 27.  Friday morning’s strikes may not be the end in a new tit-for-tat cycle that has the potential to spark a wider conflict. Iran is escalating through its Iraqi militias because it wants to raise pressure to evict U.S. forces from Iraq and to threaten Iraqi leaders ahead of next week’s selection of a replacement for resigned Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdal-Mahdi. As U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said on Thursday: “You don't get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it.” But how can deterrence be established quickly to end the cycle of attacks and prevent further loss of American lives? The deaths of two U.S. personnel—one military, one contractor—at Taji comes days after the March 8 deaths of two U.S. Marine special forces operators in a firefight with the Islamic State in northern Iraq. The two episodes underline the complexity of what the U.S. military is attempting to do in today’s Iraq. The mission of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR, or the coalition, for short) is still to defeat the last remnants of the Islamic State. In recent weeks, the coalition has ramped up its special forces raiding alongside Iraqi commandos, achieving significant successes against Islamic State leadership targets. When the U.S. gets on a roll, triggering new raids on the basis of data from laptops and phones recovered in each prior raid, terrorists face the most unrelenting foe in the world. But boosted effectiveness comes at a cost of added risk, as the March 8 deaths illustrate. To complicate matters, Iran-backed militias like KH are seeking to lever the U.S.-backed coalition out of Iraq by any means necessary, regardless of the coalition’s contribution to the anti-Islamic State struggle. Militias like KH sought the removal of international forces long before they killed an American on December 27, before they themselves were struck on December 29, and before their patriarchs, Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia chieftain Aby Mahdi al-Muhandis, were killed by the U.S. on January 3 in a Baghdad drone strike. Now the militias are doubling their efforts, including issuing warnings to Iraqi officials and soldiers to distance themselves from the coalition (which they did not). In recent months, KH has threatened Iraqi MPs to vote to remove U.S. forces (enough of them resisted this call to prevent a vote with quorum) and threatened Iraq’s president Barham Salih if he met with President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum (he met Trump anyway).  Now KH is also issuing statements vetoing certain candidates for Iraq’s imminent selection of a new prime minister, suggesting which candidate should be picked (current premier Adel Abdal-Mahdi), and explicitly suggesting how the country’s most senior religious leaders should rule on the matter.  This is all unprecedented territory in Iraq, particularly the openness of the threats, similar to Iran’s recent elections where the regime blocked over 7,000 candidates for Parliament and invalidated a third of sitting MPs from seeking reelection.  The U.S. has clearly not yet deterred the militias from killing Americans and the result is that U.S. forces in Iraq are not being protected by either the Iraqi government or, ultimately, by our own government. This is not a sustainable situation. What can change? Last night’s strikes on KH missile and rocket bases were an attempt to take the high road, but the lack of large secondary explosions suggests that KH had evacuated its valuable weapons long before the strike. Iran’s militia proxies in Iraq can trade empty buildings or even two dozen of their own rank and file for three Anglo-American fatalities all day, every day. This a game we will lose. The right approach probably lies somewhere between the high and low roads, with very prompt, decisive and unclaimed attacks demonstrated against some senior Iraqi militia leaders in order to make others think very seriously about their personal future. But high-value leadership targets — which Iran and the militias do value — are generally not available to hit the day after Americans are killed: they are keeping their heads down. Congress and the administration need to sit privately and agree to some ground rules for the use of military force that allow the U.S. military to delink the timing of deterrent strikes, so that we can strike the right targets when they become available, to deter militia attacks that are highly likely to come otherwise. In parallel, the U.S. should toughen its mindset, quietly bringing the force protection assets into Iraq that it needs (i.e., Patriot missiles and anti-rocket close-in defenses) without further consultation with an Iraqi government that would rather adopt a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach.  And finally, the U.S. should let the militias keep over-reaching, keep showing their hand as would-be dictators under Iran’s control, while the U.S.-led coalition keeps helping Iraq to defeat the Islamic State. This is a game we can win.",How the U.S. Can Stop the Surge of Deadly Rocket Attacks in Iraq,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/13/iraq-airstrikes-shiite-militias-islamic-state-128210,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued Friday that the coronavirus pandemic presents ""a great investment opportunity,"" insisting that global markets spooked by the public health crisis will rebound eventually. ""This is a short-term issue. It may be a couple of months, but we're going to get through this, and the economy will be stronger than ever,"" Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview. ""You know, I look back at people who bought stocks after the crash in 1987, people who bought stocks after the financial crisis,"" he continued. ""For long-term investors, this will be a great investment opportunity."" Despite the secretary's optimism, international anxiety over the coronavirus has provoked a historically negative reaction in recent days from Wall Street, alarmed at least in part by President Donald Trump's management of the mushrooming outbreak.  Following the president's prime-time address to the nation Wednesday evening, during which he announced a 30-day ban on foreign visitors from most of Europe, panicked investors triggered a marketwide trading halt for the second time this week and only the third time in history.  But Trump asserted Thursday that drastic measures to protect American lives justified any potential economic downturn and offered rosy predictions of a market recovery.  ""It's taken a big hit, but it's going to all bounce back, and it's going to bounce back very big at the right time,"" he told reporters at the White House. Mnuchin's remarks Friday echoed a similar assessment made last week by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who urged investors to capitalize on the faltering stock market amid coronavirus fears.

"The White House is holding up the nomination for one of the Pentagon’s top intelligence jobs because the official is not considered sufficiently loyal to the president, according to three current and former administration officials. Kathryn Wheelbarger, who has been serving as acting assistant secretary of Defense for international security affairs since November 2018, would become the deputy undersecretary of Defense for intelligence if the nomination moves forward. But the holdup comes as President Donald Trump continues a post-impeachment loyalty purge that has already felled two senior Pentagon officials in recent weeks. The post that Wheelbarger would fill is one of 21 senior positions at the Pentagon that are empty or filled on a temporary basis, a record high for the Trump administration. Lawmakers have raised concerns in recent weeks that the department doesn't have enough qualified people in place to tackle the nation's biggest national security problems as it faces a host of crises, from the spread of the coronavirus to a new spike in tensions with Iran. The White House announced its intent to nominate Wheelbarger for the No. 2 position at the Pentagon overseeing military intelligence on Feb. 13, but it has not yet submitted her paperwork to the Senate, a spokesperson for the Senate Armed Services Committee confirmed. By contrast, William Gillis, who the president announced would be nominated for assistant secretary of Defense for sustainment on the same day, had his confirmation hearing on Tuesday. Wheelbarger, through a Pentagon spokesperson, referred comment to the White House, which declined to comment. In her current acting role, Wheelbarger has been the Pentagon’s point person on a host of issues, from the conflict in Syria to relations with NATO. On Tuesday, she testified alongside U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Frank McKenzie and U.S. Africa Command head Gen. Stephen Townsend on the U.S. peace agreement with Afghanistan, terrorist threats in West Africa and more. In particular, Wheelbarger has been “instrumental and a driving force behind the president’s efforts to seek 2 percent defense funding from NATO allies,” one administration official told POLITICO. “She hammered that message repeatedly.” But the White House is not satisfied that Wheelbarger is sufficiently loyal to the administration, the three current and former officials said. The people pointed to Wheelbarger’s two years spent working for the late Sen. John McCain, who feuded publicly with Trump before his death in 2019, as the root of the current tension. But the administration official said the White House is wrong about Wheelbarger, noting that she has worked for Trump for 50 percent longer than she did for McCain. Wheelbarger also declined to testify before Congress during the impeachment inquiry, the official said, explaining that she and her lawyer convinced congressional staff that she would not be able to provide additional information for the case. This is not the first time the White House has intervened on Pentagon personnel issues. The Trump administration demanded the ouster of John Rood, then-undersecretary of Defense for policy, in February, and has since rejected several of Defense Secretary Mark Esper’s choices to replace him. The White House personnel office, which is led by Trump loyalist John McEntee, put forth its own candidate to replace Rood: Elbridge Colby, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of Defense and is one of the primary authors of the National Defense Strategy. The White House also recently withdrew the nomination of Elaine McCusker to be Pentagon comptroller after emails emerged showing her questioning the administration’s suspension of military aid to Ukraine, an issue at the heart of the impeachment. “Unless you are here to support him personally, he’d rather have gaps,” said one former administration official.",White House holding up DoD nomination amid Trump loyalty purge,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/defense-nomination-trump-loyalty-128244,politico

"President Donald Trump on Friday said that he would eliminate the interest on federal student loans ""until further notice"" as part of a package of emergency executive actions designed to address the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. “To help our students and their families, I’ve waived interest on all student loans held by federal government agencies and that will be until further notice,” Trump said during a Rose Garden address where he declared a national emergency. “That’s a big thing for a lot of students that are left in the middle right now. Many of those schools have been closed.” The unprecedented move will provide relief to the more than 42 million Americans who owe more than $1.5 trillion in outstanding federal student loans. But it did not go as far as what some Democrats had proposed, which was a suspension of monthly loan payments or loan forgiveness. The department was considering instructing loan servicers to lower the interest rate on federal loans to zero percent, according to individuals familiar with the plan. Under that approach, a borrower's monthly payment amount would not automatically change, though any payments the borrower did make would likely pay down a greater share of the principal balance. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ""is proud to work with the President in taking decisive action to help students and parents during this national emergency,"" department spokesperson Liz Hill said in a statement. The new policy will be implemented by the Education Department, which was scrambling on Friday to issue instructions and guidance to the companies it hires to manage the monthly payments of borrowers. A department official said that the interest waiver would be automatically applied to all borrowers, effective Friday, even though it may take some another week to fully ""operationalize"" the policy. It's not clear how much money the interest waiver will save borrowers, but it could be billions of dollars, depending on how long the Trump administration keeps the policy in place. In fiscal 2019 alone, the Education Department reported that it charged more than $100 billion in interest on all federal student loans. Federal student loans already offer options for borrowers to defer payments under certain circumstances, including an economic hardship, though interest can continue to accrue. Trump's suspension of interest payments, combined with those existing benefits, could mean that some Americans would be able to put their student loans on hold interest-free. Democrats and consumer advocacy groups who have long pushed for sweeping student debt relief from the federal government have said in recent days that the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the need to provide assistance to Americans struggling with monthly loan payments. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a tweet that Trump's action was ""not enough"" to help student loan borrowers. ""Donald Trump & @BetsyDeVosED need to cancel student loans, not just waive interest or suspend payments,"" she said. ""Suspending payments or interest just delays the pain."" However, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) tweeted that it was a ""good step"" and that ""With so much uncertainty in the economy, we need to continue to look at every available means of providing relief."" Senate Democrats earlier this week included a six-month moratorium on some federal student loan payments on their list of items they’d like to see in an economic rescue legislative package. The National Consumer Law Center, which represents low-income student loan borrowers, has also called for a moratorium on student loan payments. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that pausing student loan payments was among the ""list of 50 different items"" that Trump's advisers planned to present to him to shore up the economy and financial markets due to the coronavirus pandemic. “That’ll be something we’re looking at,” Mnuchin said during an interivew on CNBC. “We have lots of authorities,” Mnuchin said, adding that on “things where we don’t have authorities, we’re going to work with both the House and Senate on a bipartisan basis. I can assure you the president is all about action, action, action.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has called for sweeping student loan forgiveness, tweeted earlier in the day that she was ""thankful"" that the Trump administration was ""taking pausing student loan payments seriously."" She called it ""a decisive move that will help stabilize millions of people. We should do it now. There is much more to be done, but every step counts."" The Education Department on Friday was still determining the mechanics of how to carry out Trump's announcement. The department has decided that the policy will automatically apply to all borrowers with federal direct loans, federally held Family Federal Education Loans and federally held Perkins Loans, according to a department official. Borrowers whose loans are in income-based repayment or in forbearance will still qualify. ""This will be operationalized over the next week or so, and it will be retroactive back to today,"" the official said. Borrowers could potentially seek a recalculation of their monthly payment under income-driven repayment plans or some would qualify for forbearance options, which would now be a way to put their student loans on hold interest-free. Much of the implementation will fall to the nine companies that the Education Department hires to collect and manage the payments of federal student loan borrowers. “Servicers and the Department have already begun discussions on how to implement this response to the current situation and we look forward to being able to provide more information to borrowers very shortly,” said Scott Buchanan, the president of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, the trade association that represents the companies. “Servicers will be updating websites in the coming days with information as soon as it becomes available.”",Trump to waive interest on federal student loans 'until further notice',2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-administration-student-loan-payments-suspension-128181,politico
"The House passed sweeping legislation Saturday to respond to the coronavirus outbreak battering the nation, an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote to expand access to free testing, provide $1 billion in food aid and extend sick leave benefits to vulnerable Americans. The bill's bipartisan passage, 363-40, was virtually assured when President Donald Trump backed the measure — largely hammered out by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — and urged Republicans to support the bill. Trump's tweet, just before 9 p.m., capped several days of whiplash as Democrats and the White House appeared, at times, inches from a deal only to see it yanked away amid technical disputes and inconsistent signals from the president. Trump's backing, though, was essential to ensure support from congressional Republicans for the multi-billion dollar plan.  Democrats put the bill on the floor shortly after midnight under an expedited process and passed it in the early hours of Saturday morning, sending it to the Senate, which is expected to take it up as early as Monday.  The bill is the product of a painstaking effort by Pelosi to pass a measure with bipartisan support rather than a doomed Democrat-only bill that the Senate would have immediately spiked.  ""[W]e thought it would be important to show the American people, assure the American people, that we are willing and able to work together to get a job done for them,"" Pelosi said. ""So we thank our Republicans — those who will be supporting the bill. We appreciate the president joining us with his tweet."" Pelosi said the final bill came together slowly because of a laborious review process in the executive branch, which required approvals from multiple agencies and officials. Pelosi praised Mnuchin for his cooperation, and she acknowledged she never directly spoke with Trump about the bill. ""There was no need for that,"" she said. Alongside Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he expected House committees to be working through next week's recess on a new bill meant to address the economic damage wrought by coronavirus, which has devastated the airline, hospitality and entertainment industries. For now, though, Democrats said they were pleased to pass a bipartisan plan that they expect to pass overwhelmingly in the House and move through the Senate by Monday. ""I think this was a very good sign of bipartisanship and working together, that we can overcome this virus. We’ve done much bigger things before,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Friday night, minutes after the deal was announced.  On Saturday morning, Trump tweeted: ""Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see!"" Trump's approval came after a hard-fought — and chaotic — day of negotiations, with Democrats and Republicans alike unsure whether the president was on board with the proposal. For several hours before Trump's tweet, talks had devolved into a state of confusion, with key officials on both sides directly contradicting each other on whether a deal exists. ""Because it was essential for us to have legislation pass the House by this weekend, it required intense and constant negotiations for what could have been an elusive agreement,"" Pelosi said in a letter to fellow Democrats after 10 p.m. on Friday, thanking them for their patience amid the frenetic back-and-forth with the administration. Pelosi had announced to her members shortly after 6 p.m. that she had reached a deal. But House Republicans — and even Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat — had said talks were still ongoing and a deal had not yet been reached. Key Republicans cautioned that there were still lingering issues related to a tax credit for paid family sick leave. McCarthy later confirmed that Republicans sought more flexibility for small business owners who would be forced to offer paid leave to affected workers.  Adding to the confusion, Mnuchin surprised even members of his own party by announcing on Fox Business that he had reached an agreement with Pelosi. The Treasury secretary had huddled with Trump just minutes before — a meeting that delayed his appearance on the network for so long that Mnuchin ran out of time to speak before the program ended. Trump eventually tweeted his support hours later, delivering long-awaited relief to hundreds of members and aides who had spent 48 hours in limbo awaiting any updates about the status of the funding package. ""I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening,"" Trump tweeted. ""I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt. I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!"" One of the other major obstacles involved the president's personal demand for a payroll tax cut in this package. That idea has little support on Capitol Hill, and Democrats have already said it would be debated as part of future coronavirus crisis-related legislation at a later date. McCarthy, who met with Trump and Mnuchin multiple times in the last 24 hours, confirmed that Trump had sought the last-minute addition, and said Republicans would push for it in Congress's next tranche of economic relief, which could come later this month or in April. ""I believe this will not be the only one,"" McCarthy said, alluding to future aid packages related to the outbreak. ""This is something that the president wants, we would have liked to have that as well. I think that would have taken a little more time."" Mnuchin earlier in the talks had also expressed concerns that a tax credit to offset the cost of Democratic-proposed sick leave provisions wouldn't work as advertised.  During Trump's White House press conference to announce a national emergency declaration on Friday afternoon, the president complained, ""We don't think the Democrats are giving enough,"" even as Capitol Hill Republicans had been framing the differences as largely technical. Pelosi and Mnuchin then got on the phone again to try to finalize an agreement. The last remaining issues came down to how businesses can receive a tax credit for providing paid sick days and emergency leave for workers who are suffering from the coronavirus or helping take care of family members who contract the disease.  Pelosi and Mnuchin exchanged at least 20 phone calls on Thursday and Friday as they tried to hammer out a proposal that Trump could support.  Both Republicans and Democrats in the House insisted that they would not leave Washington until they could approve the massive package, which would work to both stem the outbreak by offering free testing and offering paid time off, while shoring up support systems for low-income workers, including school lunch meals and unemployment insurance. The legislation includes 14 paid sick days for employees, as well as three months of paid emergency leave throughout the coronavirus crisis. Employers will be reimbursed for some of these costs through tax credits. At GOP insistence, the emergency leave provision will expire in a year. And Republicans were able to insert language exempting smaller businesses from the requirements. The legislation helps provide free food for children whose schools are closed during the crisis, as well as other initiatives to make sure seniors and food banks get help as well. One of the biggest provisions involves free testing — which has been one of the major shortcomings in the U.S. response to the outbreak so far. ""This legislation is about testing, testing, testing,"" Pelosi said in a letter to her colleagues announcing the agreement. ""To stop the spread of the virus, we have secured free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured. We cannot fight coronavirus effectively unless everyone in our country who needs to be tested can get their test free of charge."" The House plans to go into recess for a week. That break, though, may be extended if the coronavirus crisis worsens. Hoyer, who sets the floor schedule, has said Democrats and Republicans are taking the situation day by day and consulting with medical experts and Capitol safety officials. The package comes amid a sense of deep unease on Capitol Hill with both the growing outbreak and the chaotic way that negotiations were led. Several House Democrats expressed complaints about the process, including Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who wrote on Twitter: ""We have ~46% of the House awaiting the @potus to tweet support before they’ll vote, and 100% of the House afforded an hour or so to read and consider one of the most important measures on which we’ll ever vote. It’s not how good governance should work, even during a pandemic."" Pelosi acknowledged that the negotiations were not ideal, suggesting that future legislation would be drafted and approved in a different fashion. ""As we proceed with further legislation, we will do so happily under a different timetable and continue to welcome any suggestions you have,"" Pelosi wrote in her Friday night letter to colleagues. The anxiety has also been compounded by the growing numbers of lawmakers and aides who are intentionally isolating themselves after potential exposure to the virus. A staffer for Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) has tested positive for coronavirus, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced Friday morning that he would be extending his self quarantine until March 17 “out of an abundance of caution.” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told POLITICO he is consulting with doctors on what he should do after news came out that a Spanish right wing politician, Santiago Abascal, he met with on March 2 tested positive for the coronavirus. He said he’s sure he shook Abscal’s hand but added he “feels fine.” He’s currently staying home and has canceled all events in his home state.  A spokesman for Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), who also met with Abascal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what Smith is doing.  More than 1,400 people in the U.S. have been infected, though many health experts fear that number is dramatically undercounted given the lack of availability of testing.

"The U.S. is shoring up its defenses in the Middle East after tit-for-tat attacks between the U.S. military and an Iran-backed Shia militia group stoked new tensions in the region this week, the top U.S. general in the region announced Friday. Following the Wednesday rocket attack on Camp Taji, Iraq, that killed U.S. and British service members and a retaliatory U.S. and British airstrike on five locations in Iraq on Thursday, the U.S. military will continue to operate two aircraft carrier strike groups in the region, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the USS Harry S. Truman, Gen. Frank McKenzie told reporters at the Pentagon Friday. This is the first period of extended dual U.S. carrier operations in the Middle East since 2012, he said. McKenzie stressed the symbolic significance of keeping two U.S. carriers in the region, noting that the vessel ""is a floating piece of American sovereignty."" ""We know the Iranians watch them very closely,"" he said. In addition, the U.S. is moving Patriot missile defense systems, which are designed to defend against cruise and ballistic missiles of the type used by Iran, into Iraq. They may be joined by more weapon systems for countering rockets, artillery and mortars, known as C-RAM, McKenzie said. C-RAM is designed to knock down lower-altitude weapons such as the 107mm Katyusha rockets fired at Camp Taji on Wednesday, but they ""are not a panacea,"" he cautioned. Roughly 90,000 U.S. forces are operating in the area overseen by U.S. Central Command, including the Middle East and Afghanistan, up from the 80,000 that were there before the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. airstrike in January. The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported that some of these troops had begun to head home after several months without a significant attack; it is not yet clear if this reduction will continue. McKenzie declined to directly blame Iran for the attack, but noted that Kataib Hezbollah, the Shia militia group that launched the rocket barrage on Wednesday, is ""closely linked"" to Tehran. Kataib Hezbollah has been involved in 12 rocket attacks against coalition forces in the last six months, including a December attack on Kirkuk that killed an American contractor and led to a series of escalations that brought Washington and Tehran to the brink of war. The U.S. and British airstrikes launched on Thursday successfully hit and destroyed all five targets, all of which were Kataib Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, McKenzie said, noting that he expects minimal collateral damage. ""We believe that this is going to have an effect on deterring future strikes of this nature,"" McKenzie said.

"As Americans brace for the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the U.S., once-booming industries are already suffering from deadly symptoms of an economic downturn.  Consumers, after panic-buying, are expected to hunker down and limit their spending. Sporting events, concerts and other entertainment are now suspended. Businesses are canceling travel and conferences. Airlines and trains are slashing schedules.  The sudden and precipitous shutdowns across the economy are forcing the Trump administration and lawmakers to contemplate which industries need targeted rescues — to keep them from collapsing entirely — and which can get by with broader support for struggling workers across the nation. While lawmakers consider an immediate aid package for workers hashed out by Democratic leaders and the White House, Trump and his aides have been meeting with business leaders and industry groups to design an aid package — through tax relief and emergency loans — for the corporate sector. Core to their challenge: Everyone can’t get special help, so the government must pick winners and losers from a downturn — with a focus on industries whose collapse could ripple through the system most. It’s a debate that will accelerate in the coming days as the economic consequences of the crisis become clearer. Airlines were the first industry that came to mind for Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank.  While strong employment insurance systems and social safety net programs will take care of workers, he said it’s important to think about “what industries have a spillover value to the rest of the economy.”  “I think of transport — whether it’s trains or trucks or airplanes. You want to look at those and where there’s distress that you can help, you want to go in and do that because it spills over to every part of the economy,” said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “I don’t think the same case can be made for restaurants and hotels. I care about the workers and employees, but you know when you build restaurants and invest in hotels, you take business risk. And this will be a bad year for them.”  President Donald Trump has already vowed to help both the cruise line industry and the airline industry, and in a White House sit-down with top health insurance executives, said his administration is already “working very closely” with both.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers this week that the administration was considering loan guarantees and other measures to aid the airline industry amid the pandemic.  “I want to be clear: This is not bailouts. We are not looking for bailouts,” he said. Mnuchin added, “There may be specific industries that are highly impacted by travel that have issues with lending” — and “I would assume the airlines would be on the top of the list,” as well as hotels and cruise lines.  Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said industry-focused measures aren’t the solution, yet.  Instead, he said the administration should focus on people and workers to attack the crisis. “If we don’t do much to respond to it, I think it’s very likely to cause a recession,” Bivens said. If the administration does move to bail out industries such as airlines, Bivens said it should be done through loans — leaving direct fiscal aid for individuals.  “It’s really bad to have a recession, and so doing things that will actually be effective is attractive,” Bivens said. “And I think aid to people and individuals is just more effective, and behind closed doors, their own economic experts will tell them that. And I think in the case of direct cash payments to people and households, how can that not be good politics as well?”  Bivens continued, “I feel like there are some incentives pushing it potentially in the right direction on this stuff, but I think a lot of aid to industries is going to be attempted to be attached to this as well.”  Here’s a look at some of the key industries experiencing the most pain in the early stages of the crisis:  Airlines Flights are being canceled across the board as vacationers halt trips and businesses slash travel. As airlines brace for the downturn, some are comparing the impact to the aftermath of 9/11. The International Air Transport Association says the global industry could lose upwards of $113 billion in 2020. And with another travel ban, this time for foreign travelers coming from Europe, airline stocks plummeted and some companies announced temporary employee layoffs to protect themselves from insolvency. Cruise lines Social distancing does not work on giant cruise ships — especially after passengers were stranded on virus-ridden boats. Carnival stopped voyages on its Princess Cruise lines for two months and cruise ship operator Viking halted operations until May 1, actions that will hit employees and devastate the companies‘ bottom lines.  After the Trump administration pushed for a temporary cruise ship shutdown, the president tweeted late Friday: “At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry — it will be kept that way!” Sports and entertainment  The sports entertainment industry has shut down as lucrative tournaments and sports seasons like March Madness, NBA, MLB and others have been canceled or put on hold. Hundreds of thousands of workers, including vendors, referees and other staff members work events across the country in addition to the athletes.  Other key entertainment industries like film, music and theme parks will be slammed as America shuts down. From Disney World to music festivals, the entertainment industry and its workers will be among those taking the hardest hit as Americans hunker down in their homes.  Hotels Hotel operators have projected major losses as travel plans are canceled across the nation and around the world. With postponed or canceled events, hotels will suffer from fewer overnight visitors. And with a slower pace of bookings, workers will feel the pain as well as companies cut their payrolls.  Restaurants Restaurants across the country are struggling to respond to the fast-paced spread of coronavirus. Bars and restaurants in hot spots like New York and Washington have had to adjust to new state orders for social distancing and lower customer traffic, forcing some to close their doors entirely for the time being — leaving employees without work.  Manufacturing  Coronavirus has disrupted the supply chains for nearly three-quarters of U.S. companies, setting up many for lower annual revenue projections, according to a survey by the leading group for purchasing managers. Companies ranging from retail to technology are sure to feel the losses because of delays in key goods from China, the world’s hub for manufacturing, as the virus kept workers there at home. Energy   Oil and natural gas producers were hit by plummeting oil prices amid the outbreak. A price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia drove oil prices this week to their steepest intraday tumble in nearly 30 years, and numerous U.S. shale companie — already in deep debt — could be pushed out of business if the collapse becomes a prolonged crisis. While a bailout for the industry seems unlikely, Trump gave oil prices a small lift on Friday when he announced that the U.S. would buy additional oil for the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we're going to fill it up,” Trump said. “This is a good time to fill it up.”",Who gets saved and who collapses?,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-industry-stimulus-129216,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is widely thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",Two senators take extreme measures to show allegiance to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"Joe Biden has long complained about the crowded debate stage and a restrictive format that doesn’t allow enough time for candidates to speak. Now, in his one-on-one debate Sunday with Bernie Sanders, he finally gets the debate terms he wanted — and an opportunity to convince Democrats the race is effectively over.  Expectations aren’t high for the former vice president after a series of mediocre debate performances during primary season. The Sanders campaign, among other Biden detractors, views the debate as a chance for him to fall flat on his face, reviving questions about the durability of his candidacy just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open with a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. But in years past, Biden has thrived in the one-on-one format during vice presidential debates. His plan Sunday is to focus on his electability and how he’s in sync with the Democratic electorate after winning 15 states, according to aides. In the face of aggressive questioning from Sanders, Biden can now point to record turnout in states like Virginia, which overwhelmingly supported him. Then there’s the fact that he won nearly all of the African American support in Mississippi. What’s more, Biden has won whites by big margins and racked up wins in the cities, suburbs and in rural areas, a fact that advisers hope will give him a sense of confidence against Sanders. “Success builds on success,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s top adviser in charge of debates. In the first debate since Feb. 25 — four days before the South Carolina primary that transformed Biden’s candidacy from hospice patient to juggernaut — Biden is expected to be careful not to come across as too arrogant. “The flip side is this thing, we’ve seen it change before, we’re taking nothing for granted,” Klain said. “I expect a lively contest on Sunday and a lively contest on Tuesday.” Biden is prepared for Sanders to question his shortcomings with reaching out to the youth vote, and to acknowledge he needs to make gains with young voters. But the former vice president’s advisers say he’ll also note that Sanders fell short of his own promise that he had the singular ability to attract new voters and build a coalition that would beat Trump. Biden is also expected to mention how most of the top former presidential candidates in the race endorsed him — and not Sanders. Sanders, meanwhile, is operating under some self-imposed constraints. The Vermont senator likes Biden and loathes Trump, and he doesn’t want to eviscerate Biden out of concern that it would only weaken him and therefore help Trump, Sanders advisers say. And they note the difficulty of being overtly political onstage at a time when coronavirus dominates the nation’s consciousness. Attacking Biden too much could be perceived as just out of step with the moment in which Democrats want unity and seriousness of purpose. “Bernie’s going to be careful about not looking too political — too electoral — and being the guy who says, ‘Well, I can get this many delegates and go on to the convention...’ No. That’s not where Americans’ heads are at,” an adviser said. “People are worrying about their families. They’re at the grocery store buying batteries.” Because coronavirus has made health care an even more important issue, Sanders is expected to press Biden on his opposition to Medicare for all. Sanders also wants Biden to explain why he advocated for cutting Social Security years ago only to inaccurately suggest he never did. “It’s not going to be an all-out assault. It’s going to be a policy debate. And it’s going to be a vigorous one,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders senior adviser. “But it’s going to be on policy.” Klain said his candidate is ready for whatever Sanders throws at him. “They have met on the debate stage 10 times already. I’m pretty sure I know what Bernie Sanders’ position is on Medicare for All and I know what Joe Biden’s position is on Medicare for All,” Klain said. “If people are expecting some big new thing on Sunday, I don’t think they’re going to get it.”  Klain, who served as Biden’s chief of staff while vice president, earned acclaim as the Obama administration’s czar who successfully managed response to the Ebola virus. Biden has tapped that expertise for his coronavirus response plan, and aides believe the issue is a strength at a moment when President Trump’s unsteady performance has generated criticism. According to NPR, exit polls showed about half of Michigan voters said they believed Biden was best equipped to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 31 percent. In Missouri, 61 percent said they trusted Biden to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 26 percent. Advisers also say Biden would contrast his approach to Trump. Biden, of course, has a well-earned reputation of going off-script, misspeaking or meandering. His first debate performance was arguably his worst. That’s when then-2020 rival Kamala Harris called him out for highlighting his ability to work with Southern segregationists in the 1970s and challenged him on busing policies. The debate went so badly, Biden felt compelled to address his performance at a Chicago event the next day.  “We all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds in a debate can’t do justice to a lifetime commitment to civil rights,” Biden said. Biden’s performances stabilized over time — or critics just became accustomed to his style — and he was praised recently for televised town halls in Nevada and South Carolina as well as the strength of his debates in both of those states.  What also helped Biden was billionaire Mike Bloomberg, a candidate who promised to save Democrats upon Biden’s collapse but instead delivered a disastrous performance in Nevada when Elizabeth Warren shredded him on stage, taking the focus off the then-struggling Biden. Weaver said Biden has benefited from the big debate stages like that one in Las Vegas that have allowed him to avoid engaging in actual debate. “With eight to 10 people onstage,” Weaver said, “it’s very difficult to have the kind of back-and-forth debate that voters need to make a good decision about who they want to pick as their nominee. That’s the problem.” Last week, the two campaigns clashed over the debate format. Sanders campaign wanted a standing debate that was moderated by professionals. Biden’s campaign was more inclined for a seated town hall-style format where citizens could ask questions. Biden has tended to thrive when given more time to argue a point or explain policy ideas. In town halls, potential voters at times would express relief at seeing Biden in person, saying he was far more articulate and cogent than the candidate they’d seen on the debate stage.  Prior to this year’s crowded debates, Biden distinguished himself with several strong performances in vice presidential debates in 2008 and 2012. “Joe Biden is simultaneously the most-experienced presidential campaign debater in modern American life but has the lowest expectations,” said Michael Steel, an adviser to former Rep. Paul Ryan before his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Biden, whose performance was credited with helping to reverse the fortunes of the Obama-Biden ticket.“We expected him to be over the top. We expected him to be blarney-full, if that’s a word. And he just took it to 11.” The dispute with the Sanders campaign over the debate format came as Democrats sympathetic to Biden started privately raising concerns that Biden didn’t have the physical or mental stamina to face Sanders on stage. Rumors circulated that the Democratic National Committee was under pressure to cancel the debate, which both the DNC and Biden’s campaign denied. The debate ultimately wasn’t canceled, but it was moved to Washington, D.C., from Phoenix over concerns about coronavirus contagion. Mike Ceraso, a former adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign, said Biden has captured the feeling of the party better than his opponents, winning a different type of expectations game. “Expectations this time around isn’t about brains or performance. It’s about the story, man. Pete and Warren and Bernie’s stories are okay,” Ceraso said. “Biden’s story hits home. Loss and anger and sense of service and sadness are relatable qualities. They amplify with Trump in the background. Take the intellectual out of it. And focus on the heart. It’s cliche as hell. But...imagine if you’re someone who has a mom with Alzheimer’s or a depressed child or someone addicted to drugs.”",Biden readies plan to finish off Bernie,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/biden-sanders-2020-endorsements-129182,politico
"The National Education Association announced Saturday that it is backing Joe Biden for president, handing the Democratic frontrunner a prized endorsement ahead of Tuesday’s big-state primaries as he aims to wipe out his last remaining major opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Lily Eskelsen García, president of the 3 million-member teachers union, praised the former vice president as a “tireless advocate for public education"" who understands the nation’s “moral responsibility to provide a great neighborhood public school for every student in every ZIP code.” The NEA is the nation's largest labor union. “For the past two years, the #RedforEd movement has proven the power of the National Education Association and the collective voice of our members to advocate for stronger public schools and opportunity for all students,” Eskelsen García said in a statement. “Now, with so much at stake in this election, educators are determined to use their voice to propel Joe Biden to the White House.” The endorsement precedes Tuesday’s key primaries in Florida, Arizona, Illinois and Ohio. NEA has members in every congressional district, including battleground states. Biden and Sanders (I-Vt.) are set to debate Sunday night just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open if he makes a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. The union’s members traditionally serve as national convention delegates and they have a high voter turnout rate. In the last presidential election, 89 percent of registered NEA members voted, according to the union. NEA endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Sanders early in the 2016 Democratic primary, though the move roiled Sanders backers in the union ranks. This time, union leaders waited to see how candidates performed in early primaries. “I'm not going to bring a recommendation before we see who actually can deliver votes,” Eskelsen García told POLITICO in January. The union's move on Saturday follows a lengthy process that included a questionnaire, videotaped interviews and multiple presidential forums. Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, also an educator and an NEA member, have built “broad support” among members, a news release said. In her statement, Eskelsen García also lauded Biden’s support for better pay for teachers and increasing funding for support staff and paraprofessionals. “And Biden will fire Betsy DeVos and replace her with an education secretary who comes from a public school classroom and believes that educators must have a seat at the table when crafting education policy,” she said. Last month, the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers union announced that it would encourage its local and state affiliates to back or endorse the presidential bids of Biden, Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

"The Trump administration is struggling to win back the confidence of hospital leaders after three years of pitched battles, with the industry pushing for urgent help from the White House as the coronavirus crisis begins to swamp emergency rooms. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma on Friday announced new moves to roll back industry regulations, two days after hospitals pled their case to Verma in a White House meeting that left many unsatisfied. Among the changes: Streamlined deployment of doctors, fewer time-consuming inspections and less red tape around how hospitals run operations during a crisis. “It gives hospitals and providers on the front lines the maximum flexibility so that they can focus on patients that need help,” Verma said on “Fox and Friends” on Saturday. The American Hospital Association hailed the moves as a “solid step.” But hospital leaders say that the new announcements only touch the surface of their needs, as they worry about shortages of crucial supplies, risks to their workers and the possibility of an industry bailout as coronavirus patients swarm their facilities. An expert on an American Hospital Association webinar last month predicted as many as 1.9 million ICU admissions from the coronavirus outbreak over the next few months, swamping existing facilities. There are only about 100,000 ICU beds across the U.S. health system. Meanwhile, the cost of care for some severely ill coronavirus patients has already been estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, as hospitals deploy significant measures to keep the patients alive while protecting their own workers against infection. At least three hospital systems in Seattle, the center of the nation's most extensive outbreak, have already announced a halt on elective procedures in order to devote more resources toward the coronavirus patients already swarming their facilities. “I think there will be hospitals that could be pushed to the edge financially,” said Chip Kahn, head of the for-profit Federation of American Hospitals, warning that hospitals will absorb a surge of coronavirus cases while postponing elective procedures that tend to be better for hospitals’ bottom lines. Some hospital leaders have quietly floated that they’ll need federal funding to pay for rented hotels or other arrangements as their hospital wards are quickly overrun by the coronavirus outbreak. The risk of failure is severe: Public health experts have warned that the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, which is in its early days, could be on track to resemble the increasingly dire situation in Italy, where patients have overwhelmed that nation’s health system. That’s left hospitals calling for extreme measures from the White House and scrambling to prepare emergency steps of their own while they wait for a response. But in the face of the looming crisis, hospital executives said that leaders were underwhelmed by their Wednesday meeting with Verma, who spent much of the hour-long session taking notes but failed to calm industry fears about swamped emergency rooms and medical supply shortages, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence briefly joined the meeting but departed to join other officials as they worked to prepare the president for his Oval Office address. “For our guys, it did not scream confidence,” said one individual briefed on the meeting. “We came out of it with bigger questions about whether the administration has done its homework to protect the supply chain,” as hospitals try to stock up on masks, swabs and other key materials that could quickly become hard to find, said another individual. Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, compared the current situation to a “World War II mentality, where we’re going to have to put extra shifts on in manufacturing and get this stuff out the door.” “The only one that can do that is the federal government, and we need the president and vice president to make a priority of that,” he said. Kahn, who was among the attendees at Wednesday’s meeting, praised Verma but put responsibility for the administration’s slow start on the White House, contending that federal health officials had to wait for authorization to get started on a series of initiatives. But hospital leaders haven’t had time alone with President Donald Trump — even as leaders of other health sectors, like the insurance industry, the pharma industry and the lab industry, have been granted extended face-to-face meetings with the president and Pence. CMS didn't respond to questions about the meeting with Verma, but defended its efforts to engage the hospital industry. A spokesperson pointed to a new weekly call to brief hospitals on coronavirus — with the first call with FDA Commissioner Steve Hahn drawing more than 1,600 listeners — and other steps to build closer ties. ""CMS created a strategic working group with the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals which began meeting last Monday,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the group included a ""small number"" of hospital CEOs. ""We believe that for the health system to respond adequately to the coronavirus, the entire health system must be engaged,"" the spokesperson added. The tensions between hospitals and the Trump administration have persisted for years. The hospital industry went to war with the White House in 2017 over Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying that rolling back the sweeping health law would harm patients and do damage to their bottom lines. They’ve continued that fight as Trump has tried to strike down the law in court, with American Hospital Association CEO Rick Pollack calling the position “misguided.” Hospitals also have fought over numerous Medicaid changes spearheaded by Verma, including a new “fiscal accountability” proposal that would tighten hospitals’ ability to collect Medicaid funding. Hospitals currently use a variety of financial arrangements to pump up their Medicaid revenue, such as supporting state taxes that allow them to draw down even more money in federal matching funds. Verma has called the arrangements industry-friendly gimmicks and wants to do away with them. “Hospitals were already concerned about the rule — and moreso with coronavirus staring them in the face,” said Joel McElvain, a partner in King & Spalding’s health care group who’s represented hospitals in lawsuits against the administration. McElvain warned that states would need to come up with new financial arrangements to support hospitals if the rule, a top priority for Verma, is finalized during the coronavirus outbreak. “It’s a time when rural hospitals are already struggling and facing real difficulty if worst-case scenarios come true in the coming weeks,” McElvain said. Meanwhile, hospitals have spent years fighting back against a slew of Trump administration funding cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and public health initiatives. Among Trump’s most recent proposals: an $18 million cut to the federal health department’s own hospital preparedness program, announced just last month, on the eve of the coronavirus outbreak. “The hospital preparedness program exists so hospitals prepare for this exact thing,” said a former HHS official. “The whole point is to prepare them so they can respond to all hazards - from hurricanes to pandemics to biological attacks.” While Trump’s battles with the pharmaceutical industry have gotten considerable headlines, some of his aides have believed that hospitals were a larger problem, citing the costs that ever-larger systems have passed along to patients and pointing to policies that they say gamed the system. They also haven’t agreed with hospitals’ warnings that their bottom lines have suffered under this administration. “The argument is so ridiculous,” said Brian Blase, who advised Trump on health policy before leaving the White House last year. “I don’t think there are a lot of policies that came out that took revenue away from hospitals,” he added, noting that hospitals successfully sued to blockTrump’s billion-dollar cut to a drug-discount program and other regulations opposed by hospitals have been similarly stalled. Amid the historic public health threat, hospital officials are loath to renew a public battle too and criticize the administration. “We have been very clear that we have had serious concerns with a number of other policies from the Administration, including the issues of Medicaid expansion and cuts to hospital outpatient department visits,” a spokesperson for the American Hospital Association told POLITICO. “Right now, of course, our focus is on working with the government and other stakeholders at all levels to address the current emergency.” But some hospital leaders did express frustration on Saturday after Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that hospitals may need to postpone elective surgeries to handle the crush of coronavirus patients. “Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!” Adams tweeted on Saturday, adding that such procedures could further the coronavirus spread, tax medical stockpiles and put further pressure on doctors and nurses. The message from the nation’s top doctor was seen as alarmist and premature, worrying hospital officials that it would prompt patients to postpone crucial care. “I do think it’s unfortunate what the surgeon general said,” said Kahn, adding that he hoped Adams and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who similarly warned of the need to cancel some procedures, would walk back their statements. “I don’t think we’re anywhere near a point where we know we would have to do something like that.” The coronavirus outbreak has served as justification of hospitals’ yearslong warnings over federal policies that the industry saw as hamstringing their finances and preparedness, executives said. Now, the same government that sought to cut pay rates and layer on new regulations is relying on hospitals as the nation’s chief defense against the pandemic. “Governments tend to, on a day-to-day basis, underestimate the importance of the health care community and look at it not so much as an economic contribution as an economic deficit,” Raske said, emphasizing that the attitude extends well beyond the Trump administration. “That tendency hits reality in a crisis.” Hospital leaders also have warned about the dearth of ventilators to treat the sickest patients — an issue that Verma has failed to directly address in multiple interviews, including being grilled by Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday night over whether hospitals will have enough. ""You know, Tucker, I don't want to make drastic predictions here, right?"" Verma said. ""Because this situation is changing every single day. And based on the information we have, we know that we have to be aggressive,"" she added, touting yesterday's moves to increase flexibility for hospitals and relax regulations. “That was one of the most incompetent and absolutely incoherent responses to what’s going on right now,” Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease expert, told Carlson a few minutes later. CMS did not directly respond to questions about whether there is a dearth of ventilators. Meanwhile, hospital executives have noted the dark irony of Washington’s sudden focus on mass treatment capacity after years of efforts to crack down on hospital reimbursement prompted providers to shrink their facilities. “I’m really worried about how, when this finally blows over, what Congress does,” said one lobbyist. “Are we actually going to learn from this?” “We love hospitals,” countered Blase, Trump’s former health policy adviser. “Hospitals are going to be at the front lines of this and have an enormous job. But there shouldn’t be policies that give them advantages they shouldn’t have.”",Trump now needs the hospitals he's alienated,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-hospitals-coronavirus-129743,politico

"Georgia has delayed its presidential primary due to coronavirus. The primary, which was originally scheduled for March 24, will now be held on May 19. Georgia is the second state to delay its presidential primary. Louisiana rescheduled its April 4 primary to June 20 on Friday. The virus, which has infected more than 2,700 people across the United States, has prompted school closures, the cessation of professional sports and, in many places, a prohibition on large public gatherings.  “Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement, originally issued to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The presidential primary in the state will now be held on the same day as primaries in the state for local, state and congressional offices.  In-person early voting has also been halted. A statement from state Sen. Nikema Williams, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia, indicated that in-person and absentee ballots that have already been cast in the presidential primary will count. However, election officials in four states that are voting on Tuesday — Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — said on Friday their primaries will go on as scheduled. “Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,” a joint statement from top election officials read. After Tuesday, only one other state or territory has a presidential primary scheduled for the month of March: Puerto Rico. But party officials in the state have also requested the primary be moved. A statement from the Puerto Rico Democratic Party said Chairman Charles Rodriguez requested that the territory’s legislature postpone its primary until April 26, with the potential for the primary to be held later if the virus is still not contained.  Some election watchdogs fret that delaying primaries is a step too far, expressing worry that moving primaries could effectively suppress voters’ rights. “We all agree that the safety and health of the public is paramount, but steps can, and must be taken to protect voters and poll workers while also ensuring that the democratic process marches ahead,” read a joint statement issued after Louisiana's decision from dozens of groups, including The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the NAACP. “Sudden changes to election times, locations, and more have been proven to create barriers to, and in some instances the denial of, citizens their right to vote.” Election administrators in the four states voting on Tuesday have been scrambling to minimize risk to voters and poll workers. Polling sites in high-risk places like nursing homes have been moved, and officials are instructing poll workers to routinely clean and disinfect voting areas. Voters have also been strongly encouraged to take advantage of early and mail-in voting as much as possible. However, early, mail, and absentee voting laws vary widely state-by-state. Some states — like Washington, which voted earlier this week — allow for expansive mail voting, limiting the amount of disruption the outbreak can cause for an election. But others only allow absentee votes with a valid excuse and have limited (or no) early voting, adding a barrier for some voters that likely cannot be lifted without legislative action from state lawmakers or executives. Elected officials and activists have started pushing for states to have more expansive absentee and mail-in voting in later primary states and for the general election, as fears over the long term effects of the virus’ spread builds.

"President Donald Trump assured Americans on Wednesday the deadly coronavirus was on the brink of disappearing. Two days later, he admitted it wasn’t. In the span of 48 hours this week, from the moment markets plunged after a confusing and stiff Oval Office address to his national emergency declaration from the Rose Garden, Trump watched his own assessment of the viral outbreak transform in extraordinary fashion, forcing him into a course correction. The unprecedented shutdown of the world’s largest economy — a nation of 330 million people — will mark the most consequential stretch of Trump’s presidency and transform how Americans think about their government. For Trump himself, the journey appeared to represent a recognition that his earlier path threatened to engulf a nation he oversees with a spreading pandemic and diminish hope for reelection this fall. Trump’s do-over approach — he unlocked $50 billion in government funding on Friday to address the growing crisis and threw his support behind House Democrats’ aid package hours later — followed weeks of the president shrugging off the coronavirus threat and making statements about the availability of tests, the severity of the virus and the development of a COVID-19 vaccine that his own officials had to correct, sometimes within minutes of being made. During a visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Trump said the virus “will go away” and said his response was “really working out.” Instead, the forecast grew worse. State and local leaders, business executives and tens of millions of ordinary Americans leapfrogged their president — without waiting for White House guidance — to shut down public spaces, schools, offices and other gathering spaces and encourage millions of Americans to hunker down for a fast-spreading, invisible threat. Even as the stock market rebounded Friday in response to Trump’s release of emergency funding, the week ended with a mystery about whether America’s 73-year-old commander-in-chief, who has downplayed concerns about a virus that disproportionately impacts the elderly, could potentially be the world’s highest-ranking vector. During a rare appearance in the White House briefing room on Saturday, donning a “USA” ball cap, Trump said he was tested Friday night for COVID-19, and has started receiving temperature checks. The news came hours after a top Brazilian official at Mar-a-Lago last weekend — who dined with the president and many of his top aides — tested positive for the virus. (The White House physician said late Saturday that Trump’s test was negative.) The White House began administering temperature checks this weekend to “any individuals who are in close contact” with Trump or Pence, a spokesman said. This included members of the press corps who were stopped by a staff physician at the entrance to the James S. Brady briefing room Saturday afternoon. “SOCIAL DISTANCING!” Trump tweeted prior to the news conference and one day after he was seen repeatedly shaking hands with corporate CEOs and health officials during his televised remarks from the Rose Garden.  Rebuffing the precautionary isolation measures his own aides were taking, Trump will now spend the weekend sifting through options with White House staff — some of whom are fresh off self-quarantines — about the mechanics of a bailout for industries devastated financially by the virus outbreak. White House aides headed into the complex early Saturday morning for the next round of urgent discussions, a recognition of the tight timeline they’re facing to rescue key sectors of the economy such as transportation and tourism. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are assembling a list of options for Trump to consider as he looks to rescue crumbling industries and protect their workforces, according to two senior administration officials.  At Saturday’s briefing, Mnuchin specifically cited the airlines, cruise ships and hotels as industries that have faced significant challenges from the abrupt crash in global travel and tourism.  Trump’s desire to leap to the assistance of certain industries stems in part from witnessing an upward swing in U.S. markets after he designated the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency on Friday. The declaration had been in the works already, but was pushed up amid historic volatility in financial markets — much of which stemmed from an Oval Office address Wednesday night in which Trump stated he was banning all travel and imports from Europe, which the administration had to later clarify did not block all products and included only the 26-member countries of the unrestricted travel Schengen zone. (The ban will be extended to the U.K. and Ireland, which aren’t members of Schengen.) Trump also claimed insurers would cover the full cost of testing and treatment — generating alarm from health plans that never agreed to waive all patient costs. Outside the White House, many of the president’s political allies viewed Wednesday’s Oval Office address as a speech that quickly needed a do-over. Staring directly into a camera while seated with his hands crossed was not the best format for the president, Trump’s own aides later admitted.  The crushing response on Thursday prompted the White House to schedule Friday’s press conference in the Rose Garden, a favorite venue of the president thanks to its natural lighting and the more free-wheeling format of a back-and-forth press conference, according to two White House officials familiar with the matter.  The president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — among the few officials to maintain the president’s trust throughout his term — also became much more deeply involved in the coronavirus response efforts later in the week as it became clear the White House needed a more forceful response, a senior administration official said.  Internally, aides started to blame officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for flawed testing kits and the amount of time it took to get results back. The administration’s internal criticism of the CDC has made the agency the latest scapegoat as Trump’s team sought to deflect blame and cushion the president from what could become devastating political blowback against the president and his party in the coming months. Morale inside the White House bottomed out on Friday, said a third senior administration official, but turned a corner once the Food and Drug Administration approved a new COVID-19 detection test from the pharmaceutical company Roche as part of an emergency authorization. “They reached the conclusion this week that they had to communicate a sense of seriousness about what was going on and had to reassure the country that they were taking it very seriously,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who remains a close ally of Trump. “Having major companies like Wal-Mart, CVS, etc. involved means suddenly you begin to see how you can move to scale for a country for our size.” The Friday Rose Garden speech, where Trump announced a public-private partnership on testing and the immediate opening of emergency operation centers across the U.S., also helped propel a stock market surge in the final hour of trading. One official later bragged the speech alone caused the “biggest market jump ever.” Trump has repeatedly boasted about the stock market’s rebound after the S&P 500 recorded its best single-day performance since 2008 on Friday — a 9% gain, reversing a Thursday plunge that marked the worst day since 1987’s “Black Monday” crash. On Saturday, an unusually jovial Trump said he was “honored” to see positive movement in the markets following his news conference the day before — even joking that he should up the volume of his public appearances to further boost investor confidence.  “I think we should do one of them every day perhaps. Maybe five times per day. That was something to watch,” he said.  But not every element of the president’s course correction has gone smoothly.  Representatives from Google said they were caught off guard on Friday when Trump said the tech company was “helping to develop a website … to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location” for Americans who suspect they may have contracted the coronavirus. In a statement shared on Twitter from Verily, a subsidiary of Google, the company said it is still “developing a tool to help triage individuals for COVID-19 testing” that would initially only be available in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Elsewhere in his remarks, Trump disavowed involvement in disbanding a pandemic unit within the White House National Security Council and about the travel restrictions he has imposed on European countries. The president, more than three years into a presidency in which he has eagerly ejected pre-Trump officials, also blamed the Obama administration for testing shortages in the U.S. that have undermined containment efforts and sowed chaos at some hospitals. “I don’t take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time,” Trump told reporters, while complaining that his predecessor “didn’t do testing” during the 2009 swine flu outbreak. (In fact, diagnostic kits shipped just weeks after the CDC identified the first case of the virus in April 2009.) Indeed, blaming his predecessors for troubles with his own administration's handling of the current pandemic has become a common tactic of late. He accused former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary, on Thursday of overseeing “one of the worst [responses] on record” to a nationwide health epidemic, in reference to that H1N1 outbreak during Obama’s first year in office.  Trump also claimed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been working with top Trump aides this week on an emergency aid package, was “trying to create a panic” when his administration faced criticism in late February about its slow response to the coronavirus outbreak.  He blamed Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell for contributing to the economic pullback by refusing to cut interest rates — despite historic action by the central bank this week to combat chaos in financial markets and an emergency rate cut last week.  As economic relief legislation stalled in the House on Friday, Trump said it was congressional Democrats’ fault because “all of a sudden they didn’t agree to certain things that they agreed to.”  “He has never accepted blame for things that have gone wrong under his watch. Why would he do so now?” said one Republican close to the White House, who claimed the tactic “has worked in the past” for the president.  Although White House aides felt confident about Trump’s message on Friday about testing and the stimulus package passed by the House early Saturday, aides also acknowledged that the next step in rescuing the economy — deciding which industries to bail out — will be much harder politically.  The potential cost of an industry bailout could upset Republican lawmakers who have grumbled for years about the ballooning national debt under their watch after fighting the Obama administration over even smaller deficits and debt levels.  “It quickly devolves into industry vs. industry and parochial stuff,” said one former senior administration official. Trump also remains intent on pushing for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year, continuing to drop it into his public remarks.  “If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!” he tweeted on Friday.  Democrats and Senate Republicans have been cool to that idea, in part because of the eye-popping price tag ($950 billion according to one estimate) and concerns among economists about whether it would be effective in preventing a severe economic downturn. As the president entered the weekend, however, he appeared intent on striking a more unifying tone. Before meeting with members of the coronavirus task force at the White House, Trump commended the “good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats” that led to the House’s passage of a bill that will expand paid emergency leave and provide tax credits for workers and employers affected by the coronavirus crisis. The legislation also includes $1 billion in food aid for low-income Americans.  “People really pulled together. Nice to see!” Trump tweeted. He even praised the media — whom he accused last week of trying to “inflame the CoronaVirus situation far beyond what the facts would warrant” — for recent coverage of his administration’s response to the crisis. “Over the past 24 hours, I think the representation has been very fair. It’s been very fair,” Trump told reporters on Saturday.",From complacency to emergency: How Trump changed course on coronavirus ,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/how-trump-changed-course-on-coronavirus-129528,politico
"Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday that he still plans to offer more details about a planned website to help screen people for coronavirus symptoms — a day after President Donald Trump's description of it as a massive Google project appeared to surprise even the company. ""Tomorrow, 5 o'clock, we'll have a very specific description tomorrow about when the website will be available,"" Pence told reporters at a White House news conference, adding that he thought the site would be available Monday. ""As we expand testing across the country, we want people to be able to go to a website,"" Pence added in response to a later question. ""There will be a questionnaire there to determine whether or not a test is in order, because we want to make sure that people are being tested that have the symptoms."" Trump had announced the project during a Rose Garden address Friday afternoon, saying that for people who may have coronavirus symptoms, the website will help ""determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location."" Trump added that ""we have many, many locations. ... We cover this country and large parts of the world."" But later on Friday, Google tweeted a statement from its life sciences affiliate, Verily, that described the project as having a more modest scope, at least initially. ""Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time,"" said the company, which is owned by Google's parent, Alphabet. Google appeared to walk that back Saturday night by posting a Twitter thread much more consistent with the White House's description: ""Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information,"" it wrote, adding that this was in addition to ""Work being done by our sister company Verily to launch a pilot website that will enable individuals to do a risk assessment and be scheduled for testing at sites in the Bay Area."" Google was also taking steps such as ""[p]romoting authoritative information through Google Search and YouTube"" and weeding out ""phishing, conspiracy theories, malware and misinformation."" Neither Google and Verily responded to attempts to reconcile their various statements with the administration's accounts. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said Saturday that the site will incorporate ""everything they have learned about symptoms and screening"" for the virus. ""It's not just a simple checkbox website,"" she said. ""It's actually going to go through critical symptoms, and that's why we're giving ourselves the weekend to get it put up."" Friday's announcement instantly raised red flags among patient privacy groups, which have pushed for greater scrutiny of Google’s use of health data. Google recently came under fire over a deal with Ascension Health that grants the tech giant access to millions of patients' identifiable medical information. While Google contends the deal complies with federal privacy protections for health data, a Wall Street Journal report on the deal triggered an investigation by the HHS civil rights office and landed the company in the crosshairs of congressional privacy hawks. “It sounds like @Google just figured out how to get the personal health data of every single American,” tweeted Kyle Plotkin, chief of staff for Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), after Trump made the announcement. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) have demanded answers from Google and Ascension. Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said it’s critical for consumer privacy that Google doesn’t gather any personally identifiable information from the coronavirus website, and that it shouldn’t keep IP addresses or use any other “covert tracking techniques.” The White House has sought the tech industry's help bolstering its response to the expanding outbreak. U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios held a conference call Wednesday with representatives from large tech firms, including Google, Facebook and Amazon, to discuss their efforts to combat coronavirus-related online misinformation and ways artificial intelligence could be used to analyze medical research on the virus. “Cutting-edge technology companies and major online platforms will play a critical role in this all-hands-on-deck effort,” Kratsios said in a statement after the call. “Today’s meeting outlined an initial path forward and we intend to continue this important conversation.” Mohana Ravindranath, Darius Tahir and Steven Overly contributed to this report.",Pence promises more details on virus screening website,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/pence-coronavirus-website-129530,politico
"The White House is expanding its travel ban to passengers from the United Kingdom and Ireland in an attempt to stem the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S., a further expansion of restrictions on air travel that haven’t been seen since Sept. 11, 2001. The administration had previously banned foreign nationals from flying into the United States from the 26 countries in the Schengen Area free movement zone, but not the U.K. and Ireland, despite the existence of the coronavirus in those countries. The ban on travel from other parts of Europe began at midnight on Saturday, White House officials said at a press conference on Saturday. The ban on the two new countries will be implemented at midnight Monday night, Eastern Daylight Time. Trump spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday, according to a readout released by the White House.  The move is sure to push airlines further into crisis after they have been struggling financially for weeks amid a steep slump in passenger demand. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said economic aid could soon be coming for airlines and cruise lines after Congress passed two pieces of coronavirus relief legislation that didn’t include provisions for those industries. ""We have a lot more we need to do with Congress, and the speaker and I have acknowledged that we will be working starting immediately,” Mnuchin said. “The airlines industry in particular, no different than after 9/11, has a very unique circumstances — the cruise industry, the hotel industry. I would say we’ve got a lot more work to do.” Airlines are already struggling with massive losses, with some carriers having more canceled flights than new bookings for April and May. Delta Air Lines announced Friday that it is slashing 40 percent of its flight capacity, a massive cut. The reduction in flights is the steepest in Delta's history, including the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks. A senior TSA official said Saturday that there has been a ""significant"" drop in the number of both domestic and international air travelers. ""This can be as much as 30 percent — some locations, higher,"" the official said. However, the White House and airlines have been in discussions about the impact the coronavirus is having on their businesses, and what aid might be needed. Nothing has been finalized or made public, but those discussions, for now, appear to be centered around letting airlines keep some of the excise taxes passengers pay as part of the price of a ticket. However, one of those charges typically is funneled to airports to help pay for capital improvements, and airports, themselves looking at billions in losses as travel continues to slump, are likely to fight such a change. Similarly, one of the taxes — about 7.5 percent of the cost of an airline ticket — is used to help pay to run the Federal Aviation Administration, which Congress may not endorse if it is waived for anything longer than a few months. The European travel ban does not apply to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents or their family members, but they will be directed to one of 13 airports with enhanced screening procedures in place. Some domestic travel restrictions may also be under consideration. When asked Saturday whether he was “considering other travel restrictions, perhaps domestically,“ President Donald Trump answered: “Specifically from certain areas, yes we are, and we’re working with the states and we’re considering other restrictions.”  On a call with reporters later Saturday, a senior DHS official said domestic travel restrictions weren't expected ""at this time."" Though the administration has been intensely focused on reducing flights from coronavirus-exposed countries, there are indications that health screenings for international travelers arriving at U.S. airports have been spotty. Passengers returning from coronavirus hotspots around the globe have reported that despite coming straight from countries with rampant coronavirus outbreaks, Customs and Border Protection officers and health officers in U.S. airports did not ask them questions about their travel histories, take their temperatures or check them for coronavirus symptoms.

"President Donald Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, the White House physician said Saturday evening after the president held a press briefing on the administration's latest moves to combat the outbreak. The president consented to a test Friday night, Navy Cdr. Sean Conley said in a statement, and he remains symptom-free one week after dining with a Brazilian government delegation, some of whose members have tested positive for the illness, at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The statement did not say if Trump will be re-tested. Trump said that he has been tested for coronavirus after being questioned about it during a Rose Garden address on Friday. “I also took the test last night,"" Trump said during the White House briefing. ""And I decided I should, based on the press conference yesterday. People were asking, 'Did I take the test?'"" Asked when test results would be returned, he said: ""A day, two days. They send it to a lab."" Trump also touted the bipartisan congressional funding package passed early Saturday and the rise in the stock markets following his Rose Garden address. ""I was honored to see that the stock market, you were mostly there with us, set a record in a short period of time, over 45-minute period that we had the press conference yesterday in the rose garden,"" Trump said. ""That was a record. All-time record. I think we should do one of them every day perhaps. How about five times a day? We'll do one five times a day."" He also announced that the White House is expanding its travel ban to passengers from the United Kingdom and Ireland, also hinting that relief for the airline and cruise industry would be coming soon. The president was joined at the press event by Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Housing Secretary Ben Carson and health officials, including Seema Verma, Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, who have been leading the administration's response to the outbreak. Not present was Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, whose standing has been diminished in the wake of the outbreak.  ""Secretary Azar was at the coronavirus task force meeting this morning. He's back to work, and we will have a changing round-up of these presentations so we can get quickly to your questions,"" Pence said in response to a question about the absence of the administration's top health official. ""But secretary Azar is doing a remarkable job, and working seven days a week for the American people and making a difference."" The vice president, pressed on the messaging discrepancies from the White House around whether Trump needed to get tested, told reporters he’d consult with the White House physician on getting a diagnostic himself after today’s briefing. “Mrs. Pence and I will be more than happy to get tested,” he said, after stating that the physician on Friday night had said Pence and his wife didn’t have the “symptoms or contacts that would necessitate testing.” He also said he’d had his temperature checked earlier. White House staff barred at least one person from the press briefing room after checking the temperatures of journalists who gathered for the event Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel experienced a fever and flu-like conditions Friday evening and went to a Michigan hospital for treatment, according to the RNC. She is self-quarantining at home with her family. The president has been criticized for repeatedly shaking hands in public and on camera despite the advice of public health officials to refrain from the practice.  At the press briefing, he defended his actions but also said that ""getting away from shaking hands is a good thing."" Late Friday, press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a memo from Conley saying Trump had dined at Mar-a-Lago with a person who has since tested positive for coronavirus. Conley did not recommend testing the president as a necessity. Conley on Saturday said he had been in touch with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House Coronavirus Task Force and that his office is “encouraging the implementation of all their best practices.” Earlier Saturday, Trump hailed the bipartisan deal on a congressional coronavirus funding package on Twitter, adding that he'd attended a series of coronavirus-related meetings in the White House that morning.  He also tweeted: ""SOCIAL DISTANCING!"" As of Saturday, the U.S. had reached 50 reported coronavirus-related deaths and over 2,200 confirmed cases. Despite Trump’s announcement that’s he’s been tested, health officials at Saturday’s press conference urged Americans to begin isolating themselves instead of rushing to get tested if they’re not experiencing symptoms.  Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator said said Quest and LabCorp — two private labs currently running diagnostics — are reporting 98 percent to 99 percent of their tests are coming back negative for coronavirus.  Though early missteps have prevented widespread testing necessary to track the spread of the virus and isolate sick individuals, Birx and other administration health officials said they were optimistic about the steps the administration is taking to ramp up testing. The administration on Friday announced steps that would allow some labs that have been processing tens or hundreds of samples a day to instead handle thousands. The U.S. tested about 11,000 people during the first seven weeks of the outbreak — roughly as many as South Korea can test in a day. Pence said the administration would release more details at a briefing Sunday evening on progress in the effort to expand testing. Health officials Saturday said they were optimistic that the new measures will allow the U.S. to begin understanding how the disease is spreading. “Now it's all systems go,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “As we get knowledge about new testing, we'll alleviate the anxiety that we have in the world about, we don't know what's going on.” “Now it's all systems go,” Fauci said. “Let's look forward.” Alex Isenstadt contributed to this report."," Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, White House physician says",2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-test-129444,politico

"The nation's top doctor on Saturday urged a widespread halt of hospital elective procedures amid mounting concern that the health system doesn't have enough beds to manage a potential surge of coronavirus cases. ""Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!"" U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted this morning.  He warned that every elective surgery could spread coronavirus within the facility, use up protective medical gear as public officials worry about shortages and burden a hospital workforce who ""may be needed"" to respond to COVID-19. Adams was responding to new recommendations from the American College of Surgeons issued Friday. The group said hospitals, health systems and surgeons should ""thoughtfully review"" all their scheduled operations and consider canceling or postponing them ""until we have passed the predicted inflection point"" in the disease spread and ""can be confident that our health care infrastructure can support a potentially rapid and overwhelming uptick in critical patient care needs.""

"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency to combat the coronavirus — but he could go much further if he wanted.  Federal law gives Trump vast emergency powers in times of pandemic. He could direct the quarantine of people arriving in the United States who exhibit certain symptoms or even if they’re just suspected of having the virus. He could have the federal government detain individuals if their illness might wind up crossing state lines. And under regulations revised and reissued just before Trump entered office, the government can stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease. Some even interpret the statute as meaning a president could deploy the military to cordon off a city or state.  “The federal public health power is pretty awesome … awe-inspiring in its breadth,” said Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University. “But there’s also obviously a lot of danger.” Indeed, it’s an extraordinary palette of options for a president often mocked as enamored of dictatorial authority and who has claimed, “I have the right to do whatever I want, as president.” And many of these powers remain largely undefined, as they have rarely — if ever — been widely used. It’s a troubling concept for those who are pressing Trump to take more urgent action to combat the coronavirus as it infiltrates American cities, but are wary that he will go too far.  “We can’t divorce this from the context of a president who has shown a willingness to abuse emergency power,” said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.  The conflict was on display Friday as Trump declared a national emergency to unlock funding and bypass regulations to accelerate the lagging development of coronavirus testing options. While even some of Trump’s most ardent opponents praised the move, they were anxious about what might come next. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. Fresh discussion of Trump’s power to isolate regions of the U.S. was spurred Thursday by his comments in response to a question about whether he was considering travel restrictions to the states experiencing some of the most widespread infections, such as Washington and California. “We haven’t discussed that yet. Is it a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,” the president said during an Oval Office photo-op with the Irish prime minister. While experts say such measures would be ineffective — diverting resources better devoted to scaling up hospitals and aiding people in dire straits due to other impacts of the virus — they might be legally possible. Under the Public Health Service Act, federal authorities can quarantine individuals arriving in the U.S. by air, land or ship if they are suspected of infection with a list of diseases and syndromes set by executive order. The law also gives federal officials the power to try to check the spread of disease between states, although this authority is almost never used to fight human illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control, however, maintains that its quarantine powers go quite far. Regulations finalized by the Obama administration claim that federal officials can detain individuals if their illness could spread to other states. The rules essentially give the federal government the authority to stop and seize commuters in a bid to halt the spread of contagious disease. Whether it could allow a president to use the military to cordon off a city or a whole state is less clear, but experts say that the statutes and regulations could be read to allow for that. “The ability to restrain interstate travel is something that could be done, but the question is would it be done?” said Jennifer Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “These are the kinds of scenarios that you think would never happen but here we are.” But in this situation, Nuzzo said, it’s too late for that extreme measure. “There would be no public health benefit,” said Nuzzo, who studies government responses to health crises. “Over 40 states are reporting cases. … The horse is out of the barn. The disease is already here.” On Friday, Trump invoked his first significant emergency power since the coronavirus first appeared in January, declaring a national emergency.  In its declaration, the White House cited two laws — the 1988 Stafford Act, a disaster relief law, and the 1976 National Emergencies Act, the law Trump used to divert government funds to build a southern border wall.  For days, though, Trump had balked at exercising the power, even as he faced a chorus of calls from health groups, disaster relief specialists and Democrats to do so. According to people familiar with the situation, Trump had been reluctant to take the step because it could undermine his contention that the coronavirus outbreak is similar to seasonal flu. But he insisted on Thursday that he was more than willing to invoke any of his emergency authorities. “We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act. … And if I need to do something, I'll do it,” he said, adding cryptically, “I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.”  Trump has not previously been bashful about exercising his emergency powers. He was only seven days into his tenure when he issued the hugely controversial travel ban, sharply restricting the flow of people to the U.S. from mostly-Muslim countries. A series of court rulings blocked enforcement of the original ban, prompting the administration to redraft the order several times. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld a substantially pared-back version of the initial order. The policy — which critics called a “Muslim ban” — was based on the same legal authority Trump has since used to exclude foreign travelers from China and, now, from much of Europe, in response to the current virus. Many White House statements about the new virus-related travel restrictions go out of their way to explicitly cite the precise legal authority tapped in both instances, giving the president the power to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” The mentions seem to echo arguments the Justice Department made in the “Muslim ban” case. Lawyers repeatedly warned judges to be wary about restricting the power because it may be needed in a crisis.  Perhaps Trump’s most aggressive executive actions have involved money, namely his moves to spend billions of dollars on construction of a border wall with Mexico despite Congress’s unwillingness to fund that project — a signature of his 2016 campaign — at anywhere near the levels he has sought. Trump’s lawyers have cited powers Congress gave the president to reallocate military construction funds and to tap other funds for counter-drug activities.  Lower courts halted more than $6 billion of the funding, questioning Trump’s claims of an emergency and noting Congress’s rather explicit refusal to fund expansion of the wall. But the Supreme Court stepped in last year to allow Trump to proceed with the spending as litigation continues. Historically, officials at the state and local level have taken the most aggressive measures to address public health emergencies. In 1899 and 1900, officials in Honolulu and San Francisco cordoned off those cities’ Chinatown districts in a bid to control the bubonic plague, a move now viewed as heavily tainted by racism. Authorities in Hawaii even lit one home on fire in order to try to squelch the disease, but in the process burned down much of the neighborhood. Nothing similar has happened yet in the U.S. during the coronavirus outbreak, although governors are increasingly flexing their legal muscle.  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Thursday ordered the closure of all public schools in the state for two weeks. On the same day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued an executive order directing residents to eschew non-essential gatherings of more than 250 people. Newsom also tapped the state’s power to “commandeer” hotels, if needed, as temporary hospitals or quarantine centers.  And in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared a “containment zone” in New Rochelle, N.Y., to combat a virulent cluster of corona cases there. He even called out the national guard to assist with food distribution and other logistics in the city. Trump weighed in on the move at his photo-op Thursday, noting it isn’t a flat-out ban on movement or work. While he called the action “not very strong,” he seemed to welcome the fact that it would give locals the feeling “they’re being watched.” Some of the more severe travel limits the federal government can impose are quietly wielded in individual cases.  The CDC maintains a little publicized “do-not-board” list for domestic and international airline travel. Details on the list are thin, but it has included people with tuberculosis and measles. In 2015, CDC formally declared that individuals could be added to the list if they were suspected simply of being exposed to hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola. Back in 2007, an Atlanta lawyer drew national attention when he flew to Paris to get married and returned to the U.S. while suffering from drug-resistant tuberculosis. Doctors said they told him not to travel, but he insisted they never told him he could be contagious. He was eventually put under a federal quarantine order, but it turned out his disease was not the type most resistant to treatment. Typically, however, federal officials have relied on state and local health departments to address most disease outbreaks, even sometimes asking them to detain individuals who refuse to cooperate with doctors’ recommendations. But Trump has hostile relationships with the Democratic governors of the most affected states — Washington, California and New York. And if he wanted, he could have the CDC step in. Federal regulations give the CDC sweeping powers if a state’s measures “are insufficient” to prevent a disease from spreading into another state. The CDC chief is authorized to do what he or she “deems reasonably necessary” under those circumstances. Whether that includes widespread restrictions on movement is unclear. Parmet, the Northeastern University law professor, stresses that the Constitution still applies. Aggressive federal government action on such vague authority could face legal challenges, especially if the moves don’t have a scientific basis.  On the other hand, in a crisis judges tend to defer to executive authorities, including health officials. “The real danger is that these moves are taken just for show,” Parmet said. “At this point, where we are in the curve of this pandemic, there’s no magical legal elixir.”",What more could he do?

"Scott Gottlieb left the Trump administration nearly a year ago — but from Twitter to TV, he’s become the face of truth-telling about the coronavirus pandemic. The 47-year-old former Food and Drug Administration commissioner is providing blunt reality checks on talk shows and in congressional chambers, where his warnings about undetected outbreaks and testing delays starkly contrast with current administration officials’ assurances that the risk from the fast-spreading virus remains very low. “And all I say is, ‘Be calm.’ We have the greatest people in the world,” President Donald Trump told reporters on March 6 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “You never really know when something like this is going to strike and what it’s going to be.” Gottlieb had a different take. “People will suffer and die. The most vulnerable are at greatest risk,” Gottlieb tweeted the next morning. “We must all work together to protect them. The next few months will be hard, but we will preserve life, and eventually conquer this pathogen.” Gottlieb’s hard truths were finally embraced on Thursday morning by the president, who retweeted a series of Gottlieb’s warnings hours after Trump’s prime-time coronavirus address was widely panned. “We need to sacrifice some of the trappings of normal life to reduce the scope and severity of what’s ahead,” Gottlieb wrote — and Trump retweeted — in a series of tweets that also took shots at the ""void left by policy makers.” Gottlieb’s emergence has made him the rare Trump administration insider who’s found ways to critique his old colleagues’ decisions from outside while still maintaining respect in Trump's inner circle. In some ways his plain-spoken warnings mirror those of Anthony Fauci, the 79-year-old NIH infectious disease expert who’s become a mainstay at congressional and White House task force briefings even as he contradicts the president’s reassurances or optimistic timelines. Widespread mistrust of the administration’s take on the coronavirus has enhanced the role of an outsider like Gottlieb. And his ubiquity has made his estimates even more valued. Some have pointed to a coronavirus testing tracker that Gottlieb and the free market American Enterprise Institute established this week to estimate how many people could be tested for the infection each day — an initiative that aggravated some government health officials, despite Trump’s retweets. Gottlieb also suggested that health systems could run coronavirus tests on a high-volume platform developed by drug giant Roche weeks before the administration authorized the strategy on Friday. The Monday morning quarterbacking, especially around early testing stumbles, has particularly ruffled some feathers in the health department, where HHS Secretary Alex Azar is already dealing with criticism from White House officials — and where current FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has been virtually invisible on television during the crisis. “I don’t know what his endgame is,” said one official, criticizing Gottlieb’s high profile, arguing that some of it’s come at the expense of his successor. “What’s he trying to prove, and why does he keep stepping on Hahn?” Some officials also grumbled after Gottlieb penned Wall Street Journal editorials about preparedness in January and early February, claiming that his warnings about silent coronavirus spread were too alarmist — even if they’ve turned out to be true. It’s set up the media-savvy former FDA chief — who remains in frequent conversation with the White House and won as much bipartisan support as any Trump appointee while in office — for inevitable run-ins with current health officials who don’t have the latitude to make the same kind of policy pronouncements. “He can say things that maybe the government would like to say because he has an authority,” said a source close to HHS. But at the end of the day: “They are making decisions that are going to affect 350 million Americans. He’s not.” Others on the inside of the coronavirus battle say Gottlieb has been indispensable to the White House and Pence in particular on response strategy. They say consternation is rooted in Azar’s insecurity about his role and concerns that he could be undercut by Gottlieb, who had been rumored as a shortlist pick for a so-called coronavirus czar. “I think good leaders want to bring the strongest, smartest minds in and surround themselves,” said one administration official. “But that’s not what they’re doing [at HHS].” A source close to Azar disputed that characterization and frustration with Gottlieb, and the idea Azar that has been sidelined.  Gottlieb was seen at the White House ahead of Trump's emergency declaration on the coronavirus pandemic, according to a source, and he later praised Trump's Rose Garden event. Gottlieb declined to comment for this story. He now divides his time between a fellowship at the American Enterprise Institute, serving on a handful of drug company boards and a career as a talking head who has the rare ability to explain complicated science in a way ordinary people can understand. Some of that has been to the administration’s adversaries on Capitol Hill. The libertarian doctor’s activist agenda as FDA chief, on everything from e-cigarettes to nutrition, often put him at odds with the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory approach. But Gottlieb sold his proposals well — and left the administration on rare good footing with the White House and lawmakers from both parties in Congress. “You do have big shoes to fill,” Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.) told Hahn, Gottlieb’s successor, at a House hearing Wednesday where Democrats grilled him on the flawed White House response to the coronavirus. Just one day earlier, Gottlieb gave his take on the state of the outbreak to Pocan and the rest of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at their invitation. “We don’t have a whole lot of, honestly, Trump appointees, American Enterprise Institute employees, come by to brief the Progressive Caucus. But he got it because we respect him so much,” Pocan told Hahn. Meanwhile, HHS has said it doesn’t know how many tests have been done, and the CDC has dropped its own count from its website. Instead, the administration has been updating how many tests have been shipped to labs, not how fast the troubled testing program can turn them around. Azar said the CDC is working to get its own testing tracker up. Gottlieb also has stepped into a void around Hahn, who has kept a low profile throughout the crisis — posting relatively few coronavirus tweets, making no appearances on prime-time TV programs, and waiting a month before the White House even added him to its coronavirus task force. And when asked about the testing numbers his predecessor is projecting, Hahn said it’s complicated. “I would want to get you the most accurate information possible,” he told lawmakers. Hahn, a cancer doctor and health system administrator, is constrained in ways that Gottlieb is not, allies argue. Two administration officials said that early testing delays were rooted in Azar’s decision early on to leave Hahn off the coronavirus task force, where he could have coordinated more easily with CDC Director Robert Redfield to let private labs roll out their own tests. “He wasn’t given the opportunity to be involved and that’s what created the problems,” said one administration official. Hahn was eventually brought on the task force, along with Surgeon General Jerome Adams and CMS Administrator Seema Verma, after Vice President Mike Pence was tapped to take the lead. An HHS spokesperson said Hahn has been involved in briefing Azar and others from the very beginning and Azar is pleased he is part of the task force. “We are and have been focused on addressing this public health emergency, and not who was appointed to the task force or when,” Hahn said in a statement to POLITICO. Yet what looked like early stumbles and confusion among administration officials has driven frustration among lawmakers — and now they are turning to Gottlieb. “I just feel that there's been such confusion and miscommunication at the presidential level that we're constantly playing catch-up,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) whose state has reported at least nine cases of coronavirus. “Even though he's on the conservative side, you know the ideas that he's pushing forward are important and they've been smart,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who attended Gottlieb’s closed-door briefing with progressive members and whose state has become the U.S. epicenter of the outbreak. “His deep-seated interest in public health issues is genuine, it’s who he was before. It’s just getting more attention, it’s magnified now,” said a former HHS official. “What’s the long game? He’s going to keep writing op-eds.” Adam Cancryn contributed to this report.",The shadow coronavirus czar,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/shadow-coronavirus-czar-scott-gottlieb-129563,politico
"Virtually the entire Democratic presidential primary has been predicated on one underlying assumption: the eventual collapse of Joe Biden. More than a dozen of his erstwhile opponents bet their campaigns on it, and he’s proven them all wrong. But his last serious opponent standing, Bernie Sanders, is still clinging to the same belief — and that it will finally happen on Sunday night, under the bright lights of their one-on-one debate. To revive his campaign, Sanders needs to prove he’s the best candidate to take on President Donald Trump and lead the country at a time of duress, his aides and allies say. But they also acknowledge privately it’s going to take more than that — namely, for the gaffe-prone Biden to stumble. “In the best-case scenario, Bernie dominates the debate and the arguments. He has one or two good one-liners,” said Mark Longabaugh, a former senior adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign. “And obviously the flip side would be Biden has a lackluster debate and maybe makes a mistake. All that coming together maybe causes some pause and hesitation on the part of voters.” It’s a tall order: Biden has won 14 of the 20 states that have voted this month, and he’s polling about 20 to 40 percentage points ahead of Sanders in the states that cast ballots on Tuesday. To make matters worse for Sanders, Tuesday was going to be difficult for him even in the best-case scenario: Its biggest delegate prize is Florida, home to many older, moderate Democrats and Cuban exiles who eschew his left-wing politics. It is also a closed primary where only Democrats can vote, and Sanders typically performs better in races where independents can participate. The reality of the situation isn’t lost on Sanders’ aides. “We’re not naïve,” said Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ campaign manager. “It’s going to be a hard path.” During an all-staff call Thursday evening, Sanders’ national organizing and field director, Misty Rebik, admitted to the team that it was facing an uphill battle — but it has always been that way, she tried to assure them. Sanders himself has appeared less confident on the campaign trail in the last few weeks, even looking downcast at a round-table with workers in Michigan, which is the type of event where he usually seems most upbeat. At the same time, Sanders’ staffers truly believe the trajectory of the race could change — that the campaign that somehow found itself in a stronger position after Sanders suffered a heart attack last fall could have another improbable comeback. They argue that the primary has been volatile, and that Biden himself trailed in the first three primary and caucus states before leapfrogging to frontrunner. They also point out that former presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar have surged in polls after strong performance debate performances. “I don’t know if you’ve seen Joe Biden lately, but he doesn’t like to be told he’s wrong,” said a Sanders adviser. “We’re going to take him on around the issues and make him defend his record. He’s deflected on those in earlier debates because there’s so much chatter happening on the stage. But when you’re one-on-one, you change the dynamic.” It’s unclear how aggressive Sanders will be with Biden. Some of Sanders’ staffers and supporters have been frustrated by what they see as his light touch with his former Senate colleague, whom Sanders likes and considers a friend. Even with Hillary Clinton, Sanders often lacked a killer instinct, famously telling her in a 2015 debate that “the American people are sick and tired about hearing about your damn emails!” Sanders, who doesn’t practice in mock debates while readying for showdowns, did not change his strategy during debate prep last week. “I know it’s shocking for you to hear that Bernie Sanders remained consistent in his approach,” joked Shakir. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group closely aligned with Elizabeth Warren, urged Sanders to stay in the race to debate the former vice president and prevent a “quick Biden coronation.” Given that Sanders this week laid out several questions he plans to ask Biden during the debate, Green doesn’t “expect Bernie to attempt a knockout punch like Elizabeth Warren did to Michael Bloomberg.” But, he added, “In this new coronavirus world, he has a very legitimate case that Democrats defeat Trump if we stand for universal free health care, paid sick leave, student debt cancellation, and a government that actually works for people. If he presses Biden in good faith to agree, he both makes Biden more electable and proves himself more electable — a win-win that lessens objections to him staying in the race this month."" In the Sanders campaign’s ideal world, aides said, he would win the debate, which would give him enough momentum to carry at least one of the four states voting on Tuesday. His aides see Arizona — partly because he has performed strongly among Latino voters — and Illinois as the best possibilities. In their view, that could change the narrative about Sanders’ campaign being all but done, and allow them to potentially win states voting later this primary, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and New York. To gain steam, ""you have to do it by initially suggesting the storyline was wrong about Bernie"" being finished, said Shakir. “Right now, I’m not sure that anyone — correct me if I’m wrong — is suggesting that we will win in any of those four states. Hopefully we can turn that around.” Another reason the Sunday debate looms so large in the Sanders team’s mind is because his aides believe that voters who have seen Biden up close in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire have not supported him. A Biden adviser said of that notion, ""South Carolinians have seen Joe Biden up close for decades. They chose him overwhelmingly."" For Sanders, the debate is also an opportunity to nudge Biden to the left, a familiar position for the politician who successfully pulled Clinton in his direction during his unsuccessful 2016 bid. Sanders sees the coronavirus outbreak as a red flag that America’s health care system is dysfunctional, and that the country needs “Medicare for All” and other liberal policies. “There are 28 million people who are currently uninsured. How are we going to pay for their treatment and their testing? How are we going to deal with seniors who are seeing their retirement accounts hit, other than by expanding Social Security?” asked Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair. “The coronavirus and the uncertainty around it, the economic uncertainty, gives a way of having Sen. Sanders talk about his policies. Not just in an aspirational, abstract sense, but in a way of here and now.” During the Thursday all-staff call, Shakir and other senior aides said that campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic meant that they would need to focus more on their digital operation and “distributed organizing” strategy, which, they argued, are superior to Biden’s.  The digital gap between the two campaigns was on display Friday, when the Biden operation struggled with technical difficulties during its first virtual town hall. Since Sanders first announced he was running in 2020, his team has livestreamed almost every public event. But if the coronavirus has shifted voters toward a candidate so far, it’s Biden. Exit polls found Democratic primary voters trust Biden more than Sanders to lead during a crisis by double-digit margins. Sanders’ team aims to change that — and everything else — on Sunday. ""You don't run for president if you're not in it to win,” said Khanna. ""He’s hoping the debate will change the dynamic.” Laura Barron-Lopez contributed to this report.",Sanders bets on Biden debate implosion,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-129418,politico
"SEATTLE, Wash.—As of Friday, the coronavirus outbreak is officially a national emergency. But while most Americans are only just becoming familiar with social distancing and quarantining, Washington state has been dealing with the crisis since the first U.S. case was discovered there on January 20. The Seattle area, in particular, has become Ground Zero in the United States after the first death from the epidemic on February 29. Now, the buzzing birthplace of Starbucks and home of tech giants like Amazon has, in large part, shut down, foreshadowing what could come for the rest of the country. In Washington’s most populated city, large events and entire sports seasons are being cancelled or postponed; schools, libraries, community centers and the zoo are closing; some hospitals and prisons have banned visitors; and public health officials are urging businesses to allow employees to work remotely. Governor Jay Inslee has banned gatherings of 250 or more people in three counties, including Seattle’s King County. A usually bustling city is now eerily silent and still. Over the last week, Seattle-based photographer Chona Kasinger documented the ghost town that it’s become. Text by Ruairí Arrieta-Kenna. Pike Place Market is usually a hub of activity, filled with locals and tourists buying fish, flowers or produce. But what would usually be a busy weekend for the century-old farmers’ market was instead a sleepy Sunday on March 8—after the statewide total of known coronavirus cases crossed into triple digits and the number of deaths into double digits. Since King County officials urged employers on March 4 to allow people to work remotely, the once traffic-heavy city of Seattle has come to a near standstill. While many restaurants and shops remain open, many would-be patrons are staying home, and some businesses are starting to close. According to the Seattle Times, more than 50 restaurants and bars, including a dozen by local celebrity chef Tom Douglas, have already shut their doors in the past two weeks. In Seattle, much like other parts of the country, stores have been marked by long lines and low supplies as people stock up on provisions. The coronavirus is known to be deadlier to people over 60, with the vast majority of the 32 deaths in King County as of Saturday linked to a single retirement community. While young people have generally been spared from the virus’ worst symptoms and might feel less hesitant to avoid public places, state officials are weighing even more drastic measures to make sure they don’t become carriers of the disease.",America’s Coronavirus Ground Zero,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/15/seattle-ghost-town-coronavirus-ground-zero-128720,politico
"TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s official leading the response to the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East on Sunday acknowledged that the pandemic could overwhelm health facilities in the country, which is under severe U.S. sanctions. Muslim authorities, meanwhile, announced that the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam, would be closed indefinitely due to concerns about the outbreak, with prayers continuing to be held on the sprawling esplanade outside. Similar measures have been taken at the nearby Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, where outdoor prayers continue but only 10 people at a time are permitted in enclosed areas, in keeping with measures taken by the Israeli government. Iran is battling one of the worst outbreaks outside China. On Sunday the Health Ministry reported 113 more deaths, bringing the country’s death toll to 724 amid 13,938 confirmed cases. The real number of infections could be even higher, as questions have been raised about the government’s transparency. “If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity,” Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak, was quoted as saying earlier by the state-run IRNA news agency. Iran is believed to have around 110,000 hospital beds, including 30,000 in the capital, Tehran. Authorities have pledged to set up mobile clinics as needed. Zali also acknowledged that “many” of those who have died from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus were otherwise healthy, a rare admission by local authorities that the virus does not only prey on the sick and elderly. Health Ministry figures show that while 55% of fatalities were in their 60s, some 15% were younger than 40. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Most people recover in a matter of weeks. The virus has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,800. More than 70,000 people worldwide have recovered after being infected. In Iran, the virus has infected a number of senior officials, including the senior vice president, Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, Revolutionary Guard members and Health Ministry officials. Authorities have nevertheless been slow to adopt measures taken by other hard-hit countries. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday ruled out a general quarantine and said the government was working to keep the borders open. Dalia Samhouri, a senior regional official with the World Health Organization, said both Iran and Egypt, two of the most populous countries in the Middle East, were likely underreporting cases because of the nature of the virus, which can be spread by individuals who show no visible symptoms. “We can easily say that the current figures are an underestimation of the actual figures,” she said. Iran has struggled to respond in part because of crippling sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. The U.S. says it has offered humanitarian aid but that Iran has rejected it. Countries across the Middle East have imposed sweeping travel restrictions, canceled public events and in some cases called on non-essential businesses to close for the coming weeks. In the skyscraper-studded city of Dubai, a global business and travel hub in the United Arab Emirates, authorities announced on Sunday that all movie theaters, arcades and gyms would be closed through the end of the month. Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, also shut down its amusement parks and museums through the end of the month, including Louvre Abu Dhabi. The UAE’s central bank meanwhile announced a $27 billion stimulus package directed at supporting banks and said regulatory limits on loans will be eased. Saudi Arabia announced its own $13 billion stimulus plan. Al-Aqsa is the latest in a series of religious sites where access has been halted or strictly limited. Saudi Arabia has halted the umrah pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina and could be forced to limit or cancel the much larger haj later this year. On Sunday, it announced the temporary closure of all mosques and called off Friday prayers. Sheikh Omar Kiswani, the director of the Al-Aqsa mosque, said Sunday that the closure of the mosque and other buildings on the compound, including the iconic golden Dome of the Rock, would continue indefinitely. The religious site is also the holiest in Judaism because it was the location of the two Jewish temples in antiquity. Israel occupied and annexed east Jerusalem in the 1967 war in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state, and the religious site has often been a flashpoint in the decades-long conflict. Israel imposed sweeping travel and quarantine measures more than a week ago but has seen its number of confirmed cases double in recent days, to around 200. On Saturday, the government said restaurants, malls, movies, gyms and daycare centers would close. Schools and universities have already been shut down until next month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s trial on serious corruption charges, which was supposed to begin this week, was postponed for two months due to restrictions on public gatherings. Netanyahu has meanwhile been pressing for an emergency unity government with his main rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, following three inconclusive elections and more than a year of political deadlock. Gantz has appeared open to the idea. Jordan, which had previously reported just one infection in a man who later recovered, confirmed six new cases. Four are French tourists while the other two are Jordanians, Health Minister Saad Jaber said Sunday. Jordan has suspended all flights into and out of the kingdom except for aid workers and diplomats, and has closed schools for two weeks. It has also banned the smoking of hookahs, or water pipes, in cafes.",Iran says worsening outbreak could strain health facilities,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/iran-says-worsening-outbreak-could-strain-health-facilities-129895,politico
"Bernie Sanders is facing a host of questions before Sunday’s debate. How directly will he challenge Joe Biden? Is he betting on a miraculous turnaround in Florida, Illinois and Ohio? Or is he effectively conceding the nomination, and staying in the race just to try to convince Biden to embrace more of the Sanders agenda? But Biden is the 2020 candidate who faces the more consequential question in this debate: How far will he go to embrace Sanders out of a desire for party unity, and how much of a risk is he taking by doing so? Here, history provides a cautionary lesson. When the presumptive presidential nominee of a political party goes too far to placate a noisy ideological minority, the results can backfire—and might even presage defeat in November. Back in 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon was in a position not all that different from Biden’s. He was on a glide path to the Republican presidential nomination. His most likely challenger, New York governor Nelson Rockefeller, had taken himself out of the running at the end of 1959, declaring that “this decision is definite and final.” But by the summer of 1960, Rocky was showing unmistakable signs that he might be changing his mind. In June, after a White House meeting, he issued a blistering statement arguing that “those now assuming control of the Republican Party have failed to make clear where the party is heading and where it proposes to lead the nation. … I find it unreasonable in these times that the leading Republican candidate for the presidential nomination has firmly insisted upon making known his program and his policies not before, but only after nomination by this party.” He called Ike the next day to test the possibility of a presidential endorsement of his candidacy. There was, in fact, virtually no support within the Republican establishment for a Rockefeller run, just like there is very little support in the Democratic establishment for a Sanders presidency today. But that did not stop the New York governor from challenging his party, specifically on its platform, on issues ranging from defense spending (he wanted a lot more) to civil rights to medical care. And that challenge was one Richard Nixon desperately wanted to avoid. So, without consulting his advisors, Nixon sought a personal meeting with Rockefeller. It was granted, on terms that very much made Nixon look like a supplicant. He had to publicly ask for the meeting, which also had to be at Rockefeller’s Fifth Avenue triplex in Manhattan. And most important. when Nixon left the meeting at 3 a.m., he and Rockefeller had signed onto platform language that more or less repudiated Eisenhower and the Republicans across a range of concerns—especially on the civil rights. On that issue, the Compact’s strong language (“aggressive action to remove the remaining vestiges of segregation or discrimination in all areas of national life” and “support for the objectives of the sit-in demonstrators”) was admirable, but it undermined the tightrope Nixon was intending to walk between his party’s Northern liberals and its Southern whites. The document—labeled “the Compact of Fifth Avenue”—was the political equivalent of a hand grenade. Conservatives, who carried a deep antipathy toward the deep-pocketed Eastern internationalist wing of the GOP that had denied them a presidential nomination for two decades, were furious that Nixon had bent the knee to the symbolic leader of that wing. Some were angry enough to place in nomination the name of an emerging conservative hero, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Addressing the convention that summer, Goldwater said: “Let’s grow up, conservatives. … If we want to take this party back—and I think we can someday—let’s go to work.” Just four years later, Goldwater won the nomination before going down to a landslide loss in November to President Lyndon Johnson. The Republican Party did not adopt the Nixon-Rockefeller language on civil rights, but that language did cause Nixon a significant headache as he sought to replicate the gains in the South that Eisenhower, who carried Texas and Louisiana in 1956, had made in previous elections. So what’s the lesson here for Biden? It’s that he needs to walk a fine line between respecting Sanders and his base, and accommodating too many of their ideas, which Biden has explicitly opposed throughout the campaign. When they were offered a clear, binary choice between Sanders and a less militantly left candidate, Democratic voters went for the relative centrist by significant margins. Seemingly out of nowhere, a broad coalition emerged—led by landslide majorities of African-Americans—that that rejected the idea that a “political revolution” was the key to winning the White House. They support comprehensive immigration reform and protection for “the Dreamers”—but they do not necessarily support free health care and college tuition for the undocumented. They favor restoring voting rights for felons who have served their time; they do not necessarily support voting rights for felons who are still in prison. They favor expanded health care, but they do not favor a plan that would effectively abolish all private health insurance. For the presumptive nominee of a party—which is what Biden is very close to becoming—there is a point where reaching out to unify the party crosses over into appeasement. Something like that almost happened in 1980, when Ronald Reagan came close to offering former president Gerald Ford the vice presidential slot on his ticket. Emissaries for Ford, including Henry Kissinger, were busily negotiating a range of duties for Ford that would have amounted (in Walter Cronkite’s words) to “something of a co-presidency”. It would have been a confession of weakness, a signal that Reagan doubted his own capacity for the job of chief executive. Luckily for the Gipper, the deal fell apart. Biden should recognize the spirited campaigns Sanders has run, the passion of his followers, and his achievement in forcing the Democratic Party to confront the nation’s yawning inequality, which requires major repair. And he should highlight his own ideas about increased taxes on the wealthy, criminal justice reform, and an ambitious health care plan that address some, but not all, of concerns of the Sanders’ supporters. But Biden also needs to act in a way that reminds his party and his country who is winning the most votes from Democrats and who will almost surely prevail when the convention assembles in Milwaukee. One more point: when and if the two meet for an endorsement rally, it would be wise to hold it in Wilmington, not Burlington.",Why Biden Shouldn’t Unify Too Much with Sanders,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/15/biden-sanders-debate-2020-128731,politico
"The Trump administration is struggling to win back the confidence of hospital leaders after three years of pitched battles, with the industry pushing for urgent help from the White House as the coronavirus crisis begins to swamp emergency rooms. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma on Friday announced new moves to roll back industry regulations, two days after hospitals pled their case to Verma in a White House meeting that left many unsatisfied. Among the changes: Streamlined deployment of doctors, fewer time-consuming inspections and less red tape around how hospitals run operations during a crisis. “It gives hospitals and providers on the front lines the maximum flexibility so that they can focus on patients that need help,” Verma said on “Fox and Friends” on Saturday. The American Hospital Association hailed the moves as a “solid step.” But hospital leaders say that the new announcements only touch the surface of their needs, as they worry about shortages of crucial supplies, risks to their workers and the possibility of an industry bailout as coronavirus patients swarm their facilities. An expert on an American Hospital Association webinar last month predicted as many as 1.9 million ICU admissions from the coronavirus outbreak over the next few months, swamping existing facilities. There are only about 100,000 ICU beds across the U.S. health system. Meanwhile, the cost of care for some severely ill coronavirus patients has already been estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, as hospitals deploy significant measures to keep the patients alive while protecting their own workers against infection. At least three hospital systems in Seattle, the center of the nation's most extensive outbreak, have already announced a halt on elective procedures in order to devote more resources toward the coronavirus patients already swarming their facilities. “I think there will be hospitals that could be pushed to the edge financially,” said Chip Kahn, head of the for-profit Federation of American Hospitals, warning that hospitals will absorb a surge of coronavirus cases while postponing elective procedures that tend to be better for hospitals’ bottom lines. Some hospital leaders have quietly floated that they’ll need federal funding to pay for rented hotels or other arrangements as their hospital wards are quickly overrun by the coronavirus outbreak. The risk of failure is severe: Public health experts have warned that the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, which is in its early days, could be on track to resemble the increasingly dire situation in Italy, where patients have overwhelmed that nation’s health system. That’s left hospitals calling for extreme measures from the White House and scrambling to prepare emergency steps of their own while they wait for a response. But in the face of the looming crisis, hospital executives said that leaders were underwhelmed by their Wednesday meeting with Verma, who spent much of the hour-long session taking notes but failed to calm industry fears about swamped emergency rooms and medical supply shortages, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence briefly joined the meeting but departed to join other officials as they worked to prepare the president for his Oval Office address. “For our guys, it did not scream confidence,” said one individual briefed on the meeting. “We came out of it with bigger questions about whether the administration has done its homework to protect the supply chain,” as hospitals try to stock up on masks, swabs and other key materials that could quickly become hard to find, said another individual. Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, compared the current situation to a “World War II mentality, where we’re going to have to put extra shifts on in manufacturing and get this stuff out the door.” “The only one that can do that is the federal government, and we need the president and vice president to make a priority of that,” he said. Kahn, who was among the attendees at Wednesday’s meeting, praised Verma but put responsibility for the administration’s slow start on the White House, contending that federal health officials had to wait for authorization to get started on a series of initiatives. But hospital leaders haven’t had time alone with President Donald Trump — even as leaders of other health sectors, like the insurance industry, the pharma industry and the lab industry, have been granted extended face-to-face meetings with the president and Pence. CMS didn't respond to questions about the meeting with Verma, but defended its efforts to engage the hospital industry. A spokesperson pointed to a new weekly call to brief hospitals on coronavirus — with the first call with FDA Commissioner Steve Hahn drawing more than 1,600 listeners — and other steps to build closer ties. ""CMS created a strategic working group with the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals which began meeting last Monday,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the group included a ""small number"" of hospital CEOs. ""We believe that for the health system to respond adequately to the coronavirus, the entire health system must be engaged,"" the spokesperson added. The tensions between hospitals and the Trump administration have persisted for years. The hospital industry went to war with the White House in 2017 over Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying that rolling back the sweeping health law would harm patients and do damage to their bottom lines. They’ve continued that fight as Trump has tried to strike down the law in court, with American Hospital Association CEO Rick Pollack calling the position “misguided.” Hospitals also have fought over numerous Medicaid changes spearheaded by Verma, including a new “fiscal accountability” proposal that would tighten hospitals’ ability to collect Medicaid funding. Hospitals currently use a variety of financial arrangements to pump up their Medicaid revenue, such as supporting state taxes that allow them to draw down even more money in federal matching funds. Verma has called the arrangements industry-friendly gimmicks and wants to do away with them. “Hospitals were already concerned about the rule — and moreso with coronavirus staring them in the face,” said Joel McElvain, a partner in King & Spalding’s health care group who’s represented hospitals in lawsuits against the administration. McElvain warned that states would need to come up with new financial arrangements to support hospitals if the rule, a top priority for Verma, is finalized during the coronavirus outbreak. “It’s a time when rural hospitals are already struggling and facing real difficulty if worst-case scenarios come true in the coming weeks,” McElvain said. Meanwhile, hospitals have spent years fighting back against a slew of Trump administration funding cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and public health initiatives. Among Trump’s most recent proposals: an $18 million cut to the federal health department’s own hospital preparedness program, announced just last month, on the eve of the coronavirus outbreak. “The hospital preparedness program exists so hospitals prepare for this exact thing,” said a former HHS official. “The whole point is to prepare them so they can respond to all hazards - from hurricanes to pandemics to biological attacks.” While Trump’s battles with the pharmaceutical industry have gotten considerable headlines, some of his aides have believed that hospitals were a larger problem, citing the costs that ever-larger systems have passed along to patients and pointing to policies that they say gamed the system. They also haven’t agreed with hospitals’ warnings that their bottom lines have suffered under this administration. “The argument is so ridiculous,” said Brian Blase, who advised Trump on health policy before leaving the White House last year. “I don’t think there are a lot of policies that came out that took revenue away from hospitals,” he added, noting that hospitals successfully sued to block Trump’s billion-dollar cut to a drug-discount program and other regulations opposed by hospitals have been similarly stalled. Amid the historic public health threat, hospital officials are loath to renew a public battle too and criticize the administration. “We have been very clear that we have had serious concerns with a number of other policies from the Administration, including the issues of Medicaid expansion and cuts to hospital outpatient department visits,” a spokesperson for the American Hospital Association told POLITICO. “Right now, of course, our focus is on working with the government and other stakeholders at all levels to address the current emergency.” But some hospital leaders did express frustration on Saturday after Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that hospitals may need to postpone elective surgeries to handle the crush of coronavirus patients. “Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!” Adams tweeted on Saturday, adding that such procedures could further the coronavirus spread, tax medical stockpiles and put further pressure on doctors and nurses. The message from the nation’s top doctor was seen as alarmist and premature, worrying hospital officials that it would prompt patients to postpone crucial care. “I do think it’s unfortunate what the surgeon general said,” said Kahn, adding that he hoped Adams and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who similarly warned of the need to cancel some procedures, would walk back their statements. “I don’t think we’re anywhere near a point where we know we would have to do something like that.” The coronavirus outbreak has served as justification of hospitals’ yearslong warnings over federal policies that the industry saw as hamstringing their finances and preparedness, executives said. Now, the same government that sought to cut pay rates and layer on new regulations is relying on hospitals as the nation’s chief defense against the pandemic. “Governments tend to, on a day-to-day basis, underestimate the importance of the health care community and look at it not so much as an economic contribution as an economic deficit,” Raske said, emphasizing that the attitude extends well beyond the Trump administration. “That tendency hits reality in a crisis.” Hospital leaders also have warned about the dearth of ventilators to treat the sickest patients — an issue that Verma has failed to directly address in multiple interviews, including being grilled by Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday night over whether hospitals will have enough. ""You know, Tucker, I don't want to make drastic predictions here, right?"" Verma said. ""Because this situation is changing every single day. And based on the information we have, we know that we have to be aggressive,"" she added, touting yesterday's moves to increase flexibility for hospitals and relax regulations. “That was one of the most incompetent and absolutely incoherent responses to what’s going on right now,” Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease expert, told Carlson a few minutes later. CMS did not directly respond to questions about whether there is a dearth of ventilators. Meanwhile, hospital executives have noted the dark irony of Washington’s sudden focus on mass treatment capacity after years of efforts to crack down on hospital reimbursement prompted providers to shrink their facilities. “I’m really worried about how, when this finally blows over, what Congress does,” said one lobbyist. “Are we actually going to learn from this?” “We love hospitals,” countered Blase, Trump’s former health policy adviser. “Hospitals are going to be at the front lines of this and have an enormous job. But there shouldn’t be policies that give them advantages they shouldn’t have.”",Trump now needs the hospitals he's alienated,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-hospitals-coronavirus-129743,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is widely thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",2 senators take extreme measures to show allegiance to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"America’s top infectious diseases expert expressed concern over the crush of travelers stuck in airports trying to return home in light of new travel restrictions from Europe, urging Americans to remain calm and so not overwhelm the world’s airports. This weekend’s implementation of the new restrictions announced only days earlier has spurred a mad dash for Americans abroad to return home, causing backups and massive crowds in airports across the country. In response to the mess at Chicago‘s O’Hare Airport, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together.“ But Anothony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that the bottleneck is “countermanding” efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. “We would like to not see crowds like that,” Fauci told “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace, promising that Americans need not worry about being able to get back into the country.  “I think what people need to understand is if you're an American citizen, if you are a family member you can get back. You don't need to rush back, you will be able to get back,” he pledged. While Fauci called the panic “understandable,” he admitted that “unfortunately” the rush is unlikely to abate. The rollout of the Trump administration’s new travel restrictions barring foreigners from Europe — which the World Health Organization this weekend called the new “epicenter” of the pandemic — faced a torrent of criticism and backlash from stranded travelers and officials alike over the weekend. The White House was panned first for its lack of clarity surrounding who the ban applied to, prompting administration officials to pan out on television to do clean up duty for President Donald Trump's initial announcement.  Trump implemented similar restrictions for foreigners from China and Iran earlier in the year as the virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, quickly began to spread across the globe. But those restrictions were put in place before the respiratory disease really took hold within the U.S., which has since seen thousands of cases. But Fauci said Sunday that there are much more worrying considerations than the inconvenience of travelers during a time when Americans have been asked to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “Obviously whenever you have crowds — that's the thing we've been talking about that we really want to implement is to have that kind of social separation,” he said. Airport crowding “is countermanding that, and hopefully people understand you don't have to rush back.”  Asked whether there was anything airports could do to try and mitigate the rush, Fauci said he wasn’t sure, other than “to try and encourage people to tell them that if you are an American citizen, you will be able to get back, it's not going to be a problem.” ",Fauci to Americans abroad: ‘You will be able to get back’,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-travel-airports-130104,politico
"If you’re in angst-ridden quarantine, you’ll probably be finding it hard to take your mind off things. One high-risk strategy — not for those of a nervous disposition — is to dive headlong into some of literature’s most horrific plagues, from Sophocles to Camus, to put things in perspective. There’s some solace in the unity of human experience over the centuries. Big themes — terrifying incomprehension, the vulnerability of doctors and the emergence of cynical profiteers — recur across the centuries. Do you feel guilty about your obsessive addiction to the daily tolls of infections and deaths? Well, the English writers Samuel Pepys and Daniel Defoe shared exactly the same fascination. If you are ever feeling really down, remember Giovanni Boccaccio’s cheery observation from the 14th century that in plague-infested days “a dead man was then of no more account than a dead goat.” See, you must be feeling better already … Here are some feel-good classics: The quintessential novel about how the human psyche reacts in times of plague, confinement and fear of death. The characters in Camus’ story reflect the entire spectrum of behavior, ranging from the scientific, matter-of-fact approach of Rieux, a doctor who combats the plague ravaging the Algerian port city of Oran; to the profiteering Cottard, who relishes in the collective misfortune but eventually goes mad; and Father Paneloux, who finds solace in God’s will but is eventually taken ill. “The Plague” is an ode to humanity in its darkest times. Camus was a fan of Defoe, and owes much to the Englishman’s compelling piece of faux journalism, where plague-ridden London in 1665 is the seething ant colony of human foibles that comes under the magnifying glass. (It is written as a supposed eyewitness account, but Defoe was only five at the time.) The narrator muses on everything from the divine will and the rise of conmen to the rights and wrongs of shutting people in their houses. There are vivid vignettes including a brutal scene where blaspheming boozers at the Pye Tavern in Houndsditch taunt a distraught man who has just seen his wife and children flung into a mass grave. Defoe ends on the bleak note that the survivors’ gratefulness to God would prove short-lived, and that they would slide back into their old habits. Unlike Defoe, the debonair and adulterous diarist Pepys is a bona fide witness to the horrors of the bubonic plague of 1665 that killed a quarter of Londoners. It’s a haunting vision of depopulation, fires in the streets and the ceaseless tolling of bells. Famously declaring “God preserve us all!” he loses close acquaintances including his baker to the pestilence, and chews tobacco in the hope that it is an antidote. While extremely careful in some respects, Pepys is also an oyster-slurping playboy with a penchant for extra-marital liaisons, who takes astonishing risks in visiting his mistress, whose servant died of plague. His career goes from strength to strength and he finally describes 1665 as a year in which he “never lived so merrily.” Compulsory reading for Italian high school students, “The Betrothed” gives a historically accurate account of the bubonic plague that wiped out a quarter of Milan’s population in 1629-1631. Particularly poignant is Manzoni’s description of the crowd’s descent into a collective psychosis and the public lynching and unfair prosecution of people wrongly accused of intentionally spreading the plague, the so-called “untori.” Parallels with recent attacks on people of Asian descent are painfully obvious. In a lighter approach to the plague theme, Boccaccio imagines a group of 10 youths fleeing the Black Death ravaging Florence and finding refuge in the Tuscan hills. They entertain themselves by narrating a tale a day for 10 days, giving 100 stories ranging from the tragic to the facetious and ribald (Decameron means “10 days” in Greek). If you can’t find a copy in your solitary confinement, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1971 movie adaptation, with music by the old maestro Ennio Morricone, is an excellent alternative. A writer develops an obsessive, unrequited love for a beautiful youth. Meanwhile, a mysterious cholera from the Ganges quickly spreads through Venice’s maze of canals. Mann’s novella is less about the plague than about the tension between Apollonian restraint and Dionysian abandon, but it is obligatory reading, and you will succumb to Mann’s beautiful writing. “The Last Man” by Mary Shelley, who’s better known for Frankenstein, is often described as English literature’s first apocalypse novel. It takes place in the late 21st century (as described by someone living in the early 19th century — the Ottoman Empire’s still going strong in her vision of the future) when a deadly plague of unknown nature sweeps across the world. The book is heavily inspired by tragic events in Shelley’s life, such as the death of her husband and children, which is reflected in the novel’s grim ending: Humans die by the millions, until only the titular last man is left alive. The Greek historian Thucydides wins his place on our list for being not only an eyewitness but also a survivor of the plague that tore through Athens from 430 B.C. There’s no consensus about what the disease was, but it was vicious: It caused unquenchable thirst, fever, spasms, ulcers, vomiting and total memory loss. It weakens Athens in its war with Sparta, and claims the life of the city’s great statesman Pericles. Thucydides notes that it also sparks a breakdown in law and morals, with people frittering their money away on life’s pleasures. In his tragedy Oedipus Rex, performed in 429 B.C., Sophocles opens the action in a city brought low by plague. “The fire-bearing god, the most hateful pestilence, hath swooped down on our city,” as the playwright puts it. And that’s before things turn truly tragic! In this brief and powerful book, a young physical education teacher in Newark, New Jersey tries to keep a level head as polio consumes his community. Panic gradually takes hold in the 1950s Weequahic neighborhood, with no cure in sight and no understanding of how the disease spreads. When a research satellite crashes in Arizona, everyone in a nearby town dies from a mysterious ailment that either clots their blood or causes them to commit suicide in bizarre ways.

"Top health official Anthony Fauci said Sunday that after strict containment and mitigation, China’s coronavirus outbreak is “coming down right now.” On ABC’s “This Week,” the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that it takes several weeks to a few months for the outbreak to dwindle, pointing to China and South Korea as examples.  China, where COVID-19 first set off alarms, passed through the worst, Fauci said. According to a Johns Hopkins University database, the country has had the bulk of the cases and fatalities: nearly 81,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,200 deaths.  Recently, China reported just 11 new cases — minuscule compared to the numbers it used to see, Fauci said. South Korea’s coronavirus spread is also starting to flatten. “If you look at that bracket, all of that was a couple of months, a month-and-a-half for China,” he said Sunday. “The way you interfere with that … depends on the effectiveness in which you do the kinds of controls that we've been talking about, the containment and the mitigation.”  China, Fauci added, really dramatically practiced “social distancing” when officials shut down the country. Now, all eyes are on what happens as people resume normal life.  “It's over for now and hopefully for good,” Fauci said. “As they start getting back to normal personal interaction, I hope we don't see the second blip, but it's possible.”  The worst may also be over in South Korea, Fauci said. “Korea is starting to flatten and maybe come down a little,” he said. Worldwide, there are over 156,000 confirmed cases and over 5,800 deaths. In the United States, there have been more than 2,900 cases and 57 deaths. Many public spaces, schools and offices have closed as millions of Americans are encouraged to reduce close contact with others.  On Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted to reinforce that message: “SOCIAL DISTANCING!”",Top U.S. health official: China’s situation is improving,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-china-korea-130027,politico
"The nation’s top infectious disease expert warned Sunday that Americans should prepare to take far more drastic steps to blunt the rapid spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, which has sickened thousands of Americans across the country and prompted calls for a wide-scale withdrawal from public life. “I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview airing on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” His warning comes as the virus has caused the cancellation of events across the globe, as well as travel bans — and in some countries, domestic travel restrictions. Health officials have warned Americans to practice social distancing to limit the amount of community transmission and avoid overwhelming an already-strained health care system.  Asked Sunday whether he would favor the kind of national lockdown ordered by Italy’s prime minister, Fauci said he would rather err on the side of being “overly aggressive.”  “You know, I would prefer as much as we possibly could,” Fauci responded. “I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting.” Fauci said he’d broached these concerns with the White House, which has taken increasingly significant steps over the last week as the number of U.S. cases exploded. He said that there had not been pushback to his suggestions, noting that “in fairness, they listen and they generally go with what we say.” While Fauci said “much more” needed to be done on the social distancing front, he conceded that some Americans would ultimately do what they please. “I mean, obviously, you're going to have people who are going to go to restaurants anyway,” he said, when asked by “Meet the Press” anchor Chuck Todd about packed restaurants and bars as people celebrated St. Patrick’s Day over the weekend. “But for the most part, and particularly, if I can say this, this is particularly appropriate and relevant for people at the higher risk. The elderly and those who have underlying conditions right now should really hunker down.” He reiterated, though, that it was better to be safe than sorry.  “The golden rule that I say is that, when you think you are doing too much, you are probably doing enough or not enough,” he argued, urging Americans not to be “complacent.”  “Don’t even, for a second, think that I am saying we shouldn’t — I like to be criticized,"" he added. ""When I say oh, you are being too overactive, that is good for me.”",Fauci: Americans should be prepared to 'hunker down' even more,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/coronavirus-fauci-americans-hunker-down-130035,politico
"Voters are divided along party lines on how President Donald Trump is handling the burgeoning coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., according to a new poll out Sunday that shows a majority predicting it won’t change their lives in a significant way. Nearly half of voters in the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 45 percent, approve of the job Trump is doing in handling the outbreak, slightly fewer than the 51 percent who disapprove. That nearly matches Trump’s overall approval rating of 46 percent, which is statistically unchanged from a month ago. The partisan split on Trump’s handling of the virus is wide: While 81 percent of self-identified Republican voters approve of how the president is handling the situation, 84 percent of Democrats disapprove. Among independent voters, 43 percent approve, and 52 percent disapprove. More strikingly, a significant share of voters, mostly Republicans, say they don’t expect the outbreak to have major effects on their daily lives — a view that runs counter to the recommendations of public-health officials. The poll was conducted March 11-13, surveying 900 registered voters. It went into the field the day of Trump’s address to the nation on the outbreak on Wednesday, the same day the NBA suspended its season after a player, Utah’s Rudy Gobert, contracted the virus and actor Tom Hanks announced he and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, had also tested positive for coronavirus. Only 15 percent of voters say they expect the virus to change their lives “in a very major way,” and an additional 26 percent say they think it will change their lives “in a fairly major way.” But 39 percent expect only “small” changes, and 17 percent say it won’t change their lives in any way. The combined 41 percent who expect major changes to their lives includes 56 percent of Democrats, but only 26 percent of Republicans. Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say they have or will be canceling travel plans (47 percent, versus 23 percent) or plan to stop eating at restaurants (36 percent, versus 12 percent). “Simply put, it is very clear that partisanship has infected our views of the coronavirus,” Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt told NBC News. Voters do expect things to get worse: Roughly six-in-10, 60 percent, said the worst is yet to come. But 6 percent said the worst was already passed, and 31 percent said they don’t expect coronavirus to be a major problem in the U.S. And despite the effects already seen — a wave of cancellations of public events, the tumbling stock market and the strain on the health care system — the share of voters saying the country is headed in the right direction (37 percent) is statistically unchanged from last December (35 percent). Voters are split on their confidence in Trump to handle the crisis: 48 percent say they have a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in Trump, while 50 percent no or “not very much” confidence in him. By contrast, voters are more confident in their state government (75 percent great deal or fair amount of confidence), their local government (72 percent) or the federal government as a whole (62 percent). The poll also tested opinions of Democratic voters following last week’s presidential primaries. Former Vice President Joe Biden is the first choice of Democrats, with 61 percent saying they would favor him if a primary were being held in their state today. That’s nearly double the percentage choosing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), 32 percent. Four percent of Democrats choose Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). In hypothetical general election matchups, both Biden and Sanders lead Trump, though Biden’s 9-point advantage, 52 percent to 43 percent, is slightly larger than Sanders’ 4-point lead, 49 percent to 45 percent. The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points for all registered voters, and 4.7 percentage points for Democratic primary voters.",Poll: Voters split on Trump’s handling of coronavirus outbreak,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/poll-voters-coronavirus-outbreak-130033,politico
"Illinois’ governor complained late Saturday that new travel restrictions in place because of the coronavirus pandemic have led to an impossible situation at Chicago’s biggest airport. “The crowds & lines O’Hare are unacceptable & need to be addressed immediately,“ Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted Saturday. He added: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW.“ Enhanced screening for returning travelers from Europe is creating massive logjams at U.S. airports, with travelers waiting hours in long lines to get their luggage and clear customs. Having travelers stuck in huge crowds — while public health officials urgently advise people to keep their distance — is also creating concerns that the virus could spread at airports. “To the frustrated people trying to get home, I have spoken with the mayor and our Senators and we are working together to get the federal government to act to solve this. We will do everything within our power to get relief,” the governor tweeted. Mayor Lori Lightfoot echoed Pritzker’s criticisms on Twitter: “This is unacceptable.

"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday dodged questions about whether the coronavirus pandemic could plunge the U.S. into a recession, insisting that the reeling stock market would eventually get back on track and that the Trump administration is more focused on targeting short-term relief to those most impacted by the fast-spreading disease.  In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” the secretary repeatedly sought to avoid getting pinned down on a number of issues relating to the surge of coronavirus cases in the U.S. after he spent the last week negotiating with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the details of an economic aid package that he referred to as just the “second inning” of relief. “I wouldn't focus on the technical issue of whether we are going to be in a recession or not,” Mnuchin told host Chris Wallace, arguing that the administration is more concerned about what it can immediately do to blunt the impact of the outbreak. The virus has prompted the shuttering of schools, the cancellation of sporting and entertainment events and outright travel bans, while fears over the novel coronavirus have contributed to a turbulent month on Wall Street.  The stock market over the last few weeks has shattered records for its greatest one-day gains but also for point drops, posting numbers not seen since the 1987 crash and ending an 11-year bull market run. The Federal Reserve has already stepped in to try and calm investors' fears, but those moves have gotten bowled over by new developments in the outbreak.  But “if the medical professionals are correct and we are doing all the things, I expect we’ll have a big rebound later in the year,” Mnuchin continued, arguing that the current market rout has very different origins than the Great Depression and other past declines — and thus wasn’t comparable. “This will have an end to it as we confront the virus,” he argued. Mnuchin said his primary focus at the moment was the passage of the congressional aid package, which passed the House after midnight on Friday and which President Donald Trump has pledged to sign if it passes the Senate. That legislation would act as a complement to an $8.3 billion emergency aid bill that Congress approved earlier this month, and would precede a stimulus package aimed at propping up the hard-hit travel industry on which he said negotiations would begin this week.  “We need to get economic relief to the people that are impacted by this, and as I have described this, we are in the second inning. The first inning was the $8 billion, the second inning we passed bipartisan legislation to make sure that workers that need to be home and small and medium-size businesses will get paid,” he said. “We are now going back to Congress and focusing this week on the airlines industry, the hotel industry, the cruise ship -- there's no question that the travel industry has been impacted like we've never seen before.”  He declined to put a price tag on the latest aid package, pointing to the unknown extent of the virus’ spread and how many workers would need the paid sick leave included in the latest stimulus bill. The cost would be “significant,” he said, “but not huge.”  The secretary also would not predict how much of a hit the economy would take, instead reiterating that investors “need to focus on the long term” and pushed back on the idea that the relief measures currently under consideration should be classified as a bailout, a term the Trump administration has sought to avoid. Unlike the 2009 recession, which was underpinned by the burst of the housing bubble and other structural weaknesses in the financial sector, Mnuchin argued that there were no such issues contributing to the current market tumble. “If you are providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you’re taking collateral and you have security, that's not a bailout,” Mnuchin reasoned. “To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted, again — our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted it.”  While he stressed that there will be businesses “that will be severely impacted” by the collapse of consumer spending while Americans are urged to exercise social distancing, “we are focused on helping those businesses that need liquidity.”",Mnuchin dodges on specifics of coronavirus' economic impact,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/mnuchin-coronavirus-economic-impact-130163,politico

"America’s top infectious diseases expert expressed concern over the crush of travelers stuck in airports trying to return home in light of new travel restrictions from Europe, urging Americans to remain calm and not overwhelm the world’s airports. This weekend’s implementation of the restrictions announced only days earlier has spurred a mad dash of Americans abroad returning home, causing backups and massive crowds in airports across the country. In response to the mess at Chicago‘s O’Hare Airport, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together.“ But Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned the bottleneck is “countermanding” efforts to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak. “We would like to not see crowds like that,” Fauci told “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace, promising that Americans need not worry about being able to get back into the country.  “I think what people need to understand is if you're an American citizen, if you are a family member, you can get back. You don't need to rush back — you will be able to get back,” he pledged. While Fauci called the panic “understandable,” he admitted that “unfortunately” the rush is unlikely to abate. The rollout of the Trump administration’s travel restrictions barring foreigners from Europe — which the World Health Organization this weekend called the new “epicenter” of the pandemic — faced a torrent of criticism and backlash from stranded travelers and officials alike over the weekend. The White House was panned first for its lack of clarity surrounding who the ban applied to, prompting administration officials to pan out on television to do clean up duty for President Donald Trump's initial announcement.  Trump implemented similar restrictions for foreigners from China and Iran earlier in the year as the virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, quickly began to spread across the globe. But those restrictions were put in place before the respiratory disease really took hold within the U.S., which has since seen thousands of cases. Fauci said Sunday there are much more worrying considerations than the inconvenience of travelers during a time when Americans have been asked to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “Obviously whenever you have crowds — that's the thing we've been talking about that we really want to implement is to have that kind of social separation,” he said. Airport crowding “is countermanding that, and hopefully people understand you don't have to rush back.”  Asked whether there is anything airports could do to try to mitigate the rush, Fauci said he wasn’t sure, other than “to try and encourage people to tell them that if you are an American citizen, you will be able to get back — it's not going to be a problem.” ",Fauci to Americans abroad: ‘You will be able to get back’,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-travel-airports-130104,politico
"Virtually the entire Democratic presidential primary has been predicated on one underlying assumption: the eventual collapse of Joe Biden. More than a dozen of his erstwhile opponents bet their campaigns on it, and he’s proven them all wrong. But his last serious opponent standing, Bernie Sanders, is still clinging to the same belief — and that it will finally happen on Sunday night, under the bright lights of their one-on-one debate. To revive his campaign, Sanders needs to prove he’s the best candidate to take on President Donald Trump and lead the country at a time of duress, his aides and allies say. But they also acknowledge privately it’s going to take more than that — namely, for the gaffe-prone Biden to stumble. “In the best-case scenario, Bernie dominates the debate and the arguments. He has one or two good one-liners,” said Mark Longabaugh, a former senior adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign. “And obviously the flip side would be Biden has a lackluster debate and maybe makes a mistake. All that coming together maybe causes some pause and hesitation on the part of voters.” It’s a tall order: Biden has won 14 of the 20 states that have voted this month, and he’s polling about 20 to 40 percentage points ahead of Sanders in the states that cast ballots on Tuesday. To make matters worse for Sanders, Tuesday was going to be difficult for him even in the best-case scenario: Its biggest delegate prize is Florida, home to many older, moderate Democrats and Cuban exiles who eschew his left-wing politics. It is also a closed primary where only Democrats can vote, and Sanders typically performs better in races where independents can participate. The reality of the situation isn’t lost on Sanders’ aides. “We’re not naïve,” said Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ campaign manager. “It’s going to be a hard path.” During an all-staff call Thursday evening, Sanders’ national organizing and field director, Misty Rebik, admitted to the team that it was facing an uphill battle — but it has always been that way, she tried to assure them. Sanders himself has appeared less confident on the campaign trail in the last few weeks, even looking downcast at a round-table with workers in Michigan, which is the type of event where he usually seems most upbeat. At the same time, Sanders’ staffers truly believe the trajectory of the race could change — that the campaign that somehow found itself in a stronger position after Sanders suffered a heart attack last fall could have another improbable comeback. They argue that the primary has been volatile, and that Biden himself trailed in the first three primary and caucus states before leapfrogging to frontrunner. They also point out that former presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar have surged in polls after strong performance debate performances. “I don’t know if you’ve seen Joe Biden lately, but he doesn’t like to be told he’s wrong,” said a Sanders adviser. “We’re going to take him on around the issues and make him defend his record. He’s deflected on those in earlier debates because there’s so much chatter happening on the stage. But when you’re one-on-one, you change the dynamic.” It’s unclear how aggressive Sanders will be with Biden. Some of Sanders’ staffers and supporters have been frustrated by what they see as his light touch with his former Senate colleague, whom Sanders likes and considers a friend. Even with Hillary Clinton, Sanders often lacked a killer instinct, famously telling her in a 2015 debate that “the American people are sick and tired about hearing about your damn emails!” Sanders, who doesn’t practice in mock debates while readying for showdowns, did not change his strategy during debate prep last week. “I know it’s shocking for you to hear that Bernie Sanders remained consistent in his approach,” joked Shakir. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group closely aligned with Elizabeth Warren, urged Sanders to stay in the race to debate the former vice president and prevent a “quick Biden coronation.” Given that Sanders this week laid out several questions he plans to ask Biden during the debate, Green doesn’t “expect Bernie to attempt a knockout punch like Elizabeth Warren did to Michael Bloomberg.” But, he added, “In this new coronavirus world, he has a very legitimate case that Democrats defeat Trump if we stand for universal free health care, paid sick leave, student debt cancellation, and a government that actually works for people. If he presses Biden in good faith to agree, he both makes Biden more electable and proves himself more electable — a win-win that lessens objections to him staying in the race this month."" In the Sanders campaign’s ideal world, aides said, he would win the debate, which would give him enough momentum to carry at least one of the four states voting on Tuesday. His aides see Arizona — partly because he has performed strongly among Latino voters — and Illinois as the best possibilities. In their view, that could change the narrative about Sanders’ campaign being all but done, and allow them to potentially win states voting later this primary, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and New York. To gain steam, ""you have to do it by initially suggesting the storyline was wrong about Bernie"" being finished, said Shakir. “Right now, I’m not sure that anyone — correct me if I’m wrong — is suggesting that we will win in any of those four states. Hopefully we can turn that around.” Another reason the Sunday debate looms so large in the Sanders team’s mind is because his aides believe that voters who have seen Biden up close in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire have not supported him. A Biden adviser said of that notion, ""South Carolinians have seen Joe Biden up close for decades. They chose him overwhelmingly."" In a statement, the Biden campaign signaled that the former vice president is not planning on hammering away at contrasts with Sanders and instead wants to focus on Trump. Biden is ""honored to share the stage with Sen. Sanders, who he considers a good friend and whose values and leadership he admires,"" said Andrew Bates, Biden’s rapid response director. For Sanders, the debate is also an opportunity to nudge Biden to the left, a familiar position for the politician who successfully pulled Clinton in his direction during his unsuccessful 2016 bid. Sanders sees the coronavirus outbreak as a red flag that America’s health care system is dysfunctional, and that the country needs “Medicare for All” and other liberal policies. “There are 28 million people who are currently uninsured. How are we going to pay for their treatment and their testing? How are we going to deal with seniors who are seeing their retirement accounts hit, other than by expanding Social Security?” asked Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair. “The coronavirus and the uncertainty around it, the economic uncertainty, gives a way of having Sen. Sanders talk about his policies. Not just in an aspirational, abstract sense, but in a way of here and now.” During the Thursday all-staff call, Shakir and other senior aides said that campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic meant that they would need to focus more on their digital operation and “distributed organizing” strategy, which, they argued, are superior to Biden’s.  The digital gap between the two campaigns was on display Friday, when the Biden operation struggled with technical difficulties during its first virtual town hall. Since Sanders first announced he was running in 2020, his team has livestreamed almost every public event. But if the coronavirus has shifted voters toward a candidate so far, it’s Biden. Exit polls found Democratic primary voters trust Biden more than Sanders to lead during a crisis by double-digit margins. Sanders’ team aims to change that — and everything else — on Sunday. ""You don't run for president if you're not in it to win,” said Khanna. ""He’s hoping the debate will change the dynamic.” Laura Barron-Lopez contributed to this report.",Sanders bets on Biden debate implosion,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-129418,politico
"Massive lines ballooned across several U.S. airports this weekend as European travelers made a mad dash for home — a situation created by the quick rollout of the Trump administration’s European travel ban and exacerbated chronic airport staffing shortages.  U.S. officials promised Sunday to address the most visible sign of the chaos — the jam-packed terminals where Americans returning to the U.S. are waiting hours for virus screening at several major airports, including Chicago O'Hare, Dallas Fort Worth and Dulles International. But those lines are just one of a series of pressure points that have undermined the administration’s efforts to keep the virus from entering the country — and now threaten to hasten its spread: — The administration’s European travel ban, which President Donald Trump announced Wednesday and went into effect Friday night, sent Americans abroad scrambling to find plane tickets back home. U.S. officials eventually clarified that the ban didn't apply to American citizens or permanent residents — but by then, panic-buying most likely inflated the number of people trying to reenter at once. — The administration also dramatically narrowed the number of places where air travelers returning from Europe could enter the U.S. — currently just 13 airports. At the same time, Customs and Border Protection and health officials on Friday began doing ""enhanced screening"" for those passengers, consisting of temperature checks and questions about travel history and symptoms, without having enough staff on hand to process them quickly. — Customs staffing levels have been inadequate for some time. The union representing Customs screeners said at a hearing in December that the force was short 2,700 officers, partly as a result of the administration’s decision to temporarily reassign people to the U.S.-Mexican border. — In the early weeks of the outbreak, the administration was slow to ramp up screening at international airports, even for travelers re-entering the United States from known coronavirus hot spots. Harvard public health researchers warned in early March that the screening procedures in place then would miss as many as two-thirds of U.S.-bound passengers entering the U.S. Now, public health officials are expressing concern that the passengers crammed shoulder-to-shoulder in airport screening lines are at higher risk for catching and then spreading the virus. “It’s not good public health policy to have crowds of people in tight spaces, especially people who are returning from places where we know there’s widespread transmission occurring,” said John Auerbach, president and CEO of Trust for America’s Health. He added that there should be serious consideration of unintended consequences of the policies being implemented. Illinois leaders blamed the Trump administration for the latest mess, saying it was apparently unprepared to carry out its own orders. “Appears source of delays all federal and Admin was unprepared after Presidential ban on travel from Europe,” said Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin on Twitter. The state’s governor, JB Pritzker, wrote: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW.” Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said Saturday that the added screenings are only taking around 60 seconds per passenger. But that doesn’t help if not enough screeners are on duty. And some passengers complained on social media that they waited as long as six or seven hours to be screened. CBP's acting commissioner, Mark Morgan, said in a statement Sunday that the agency is ""working diligently to address the longer than usual delays"" and several airports are already improving. A spokesperson was not able to provide details about any specific steps the agency had taken to get lines under control. ""We appreciate the patience of the traveling public as we deal with this unprecedented situation,"" Morgan said. ""We’re continuing to balance our efficiencies with ensuring the health and safety of all American citizens through enhanced medical screening."" The thousands of people who have been jammed into close quarters while waiting for their bags and customs checks could be at a greater health risk because of the situation. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Fox News Sunday the crowds are “countermanding” the administration’s own mitigation efforts. Public health officials have frequently stressed the importance of social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. “What people need to understand is if you're an American is if you're an American citizen, you can get back,” Fauci said. “You don't need to rush back, you will be able to get back but it's understandable how when people see the travel ban, they immediately want to hunker and get home. “Hopefully we don't have more of that, but I think we probably unfortunately will see that,"" he said. Mike Fraser, executive director for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the large crowds at ports of entry are concerning. “While travel home is essential for these individuals, I would hope federal and airport authorities would work with the airlines and state and local health agencies to practice appropriate infection control measures everywhere, but especially in places were crowds are gathered and recommend staggered arrivals to reduce the number of people congregating in one place, ""Fraser said. “At this time, the goal is to prevent transmission of disease. Any crowded space — churches, grocery stores, airports — all increase the probability of transmission,” said Joyce Johnson, a senior retired U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer. These enhanced screenings are also starting too late, following weeks while the virus was already rapidly spreading around the world. The administration’s initial screening efforts focused on travelers from China, even after it had become clear that the virus had spread to other countries. Marc Lipsitch, head of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, has said the lax screening of infected travelers may have led to the outbreak in Washington state, the first U.S. state the virus swept through. Before this weekend, alarmed passengers had reported on social media what they considered lax screening as they returned to the U.S. Jenn Bartick, a California attorney, told POLITICO that she flew back from Italy two weeks ago and went through “no screening of any type."" She said no one asked her if she had been in the parts of Italy that have been hardest hit by the virus, a spread that since prompted Italian authorities to shut down the entire country. She said when she boarded the plane in Italy, “they asked if I had been to China in the past 14 days. No further screening.” She’s been unable to get a test because she doesn’t have symptoms and is self-quarantining. A U.S. businessman who flew recently from Hong Kong told POLITICO that the screening he underwent at Los Angeles International Airport was ""a joke."" “As opposed to all arrivals and departures at all Asian airports there was no temperature taking,” said the businessman, who has lived in China and other Asian countries for decades and requested anonymity because he doesn't want to “get blacklisted on flights” to the United States added: “No questions, nothing. Couldn’t get rid of the passengers fast enough.” Customs officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment about those passengers’ accounts. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) has asked the federal government to expand screening beyond air travel, by requiring temperature checks for all passengers boarding not just airplanes but mass transit. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, told lawmakers last week that passenger screening “bought us time” but said travel restrictions and screenings were never “intended to be a hermetically sealed process.”",Terminal crush: Air passengers caught in Trump's travel ban,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/air-passengers-crush-coronavirus-trump-130251,politico
"The nation’s top infectious diseases expert has a stern warning to young people: Don’t get complacent about statistics showing that serious coronavirus cases and fatalities are skewed toward the elderly and those with underlying health issues.  “You are not immune or safe from getting seriously ill,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” when asked if younger Americans should be concerned about contracting the virus, which Fauci has repeatedly said is more lethal than the average flu.  “Even though when you look at the total numbers, it's overwhelmingly weighted toward the elderly and those with underlying conditions,” he explained, “the virus isn't a mathematical formula. There are going to be people who are young who are going to wind up getting seriously ill.”  In addition, Fauci said it was critical for young people to understand that they can be a carrier for the virus and spread it without showing symptoms or feeling ill themselves.  “Even though you don't get seriously ill, you could bring it to a person who would bring it to a person that would bring it to your grandfather, your grandmother, or your elderly relative,” he argued. “That's why everybody's got to take this seriously, even the young.” In appearances on every major Sunday morning talk show, Fauci preached the importance of practicing social distancing for containing the spread of coronavirus cases, which have exploded in the U.S. in recent weeks as well as other hot spots all over the globe, including Italy, Iran and South Korea.  He and other health officials have pleaded for people to hunker down in an attempt to blunt the spread and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. When asked about crowds still heading to restaurants and bars over the weekend, Fauci said that there was serious room for improvement. “I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and in bars,” he said. “Whatever it takes to do that, that's what I would like to see.”  Some local governments and businesses have stepped up to attempt to force social separation, banning mass gatherings and slashing business hours. The issue was unavoidable over the weekend for scores of travelers who tried to rush back to the U.S. in the wake of a new travel ban by the administration, crowding airports across the country, which Fauci called “unfortunate” and “not what you like to see.”  But where social interaction is able to be avoided, Fauci said that sacrifices in people’s lifestyles are imperative to heading off a crisis the likes of which countries like Italy are grappling with. “Certainly it is conceivable that if we don't do that you could get as bad as Italy,” he warned. “But I don't think we're going there, if we do the kind of things that we're publicly saying we need to do. We need to be very serious about, for a while, life is not going to be the way it used to be in the United States. We have to just accept that if we want to do what's best for the American public.” ",'Everybody's got to take this seriously': Fauci warns against coronavirus indifference among young people ,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-young-people-130229,politico

But “if the medical professionals are correct and we are doing all the things, I expect we’ll have a big rebound later in the year,” Mnuchin said, arguing the current market rout has disparate origins than the Great Depression and other past declines — and thus isn't comparable. “This will have an end to it as we confront the virus."" Mnuchin said his primary focus at the moment is the passage of the congressional aid package, which passed the House after midnight on Friday and which President Donald Trump has pledged to sign if it passes the Senate. That legislation would act as a complement to an $8.3 billion emergency aid bill Congress approved earlier this month, and it would precede a stimulus package aimed at propping up the hard-hit travel industry on which he said negotiations would begin this week.  “We need to get economic relief to the people that are impacted by this, and, as I have described this, we are in the second inning. The first inning was the $8 billion, the second inning we passed bipartisan legislation to make sure that workers that need to be home and small- and medium-size businesses will get paid,” he said. “We are now going back to Congress and focusing this week on the airlines industry, the hotel industry, the cruise ship — there's no question that the travel industry has been impacted like we've never seen before.”  He declined to put a price tag on the latest aid package, pointing to the unknown extent of the virus’ spread and how many workers would need the paid sick leave included in the latest stimulus bill. The cost would be “significant,” he said, “but not huge.”  The secretary also would not predict how big of a hit the economy would take, instead reiterating that investors “need to focus on the long term” and pushing back on the idea that relief measures under consideration should be classified as a bailout, a term the Trump administration has sought to avoid. Unlike the 2008 recession, which was underpinned by the burst of the housing bubble and other structural weaknesses in the financial sector, there are no such issues contributing to the market tumble, Mnuchin argued. “If you are providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you’re taking collateral and you have security, that's not a bailout,” Mnuchin reasoned. “To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted, again — our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted it.”  While he stressed that there will be businesses “that will be severely impacted” by the collapse of consumer spending while Americans are urged to exercise social distancing, “we are focused on helping those businesses that need liquidity.”",Mnuchin dodges on specifics of coronavirus' economic impact,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/mnuchin-coronavirus-economic-impact-130163,politico
"If you’re in angst-ridden quarantine, you’ll probably be finding it hard to take your mind off things. One high-risk strategy — not for those of a nervous disposition — is to dive headlong into some of literature’s most horrific plagues, via Sophocles to Albert Camus, to put things in perspective. There’s some solace in the unity of human experience over the centuries. Big themes — terrifying incomprehension, the vulnerability of doctors and the emergence of cynical profiteers — recur across the centuries. Do you feel guilty about your obsessive addiction to the daily tolls of infections and deaths? Well, the English writers Samuel Pepys and Daniel Defoe shared the same fascination. If you are ever feeling really down, remember Giovanni Boccaccio’s cheery observation from the 14th century that in plague-infested days “a dead man was then of no more account than a dead goat.” See, you must be feeling better already … Here are some feel-good classics: The quintessential novel about how the human psyche reacts in times of plague, confinement and fear of death. The characters in Camus’ story reflect the entire spectrum of behavior, ranging from the scientific, matter-of-fact approach of Rieux, a doctor who combats the plague ravaging the Algerian port city of Oran, to the profiteering Cottard, who relishes in the collective misfortune but eventually goes mad, and Father Paneloux, who finds solace in God’s will but is eventually taken ill. The Plague is an ode to humanity in its darkest times. Camus was a fan of Defoe and owes much to the Englishman’s compelling piece of faux journalism, in which plague-ridden London in 1665 is the seething ant colony of human foibles that comes under the magnifying glass. (It is written as a supposed eyewitness account, but Defoe was only 5 at the time.) The narrator muses on everything from divine will and the rise of con men to the rights and wrongs of shutting people in their houses. There are vivid vignettes including a brutal scene in which blaspheming boozers at the Pye Tavern in Houndsditch taunt a distraught man who has just seen his wife and children flung into a mass grave. Defoe ends on the bleak note that the survivors’ gratefulness to God would prove short lived and that they would slide back into their old habits. Unlike Defoe, the debonair and adulterous diarist Pepys is a bona fide witness to the horrors of the bubonic plague epidemic of 1665 that killed a quarter of Londoners. It’s a haunting vision of depopulation, fires in the streets and the ceaseless tolling of bells. Famously declaring “God preserve us all!” he loses close acquaintances including his baker to the pestilence and chews tobacco in the hope that it is an antidote. While extremely careful in some respects, Pepys is also an oyster-slurping playboy with a penchant for extramarital liaisons who takes astonishing risks in visiting his mistress, whose servant died of plague. His career goes from strength to strength and he finally describes 1665 as a year in which he “never lived so merrily.” Compulsory reading for Italian high school students, The Betrothed gives a historically accurate account of the bubonic plague that wiped out a quarter of Milan’s population in 1629-1631. Particularly poignant is Manzoni’s description of the crowd’s descent into a collective psychosis and the public lynching and unfair prosecution of people wrongly accused of intentionally spreading the plague, the “untori.” Parallels with recent attacks on people of Asian descent are painfully obvious. In a lighter approach to the plague theme, Boccaccio imagines a group of 10 youths fleeing the Black Death ravaging Florence and finding refuge in the Tuscan hills. They entertain themselves by narrating a tale a day for 10 days, giving 100 stories ranging from the tragic to the facetious and ribald (Decameron means “10 days” in Greek). If you can’t find a copy in your solitary confinement, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1971 movie adaptation, with music by the old maestro Ennio Morricone, is an excellent alternative. A writer develops an obsessive, unrequited love for a beautiful youth. Meanwhile, a mysterious cholera from the Ganges quickly spreads through Venice’s maze of canals. Mann’s novella is less about the plague than about the tension between Apollonian restraint and Dionysian abandon, but it is obligatory reading, and you will succumb to Mann’s beautiful writing. The Last Man by Mary Shelley, who’s better known for Frankenstein, is often described as English literature’s first apocalypse novel. It takes place in the late 21st century (as described by someone living in the early 19th century — the Ottoman Empire’s still going strong in her vision of the future) when a deadly plague of unknown nature sweeps across the world. The book is heavily inspired by tragic events in Shelley’s life, such as the death of her husband and children, which is reflected in the novel’s grim ending: Humans die by the millions, until only the titular last man is left alive. The Greek historian Thucydides wins his place on our list for being not only an eyewitness but also a survivor of the plague that tore through Athens from 430 B.C. There’s no consensus about what the disease was, but it was vicious: It caused unquenchable thirst, fever, spasms, ulcers, vomiting and total memory loss. It weakened Athens in its war with Sparta and claimed the life of the city’s great statesman, Pericles. Thucydides notes that it also sparked a breakdown in law and morals, with people frittering their money away on life’s pleasures. In his tragedy Oedipus Rex, performed in 429 B.C., Sophocles opens the action in a city brought low by plague. “The fire-bearing god, the most hateful pestilence, hath swooped down on our city,” as the playwright puts it. And that’s before things turn truly tragic! In this brief and powerful book, a young physical education teacher in Newark, New Jersey, tries to keep a level head as polio consumes his community. Panic gradually takes hold in the 1950s Weequahic neighborhood, with no cure in sight and no understanding of how the disease spreads. When a research satellite crashes in Arizona, everyone in a nearby town dies from a mysterious ailment that either clots their blood or causes them to to kill themselves in bizarre ways. The race is on for scientists from the Wildfire task force to contain the alien micro-organism and understand why two very unlikely people appear to be immune.

"Bernie Sanders is facing a host of questions before Sunday’s debate. How directly will he challenge Joe Biden? Is he betting on a miraculous turnaround in Florida, Illinois and Ohio? Or is he effectively conceding the nomination and staying in the race just to try to persuade Biden to embrace more of the Sanders agenda? But Biden is the 2020 candidate who faces the more consequential questions in this debate: How far will he go to embrace Sanders out of a desire for party unity, and how much of a risk is he taking by doing so? Here, history provides a cautionary lesson. When the presumptive presidential nominee of a political party goes too far to placate a noisy ideological minority, the results can backfire—and might even presage defeat in November. In 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon was in a position not all that different from Biden’s. He was on a glide path to the Republican presidential nomination. His most likely challenger, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, had taken himself out of the running at the end of 1959, declaring that “this decision is definite and final.” But by the summer of 1960, Rocky was showing unmistakable signs that he might be changing his mind. In June, after a White House meeting, he issued a blistering statement arguing that “those now assuming control of the Republican Party have failed to make clear where the party is heading and where it proposes to lead the nation. … I find it unreasonable in these times that the leading Republican candidate for the presidential nomination has firmly insisted upon making known his program and his policies not before but only after nomination by this party.” He called President Dwight D. Eisenhower the next day to test the possibility of a presidential endorsement of his candidacy. There was, in fact, virtually no support within the Republican establishment for a Rockefeller run, just like there is very little support in the Democratic establishment for a Sanders presidency today. But that did not stop the New York governor from challenging his party, specifically on its platform, on issues ranging from defense spending (he wanted a lot more) to civil rights to medical care. And that challenge was one Nixon desperately wanted to avoid. So, without consulting his advisers, Nixon sought a personal meeting with Rockefeller. It was granted, on terms that very much made Nixon look like a supplicant. He had to publicly ask for the meeting, which also had to be at Rockefeller’s Fifth Avenue triplex in Manhattan. And most importantly, when Nixon left the meeting at 3 a.m., he and Rockefeller had signed on to platform language that more or less repudiated Eisenhower and the Republicans across a range of concerns—especially on civil rights. On that issue, the compact’s strong language (“aggressive action to remove the remaining vestiges of segregation or discrimination in all areas of national life” and “support for the objectives of the sit-in demonstrators”) was admirable, but it undermined the tightrope Nixon was intending to walk between his party’s Northern liberals and its Southern whites. The document—labeled “the Compact of Fifth Avenue”—was the political equivalent of a hand grenade. Conservatives, who carried a deep antipathy toward the deep-pocketed Eastern internationalist wing of the GOP that had denied them a presidential nomination for two decades, were furious Nixon had bent the knee to the symbolic leader of that wing. Some were angry enough to place in nomination the name of an emerging conservative hero, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Addressing the convention that summer, Goldwater said: “Let’s grow up, conservatives. … If we want to take this party back—and I think we can someday—let’s go to work.” Just four years later, Goldwater won the nomination before going down to a landslide loss in November to President Lyndon B. Johnson. The Republican Party did not adopt the Nixon-Rockefeller language on civil rights, but that language did cause Nixon a significant headache as he sought to replicate the gains in the South that Eisenhower, who carried Texas and Louisiana in 1956, had made in previous elections. So what’s the lesson here for Biden? It’s that he needs to walk a fine line between respecting Sanders and his base and accommodating too many of their ideas, which Biden has explicitly opposed throughout the campaign. When they were offered a clear, binary choice between Sanders and a less militantly left candidate, Democratic voters went for the relative centrist by significant margins. Seemingly out of nowhere, a broad coalition emerged—led by landslide majorities of African Americans—that that rejected the idea that a “political revolution” was the key to winning the White House. They support comprehensive immigration reform and protection for Dreamers—but they do not necessarily support free health care and college tuition for undocumented immigrants. They favor restoring voting rights for felons who have served their time; they do not necessarily support voting rights for felons who are still in prison. They favor expanded health care, but they do not favor a plan that would effectively abolish all private health insurance. For the presumptive nominee of a party—which is what Biden is very close to becoming—there is a point where reaching out to unify the party crosses over into appeasement. Something like that almost happened in 1980, when Ronald Reagan came close to offering former president Gerald Ford the vice presidential slot on his ticket. Emissaries for Ford, including Henry Kissinger, were busily negotiating a range of duties for Ford that would have amounted (in Walter Cronkite’s words) to “something of a co-presidency”. It would have been a confession of weakness, a signal that Reagan doubted his own capacity for the job of chief executive. Luckily for the Gipper, the deal fell apart. Biden should recognize the spirited campaigns Sanders has run, the passion of his followers and his achievement in forcing the Democratic Party to confront the nation’s yawning inequality, which requires major repair. And he should highlight his own ideas about increased taxes on the wealthy, criminal justice reform, and an ambitious health care plan that address some, but not all, of concerns of Sanders supporters. But Biden also needs to act in a way that reminds his party and his country who is winning the most votes from Democrats and who will almost surely prevail when the convention assembles in Milwaukee. One more point: When and if the two meet for an endorsement rally, it would be wise to hold it in Wilmington, Delaware, not Burlington, Vermont.",Why Biden Shouldn’t Unify Too Much with Sanders,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/15/biden-sanders-debate-2020-128731,politico
"The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Fair Isaac Corp., the financial company whose credit scores underlie nearly all U.S. consumer credit decisions, according to information obtained by POLITICO. The probe follows years of complaints from rivals about Fair Isaac's dominance, and comes amid efforts by Congress and financial regulators to inject more competition into the credit score market. Fair Isaac's FICO scores are a measure of risk that banks and credit card companies use to make lending decisions, and are used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to determine creditworthiness of mortgage applicants. The exact scope of the DOJ’s antitrust investigation isn’t yet known. The agency recently sent letters to Fair Issac and others in the consumer credit industry asking them to preserve documents, according to a person knowledgeable about the case who was not authorized to speak about it. Such hold-letters are the first step in an investigation. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment Friday night. But Fair Isaac, also known as FICO, confirmed the existence of the probe Sunday, saying it focuses on “potential exclusionary conduct."" “FICO intends to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice and looks forward to a constructive dialogue about the state of competition in our industry,” the company said in a statement. “FICO is confident the Department will conclude that it has not engaged in any exclusionary conduct.” The company noted that it is also involved in an antitrust suit brought by credit reporting agency TransUnion, which that company filed after Fair Isaac sued it for unpaid royalties. Fair Isaac founded the FICO score in 1956 and has issued more than 100 billion scores, according to its website. The scores are based on information collected by TransUnion and the other two large credit reporting agencies, Experian and Equifax. The credit reporting agencies also sell FICO scores to lenders. In 2006, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion introduced their own credit scoring model, known as VantageScore. Fair Isaac sued the three agencies for antitrust violations, but a court later dismissed those allegations. A federal jury later sided with VantageScore that it didn’t violate Fair Isaac’s trademarks or engage in unfair competition. Fair Isaac also sued TransUnion in 2017 for breach of contract, copyright infringement and other allegations. TransUnion countersued Fair Isaac for antitrust violations. A Chicago federal judge ruled last year that TransUnion can move forward with its antitrust allegations. Congress and regulators, meanwhile, have sought to lessen Fair Isaac's grip on the credit score market. In a 2018 law that sought to roll back some of the banking reforms in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Congress ordered the Federal Housing Finance Agency to establish rules and criteria for the credit scoring models used by Fannie and Freddie. A December 2018 proposed rule by FHFA would have effectively prohibited Fannie and Freddie from using VantageScore over concerns about conflicts of interest. But the final rule, issued in August, switched gears and allowed the government-sponsored entities to make use of VantageScore as an alternative to FICO scores. VantageScore didn’t immediately return calls and emails for comment sent after business hours Friday. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion also didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",DOJ opens antitrust probe into credit score giant Fair Isaac,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/justice-fair-isaac-antitrust-129204,politico

"Social distancing hit the set of President Donald Trump's favorite morning cable news show Tuesday, with the three hosts of ""Fox & Friends"" scattered across their New York studio in an effort to demonstrate best practices amid the coronavirus pandemic.  ""To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart — same studio, plenty of distance,"" co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers at the top of the broadcast.   The right-leaning talk show, which airs weekdays from 6-9 a.m. ET and has achieved outsized influence under Trump's administration, is the latest TV news program to employ the preventative measure as the outbreak tears across the United States. Although the CDC recommends that Americans maintain a distance of six feet to help thwart the coronavirus' rapid spread, co-host Steve Doocy said that he and his colleagues usually sit only about 18 inches apart on the signature ""curvy couch"" of the ""Fox & Friends"" set. Tuesday morning, however, Doocy was alone on the mezzanine-level sofa, while Kimeade anchored ""the big plastic desk"" one floor below and co-host Ainsley Earhardt was stationed at a lectern nearby in the studio's ""fish bowl area."" ""We're doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is stay away from each other because you don't want to get infected and you don't want to spread infection,"" Doocy said. ""We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,"" Earhardt added. ""And so if you can keep your distance and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly and help our country as a nation.""  The new seating configuration reflects the seriousness with which President Donald Trump and his staunchest allies, both in media and politics, are now taking the nature of the coronavirus threat after previously being dismissive of its risk to Americans. The on-air talent and guests at Fox News have drawn special scrutiny for downplaying the disease in recent weeks. Just last Friday, Earhardt remarked that it was ""actually the safest time to fly"" despite advisories against nonessential travel, and conservative religious leader Jerry Falwell Jr. appeared on the program to accuse people of ""overreacting"" to the coronavirus. ""It makes you wonder if there's a political reason for that,"" Falwell said. ""You know, impeachment didn't work, and the Mueller report didn't work, and Article 25 didn't work. And so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.""",The president’s favorite morning show starts social distancing,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fox-and-friends-social-distancing-133619,politico

"Few Americans trust President Donald Trump when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, and less than half of respondents believe the federal government is taking sufficient steps to combat the public health crisis.  An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Tuesday shows that only 37 percent of those polled have either “a good amount” or “a great deal” of trust in the the information they hear from the president about the coronavirus, while 60 percent say they do “not very much” or “not at all” trust Trump’s words on the subject.  The president’s trust ratings regarding the coronavirus rank lower among those surveyed than other prominent sources of information, including the news media, state and local governments, and public health experts. More Americans than not disapprove of the way he is handling the pandemic, by a margin of 49-44 percent, and his overall job approval rating rests at 43 percent. The poll’s results come after the White House spent weeks downplaying the coronavirus’ threat to the United States, even as public health officials within the administration sounded alarms over its risk to the country and warned of its rapid rates of transmission. Only recently has Trump adopted a more somber tone when discussing the crisis, acknowledging Tuesday that “this is a very bad one” and cautioning Americans that “we have an invisible enemy” in the coronavirus.  The more dire rhetoric from the president was accompanied by a new series of increasingly stern guidelines from the administration, which recommended avoiding group gatherings of more than 10 people, working or attending school from home whenever possible, and abstaining from eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts. It remains to be seen whether the latest measures will bolster public confidence in the administration’s ability to fight the coronavirus. Just 46 percent of Americans believe the federal government is doing enough to prevent the disease’s spread, down from 61 percent in February. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll was conducted March 13-14, surveying 835 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",Poll: Most Americans don’t trust Trump on coronavirus information,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/poll-americans-lack-trust-in-trump-on-coronavirus-information-133576,politico

"There’s an easy way to tell that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi negotiated a bad deal on the bipartisan coronavirus response bill that Congress is expected to pass this week. It’s not the liberal complaints that she let the White House limit paid sick leave to about one-fifth of U.S. workers. It’s not the Republican complaints that the bill doesn’t provide tax relief and cash for businesses and individuals hurt by the pandemic. It’s not even the general consensus that this initial legislation will need to be followed up by a much more aggressive economic stimulus bill. No, the easy way to tell Pelosi negotiated a bad deal for Democrats is that she negotiated a deal at all—rather than dictating the terms and telling President Donald Trump to take them or leave them. The lesson of the last congressional response to an economic emergency, President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill, is that when a president desperately needs legislation to address a crisis, anyone with the power to stop him can decide what’s in it. When Obama took office, in the midst of the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression, Democrats controlled the House and Senate as well. But they needed 60 votes to break a Republican filibuster in the Senate, and there were only 57 Democratic senators, which meant Obama had to recruit three Republicans to vote for a stimulus bill. In just his second week in office, his blunt-spoken chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, had to pose a blunt-spoken question to Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania: Whaddya want? Specter’s ask was simple, and by Washington horse-trading standards, noble. He wanted $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health. Then he would vote for the Obama stimulus. “Are you f---ing kidding me?” Emanuel exploded. Emanuel assumed $10 billion-with-a-b was just Specter’s initial bid, a shock-tactic negotiating ploy. But Specter gruffly said no, that was his final offer, take it or leave it. “What the f--- does a vote cost around here?” Emanuel screamed. In Specter’s case, it cost precisely $10 billion. He understood that Obama needed his vote to fix the economy, so he held all the leverage. But today’s congressional Democrats don’t seem to understand that at all. Right now, after initially downplaying the threat of coronavirus, then bungling the response to the pandemic, then watching the swift demise of the bull market he had hailed as proof of his leadership, Trump absolutely needs congressional action to limit the public health disaster and mitigate the economic damage on his watch. House Democrats can pass whatever bill they want, and if Republicans aren’t willing to go along with it, another lesson of American crisis politics is that it’s Trump who will suffer the consequences. Some Democrats have fretted that they might suffer politically if they don’t help Trump clean up the mess, but the opposite happened in 2009. The Republican minority in the House unanimously refused to support Obama’s stimulus, even though the crisis had exploded on his Republican predecessor’s watch, and the very next year those same Republicans took back the majority in the House. In fact, the only Republican in Congress who paid a political price was Specter, who had to switch to the Democratic Party after a GOP backlash over his vote for Obama’s stimulus, and ended up losing his seat anyway. In 2020, Democrats are not acting like a party with that kind of leverage. Instead, Pelosi frantically hashed out a compromise on Friday over 13 phone calls with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who accepted Democratic proposals to expand free COVID-19 testing and unemployment benefits, along with a modest boost in food aid for the poor, but made it clear that permanent legislation mandating universal sick leave was a “non-starter” for Republicans. Trump ratcheted up the pressure by complaining publicly that Democrats weren’t “giving enough” in the negotiations, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the House proposals as “an ideological wish list.” Ultimately, Democrats accepted a temporary mandate that only applies to companies smaller than 500 employees, and allows companies smaller than 50 employees to seek exemptions.  “Democrats preferred to have something rather than nothing,” a Democratic source explained to CNN’s Jake Tapper. “That was the choice we faced.” That was not the choice Democrats faced. Unlike the Republicans in 2009, who only had a filibuster-proof minority in the Senate, they also have a majority in the House, where they could have attached anything they wanted to the must-pass coronavirus testing and dared Republicans to say no.  If the president was unwilling to approve measures to help contain a pandemic and limit the economic fallout because he didn’t want sick workers to be guaranteed paid leave, he could have explained that to the public. He’s the president, the head of state, the “I alone can fix it” guy. He’s the one who will be judged by the outcome of the crisis that he initially insisted was not a crisis, then declared was under control thanks to his leadership. After all, Obama was held responsible for an economic crisis that erupted on George W. Bush’s watch, and the party that fought his efforts to fix the crisis ended up taking back the House, the Senate and eventually the White House. The public doesn’t follow the details of legislation on Capitol Hill, but it blames presidents for bad outcomes. The public also tends to blame presidents for partisan paralysis, while giving them credit for bipartisan cooperation; that’s why McConnell understood he could make Obama look partisan by fighting him, even though Obama’s stimulus was stuffed with tax cuts and other Republican priorities. It is true that Democrats would be accused of trying to exploit the crisis if they tried to load up a coronavirus bill with unrelated priorities such as, say, a Green New Deal to fight the climate crisis—although it’s worth noting that Trump and McConnell have already accused them of trying to exploit the crisis just for trying to mandate sick leave during a pandemic. But they still have the leverage to shape legislation just about any way they want if they’re willing to take the heat. In 2009, Republican Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine used her leverage to demand that the Obama stimulus include a technical fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax that added $70 billion to the price tag while providing virtually no economic stimulus. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine insisted on stripping a school construction initiative out of Obama’s stimulus—along with, ironically, an $870 million line item for pandemic preparedness. The 57 Democrats in the Senate also had the power to extract concessions for their votes; Obama had wanted a stimulus without congressional earmarks, but Dick Durbin of Illinois managed to include one for a $1 billion carbon-capture plant that never ended up getting built. Setting aside the question of whether Democrats should try to exploit the leverage to advance long-term policy priorities, they can absolutely exploit their leverage to address the short-term crisis. If they think universal sick leave will help, they should demand universal sick leave. Meanwhile, with Louisiana and Georgia already postponing primaries over the virus, why shouldn’t Democrats attach provisions guaranteeing that Americans will be able to vote by mail in November? Jeff Hauser, director of the left-leaning Revolving Door Project, doesn’t understand why the Democrats didn’t insist on provisions restoring congressional oversight powers to help them ride herd on the administration’s response to the virus, ensuring that Trump and his aides can no longer defy subpoenas for documents and witnesses. Again, if Trump thinks it’s so important to prevent Americans from voting by mail and preventing Congress from overseeing his administration that he would block measures to accelerate the pandemic testing that his own team has botched, he can try to convince the public. “House Democrats don’t have some leverage,” Hauser says. “They have complete leverage.” By giving Trump the emergency measures that he needs most without insisting on the worker protections that Democrats wanted most, Pelosi has sacrificed some of that leverage. She has also helped the president look like a bipartisan consensus-builder, while essentially confirming the GOP talking point that Democrats have a responsibility to meet Trump’s demands in order to avoid a partisan stalemate. In 2009, Republicans simply ignored all the pundits warning that they would pay a huge political price for refusing to help the first black president fix an economic mess he had inherited—and the pundits turned out to be wrong. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders argue that it’s their duty to help Trump save lives and jobs in 2020, even though Republicans didn’t help Obama in 2009, even though Trump routinely calls them traitors, even though an economic downturn could doom his reelection. They’re pro-government people; they’re not inclined to stand in the way of government action during a crisis. When the Great Recession was just getting started in January 2008, Pelosi negotiated a quick bipartisan stimulus bill with Bush’s Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, and within months Americans were receiving $1000 checks from the federal government. It’s an honorable approach, even though it also probably reduces Pelosi’s leverage. It’s hard to win a game of chicken when the other driver knows you’re committed to avoiding a crash. Once Trump signs this emergency response bill, he’ll start clamoring for a much larger economic stimulus bill loaded with tax cuts for airlines, cruise lines, his own hospitality industry and other Republican-friendly businesses, along with payroll tax cuts that can help get him reelected. And Democrats will find that many of the same Republicans who mocked the idea of using taxpayer dollars to stimulate the private economy as big government when Obama was in the White House—even though they had supported that bipartisan stimulus bill under Bush—will rediscover the attraction of Keynesian economics when it suits their party’s interests. Democrats will have to decide whether to meet Trump in the middle, or whether to risk the obstructionist label by holding out for what they want in a time of economic pain. They will also have to decide exactly what it is they want. Some of Obama’s top economists have publicly called for Congress to send checks to American citizens, which would help the economy and also Trump’s reelection prospects. Again, that’s honorable and responsible, especially since Trump is sure to denounce the Democrats as obstructionists no matter what happens, but it’s not clear it squares with Democratic rhetoric about the danger of Trump’s reelection, especially if they don’t get anything in exchange for helping to rescue the sinking Trump economy. In any case, Trump won’t be able to pass a stimulus bill without them. At a minimum, one thing they can demand for their cooperation is legislative assurance that economic stimulus can no longer be something that only happens routinely under Republican presidents. They should insist on more robust “automatic stabilizers” so that any time the economy craters, no matter who’s in the White House, Washington will automatically spend far more on food stamps, unemployment insurance and other aid to vulnerable families, and perhaps automatically roll back payroll taxes and other economic burdens. That way, members of Congress will no longer have the power to take the economy hostage during crises. For now, though, Democrats absolutely have that power. They need to choose their ransom wisely.",Pelosi Has Trump Over a Barrel,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/nancy-pelosi-trump-stimulus-132388,politico
"Much of American public life is at a standstill. But not the Democratic presidential race — not yet at least. While some future voting has been postponed due to the burgeoning outbreak of coronavirus across the U.S., primaries in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois are still on for Tuesday. Polling places in Ohio, which was set to vote Tuesday, have been closed down by public health officials after the governor pushed to delay the primary amid the public health crisis. Despite that, think of the vote as Super Tuesday, Jr.: The 441 delegates up for grabs in the three states still voting today makes it the third-largest delegate haul on the calendar, behind only March 3 and the slate of primaries planned for April 28. But between the coronavirus beginning to ravage the nation, the unprecedented, widespread closures that have shuttered public spaces across the country and Joe Biden’s now-commanding lead over Bernie Sanders — in polls released on the eve of the March 17 contests, Biden holds double-digit leads across all four states — the primaries are flying below the radar for many Americans. Last week, officials in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio rejected calls to postpone Tuesday’s primaries, saying that they would make accommodations, including extending early-voting hours, to prevent large crowds from gathering. But on Monday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a court in Columbus for a last-minute postponement of the primary. When the court refused, saying it was too late to postpone, the state’s health department ordered the polling places shuttered — despite a lack of clarity about how, or even if, voters might be able to cast ballots in the primary. The Ohio Supreme Court later effectively upheld the decision to close the polls. Here’s a state-by-state look at the map for Tuesday: Democrats are hoping that Tuesday’s presidential primary is the springboard to flipping Arizona in November. President Donald Trump won the state by just 4 points in 2016, and polls conducted there show Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are both competitive against Trump in the general election. Arizona will likely be the closest of the four states voting on Tuesday, according to pre-election polls. But Biden still holds a double-digit lead over Sanders in poll after poll — despite Sanders’ enduring, though not overwhelming, advantage among Latino voters. Clinton defeated Sanders in Arizona four years ago. 56 percent to 41 percent, and carried all nine of the state’s congressional districts. Polls suggest Biden is on pace for a similar victory, barring a surprise. The state is going ahead with its primary despite the coronavirus outbreak. Many voters cast their ballots by mail, but there is still significant disruption. In Maricopa County — which includes Phoenix and is home to roughly 60 percent of registered voters — most polling places are closed for safety reasons. Instead, the county is operating about 150 vote centers on Tuesday, where voters can cast their ballots regardless of where they live within the county. Bernie Sanders was blown out by Hillary Clinton in Florida in 2016 — and his prospects are no more promising in 2020. Polls show Joe Biden with a two- or three-to-one advantage over Sanders, whose lack of support from older Democrats makes him particularly ill-suited for a state that is a magnet for retirees from the eastern third of the nation. Moreover, Sanders’ advantage with Latino voters in other states doesn’t translate to Florida, where many Hispanics are either immigrants or descend from immigrants from Caribbean and Latin American countries whose leftist leaders they despise. Polls show Sanders, who has praised some of the actions of those authoritarian governments, trailing Biden among Hispanic voters in Florida. The state has shuttered and consolidated a number of polling places because of the coronavirus outbreak. The state Democratic Party on Monday identified 91 precincts that were closed after GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered elections officials not to house polling places in nursing homes or assisted-living facilities. But DeSantis resisted calls to reschedule the presidential primaries. “We’re definitely voting,” he told reporters in Tallahassee last Friday. “They voted during the Civil War. We’re going to vote.” Polls close in virtually all of Florida at 7 p.m. Eastern — but remain open an hour later in portions of the Panhandle in the Central Time Zone. Bernie Sanders had the Democratic establishment on edge four years ago when he stormed out of Michigan victorious and nearly beat Hillary Clinton in her home state of Illinois a week later. But in 2020, neighboring Michigan delivered a 16-point rout for Biden and has deflated the Vermont senator’s campaign here. Mike Bloomberg had started to make inroads here but when he, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar folded their campaigns, most of their moderate supporters — and their donors — joined the Biden camp. Gov. J.B. Pritzker also delivered his endorsement to Biden on primary eve. A WGN-TV/Emerson College poll last week showed Biden leading Sanders by 20 percentage points among likely voters in Illinois. Sanders recently rallied in Chicago with Rep. Chuy Garcia and other local Latino officials to help shore up his support. But the cloud hanging over the Tuesday primary is the coronavirus outbreak. Schools have been ordered closed and polling stations are being moved out of senior centers as the number of cases tick up, so it’s unclear what voter turnout will look like. The saga of Ohio’s primary adds significant uncertainty to a race that otherwise seems one-sided. Biden led Sanders in the latest poll by 23 points — in a state Clinton carried by 13 points four years ago, winning all but 15 of the state’s 88 counties. Gov. Mike DeWine’s Monday night order closing the polling places came only about eight hours before they were set to open. DeWine said Secretary of State Frank LaRose would petition the courts “to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.” But it’s unclear how that opportunity would be extended, or when. The ambiguity extends beyond the presidential race. Ohio was set to hold all its primaries for the 2020 elections on Tuesday, including for Congress and state legislature.",How to watch Tuesday’s primaries like a pro,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/how-to-watch-tuesdays-primaries-133318,politico
"Bernie Sanders’ path to the Democratic nomination is closing, but a quick exit is far from guaranteed — even if he gets wiped out Tuesday. From his debate posture to staffing moves to the “virtual rally” he convened Monday evening, the Vermont senator is signaling that he may not be ready to concede.  If Sanders remains in the race, it will be in part to keep his “political revolution” alive. According to people familiar with his thinking, Sanders will not only consider what’s best for his campaign, but also the progressive movement. Many of Sanders’ aides and allies also expect him to press onward after Tuesday. They see a benefit in amassing as many delegates as possible in order to influence the party platform at the Democratic National Convention this summer — even if Sanders himself can’t win the nomination. “I think there’s a very good chance that he will stay in,” said Larry Cohen, chair of Our Revolution, a group founded by Sanders in 2016. “The number of delegates you have, the number of people on the platform committee is absolutely critical.” Notably, Sanders has staff in place for states that vote as late as April 28, according to a campaign adviser, including New York. Sanders’ aides have long thought that he would have a good shot in the Empire State, which is rich in delegates. Earlier this month, Sanders’ team announced it was opening five offices in Pennsylvania, a state seen by many local and state officials as Joe Biden’s second home. A former aide close to the Sanders campaign said that a senior staffer argued as recently as last week that there is still a path to victory even if Sanders suffers major losses Tuesday. “I think he’s in. Who is going to advise him to drop out?” the person said, adding that current aides can “work for whatever group Bernie starts next.” At Sunday’s debate, Sanders not only tried to push Biden’s agenda to the left, but also litigated his past votes extensively. When the former vice president offered him an olive branch by adopting a plan to make college free for families earning less than $125,000 annually, Sanders said it didn’t go far enough. “What I know about Sen. Sanders’ thought process and focus is, it’s all about representing the movement and leading what he initially called the political revolution,” said Kurt Ehrenberg, Sanders’ longtime political strategist in New Hampshire until last year. “And not letting down the people who have been with him all along. I think that’s the most important consideration for him.” The fact that states are postponing their primaries to combat the coronavirus outbreak could provide Sanders more incentive to stay in the race. Georgia, Louisiana and Kentucky, which had previously been scheduled to vote in March, April and May, respectively, have rescheduled their primaries. Party officials in Puerto Rico are in the process of requesting a delay.  If Puerto Rico reschedules its March 29 primary, it will be more than two weeks until the next regularly scheduled primaries.  At the same time, the pandemic and looming possibility of a recession — or even a full-fledged depression — could make it more likely that Sanders stays in because the stakes are so high. “In these very uncertain times, we need a president who is going to put the interests of everyday people over every other consideration — and that’s Bernie Sanders,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ senior adviser. “How do we know that? Because that’s been his consistent life’s work.” If Sanders continues his bid after Tuesday, he will face an onslaught of pressure from establishment Democrats and even some progressives to drop out. Many are wary of a long, divisive primary after 2016, and eager to take on President Donald Trump with the benefit of a united party. Jim Clyburn, whose endorsement helped fuel Biden’s comeback victory in South Carolina, said on the day of the March 10 primaries that the Democratic National Committee should “shut this primary down” and cancel debates if the former vice president swept the races, which he went on to do. Sanders’ electoral prospects are bleak. Momentum — and the delegate count — have shifted to Biden, who looks poised to win another string of contests decisively on Tuesday. “I think it could be much, much more constructive if he gets out earlier,” said Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Sanders during his 2016 campaign. “He’s still going to have roughly 1,000 delegates going into the convention, and that’s all the leverage that you need to influence the platform.” But Sanders often doesn’t follow the unwritten rules of campaigning that other politicians abide by. When he had a heart attack last year — the kind of event that would force most candidates out of an election — he stayed in the race. He also declined to bow out of the 2016 primary even after it was mathematically impossible to win the nomination, instead successfully pushing for a more progressive party platform and major rule changes. And at the same time that Sanders faces pressure from mainstream Democrats to exit, many on the left are encouraging him to stay in. Some Sanders supporters still remember when Biden was badly down in the primary before South Carolina, and envision a turnaround for their own candidate. “My urging to the campaign has been, ‘We’ve got to play this out,’” said Gil Cedillo, a Los Angeles city councilman and prominent Sanders ally. “We’ve got to play the whole game … I’m suggesting we don’t quit simply because now they’re up. Why should we?” Progressive activists see Sanders’ continued candidacy as significant to their movement, even if his chances narrow to almost impossible margins. Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the political action committee Democracy for America, said there is a “real question” about whether either Biden or Sanders can reach the delegate threshold necessary to secure the nomination outright and that the tumultuous nature of the race suggests Sanders should stay in. “I don’t think anyone can predict for sure what’s going to happen between now and the end of this primary contest,” he said. “There’s plenty of time, plenty of delegates left, and this game can change at any minute.” The Democratic Party, he said, “shouldn’t be about shutting it down” before more states vote. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is closely aligned with Elizabeth Warren, urged Sanders to remain in the race through at least March. “Not only should Bernie stay in, but it would actively hurt Democrats’ chances against Trump if he got out prematurely,” he said. “Because especially during this crisis, we need to know that our candidate is tested and stands for bold ideas like paid sick leave, free universal health care and canceling student debt as the right way to put money into the economy.” At the same time, Sanders loathes Trump and considers Biden a friend, which will also likely factor into his decision of whether to continue his bid for the White House after Tuesday. One thing is certain: Only Sanders and his wife, Jane, who has played an instrumental role in his 2020 operation, know for sure if he will carry onward. “All of the important decisions come from Bernie and Jane, as they should,” said Ehrenberg.",‘Who is going to advise him to drop out?’: Bernie may not be ready for quick exit,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-sanders-not-going-quietly-132641,politico
"For the second time in two years, Rep. Dan Lipinski — one of the last members of a dwindling breed of conservative House Democrats who oppose abortion rights — is at risk of losing his seat in a primary. The Illinois lawmaker faces a rematch Tuesday against Marie Newman, a progressive upstart who nearly unseated him in 2018. But what should have been the left’s clearest shot yet at the incumbent is mired in uncertainty, with high-profile progressives distracted by Sen. Bernie Sanders's floundering presidential campaign and the election itself enveloped by the coronavirus crisis. Both camps are at a loss for how to handicap the race. “I personally don’t know,” said Pete Brodnitz, a veteran Democratic pollster working with Lipinski. “You love to say you’re a guru about these things, but there’s too many things we don’t know the answer to.” Lipinski is liberals' highest-profile 2020 primary target. Lining up behind Newman are Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and the Justice Democrats.  Ousting him would be a much-needed victory for these progressives who have struggled to recapture the magic of 2018, including Ocasio-Cortez's defeat of a leading House Democrat, amid a series of roadblocks throughout the primary season. Their latest loss came on Super Tuesday, when Jessica Cisneros, a liberal challenger boosted by the Justice Democrats, failed to oust a moderate Democrat in South Texas. Other progressive Senate candidates also fell short in primaries in Texas and North Carolina. Lipinski's primary may have been their best chance for victory— before the coronavirus outbreak. Newman began March with clear momentum: She was outspending the incumbent on TV by a two-to-one margin, and Lipinski supporters were nervous enough that they had begun urging Republican-leaning voters to pull a Democratic ballot and cast it for the incumbent. The biggest question mark now is turnout. Both campaigns are operating under the assumption that it could be at a historic low, with leaders, including Illinois' governor, urging citizens to be cautious about venturing out into public spaces. Lipinski admitted in an interview last week he was combating a lot of unknowns. “We’ll see where the presidential primary is,” he told reporters in the Capitol. “You don’t know what’s going to happen, don’t know what the coronavirus — what impact that could have. So, just wait and see.” The Newman campaign has urged supporters to vote early, is prioritizing phone banking and canceled its election night party. Both teams could make a plausible case that low turnout is to their benefit, depending on the age and ideology of who shows up. Lipinski’s team thinks he could have an edge with older voters, who tend to be more reliable and may be more likely to go to the polls. Yet the coronavirus disproportionately affects those 60 and older and public health officials urged that demographic should remain in their homes as much as possible. Other liberal challengers, such Ocasio-Cortez, have won low-turnout races where the electorate is smaller and more ideological. The 2018 midterms brought roughly presidential-level primary turnout, and Newman came within 2,200 votes short of ousting Lipinski. Though a new policy by the House Democratic campaign arm that blacklists consultants who work with primary challengers cost her some top campaign talent, Newman said she feels better prepared this cycle. “As you can imagine, your first time out you learn a lot. And I did. And there’s things that I didn’t do well,"" she told reporters in a phone call last week.  Now ""we have an amazing voter outreach program,"" she said. ""I started fundraising a lot earlier this time.” Her campaign, she said, has knocked over 110,000 doors and made 90,000 phone calls. She had outraised Lipinski by more than $400,000 as of late February, and that contrast is particularly stark on television. Newman has funneled about $900,000 on television advertising, while Lipinski has dropped less than $450,000, according to an analysis obtained by POLITICO. Plus a coalition of pro-abortion-rights groups, including EMILY’s List, NARAL Pro-Choice and Planned Parenthood, have dropped about $1 million in TV ads knocking Lipinski. And outside allies who spent for Lipinski in 2018, such as the bipartisan group No Labels, have largely stayed out this cycle, leaving a stark disparity. “She’s got significantly more independent-expenditure resources than she had last time, and we have significantly less,” said Dave Heller, a media consultant for Lipinski, “which is the only reason why we’re worried.” Lipinski is reviled by the liberal wing of the party for a slew of positions and votes that range from defunding Planned Parenthood, to his 2010 opposition to the Affordable Care Act. (He is now notably running an ad touting his efforts to protect that law, attacking Newman for supporting a single-payer health care plan.) Still, Newman has centered her campaign more squarely around other issues like reducing gun violence and making health care affordable. She supports Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal. Lipinski has pitched himself as more in line with the district and suggests Newman is too extreme: ""We should remain focused on what’s important. What really holds us all together as Democrats: the type of agenda that we have had in the House with our majority in this Congress."" Yet there’s evidence to suggest his allies are leaning on independent and Republican voters to boost him in the Democratic primary. An internal campaign strategy document accidentally leaked in November suggested “GOP surrogates” could help Lipinski court Republican voters. Then this weekend, a Newman volunteer received what appeared to be an automated text message mobilizing GOP-leaning voters to ""stop"" Newman and Cook County (Ill.) prosecutor Kim Foxx. Asked last week about the possibility of courting Republican voters — Illinois doesn't have party registration, so voters can pull whichever party's primary ballot they request — Lipinski said it was not the focus of his outreach but suggested he would take their support. “I think it’s good to have more people vote in the Democratic primary, bring them into the Democratic Party,” he said. Lipinski was first elected in 2004, after his father, then-Rep. Bill Lipinski, announced his surprise retirement and persuaded the state Democratic Party to nominate his son to replace him on that fall's ballot. The younger Lipinski could benefit from Chicago machine politics that boosted him and his father in the past. He will need to run up the margins in the Chicago part of the district, as he did two years ago, while Newman is banking on support in the southwest suburbs. A win by Newman on Tuesday would bring a surge of energy to progressives disheartened by a stinging loss earlier this month against Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who has also opposed abortion rights.  Cuellar and his fellow moderates have hailed his victory over Cisneros, a 26-year-old immigration attorney, as an indicator that their caucus is still a big-tent party. “It bodes well for moderates and centrists,” said Cuellar, who said he had discussed his race with Lipinski. “A lot of members were very happy I won because they felt that, if I would have lost, then that would have created a momentum.” Sanders’ dismal performance in recent primaries has relieved some Lipinski supporters, who worried Sanders could drive out young and more left-leaning voters out to the polls, and that they would be more likely to support Newman. Interviewed last week at the Capitol as the House scrambled to cobble together a program to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, some top progressives suggested they had not been closely monitoring Lipinksi’s race or were otherwise preoccupied. ""Obviously, I’ve been very busy with the Sanders campaign,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a top Sanders surrogate. “But I’m supportive of her; we did some fundraising for her.” “I don’t know any of the day-to-day detail stuff,” said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who endorsed Newman, when asked if he was following the race. The scaling back of large gatherings precluded any kind of final-weekend rally with big-name headliners like Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez — though it’s not clear if any would have materialized without the outbreak. Neither campaigned for Cisneros in South Texas. “I was always a little bit worried about this dynamic,” said Sean McElwee, the founder of a liberal think tank. “The extent to which the top of the ticket was going to swamp out interest in the down-ticket stuff was always a danger for these primary challengers this cycle.”","This anti-abortion rights, Obamacare-opposing House Democrat is in trouble",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/dan-lipinski-primary-133226,politico

"The return of the snowbird is a sign of spring in Canada — though this year, those returning from states with coronavirus cases are causing concern rather than celebration. Hundreds of thousands of retired Canadians spend their winters in warm American climes, timing their return with the melt of the snow back home. Heightened concerns about the rapid spread of COVID-19 are prompting Canadian officials to openly question whether the travelers may bring home more than memories and souvenirs. It's unclear if border agents are prepared to manage their arrival or if the travelers know about the self-quarantine precautions they’re supposed to take when they get to Canada.  Many of those “snowbirds” live part of the year in Florida, which has seen a stark increase in the number of diagnoses and at least 141 positive cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus that’s spread across the globe. Those retirees are among the most vulnerable populations affected by the upper respiratory disease. With rising concern about the outbreak, politicians and health officials are wondering aloud how they'll handle the influx as cases of the virus continue to rise in the country. Ontario Chief Medical Officer David Williams said Monday that the province was “trying to get some direction from the federal government” on how to manage the snowbirds' return. “We’re seeing a number of Ontarians at least coming back in ever-increasing numbers,” he said. “Unfortunately, a number of them, after a few days, have been found to be positive from different parts of the USA.” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said Sunday he's instructed the province's tourism arm to redirect advertising toward Canadians, including snowbirds, to inform them of the new protocols upon arrival in the country from abroad. Just as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was appealing for Canadians abroad to return home as soon as possible, many of these older citizens were notified by their medical insurers that their coverage for COVID-19 will expire in the next week if they remain away. Trudeau said Monday that anyone showing symptoms associated with the illness won't be permitted to board flights to Canada beginning Wednesday, adding another potential complication to anyone trying to leave the U.S. Evan Rachkovsky, a spokesperson for the Canadian Snowbird Association, said his group has emailed more than 100,000 members with up-to-date information on Canadian government recommendations, including that they will be expected to self-isolate upon return. “We are doing everything that we can do to flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus,” Rachkovsky said when asked how members were receiving the instructions, adding that the group has been providing the details about self-isolation for more than a week. “The response has been positive in the sense that ... they’re obviously being cautious, and they want to return home as quickly as possible,” he said. He did not have information on whether any members have tested positive for the virus. The Canada Border Services Agency announced new coronavirus screening questions Monday after being criticized for an apparently haphazard approach to evaluating inbound travelers for possible symptoms and to advising them on the strongly encouraged 14-day self-isolation period upon arrival. Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said every Canadian returning home — including snowbirds arriving by car — will receive information telling them to self-isolate. “People who ... maybe spent the winter down in Florida or in Arizona, many of them will be driving back,” he said Monday. “That same information will be provided to them as they cross into Canada ensuring that they understand the need to self-isolate for 14 days.” Florida and Arizona are the most popular states among snowbirds, Rachkovsky said. St. Petersburg and Clearwater boast “several thousand” Canadians come wintertime, and many also flock to the Phoenix and Mesa areas of Arizona, he said. It’s difficult to estimate how many snowbirds will return to Canada in the coming days, Rachkovsky said. “But you’re definitely dealing with hundreds of thousands of people"" who are being asked to leave as quickly as possible, he added.",Return of Canada's 'snowbirds' raises COVID-19 concerns,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/canada-snowbird-coronavirus-133062,politico
"Bernie Sanders has run up the score among young voters in state after state, but his efforts have hit a wall in South Florida.  In a place where young Cuban-Americans joined their elders in the streets with pots and pans to celebrate Fidel Castro’s death, the Vermont senator’s Democratic socialism and past refusals to wholeheartedly condemn Castro and other Latin American authoritarian leaders are proving costly. “I’m more progressive than Biden, but I also don’t want to stand next to the dummy in the Che Guevara T-shirt at a rally, and that’s true here regardless of age,” said Carmen Pelaez, a founding member of Project Cafecito, a grassroots initiative in Miami that leads get-out-the-vote efforts for progressive candidates.  For Sanders, who posted big margins among young and Latino voters in places like California, Nevada and Texas, the resistance he’s encountering among young Latinos is a harbinger of a rough election night in the state that serves as the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries.  It’s not that Joe Biden is wildly popular among younger Latinos, just that he’s a more palatable alternative for many of them. “Are we excited about Biden’s candidacy? I don’t think so. But it’s just what Bernie represents to those here in South Florida that could be catastrophic, especially in a general election matchup,” said Toni Rodriguez, national political director for College Democrats.  “Here in South Florida, Bernie Sanders’ message is disconnected. And that’s telling people, ‘No, we need to vote for Biden because Bernie won’t resonate here in Florida,” Rodriguez, a student at Barry University in Miami Shores, Fla., added.  Cuban-Americans — known for their high voter turnout rates — have for decades been the largest group of Latinos in South Florida, with more than half of the state’s 2 million Cubans living in the region. But it’s only been in the past 20 years that Cuban-Americans have started playing a big role in Democratic politics as voters under 50 — many born in the U.S. — have broken with the Republican Party and embraced more liberal views than their parents and grandparents.  That generational change was reflected in the last presidential election: In 2004, George W. Bush won 78 percent of Florida’s Cuban-American vote, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of exit polls. By 2016, Donald Trump only managed to capture just over half of that vote. The red-to-blue evolution has its limits, however.  Pelaez points out that other Latino groups in South Florida, like Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, also favor Biden in the primary because of their family and friends’ history with socialist and authoritarian regimes — a sign of their different background and experience than Latinos in the Southwest, where Sanders had more widespread support.  “We come from countries where we’ve seen the slogan ‘Socialismo o muerte’ on the walls. We either survived socialism or have grandparents that did and have grown up with those stories,” Pelaez said. “Other Latinos don’t have that frame of reference.” That difference was reflected in a Florida poll last week that showed Sanders trailing Biden, 48 percent to 37 percent, among Hispanic voters.  Only 18 percent of Florida Hispanics — from Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Central and South America — said they would vote for a self-described socialist, while 70 percent said they would not, according to the survey conducted for Telemundo Station Group by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy.  More than 50 percent of Florida Hispanic voters under 50 years old said they would not vote for a socialist candidate, compared with 31 percent who said they would.  To some Florida Latinos, those numbers are proof that Biden would be a stronger rival to Trump in November — and would provide more top-of-the-ticket protection for Latino down-ballot candidates. “A lot of people in Florida know in order to win you have to have a more moderate standpoint. That’s been known,” said Mayra Macías, executive director of Latino Victory Project, an organization that endorsed Biden and is dedicated to electing Latinos up and down the ballot. Macías explained that in a state like Florida, voters are thinking beyond the presidential matchup, given the history of close races for national, state and local offices. She pointed to the reelection campaigns for Democratic Reps. Debbie Mucarsel Powell and Donna Shalala, both of whom flipped their South Florida districts in 2018 from Cuban Republicans and are up against two well-known Cuban Republican opponents again. Trump took to Twitter to endorse Mucarsel Powell‘s GOP opponent, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, just hours after he launched his campaign in January. “It’s all these candidates that would get affected … and hurt by a campaign’s inability to distinguish their brand of Democratic socialism from the socialism that many folks in Florida fled from or have a negative perception of,” Macías said.  Democrats have chronically struggled to get more Latino candidates on the ballot — the only Cuban-Americans in the Florida congressional delegation are Republican: Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Díaz Balart.  It’s critical for Biden to court Latinos “who came of political consciousness post the Obama years,” Macías said. “It’s going to be extremely important for the campaign to articulate a vision for them.”",Meet the young voters who refuse to vote for Bernie,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-florida-youth-132928,politico
"The voice of the woman, introducing herself as “Elisabeth … you know, Poldi’s mom,” sounded genuinely concerned. A friend of hers, who was a doctor at the university hospital of Vienna, had called her with a warning, she said in German. The clinic had noticed that most patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus pandemic, had taken the painkiller ibuprofen before they were hospitalized. Tests run by the university’s laboratory, she added, had found “strong evidence that ibuprofen accelerates the multiplication of the virus.” With lightning speed, an audio recording of the message spread among German-language users of WhatsApp, the messenger service owned by Facebook. Quickly, similar recordings referring to alleged research from Vienna in other languages like Slovak also began circulating on the service. But the WhatsApp message was based on fake information. “Nonsense,” said Johannes Angerer, a spokesperson for the Medical University of Vienna. “We neither discussed this internally, nor do we conduct any research into the potential effects of ibuprofen on COVID-19.” While there have been warnings against the use of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen to treat coronavirus-like symptoms, including by France’s health minister, everything the voice recording said about research efforts at the medical school had been made up, he stressed. The university released statements to flag the messages as fake within hours after first hearing about them Saturday morning. But the proverbial horse had bolted: German-language Google searches for the keywords “ibuprofen” and “Corona” spiked on Saturday around noon, according to data from the search giant. Over the weekend, the university’s website collapsed temporarily. The case provides an example of how, as the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, a wildfire of false and unverified information about the pandemic is following in its wake. On private messaging services like WhatsApp, well-intentioned but fearful individuals are forwarding messages with misleading or doctored information. Other cases range from warnings over made-up extraordinary measures governments might take to keep people in their homes to false numbers of deaths and the level of preparedness of medical services. “We are aware of an increasing number of false information about the COVID-19 outbreak appearing in public discourse, including on social media,” European Commission Vice President Věra Jourová, whose portfolio includes the EU’s efforts to fight fake news, told POLITICO in an email. But she also acknowledged that “we need to understand better the risks related to communication on end-to-end encryption services.” The Vienna fake is far from an isolated case of such digital misinformation — and others often follow a similar pattern that involves people claiming to share insider information with friends and family that they’ve gained access to. Among Belgian WhatsApp users, an audio message has been circulating with a woman claiming the hospital she worked in had triggered “the maximum pandemic plan.” Other voice recordings warned people of a complete lockdown of the country and urged them to stock up on food. Poland was hit by a wave of rumors about the government introducing zoning to cities and cutting off transportation to Warsaw. One audio message, recorded by a man who claimed he had a journalist friend with close ties to political decision-makers, said that as of last Sunday, the president would introduce an “emergency state” and that people wouldn’t be able to leave their houses for three weeks. In France, users forwarded an audio message of a woman who said that she has “a very very very well placed uncle” with ties to national ministers from whom she got information that the whole country would soon be in full quarantine. And in Portugal, a widely circulated voice message suggested that information on the number of infected people in the country was downplayed by official sources, with a man saying: “Forget the numbers the television is talking about. There are thousands of infected in Portugal, confirmed.” In Ireland, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar pleaded with people on Twitter: “I am urging everyone to please stop sharing unverified info on What’sApp groups. These messages are scaring and confusing people and causing real damage.” Jourová, who is drafting new proposals on how to protect EU democracies from misinformation, warned that her office was “concerned that some [false claims] can lead to public harm, such as false claims that drinking bleach cures the virus, or abuse the situation for material gain.” Her office is “is in regular contact with online platforms” to address the issue, she added. Experts have warned that, as Facebook has clamped down on misinformation on its main platform, its messenger service WhatsApp, which was bought in 2014, is increasingly becoming a key arena for the spread of misinformation. The social networking giant has invested millions of euros to clamp down on falsehoods on its main network, so people have turned to WhatsApp because it is less regulated and allows people to share personal messages with large numbers of people. In a statement, the company said that it is “committed to doing our part to tackle viral messages,” among other things by “reducing the number of people you can forward a message to.” In recent years, Facebook has limited the ability of people to forward WhatsApp messages in an attempt to stop misinformation from spreading like wildfire, and has teamed up with governments to help them share official announcements on the platform. “We encourage all users to check the facts online before sharing messages that have been forwarded to them, and we encourage users to engage directly with trusted and official sources for important information,” a company spokesperson added. Still, the rise of WhatsApp represents the latest turn in the cat-and-mouse game between those spreading misinformation — often people who are doing so unwittingly — and the global platform’s ability to thwart such activities. For Claire Wardle, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who has tracked WhatsApp’s role in spreading falsehoods, the platform allows people to share personal details — something many are eager to do in a time of crisis. “So much of this is about emotion, and audio is an emotive medium,” she said. “That phenomenon, which dates back to what we saw in India, is finally coming to Western Europe. People are turning to WhatsApp because they have more to say, and they want to speak directly to their friends and family.”", The coronavirus fake news pandemic sweeping WhatsApp,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/coronavirus-fake-news-pandemic-133447,politico
"Before markets started spiraling like 1987’s “Black Monday” crash, and even before President Donald Trump heard from state governors and G-7 leaders trying to stave off deaths at home, the president received a series of fresh warnings about the scale of the calamity poised to wash over America.  His coronavirus task force presented new information based on overseas models showing how quickly the virus could spread without swift action. And new data he was shown from China overnight highlighted that country’s economic collapse — plunging factory activity and soaring unemployment — despite its draconian measures to combat the coronavirus crisis.  Faced with a reality that the nation he oversees needs to take dramatic action or follow in the footsteps of deeply troubled nations abroad, the president took on a newly somber tone about a virus outbreak he spent months downplaying.  “I’m glad to see that you’re practicing social distancing,” Trump quipped as he stepped up to the lectern in an unscheduled appearance at the sparsely populated James S. Brady briefing room in the White House, where reporters were arranged with open seats between them. It was a short moment of levity for Trump before he laid out dramatic new guidelines aimed at curbing the spread of the virus and saving lives. He instructed people to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people, stay home from work or school if possible, avoid travel and nursing homes.  In just 24 hours, the president went from telling people filling up their pantries to just “relax,” to acknowledging the economy might be careening toward a recession and warning the public they have a narrow window of 15 days to stop the spread of a lethal disease. “It’s bad. It’s bad,” Trump said. “But we’re going to be hopefully a best case, not a worst case. And that’s what we’re working for.” It was a dramatic change in tone from his Oval Office address, which was riddled with mistakes; his Rose Garden news conference, where he went against expert recommendations and shook hands with everyone in sight; and his Sunday appearance with the vice president, when he rattled off a list of CEOs he talked to on the phone only to turn on his heels without taking questions. “Each and every one of us has a critical role to play,” Trump said Monday, flanked by members of his task force. “If everyone makes these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus.” The shift represented a new understanding by the White House of the risk that the U.S. could soon be overwhelmed by a disease explosion.  “Look, we could have a spike in these cases or we could blunt the curve,” national security adviser Robert O’Brien told POLITICO. “And if we can blunt the curve we can end up with a situation where our health care system can handle the crisis. We don’t want a spike the way we’ve seen in Italy.” The president, who just one day before said the virus would quickly pass, said Americans should brace for the coronavirus to affect daily lives as late as July or August. And he appeared disturbed to hear that some of his closest allies, like GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, had bucked the advice of the health professionals standing at his side by encouraging people to go to restaurants. “Well, I would disagree with it,” Trump said. “It's adverse to what the professionals are saying.” Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer called it a “striking difference.”  “This was sobering, serious, realistic and modest. This is what the doctor ordered,” Fleischer said. The 180-degree turn came after Trump was urged by allies privately and publicly to do more as the crisis careened out of control.  Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, an outside adviser to Trump, penned an op-ed in The New York Times on Monday that didn’t criticize the president but did push him to act more aggressively by directing governors to close all schools and prohibit attendance at public facilities, including restaurants and bars, until at least May 11, among other suggestions.  “More must be done to prepare for increasing case numbers and to effectively communicate what must be done to reduce the threat,” he wrote. “I fear Americans are not yet taking this virus seriously enough.” And Newt Gingrich, another ally of the president, whose wife is the ambassador to the Holy See in Vatican City, wrote a chilling first-person account of what he saw in Italy.  “Faced with a pandemic threat, history teaches us it is far better to be overprepared than underprepared,” Gingrich wrote in Newsweek. “The lesson of Italy is that the sooner you act, the fewer lives you will lose and the less damage you will do to your economy.” On Sunday, the president hoped that the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its target interest rate to near zero would help blunt the market’s nosedive and for once lavished praise on an institution he regularly lambastes on Twitter. “That makes me very happy,” he said in a news conference.  But a former adviser said Trump realized Monday when the financial markets continued to fall that he had to do more. “The Fed obviously didn’t help” calm the waters, the person said. Trump was also deeply alarmed by the economic collapse in China that became apparent early Monday, according to two people close to the White House. Data released late Sunday showed a 13.5 percent decline in China’s industrial output in January and February from a year earlier, as well as a dramatic spike in unemployment. The country has also experienced a widespread suspension of manufacturing since the coronavirus outbreak began in China’s Hubei province in December.  “The president understands numbers and they were explaining to him some of the China economic numbers over the weekend and now he knows what’s coming here,” said one person close to Trump, adding that the drop in manufacturing truly startled the president. “This is a communist country that sealed off everyone in their apartments and is still seeing those numbers, so it made him realize there’s no way for the U.S. not to suffer those consequences and what he needs to do is whatever he can to get us through this as quickly as possible,” the person added.  News of China’s economic free fall came just days after the president and his team boasted about gains in U.S. markets following his declaration of a national emergency — during the Rose Garden ceremony last Friday at which Trump surrounded himself with corporate executives.  Up until Saturday, officials inside the White House Office of Legislative Affairs were “trying to project as much confidence” as possible in their conversations with the president, a tone that began to shift Sunday morning as more governors implemented lockdowns on non-essential businesses and ordered their residents to avoid gatherings of 50 people or more.  “It’s smart what he’s done. He’s made a decision to downplay expectations,” said a second person close to the White House after watching Trump’s appearance at the White House briefing Monday afternoon. Another official noted that the new White House guidelines gave some governors political cover to call for curfews and closures that have been met with groans by some small businesses bearing the brunt of the new rules or eye-rolls from younger Americans who may be less susceptible to the physical damage of the virus.  “I think the media has to recognize why he was hired by the American people — he’s not going to be consoler-in-chief,” said Jason Miller, a senior adviser on Trump’s 2016 campaign and an unofficial adviser. “They want him to go and get it done. What he’s realized here from the markets to society … they react to big bold leadership.” Fleischer said the president was able this time to be “reassuring and realistic.” “When events are this big, this serious, and this scary, the president’s communications job is twofold: One, be reassuring. And two, be realistic. And those two reinforce each other. The more realistic a president is, the more a country will believe his reassurances.” Still, Trump didn’t let go of his old approach completely.  When asked by a reporter Monday to rate his response on a scale of 1 to 10, the president answered in Trumpian fashion: “I’d rate it a 10. I think we’ve done a great job.”",A chastened Trump presents a newly somber tone,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-coronavirus-133278,politico
"Even before Congress has finished work on a second stimulus bill to deal with the coronavirus crisis, senators from both parties and the White House are already talking about a third package, which will come with a price tag that runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  And few people, from President Donald Trump on down, are complaining about the cost — knowing the country faces a potentially unprecedented economic hit from the pandemic.  But perhaps the most shocking fact is that the normally slow-moving Senate could pass the “Phase 3” bill this week, according to several GOP senators.  Following a meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, acting budget chief Russ Vought, and White House legislative affairs Director Eric Ueland, Senate Republicans said the Trump administration will present them with proposals on Tuesday for the latest response to the economic calamity caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  GOP senators said Mnuchin wants to funnel money to small businesses hit by the crisis, perhaps tens of billions of dollars.  And the U.S. airline industry, which has taken a huge hit as passengers disappear, could also get some financial help from the federal government. While the administration doesn't want to call it a bailout, the airline industry has warned that some carriers may face a ""potential valley of death"" if action isn’t taken quickly. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other top Democrats will roll out their own $750 billion-plus package on Tuesday, and what Trump and Senate Republicans will propose may equal or top that.  “I’m not going to comment on the specific numbers right now. I’ll be talking to the Republicans at lunch tomorrow. But it’s a big number,” Mnuchin said after huddling with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other senior Republicans for more than an hour in the Capitol on Monday.  “And we’ll be looking for support for small and medium-sized businesses, we’ll be looking for support for certain industries that we’ve talked about that are particularly hard hit. I’ve talked about airlines, hotels, others. And we will be looking at a general stimulus.”  “The president has instructed his team to look very expansively at what we have to do, and not be impeded by the potential price tag for what’s necessary here,” Ueland added.  A multibillion-dollar measure crafted by Mnuchin and Speaker Nancy Pelosi to provide some paid sick leave, expand free coronavirus testing, and boost food aid and unemployment insurance is expected to be taken up in the Senate as early as Tuesday. Congress already passed an $8.3 billion bill to combat the virus. Mnuchin is supposed to attend a Senate GOP luncheon on Tuesday and offer specific proposals for the next piece of congressional action.  Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who attended the session with Mnuchin and other administration officials, said the Senate could move to a new rescue package as early as this week. In fact, Rubio said many senators made it clear they want to move ahead on that drastically accelerated timeline. “I don’t think we can assume that we can keep reconvening the Senate every week like we did this week. I don’t think we can make that assumption,” Rubio said. “With what might happen to airlines or travel schedules, with individual members having to go into quarantine or being exposed — I don’t think we can operate as if we can just bring the Senate and House back whenever we want.”  McConnell’s office wouldn’t comment on the possibility of passing the Phase 3 bill, although a Senate GOP aide noted, “The discussions are too premature to say at this point. But now that FISA is out of the way, it opens up more floor space for possible consideration.” Ueland also noted that Trump wants quick action as well.  “We can’t let weeks and months get under our feet here,” Ueland said. “Again, we have a real focus on urgent action, and I’m hopeful there could be swift consideration of consensus ideas as quickly as possible.”  Senators in both parties acknowledged they were concerned about the current government deficit, which was already projected to be more than $1 trillion before the coronavirus hit and derailed the economy.  But now, they point out that only the federal government can respond to this emergency with the financial power needed to address the present emergency.  “The reason having a massive deficit is a problem is that in a crisis, only the federal government can frankly provide support to state and local governments that have to balance their budgets,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.).  Senate Democrats blamed the 2017 GOP tax cut — engineered by Mnuchin, McConnell and other Republican leaders — for the huge deficit, yet warned it shouldn’t matter now.  “We wouldn’t have that trillion-dollar deficit if we didn’t do a totally unnecessary tax cut,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). “But if we go into a recession or a depression, we’re talking trillions of dollars there.”  Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a deficit hawk, said he would offer an amendment to cut spending from other programs for every dollar added in stimulus spending.  “I think that all spending should be offset by cutting less important spending, so I will offer an amendment to pay for it,” Paul said. “I think anytime we choose to spend money, no matter what the cause is, we should pay for it.”  Paul predicted such “pay for” amendments will be allowed because party leaders won’t want to get bogged down in a procedural fight that could disrupt quick action on the package.

"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden narrowly won the Washington primary, keeping a lead over fellow candidate and progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to the Associated Press. Washington was one of six states that voted last Tuesday — including Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, North Dakota and Idaho — but was the last to have a winner declared Monday evening. Washington votes entirely by mail-in ballots.  Biden secured victories in all states except North Dakota, which went to Sanders. His Washington win continues a surge for the former vice president that initially started with a rocky trail behind Sanders.  Biden won by more than 21,000 of the over 2 million votes cast, according to the AP. Though 13 candidates were on the ballot, Biden and Sanders were the main candidates after a litany of prominent Democrats — including Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren — dropped out of the race. Sanders won the state's caucuses in 2016, beating out Hillary Clinton. Washington later had a non-binding primary that year that did not have an impact on the state's delegates, which Clinton won.

"As hospitals grapple with more coughing and feverish emergency-room visitors than they can test, the White House has deployed a SWAT team of fixers and technocrats to ramp up coronavirus testing, in an implicit acknowledgment that the Trump administration’s response has continued to fall short of what is needed. About 100 staffers and outside advisers, split between the health department and the White House, are currently working on teams to rapidly increase supplies of test kits and cope with shortages across the country, said four people with knowledge of the strategy. “This is the A-team of people who get shit done,” said one official, who’s worked with some of the staffers leading the effort. “We’ve got to show the American people that we can deliver on the testing promises” after weeks of President Donald Trump vowing that “anybody who needs a test can get a test” — a claim that doesn’t match the growing number of doctors, hospitals and patients who have said they’re still waiting for access and results. The lack of testing remains — despite Vice President Mike Pence’s assurance that drive-thru testing centers should be operative later this week — the greatest immediate danger to the U.S. response to the crisis, public health experts have warned. While Johns Hopkins University on Monday reported more than 4,287 confirmed cases of coronavirus across the United States, the true number could easily be more than 10 times higher at this point. That’s complicated medical professionals’ efforts to focus their resources and hurt public health officials’ effort to marshal a response. “We are far behind where we need to be,” tweeted Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, who changed his Twitter name to read ""Ashish 'We super duper need testing for COVID' Jha."" While the Harvard expert this weekend guessed that at least 40,000 people may be infected, ""we can't know without testing"" how big the problem is, he added. The SWAT-team effort is being overseen by Brett Giroir, the HHS official who was tapped as the nation’s testing coordinator on Friday, and Adam Boehler, a former HHS official who was drawn in to the coronavirus response last week. Brad Smith, a health-industry entrepreneur who only joined the administration in January, is serving as the operational leader. Outside experts in health care delivery and technology, like Flatiron Health CEO Nat Turner, also have been brought in as advisers. The officials have spent the past five days in round-the-clock war rooms and strategy sessions, gaming out ways to deploy drive-thru testing as Pence and Trump have promised this week. The initial testing centers will prioritize health workers and vulnerable populations, like people over 65, with a focus on the states that are hardest hit by the coronavirus. The new SWAT-team approach is similar to the emergency effort to repair HealthCare.gov in 2013, three officials said, although drew distinctions between the Obama-era recovery strategy — to fix the rollout of a long-scheduled website — and the frantic response to a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. “This shit hasn’t happened before,” said one senior administration official. “It’s not like we planned for coronavirus, and six months later we had a coronavirus.” Tapping officials like Giroir and Boehler, who have steered multiple administration priorities like President Donald Trump’s HIV/AIDS strategy and kidney-care overhaul, and a technocrat like Smith, is a tacit acknowledgment of management failures with the existing strategy, said two individuals, with the Trump administration cycling through multiple leaders and tactics — and officials trading blame for why testing has run so far behind. Much of the Trump administration’s initial strategy rested on coronavirus tests distributed by the Centers for Disease Control, which turned out to have manufacturing problems. CDC Director Robert Redfield has been widely faulted inside the administration for problems with his agency’s tests and miscommunicating to senior officials when replacement tests would be ready. HHS Secretary Alex Azar, who led the initial response, is frustrated with Redfield, said two people familiar with the situation, and dispatched Giroir earlier this month to the CDC to quietly investigate the problems within the agency, said three individuals briefed on the effort. The health secretary also elevated Giroir and another official, emergency-preparedness chief Robert Kadlec, to take over the department’s coronavirus response. Meanwhile, two officials blamed Azar himself for not doing more to coordinate the overall response across January and February, leaving the administration well short on the number of necessary tests. Some of the strategies taken in recent days, like working with private labs to ramp up tests, could have been pursued nearly two months ago under Azar’s leadership, the officials said. Vice President Mike Pence took over the response from Azar about three weeks ago, amid frustrations about the state of the effort and whether Azar's public health deputies had been too alarmist in their messages. But Pence has focused on coordinating the larger message and his office has lacked operational support to execute on specific initiatives, said two individuals. The new SWAT team is also a reflection of the growing involvement of White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, in the administration's coronavirus response. Kushner is a longtime friend of Boehler, who led the Medicare innovation center until taking a new role as chief of U.S. international development finance chief last fall, and is viewed as an apolitical Silicon Valley veteran. Meanwhile, Smith is a Boehler ally who inherited his job at the Medicare innovation center before being pulled in to coordinate the SWAT team response. Asked about the shifting roles and responsibilities, an HHS spokesperson touted the decision to bring on more operational experts like Giroir. “The Trump Administration has activated a whole of government response to COVID-19 and all of our leaders bring highly valuable experience and expertise to this effort,” the spokesperson said. “The American people should know that the entire government is working around the clock to prepare for and protect against COVID-19.” The White House also defended the CDC’s role and response, despite problems with the agency’s tests that led to weeks of limited information about the spread of coronavirus. “CDC is doing what they could, given their tools and resources,” said Katie Miller, a spokesperson for Pence. “Given the increased demand, the administration is doing as much as to add additional capacity in an expedited manner.” The nation’s inadequate coronavirus testing has meant that the true scope of the problem is unknown. One doctor involved in the coronavirus response at a New York City-area hospital, who asked for confidentiality because the doctor did not have permission to speak to the media, said the facility has seen its coronavirus cases jump from just a handful of confirmed patients a week ago to more than a dozen as of Sunday, as more testing has come online. But the true scope of the outbreak still can't be measured, the doctor added, because patients who aren’t sick enough to be hospitalized aren’t getting tested, and the facility has been turning away dozens of less critically ill people who present with coronavirus symptoms, creating a “big gap” between official numbers and the disease’s likely spread. Crystal Lucas, a former state legislature candidate in Florida, told POLITICO that her 61-year-old mother-in-law went to the emergency room of Palms West Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla., on Friday with respiratory problems. Four hours later, she was admitted. “The nurse told us she hadn’t been tested because they didn’t have any test kits,” Lucas said. “She had an infectious disease doctor on her team when she was still in a regular hospital room. She was obviously suspected to have an infectious disease.” Palms West’s communications office did not respond to requests for comment. The patient, Vickie Schafer, is now in critical condition, Lucas said. She finally got a coronavirus test on Sunday evening and is awaiting the results. “Everything points to COVID and they treated it as if it wasn’t even on their radar,” said Lucas. “If we have this going on and this woman presents all the symptoms, why would we not act as if she is already positive?” If Schafer tests positive, it could indicate the virus has spread in Loxahatchee, the area of Palm Beach County where she lives. As of Monday evening, there were eight cases in the county, according to the state Department of Health’s website. In addition to worrying about her mother-in-law, Lucas said she worries about the doctors and nurses Schafer might have been exposed to the coronavirus between Friday and Sunday. And she worries about the patients those people might have come into contact with. Some hospital officials have said they would have developed their own coronavirus tests weeks ago but were told to stand down by officials at CDC and the Food and Drug Administration. “We were told two things,” said Alan Wells, medical director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s clinical laboratories. “One, that they were developing the testing and that CDC and states would be able to handle this. Two, that they were exercising authority to regulate which testing was approved.” Combined with other factors, including limited supplies, Wells’ team decided to shelve their potential coronavirus testing plan six weeks ago, but resumed work as the situation worsened and finally unveiled the tests on Saturday. Public health leaders, doctors and even Wall Street investors, are growing worried about the lack of transparency around the inadequate response. “Testing is getting there but with the virus doubling right now at minimum every seven days, each day of testing lost is a day that more people get sick,” Financial services firm Raymond James warned investors on Sunday night.

"TALLAHASSEE — Door knocking? Nope. Surrogate stops? Canceled. The bubbly? Corked. Even the candidates will be AWOL. Florida, a state famed for its weirdness, is preparing for one of its weirdest election days on Tuesday, when Democrats and Republicans will brave a pandemic to cast primary ballots for their presidential nominees. With two popular candidates on the ballot, Democrats were hoping to deliver a show of force against President Donald Trump with pumped-up turnout and lots of noise. Instead, they’ve had their mojo stolen by the coronavirus. Florida is a presidential election year crown jewel, a delegate-rich state that does double duty as the nation’s largest battleground. It’s expensive and difficult to flex institutional and infrastructure muscle in the state, which serves as a barometer of any campaign’s viability. Still, neither Joe Biden nor Bernie Sanders have campaigned here this year, and neither will be glad-handing Tuesday. Democratic get-out-the-vote operations are all but halted, and for the first time in memory there will be no Election Day parties. As the country hunkers down to avoid the coronavirus, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, on Monday made a push to postpone his state’s Tuesday primary, a plea a judge rejected late Monday. Illinois and Arizona, which also vote Tuesday, are at full speed. And in Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said he’s not going to panic. “We’re definitely voting,” he said Saturday at a coronavirus briefing. “They voted during the Civil War. We’re going to vote.” Besides, he said, most ballots probably have been cast in early voting already. And neither party’s primary, he noted, are going to be cliffhangers. Florida has a reputation for botched elections — from hanging chads in 2000 to a confusing recount in 2018 that led to the ouster of two South Florida election supervisors. This time around, polling places could present the biggest challenge. In an effort to protect elderly populations most at risk from the coronavirus, DeSantis has shut down voting sites at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Democrats are riled up. “We agree with the governor’s decision. We think it’s good policy to protect at-risk populations,” said Juan Peñalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party. “But there is no list of impacted voting locations. It’s information we want to help communicate to voters, but we were told by the governor’s office there is no list, and won’t be before Election Day.” So Peñalosa’s staff and volunteers are making their own list. They’ve reached out to all of the state’s 67 county election offices to find out where polling sites will be closed. “We are compiling a list and have already started communicating to impacted voters,” Peñalosa said. Then there’s the problem of staffing. Poll workers afraid of being exposed to the virus are dropping out. That’s on top of the election coinciding with spring break — many workers have begged off duty this year due to family obligations. Pasco County elections supervisor Brian Corley said he started “hemorrhaging” poll workers after a county resident tested positive for the coronavirus. “I can’t blame them,” Corley said. “A lot of them are senior citizens.” Corley said he’s lost 175 workers so far, and has turned to the local sheriff, schools and county government to find people to fill their spots. School resource officers from the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office will be among those reporting for duty on Tuesday, along with teachers and other county employees. “We can’t get to them fast enough,” Corley said. Still, election supervisors remain optimistic the day will go smoothly, in part because turnout won’t be that high. “We knew going in this was going to be challenging,” said Orange County Supervisor of Elections Bill Cowles. And Corley said he’s doing the unthinkable — encouraging voters to not show up, especially if they’re sick or at risk. “If anyone is unsure, don’t go to the polls, as much as it pains me to say that,” Corley said. “Elections are wonderful, but this is a political party nominating contest.” Campaign operations also are improvising as the coronavirus creep sets in. Rather than emphasizing last-minute campaign and policy talking points, or feverishly ramping up their face-to-face ground game, campaigns are employing public-service-type announcements. Entire operations have gone virtual. Digital events have replaced rallies, in-person fundraising has been canceled, and election night parties just won’t happen. Because neither race is close — Biden has lapped Sanders in state polls and Trump has no serious challengers — any impact on the actual results will be minimal as Florida copes with its slice of a global pandemic. “Post South Carolina, when Biden surged in southern states, Florida experienced the same shift,” said Dan Newman, a Florida Democratic consultant who is unaligned in the presidential primary. “Basically, the race coalesced into Sanders and non-Sanders, and as a trusted national name, Biden was the beneficiary.” More than a million Florida Democrats already have voted by mail or at early voting locations, surpassing pre-primary day turnout in 2016, when 889,207 Democratic voters cast ballots. That year, Hillary Clinton was still fighting off Sanders, her primary rival. And even if Democratic turnout is low, it won’t give Republicans a valid reason to gloat, Newman said. “I don’t think turnout in a presidential primary with neither campaign particularly active, and in a state that’s functionally already decided, and in the middle of a global pandemic is predictive,” he said, “of much.”","Florida is weird.

"The early signals from the coronavirus crisis point to a scale of damage unseen in the modern U.S. economy: the potential for millions of jobs lost in a single month, a historic and sudden plunge in economic activity across the nation and a pace of sharp market swings not seen since the Great Depression. As the coronavirus outbreak ravages a paralyzed nation, Wall Street suffered another brutal bloodbath on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average diving around 13 percent in its worst percentage loss since 1987’s “Black Monday” crash. A reading on business conditions in the New York area plunged a record 34.4 points to -21.5 in March, suggesting a recession is underway that could be sharp and deep as revenue quickly bleeds out of major industries from airlines to hotels, restaurants, bars and sports leagues. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, the broadest gauge of U.S. companies, fell 12 percent. It has shed $6 trillion in value since peaking in February, slamming retirement accounts for millions of Americans in ways that could have psychological ripples for many months to come. The last time the S&P had three days of similar wild swings was 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression. The S&P is now only around 300 points away from wiping out all its gains since Donald Trump won the White House in November 2016. President Trump himself, one of the grandest boasters of the strength and resilience of markets and the American economy, appeared to capitulate on Monday with a more somber tone reflecting the immense magnitude of the challenge facing the nation. “We have an invisible enemy,” he said, acknowledging that the virus could push the U.S. into recession. “This is a bad one. This is a very bad one.” Trump urged Americans not to gather in groups over 10 and to avoid bars, restaurants, food courts and other public spaces. The VIX, a gauge of fear and panic on Wall Street, hit 82.69 on Monday — bringing it to territory unseen since the worst of the financial crisis in 2008. Oil prices tanked 10 percent — after a severe plunge last week — as traders bet the virus will ignite a global recession that sharply reduces demand for fuel. The massive sell-offs have led to suggestions by market professionals that regulators may have to take dramatic steps seen during the Great Depression and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That could include shuttering Wall Street — perhaps for days — until more is known about the direction of the coronavirus spread in the United States and until Washington comes up with a massive, bipartisan policy response to shore up flagging industries and direct money straight into the pockets of American citizens losing work as they remain shuttered in their homes at the direction of the government officials. For now, Securities and Exchange Commissioner Jay Clayton pledged to keep markets open, despite the waves of panicked selling. “Markets should continue to function through times like this,” he told CNBC. Still, many traders expect that if the market plunges several more thousand points, and trips more circuit breakers that temporarily halt trading, the administration could be forced to simply shut Wall Street down. “With new measures being put in place by the hour, the federal government at some point will have to consider a modern version of the bank holiday imposed by the Roosevelt administration back in 1933,” RSM Chief Economist Joseph Brusuelas wrote in a client note. “That four-day holiday was put into place to restore confidence in the banking and financial system. Perhaps the governing authority should consider a 10-business day holiday until Congress can act.” Wall Street analysts are already assessing the damage done to the economy thus far: stark and likely to get far worse, very quickly. “Movie box-office revenues are down more than 60 percent in data through March 15 and more than 70 percent relative to the average of recent years,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a research note. “Broadway box office revenues were already down about 20 percent relative to trend in data through March 8, and are presumably set to be down essentially 100 percent after theaters closed last Thursday, a result we also expect to see for professional and college sports revenues.” Restaurant bookings were collapsing in many cities and may now plunge to zero. Streets are increasingly empty as citizens follow government warnings to slow the spread of the virus. The hope on the part of White House officials is not to avoid a sharp economic slowdown — they all know it is coming — but that the short-term pain from extreme measures will lead to a flattening in the curve of the virus spread. Then economic activity can be made up when the crisis ebbs. But that will require agreement on a massive package of aid for both individuals and corporations to stave off mass bankruptcies and waves of layoffs. The White House hopes for a V-shaped economic cycle this time: a recession in which growth plunges then sharply recovers as consumers emerge from their bunkers with jobs to go to and money to spend. Kevin Hassett, the former White House Council of Economic Advisers chairman who remains in contact with Trump and the White House, said in an interview that jobs reports for March and April could show horrific numbers that will force massive congressional action if it has not already occurred by then. He predicted losses of perhaps over 1 million jobs in coming reports and a spike in the jobless rate. “We really could see the worst jobs reports we’ve ever seen in our history.” Hassett said he did calculations over the weekend with conservative economist Larry Lindsey showing that the economy could contract by 5 percent in the second quarter, though a swift containment of the virus could lead to a bounce-back in the third quarter. (Goldman Sachs economists also predicted a drop of around 5 percent in economic growth in the second quarter.) And he noted that infighting between the House and Senate and uncertainty about the next stimulus package from the White House could make matters far worse. The White House is trying to settle on a package that would include a payroll tax suspension and emergency lending facilities, including from the Federal Reserve, and other measures for impacted businesses that would stop short of direct cash “bailouts,” a politically toxic word since the bank rescues of 2008 and 2009. William Lee, chief economist at the Milken Institute, suggested the United States is headed into what could be the first recession whose length and depth will be determined largely by how effectively Washington responds, both on the fiscal and public health fronts. “This will be first recession induced by public health policies, and the nature of those public health policies and their effectiveness accelerating the recovery from the virus. And that will determine the course of the depth of the recession.” Lee said he was certain the second quarter would show a contraction, but that multiple policies, most of which are currently under consideration, could prime the economy to bounce back. Those policies would include direct aid to corporations slammed by the virus, through loan forbearance and acceptance of late payments. He also suggested credit rating firms would have to take into account the impact of the virus when making ratings changes, including potentially crippling downgrades. On the consumer side, Lee said supplemental sick pay leave and extended benefits for laid-off workers would be critical along with payments to cover day care. “Our avenues for pushing this stuff out through negative income taxes for households can be easily done. The key thing as that as soon as people feel safe to go out, that they have money in their pockets and they go and spend it.” Lee said he did not believe in giving free money away to corporations, but that decisions would have to be made about which companies are simply mismanaged and which are suffering directly from the virus. “We have to be generous about getting money out. It’s really important to preserve the transport infrastructure. We can’t have airlines filing for bankruptcy.” Joel Prakken, chief U.S. economist and IHS Markit, said in a note to clients that the spread of Covid-19 to the U.S. ""is causing a sharp contraction in spending on activities that involve travel and congregating in public.” His firm now expects a recession to start in the second quarter, delivering a peak-to-trough decline in GDP of 2.3 percent, with the jobless rate rising to 6 percent by mid-2021. Goldman Sachs analysts increased their expectations for stimulus action out of Washington. Their base case is to see stimulus worth 1 to 2 percent of GDP in both 2020 and 2021, or roughly $400 billion to $800 billion worth. White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Monday the administration was pursuing at least $800 billion in relief for an economy hit by the crisis. Steve Moore, a conservative economist and outside adviser to the president, said he sent a plan to Kudlow for items to include in the next stimulus proposal expected to come out of the White House and Treasury by the end of the week. Moore authored the proposal along with publishing magnate Steve Forbes and supply-side economics guru Art Laffer, a close Kudlow ally. “They haven’t settled on any one thing at this point. But it’s on a fast-track. They want it by the end of the week,” Moore said. “We proposed a four-step plan and the best idea is to suspend the payroll tax for the rest of the year. That’s something that would help everyone. It’s clean and it doesn’t pick winners and losers.” Moore said his group suggested financing the payroll tax holiday by issuing 50- and 100-year Treasury bonds at 1 percent interest. They also suggested avoiding any direct cash bailouts to hard-hit industries like airlines or hotels. “Every business is materially affected by this. Who is going to make these decision about who gets aid and who doesn’t?” Moore said. The final piece of the plan would be for the Federal Reserve to open lending facilities for low-interest loans to any business that has collateral to avoid cash crunches that could force companies into fire sales of existing assets to raise cash to replace revenue lost to the crisis. “Trump listens to us. He seeks out our advice,” Moore said. “We are urging him not to do things that are bad policy that he would not do otherwise.” “When the virus is contained, the economy will bounce back. But how long that will take and much damage is done to supply chains and the number of bankruptcies — we just don’t know. Every day this lasts compounds the economic damage.”",How ugly could it get?

"The nation's biggest banks, which were at the epicenter of the 2008 financial crisis, are facing a new set of daunting challenges with markets in turmoil over the coronavirus pandemic. While the lenders will probably be in no need of a multibillion-dollar bailout as they were back then, they’re dealing with stress from all sides as they’re pressured to help shield consumers, businesses and other financial firms from a wave of economic pain that has already begun to hit. Business debt is at record-high levels. Many consumers will struggle to repay bank loans if they face even one missed paycheck. And though lawmakers and regulators reined in some of the riskiest behavior at banks after the crisis, a lot of those same activities are still happening in other less-regulated companies that are financially connected to the large lenders. That means the banks will be tested on how well they’ve prepared for a global shock to the economy that no one saw coming. “The banks are not the problem right now,” said Karen Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics. But “they can only be fortresses for so long.” For their part, the megabanks are trying to project strength. In a March 11 meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said the financial system is “in sound shape, and we are here to help.” Bankers argue that they rely much less on debt to fund their operations and have much more cash on hand than they did during the crisis to help them keep lending during a downturn. Citi, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and five other major banks said over the weekend that they'd stop buying back their own shares through June as they pledge to help struggling consumers and businesses. The largest banks have also successfully weathered the Federal Reserve’s so-called stress tests, which require them to show every year how they would manage risks under a hypothetical severe recession. The exercise was launched in 2009 in the depth of the crisis to help restore confidence in the banking system. But financial markets are already showing signs of strain, with stocks in recent weeks wiping out most of their huge gains since Trump's election and trading in U.S. government bond markets becoming irregular, a situation that prompted the Fed to inject piles of cash into funding markets. Troubles are also growing in the market for a type of short-term business debt known as commercial paper. One of the biggest risks that regulators like the Fed have been watching is the rise in loans to companies that are already highly indebted, as well as the volume of corporate bonds that are so risky that mutual funds may not be allowed to hold them. If a lot of companies start to default on their debt, it could blow back not only directly on banks, but also other lenders and investors that do business with them. “You’re going to have massive defaults as the economy turns down, and a massive amount of dumping of the worst debt as certain investment vehicles like mutual funds are getting out of it,” said Dennis Kelleher, who heads the financial regulation advocacy group Better Markets. “You put those two things together, and there is an enormous threat coming to all financial institutions, but particularly the biggest banks.” According to financial analytics firm Trepp, banks have diversified the sectors that they’re invested in, but have particular exposure to companies in real estate; about 10 percent of outstanding corporate loans at a surveyed group of large and medium-size banks were in that sector. Corporate debt could also grow. Companies like Boeing are reportedly drawing on existing lines of credit, while United Airlines is one of the coronavirus-hit businesses that has taken out a new secured loan to help weather decreased revenue. Lee Shaiman, executive director of the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, said bundles of loans to highly indebted companies, known as collateralized loan obligations, aren’t at much risk from the industries that are being hardest hit, like energy and travel. “You don’t want to be Pollyanna-ish,” he said. “We’re in for a rough couple of weeks at least, but it’s very clear why we’re here, as opposed to the financial crisis where there were a lot of reasons and a lot of excesses.” Those CLOs are more transparent and more conservatively structured than the mortgage-backed securities that helped lead to the 2008 blowup, he said. Meanwhile, a lot of payments won’t even be due for years. Still, financial firms are connected to each other in ways that aren’t always clear, which will lead to an intense focus on how large indebted companies are faring. “This is a tinder box that the current regulators have told us is not of concern” for the broader financial system, said Sarah Bloom Raskin, former deputy Treasury secretary and onetime Fed board member. “We will see the extent to which their confidence is warranted.” Raskin also said banks need to be preparing to defer payments from small businesses and people who might be late on mortgage or credit card payments, something their regulators last week encouraged them to do. Some banks have already announced rate reductions on loans for vulnerable borrowers. “These are contributors to how long and deep this downturn is going to be,” she said.",Big banks brace for coronavirus-related onslaught,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/big-banks-coronavirus-onslaught-132997,politico
"The Justice Department is abandoning plans for a looming criminal trial focused on claims of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. With jury selection set to begin in just over two weeks, prosecutors asked a federal judge to permanently dismiss the charges special counsel Robert Mueller brought two years ago against two Russian firms linked to a St. Petersburg businessman known as Putin's chef, Yevgeny Prigozhin. The move scuttles a trial that could have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump: a high-profile showcase of U.S. intelligence agencies' evidence that Russian trolls sought to stir up support for him in the 2016 presidential election while fighting against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee who oversaw the case, formally dismissed the charge against the two Russian firms Monday night. Prosecutors cited several reasons for the shift and were clearly defensive that Russia would portray the decision as proof that U.S. evidence of the alleged Russian tampering is weak. ""There is a substantial federal interest in defending American democratic institutions, exposing those who endeavor to criminally interfere with them, and holding them accountable, which is why this prosecution was properly commenced in the first place,"" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers and U.S. Attorney for Washington Timothy Shea wrote. ""In light of the defendant’s conduct, however, its ephemeral presence and immunity to just punishment, the risk of exposure of law enforcement’s tools and techniques, and the post-indictment change in the proof available at trial, the balance of equities has shifted. It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution,"" Demers and Shea added. They said the indictment would remain in place against Prigozhin and 12 other Russian nationals, as well as the company alleged to have coordinated the online rabble-rousing, the Internet Research Agency. Trump appeared to celebrate the dropping of the charges and the scuttling of the trial as more evidence of the flaws of Mueller's operation. Late Monday night, the president retweeted another user's comment about the developments: ""How embarrassing for Team Mueller."" A defense lawyer for the Russian company that may have surprised prosecutors by seeking a trial in the case, Eric Dubelier, said the prosecution suffered from ""fundamental problems"" from its outset. ""The purpose of this indictment was to make a political statement regarding the outcome of the 2016 election that was grossly overstated,"" said Dubelier, a partner with law firm Reed Smith.  ""In preparing for trial we had every intention to prevail given the problems with the government’s allegations. The government’s evidence was completely devoid of any information that could establish that the defendants knew what they were doing was in violation of highly complex U.S. laws and regulations. This was a make-believe charge to fit the facts solely for political purposes,"" he added. One reason prosecutors cited for their retreat was a recent “classification determination bearing on the evidence the government properly gathered during the investigation [which] limits the unclassified proof now available to the government at trial.” The public filing offered scant details, but suggested that someone in the U.S. intelligence apparatus had decided that disclosing some of the evidence against Concord would expose U.S. intelligence capabilities. Prosecutors asked to submit a separate, secret, classified filing to the court that explained those concerns in more detail. While prosecutors were not specific in their public filing, one disclosed at a recent court hearing that the Justice Department planned to introduce a mystery witness who they said would implicate Prigozhin in election interference outside Russia. It is unclear whether that person is an intelligence asset, defector or someone else.  Intelligence officials also may have concluded that revealing certain evidence against Concord could put at risk Russians who helped the U.S. conclude that the 2016 activities were directed by the Kremlin. One such Russian with Kremlin ties was housed by the CIA in the Washington suburbs until his identity became public last year.  The Justice Department also filed a criminal case last month that suggested the Russian government was seeking to closely monitor Russians cooperating with U.S. intelligence agencies.  From the outset, supporters of the Russian trolls' prosecution — and some critics of the effort — dubbed it a ""name and shame"" effort aimed more at seizing the public relations value of an indictment and less at the typical goal of bringing criminals to justice. No trial ever seemed likely unless one of the defendants stumbled into a place where they could be arrested. However, soon after the indictment was returned in February 2018, Prigozhin sought to call the American prosecutors' bluff without ever exposing himself to the risk of prison. One of his firms, Concord Management & Consulting, hired U.S. lawyers to fight the case. So, the U.S. found itself facing a trial without ever having a human defendant in the dock. That prospect has been relatively clear for nearly two years, but it took prosecutors until Monday — amid the national panic over coronavirus — to concede that going to the trouble of a trial against a company that has no known presence or funds in the U.S., simply wasn't worth it. ""The government has concluded that further proceedings as to Concord, a Russian company with no presence in the United States and no exposure to meaningful punishment in the event of a conviction, promotes neither the interests of justice nor the nation’s security,"" prosecutors wrote. One expert on classified information said Monday that the belated acknowledgment by the prosecution was jarring. ""It's a bit surprising that prosecutors would make this claim so late in the proceeding. It's something they ought to have realized (and may have) months ago or longer,"" said Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists. ""Prosecutors will want to do a postmortem to understand how they got themselves in this position, and how they can avoid similar missteps in the future."" Prosecutors said recent developments in the case contributed to their decision, including difficulties getting Concord to cooperate with court orders to turn over certain information. They faulted the company for submitting a declaration claiming full compliance that was attested to by Prigozhin, someone they described as ""incredible.""  Prigozhin is widely known as Putin's chef because he started out as a high-end restaurateur, developed close ties to the Russian president and built the food-focused business into an empire doing contracting around the world for the Russian military. Concord Management and a related catering company were charged in the criminal case with conspiracy against the U.S. for seeking to frustrate the operation of U.S. election, foreign-agent, and visa laws. Friedrich did not offer any comment on the government's about-face, but did agree to accept and seal the classified explanation prosecutors offered.",Justice Department drops plans for trial over Russian interference in 2016 U.S. election,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/russia-election-justice-department-132875,politico
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants the Army Corps of Engineers to build overflow hospitals. Bernie Sanders wants to call up the National Guard. Joe Biden says ""call out the military — now."" But the military isn't a cure-all, and there are significant legal and practical limits to what the armed forces can do during the coronavirus crisis. “The Department of Defense is ready, willing and able to support civilian authorities to the greatest extent possible at the direction of the president,” Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman told reporters Monday. “We just want to make sure that the conversation that we have is informed by the facts of what is possible and what is not and what those tradeoffs are.” Here is a rundown of the different ways the military could be used in the crisis, along with jobs that should be left to others. Current and former officials have proposed tasking the Pentagon with growing the capacity of the health care system to treat the sickest patients, specifically by deploying field hospitals and constructing care facilities. On Sunday, Biden said the armed forces ""have the capacity to provide this surge help that hospitals need and that is needed across the nation. They have done it. They did it in the Ebola crisis.” But Defense Department officials stressed that while the military does have some experience deploying what they call “tent hospitals,” these facilities are limited in size and capability. Most are small community hospitals tailored for the military’s disproportionately young, healthy community and their families, said Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs, the Joint Staff surgeon. The field hospitals, while they range in size from 25 beds to “much larger,” are designed to support trauma patients and combat casualties, he told reporters Monday. “What we are trying to be very careful about is not over promising,” Friedrichs said. “There are not thousand-bed medical centers all over the U.S.; they are for the most part small community hospitals.” Retired Vice Adm. Matthew Nathan, the former surgeon general of the Navy, said there are some things the military could do to ease the medical burden, but agreed it could only do so much. ""What we are really good at is ramping up trauma capability in a hurry,"" he said in an interview. ""If we just need beds, we are good at that, too."" But he pointed out that even in the worst circumstances such as widespread battle injuries, the military commonly deals with patients who are otherwise healthy and don't suffer from underlying conditions that make them more susceptible to infectious disease such as the coronavirus. ""As far as setting up ICUs to take care of the roughly 6 to 7 percent of patients who will need intensive care and ventilators long term, we don't prepare for that,"" Nathan said. But he stressed that there are other strategies to ""expand the surge of our hospitals."" Instead of treating infected patients, the military could take care of limited numbers of others ""who just need regular hospital care because they are not severe"" in order to free up beds and staff. The Navy’s two medical ships, the USNS Mercy and the USNS Comfort, can handle large-scale medical emergencies. Both contain 12 fully-equipped operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, digital radiological services, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, an optometry lab, a CAT-scan and other capabilities, according to the Navy. But that only helps in areas near the water. ""If for example a community has a large outbreak and there's a need for emergency room support or trauma support, a hospital ship is perfectly designed to do that,” Friedrichs said. ""It’s hard to get the hospital ship to St. Louis, but along the coasts it is an option to use."" Another problem is that these vessels are not conducive to containing infectious disease outbreaks. “You have litters that are stacked toward the ceiling with individuals, you have open bay rooms — they are intended for trauma not for infectious disease environment,” Hoffman said, adding that “there are some beds for that, but at much smaller numbers.” Teams of Army researchers are helping to develop a vaccine and other countermeasures for the virus at installations around the country, including Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, both in Maryland. The teams have identified a potential vaccine that targets what doctors called the “spoke” or “spike protein” that helps the virus attach and enter human cells, Dr. Kayvon Modjarrad, director of emerging infectious diseases at Walter Reed, told reporters at the Pentagon last week. The Army is testing the vaccine candidate on mice and will next move to testing on larger animals and humans to determine whether it is safe. But the earliest the vaccine would be available to the general population is 12 to 18 months, Modjarrad said. More long term, Nathan also says the military has a number of research centers around the world that specialize in disease surveillance ""before they can get a toehold on our troops,” including in Egypt, Peru and Singapore. Perhaps the most famous military doctor, Walter Reed, made scientific breakthroughs in treating communicable diseases in the tropics. ""Why was Major Walter Reed down there? Soldiers were dying of yellow fever."" The National Guard is playing the largest role when it comes to the military's response. As of Monday, some 650 troops have been called up in 15 states to help operate drive-through virus testing facilities, staff emergency operations centers, clean public spaces and transport health care personnel. The biggest contingent to be activated so far is in New York, where as of Monday 516 part-time soldiers and airmen have been called up. In Colorado, 145 National Guardsmen were assisting with drive-up Covid-19 testing centers and helping to plan future screening missions, according to the National Guard Bureau in Washington. Smaller continents, such as eight troops in West Virginia specializing in biological defense, have been activated to train civilian first responders on how to mitigate the exposure to the virus of paramedics and fire and rescue personnel. ""Bottom line, our force must remain flexible, innovative and ready to help America mitigate the impacts of this virus,"" Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said in a statement Monday. But so far, Guardsmen have not yet been “federalized,” or called up on a national scale. That could mean siphoning them away from their civilian jobs where they may already be helping their communities to counter the virus, said Friedrichs. Nor have separate military reservists been called up. “If we mobilize the Guard and Reserve medical personnel from their civilian jobs, they are no longer in their civilian jobs and that directly impacts the community where they work — that’s the tradeoff,” he said. The military does have some options to more efficiently deploy Guard and Reserve personnel, said Hoffman, pointing out the commander of U.S. forces in Korea, one of the global epicenters of the virus, has enlisted Guard and Reserve doctors. Yet there are only so many trained medical professionals in the military to go around. The hospital ships, for example, are currently manned by merchant mariners. The medical personnel to staff them would have to come from elsewhere, Hoffman said. The White House has denied rumors that President Donald Trump is considering a national curfew to limit social interaction until the outbreak is under control. If such a decision were made, however, any military role would likely be limited. And it would fall to the National Guard. The active-duty military is barred from conducting domestic law enforcement under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. The only circumstance in which the active-duty could be called upon to provide security would be under the Insurrection Act to suppress a revolt (a Marine and Army division responded to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, for example). As of Monday, the active-duty military has been asked only to make available a trio of military bases to quarantine cruise ship passengers exposed to the coronavirus. And a spokesperson said no military personnel are involved. “We have a lot of different capacities and we don’t speculate on how or if we'd use it,"" said Stacey Knott, a spokesperson for U.S. Northern Command in Colorado, which is tasked with homeland defense and to support civil authorities in responding to natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes. The National Guard Bureau says it is not planning to play any law enforcement role at this time. ""We have the capability to do something like that but we are not burning calories on something that may or may not be happening,"" said Army Master Sgt. Michael Houk, a Guard spokesperson. ""At this point it looks like it is not happening. We are addressing existing needs."" But if a national curfew is necessary to enforce, the best way to do it is to empower individual states to carry it out. That would fall to traditional law enforcement agencies, not troops, said retired Army Lt. Gen. Steven Blum, former chief of the National Guard Bureau and deputy commander of U.S. Northern Command. ""It depends on how the president sets up the curfew,"" Blum said in an interview. ""Does he set it up where the governors are responsible so they can use the state police to enforce? If all the state governors agree to it and support it then it would be pretty easy. ""If I were advising the president,"" he added, ""I would advise them not to federalize the response but to coordinate the response and allow the states to tailor the response within their guidelines.""",Why you can't just 'call out the military' to fix the coronavirus crisis,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/military-coronavirus-defense-132801,politico
"Seven days before Donald Trump took office, his aides faced a major test: the rapid, global spread of a dangerous virus in cities like London and Seoul, one serious enough that some countries were imposing travel bans.  In a sober briefing, Trump’s incoming team learned that the disease was an emerging pandemic — a strain of novel influenza known as H9N2 — and that health systems were crashing in Asia, overwhelmed by the demand. “Health officials warn that this could become the worst influenza pandemic since 1918,” Trump’s aides were told. Soon, they heard cases were popping up in California and Texas. The briefing was intended to hammer home a new, terrifying reality facing the Trump administration, and the incoming president’s responsibility to protect Americans amid a crisis. But unlike the coronavirus pandemic currently ravaging the globe, this 2017 crisis didn’t really happen — it was among a handful of scenarios presented to Trump’s top aides as part of a legally required transition exercise with members of the outgoing administration of Barack Obama.  And in the words of several attendees, the atmosphere was “weird” at best, chilly at worst. POLITICO obtained documents from the meeting and spoke with more than a dozen attendees to help provide the most detailed reconstruction of the closed-door session yet. It was perhaps the most concrete and visible transition exercise that dealt with the possibility of pandemics, and top officials from both sides — whether they wanted to be there or not — were forced to confront a whole-of-government response to a crisis. The Trump team was told it could face specific challenges, such as shortages of ventilators, anti-viral drugs and other medical essentials, and that having a coordinated, unified national response was “paramount” — warnings that seem eerily prescient given the ongoing coronavirus crisis.  But roughly two-thirds of the Trump representatives in that room are no longer serving in the administration. That extraordinary turnover in the months and years that followed is likely one reason his administration has struggled to handle the very real pandemic it faces now, former Obama administration officials said. “The advantage we had under Obama was that during the first four years we had the same White House staff, the same Cabinet,” said former deputy labor secretary Chris Lu, who attended the gathering. “Just having the continuity makes all the difference in the world.” Sean Spicer, Trump’s first White House press secretary, was among those who participated in the meeting. He said he understood the reasons such exercises could be useful, but described the encounter as a massive transfer of information that ultimately felt very theoretical. In real life, things are never as simple as what’s presented in a table-top exercise, he said. “There’s no briefing that can prepare you for a worldwide pandemic,” added Spicer, who left the administration in mid-2017. The outgoing Obama aides and incoming Trump aides gathered for roughly three hours on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 13, 2017, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House. At least 30 representatives of Trump’s team — many of them soon-to-be Cabinet members — were present, each sitting next to their closest Obama administration counterpart. Incoming Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to keep dozing off. Incoming Energy Secretary Rick Perry was getting along famously with Ernest Moniz, the man he was replacing, several fellow participants said.  But it was clear some on the Trump team had barely, if ever, spoken with the people they were replacing. News had broken that same day about national security adviser Michael Flynn’s unusual contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, so his presence in the meeting added to the surrealness. Some members of both groups kept going in and out of the room, but most paid quiet attention to the presentations, which were led by top Obama aides. Obama aides, in op-eds and essays ripping the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus, officially called COVID-19, have pointed to the Jan. 13, 2017, session as a key example of their effort to press the importance of pandemic preparedness to their successors. In a Friday op-ed, Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, blasted Trump for comments such as “you can never really think” that a pandemic like the coronavirus “is going to happen.” She mentioned the 2017 session as one of many instances of the Obama administration’s efforts to help its successor be ready for such a challenge. She also slammed the Trump team for dismantling the National Security Council section that would play a lead role in organizing the U.S. response to a global pandemic. “Rather than heed the warnings, embrace the planning and preserve the structures and budgets that had been bequeathed to him, the president ignored the risk of a pandemic,” Rice wrote. (Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton, who oversaw the dissolution of the NSC’s global health security and biodefense section, has defended it as necessary streamlining, countering that global health “remained a top NSC priority.” Trump, when recently asked about the reshuffling, called the question “nasty” and said, “I don’t know anything about it.”) Lisa Monaco, Obama’s homeland security adviser, explained the thinking behind the January 2017 session in a recent essay for Foreign Affairs. “Although the exercise was required, the specific scenarios we chose were not,” she wrote. “We included a pandemic scenario because I believed then, and I have warned since, that emerging infectious disease was likely to pose one of the gravest risks for the new administration.” None of the sources argued that one meeting three years ago could have dramatically altered events today. But Obama aides say the Trump administration’s fumbling of the coronavirus outbreak is partly rooted in how unprepared — and in some cases unwilling — it was to engage in transition exercises at all in late 2016 and early 2017. David Shulkin, who was an Obama appointee at the time but had been nominated to be Veterans Affairs secretary in the Trump administration, said in an interview that with the exception of this exercise, which he didn’t recall well, he noticed that in his agency, there had been “little coordination” and “very little interest in working with the Obama appointees.”  “They had said we don’t really have a lot of need to talk to the Obama appointees,” he said. That botched handoff sparked weeks of confusion, all the way up to Inauguration Day. “There was a frenzy before the transition where I was asked to consider staying because the [preparedness] mission was so important,” said Nicole Lurie, who served as Obama’s Health and Human Services assistant secretary for preparedness and response, where she worked on crises like the Ebola virus outbreak and attended the pandemic exercise. “Then through the HHS secretary’s office, the next day, I heard they changed their mind.” The Trump campaign, like the rest of America, was shocked to win the November 2016 election. Soon afterward, Trump cast aside his team’s transition prep work that had happened already and started over; some of his aides described tossing carefully collected binders full of possible personnel picks into trash bins. It was days, sometimes weeks, before his nominees and their aides showed up to meet the people they were replacing — if they did so at all — or to engage in transition meetings. Obama aides said they left detailed memos for their successors, but that quite often it appeared those memos were never read. Many on the Obama side were genuinely surprised that so many actually showed up for the Jan. 13, 2017, exercise, and there were expectations that some would skip it. On the Obama side, several agencies were represented by their second-in-command at the meeting for reasons including a belief that Trump’s principals wouldn’t show. The gathering was held to satisfy a requirement in a 2016 law that updated the procedures around presidential transitions to require, among other things, that the outgoing administration “prepare and host interagency emergency preparedness and response exercises.” Obama also mentioned it in a 2016 executive order laying out his transition goals. The 2016 law came about at the urging of the Partnership for Public Service, a good-government organization that helps administrations and candidates with the transition process. The emergency preparedness provisions were inspired by how George W. Bush handled his transition to Obama; that process, regarded as the gold standard for transition planning, included joint exercises on how to react to improvised explosive devices in cities. Bush had insisted on a detailed and highly coordinated transition planning in part because he felt scarred by the rushed transition he’d experienced from the Bill Clinton administration, not to mention having to deal with the Sept. 11 attacks during his first year. “The idea was hatched after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina precisely to prepare for situations like today,” said David Marchick, director of the Partnership for Public Service’s Center for Presidential Transition.  The Obama and Trump teams met in the afternoon, sitting around tables arranged in a rectangle. Participants were given a binder of unclassified materials titled “Presidential Transition Exercise Series,” the contents of which were obtained by POLITICO. The purpose of the exercise, the documents state, was to “familiarize” the incoming team with “domestic incident management policy and practices and continuity of government programs” in case it faced a major crisis. One key goal was to explain to participants the various legal authorities they had to pursue a response, and which agencies had which capabilities and responsibilities. The references provided included detailed explanations of numerous laws and regulations that might affect their work, such as the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  Aside from the H9N2 pandemic exercise, the participants discussed the case study of how the Obama administration handled Hurricane Sandy in 2012. One section covered a potential cyber incident. Another went through how to respond to a domestic terrorism incident, in this case one carried out by a group of U.S. citizens who placed bombs in nearby spots during a major sporting event in a U.S. city. The terror squad not only detonates the bombs, it also engages in a mass shooting and takes a dozen hostages. Using the materials, Monaco led the discussion. Her incoming counterpart, Tom Bossert, acted as a “semi co-chair,” attendees said. Ross, the then 79-year-old incoming Commerce secretary, was spotted with his eyes closed on more than one occasion. Elaine Chao, tapped to run the Department of Transportation, paid close attention. Several attendees noted the tense body language between Rice and Flynn, who lasted only a few weeks as Trump’s national security adviser and was ousted amid questions over his dealings with Russian officials. And then there was the Energy Department duo: Perry, the incoming secretary who previously served as the governor of Texas, and Moniz, the outgoing secretary and famed physicist. The pair seemed to get along fabulously, which stood out to other attendees given the overall distrust between the two teams and the fact that Perry had once proposed getting rid of the Energy Department altogether. It was a “semi-bizarro lovefest” between the two, a fellow participant said. “They were ready to go make a buddy movie.”  Perry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement, Moniz, who now leads the Energy Futures Initiative, said, “It is correct that [Perry] and I offered relevant perspectives from a governor’s and Cabinet secretary’s seat, respectively. As governor of Texas for a long time, Perry had been through many episodes needing crisis management.” For the most part, however, the Trump team was in receive mode.  Partly, that was not a surprise: Many of Trump’s personnel choices had little or no government experience, and the Obama aides were presenting massive troves of information to them about how a raft of agencies had to work together to respond to various crises. Multiple current and former Trump officials reached by POLITICO said they did not recall much about the briefing. But some Obama aides who attended said they were left with the impression that many of the Trump aides showed up to simply check off a box more than to learn. The impression was boosted in part because the transition overall was going so poorly. Several Trump nominees had barely even spoken to their Obama counterparts.  The State Department representative at the meeting, for instance, was Tom Shannon, a veteran career foreign service officer serving as undersecretary of State for political affairs. Shannon attended instead of Secretary of State John Kerry in part because he would be staying on under Trump and was essentially the “transition designee.” But that Jan. 13, 2017, session was the first time he’d seen the incoming secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in person since Trump picked him for the job a month earlier. (Before the inauguration, Kerry and Tillerson spoke once, by phone, for a few minutes, people familiar with the situation said.) “The problem is that they came in very arrogant and convinced that they knew more than the outgoing administration — full swagger,” one former Obama administration official who attended said.  “There were people who were there who said, ‘This is really stupid and why do we need to be here,’” added another senior Obama administration official who attended, alleging that Ross and incoming Education Secretary Betsy DeVos were especially dismissive in conversations on the sidelines of the session. “But some Trump people, like Tom Bossert, were trying to take it seriously.” Asked for comment, Liz Hill, a spokesperson for DeVos, told POLITICO: “This is nothing more than a hit piece with no basis in reality. This department, under the secretary’s leadership, has taken swift action to support students, parents, and education leaders during this pandemic and will continue to do so. This former Obama official’s wild claims don’t comport with reality.” A Commerce Department spokesperson denied that Ross had dozed off. ""Secretary Ross found the meeting quite interesting and informative, taking many notes during the exercise,"" the spokesperson said. ""He continues to rely upon that knowledge and experience as he assists the president in confronting the crisis at hand."" Another participant noted that such exercises are primarily aimed at helping an incoming administration make it through the first several months of its tenure — “the idea being, of course, that during the transition period we’re uniquely vulnerable.”  Presumably, by the third or fourth year in power, the administration would have its own processes and muscle memory, the participant said. Asked whether information about the pandemic exercise reached the president-elect, a former senior Trump administration official who attended the meeting couldn’t say for sure but noted that it wasn’t “the kind of thing that really interested the president very much.”  “He was never interested in things that might happen. He’s totally focused on the stock market, the economy and always bashing his predecessor and giving him no credit,” the person said. “The possibility things were things he didn’t spend much time on or show much interest in. “Even though we would put time on the schedule for things like that, if they happened at all, they would be very, very brief,” the former official continued. “To get the president to be focused on something like this would be quite hard.”  Anything associated with Obama or his administration was also a no-go zone for Trump aides. If you brought them up, “that would be an immediate rejection, like, ‘Why are they even here? Why the fuck did you ask them?’” Ben Lefebvre contributed to this report.","Before Trump’s inauguration, a warning: ‘The worst influenza pandemic since 1918'",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-inauguration-warning-scenario-pandemic-132797,politico
"At Sunday night’s debate, Bernie Sanders scoffed at Joe Biden’s nearly $2 trillion — with a “t” — plan to combat climate change. “What Joe is saying is nowhere near enough,” Sanders said, dismissing Biden as an incrementalist. Republicans could barely contain their glee. To them, Biden’s pronouncements on a range of issues — from energy to immigration to health care — provided a trove of on-camera material to paint him as a radical in moderate’s clothing in the general election. Though Biden drew praise for a strong debate performance, his commitments underscored the line he’s trying to straddle between pragmatism and progressivism as he works to unite the party as the likely Democratic nominee. Republicans think his positioning will be particularly harmful in the Rust Belt states that decided the 2016 election, and where Biden is seen as a particular threat to Trump. “He effectively called for open borders — no deportations — and has already raised his hand for taxpayer-funded health care for illegals,” Scott Jennings, a former political aide in the George W. Bush White House, said of Biden’s leftward drift. “So, at the same time he’s called for a ban on fracking, he’s opening up America to a flood of illegal immigration. I’m sure this will fly in Pennsylvania and the rest of the upper Midwest. This issue — not to mention the tax increases to pay for abortions — will hurt badly in rural areas and in the big Senate races.” A Trump campaign aide told POLITICO on Monday that Biden had “openly declared war” on traditional energy sources, effectively pledging “a death sentence for the oil and natural gas industries.” Biden called for an end to new fracking (his staff later clarified he only meant on federal land). He said he’d endeavor to take millions of cars off the road, convert gas-powered fleets to clean-burning and end drilling on federal lands. He’d haul the world’s 100 biggest polluters before the U.S. in his first 100 days and make them pay an economic price. He’d convene the hemisphere to provide tens of billions for Brazil to stop burning the Amazon.  And that was on the environment alone. From immigration to social issues to health care, Republicans insist Biden is harming himself in battleground states where his appeal to centrist Democrats has long been viewed as an unmitigated asset. In a statement following the debate, Trump’s campaign even tried to yoke Biden to Sanders on health care, arguing that both offer “a complete government takeover” of the system. The warning shots at Biden come as Trump is message-testing ways to drive up excitement among his restive base while struggling with the enormous responsibilities of managing the coronavirus pandemic. Biden aides and allies view charges that he’s making himself vulnerable to Trump as fanciful. A Biden campaign official rejected the thinking outright, saying Trump will have to defend his record of supporting efforts in the courts to strip essential health coverage from millions. The Biden aide pointed to Trump’s caging of immigrant children and demonization of immigrants as antithetical to America’s values and his ignorance of the climate emergency as costing the U.S. when it should be pursuing green jobs. “These guys are going to have a tough time turning Joe Biden into an extremist liberal in this environment. In that context, Sanders served as a great foil for Biden,” said Tim Miller, a former adviser to Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, who voted for Biden in California’s March 3 primary. “Biden spent 30 minutes waving off Sanders’ claims that a trillion-dollar climate change plan is not enough — this is how you make a bold agenda look pretty centrist.” Trump’s campaign has signaled in recent days that it will try numerous approaches to confronting Biden — from questioning his mental acuity to focusing on what they view as his out-of-step liberalism. Dan Pfeiffer, the former Barack Obama adviser, dismissed the Republican strategy as reeking of desperation for a Trump campaign that had been planning to run against Sanders. The Vermont senator had appeared ascendant leading into Super Tuesday. “Trump already has the voters driven primarily by immigration,” Pfeiffer said, “so it’s about base maintenance as opposed to growing his vote share to a number sufficient to win.” “Several strategies,” he added, “is the same as no strategy.” For months, Biden has unveiled far-reaching plans that would make him a more progressive nominee than Hillary Clinton or his 2008 running mate, former President Barack Obama. Yet Biden has continued with his move left on past statements and policies relating to immigration, abortion, criminal justice and entitlement programs like Social Security. Now, poised to wrap up the nomination, he has grasped for even more olive branches as part of a broader effort to unify Democrats. Biden, who leads Trump in several battleground polls, has endorsed former rival Elizabeth Warren’s sweeping bankruptcy plan to strike through portions of a law that they once fought over. Ahead of Sunday’s debate, he gave his blessing to a Sanders-inspired plan to make college tuition free for students whose families earn less than $125,000 annually. The debate offered him yet another chance to appeal to progressives. Biden pledged that under his administration only felons would be deported in his first 100 days, saying he’d focus on uniting families. “It’s about making sure that we can both be a nation of immigrants as well as a nation that is decent, he said. Biden also said undocumented immigrants arrested by local police should not be turned over to federal immigration authorities, after opposing sanctuary cities as a presidential candidate in 2007. He again distanced himself from voting for the Hyde Amendment, which banned federal funding for the majority of abortions. Biden also restated his policy on public lands and waters, including prohibiting permitting of oil and gas drilling. Trump’s campaign has focused intently on Biden’s environmental and immigration remarks. “Fossil fuel industries employ 10 million Americans and he would yank the jobs out from under all of them. His plan would also drive heating and cooling bills through the roof,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump’s reelection campaign. Murtaugh said Biden’s plan to halt deportations would leave enormous numbers of other criminals in the U.S. who continue to pose a threat to public safety. And Biden’s position on locals not cooperating with federal immigration officials would “effectively turn the entire United States into a sanctuary country and tell the world that our borders are open,” he said. In a Monday email, America Rising, the Republican opposition outfit, cited a Wall Street Journal infographic that tallied up Biden’s agenda as costing more than twice as much as Clinton’s, with his proposed taxes totaling three times as much as the Democratic nominee four years ago. The message: Biden and Sanders “will be virtually indistinguishable.” “As we have said over and over, the eventual Democrat candidate will have to adopt the agenda of the extreme left in order to become the nominee in the first place, and Joe Biden proved that last night,” Murtaugh added.","Trump licks his chops as Biden veers left on sanctuary cities, fracking",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/biden-conservatives-trump-132214,politico
"A potential shortage of cotton swabs and other basic supplies needed for coronavirus testing is emerging as a new threat to the Trump administration’s plans to roll out high-volume testing to 2,000 sites across the country by the end of the week. President Donald Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said that millions of Americans could be tested in the coming weeks. But behind the scenes, some officials are warning the nation’s commercial labs that kinks in the supply chain for basic lab materials are the latest obstacle to broader testing. During a Sunday night conference call, HHS Assistant Secretary of Health Brett Giroir warned more than 300 representatives of commercial laboratories, hospitals and state health departments that the Trump administration anticipates supply “speed bumps” as testing expands, a person on the call told POLITICO. The materials in question include swabs that medical workers use to collect samples of patients’ phlegm and saliva for testing, and disposable plastic tips for the pipettes that lab technicians use to transfer liquids. Testing labs say they’re also concerned about the availability of personal protective equipment for their staff. Fears about securing these basic supplies are the latest concern for public health officials as they scramble to institute the widespread testing that is desperately needed to track the spread of the coronavirus and limit the growing U.S. outbreak. The pace of U.S. testing has been slowed by shortages of critical materials used to prep patient samples for analysis and problems with an early test developed by the CDC. Now, the contrast between the administration’s public and private messaging on its plan to expand testing is rankling U.S. labs. The Trump administration announced Friday that it is creating a national network of 2,000 high-volume testing sites, with each processing 2,000 to 4,000 samples a day by the end of this week. To help reach that expanded testing goal, the Food and Drug Administration said Sunday that public health labs no longer have to send coronavirus samples to the CDC to be confirmed. That should reduce the wait for test results and the number of tests conducted for each patient, said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Twitter. The FDA also recently approved the use of more types of cotton swabs and of high-volume testing systems manufactured by Roche and Thermo Fisher. About 122 of of the Roche testing machines are installed at U.S. labs, the investment bank SVB Leerink said Monday, while Thermo Fisher said it is shipping its equipment to about 200 labs. And companies such as Qiagen, Quidel, Hologic and Cepheid are developing their own high-volume testing systems. But the commercial labs that are now performing the bulk of the country’s coronavirus tests say they need help from the government to secure sufficient numbers of swabs and other low-tech equipment. “We need the continued commitment from HHS and the administration to work with us to maintain the necessary volume of supplies,” Tom Sparkman, senior vice president of government affairs and policy at the American Clinical Laboratory Association, told POLITICO. State officials have echoed those concerns. “I’m worried now about access to an adequate number of swabs, not just the RNA extraction kits” used to prepare samples for analysis, said California Gov. Gavin Newsom at a press conference on Sunday. Carmela Coyle, president and CEO of the California Hospital Association, expressed anxiety over the United States’ testing failures and the looming shortages of equipment to test patients and protect lab technicians and other health care workers. “In order to take the specimen, it requires full personal protective equipment,” she said. “We are already short.” Victoria Colliver and Angela Hart contributed to this report.",Latest coronavirus testing glitch: Not enough cotton swabs,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/coronavirus-testing-glitch-cotton-swabs-132692,politico
"The Senate on Monday unanimously adopted a short-term extension of key federal surveillance programs that expired on Sunday night — a move that allows the chamber to more rapidly consider legislation addressing the economic impacts of the global coronavirus pandemic.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scrapped an initial procedural vote Monday night on a House-passed bill that would reauthorize now-expired provisions of the 2015 USA Freedom Act and alter the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  Instead, McConnell and his leadership team worked out a deal with civil libertarian hard-liners who oppose that House bill, including Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), on a 77-day extension of the surveillance powers. As part of the agreement, Lee and Paul also secured a package of amendment votes on the House bill, which has the backing of Attorney General William Barr and leaders from both parties in the House.  “We shouldn’t have to wait until the moment when we’re on the eve of the expiration of some important legislation and where we have to wait for the president of the United States to weigh in and lean in,” Lee said. “From time to time, laws require revision and review and reform. That always necessarily requires amendments.”  Senators were under intense pressure to clear the legislative docket to allow for the chamber to quickly take up a bill intended to blunt the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. The House is expected to send a final version to the Senate as early as Monday night.  Lee and Paul, for their part, vehemently oppose the House’s FISA bill, contending that it does not go far enough to reform law enforcement’s surveillance authority. But they said they would be willing to back a temporary extension of the provisions if Senate GOP leaders allow amendment votes on the House bill, which passed in the lower chamber last week with a bipartisan majority.  “They can do it the easy way or the hard way. The easy way is that they allow debate,” Paul told reporters.  Other senators indicated earlier Monday that they would support a temporary extension of the FISA powers out of concern that a prolonged lapse would hinder the U.S. intelligence community’s work.  “If the alternative is staying dark, I’ll take an extension,” Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) told reporters. McConnell did not address the negotiations on Monday afternoon, only saying the House bill was the best path forward.  “It reauthorizes the tools, which our national security requires, while also imposing a number of new reforms, which basic accountability demands,” McConnell said.  “The Senate should not wait to act,” McConnell added. “I sincerely hope that even our colleagues who may wish to vote against the House bill will not make us prolong this brief lapse in authorities and that we will be able to get these tools back online this week.”  Last week, Lee attempted numerous times to secure unanimous consent for a short-term extension, with an agreement to vote on four amendments to the House-passed bill at a later date. But Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) objected to Lee’s requests, saying it was unnecessary to drag out a debate over the FISA provisions.  Lee also spoke with President Donald Trump earlier that day and said the president told him he did not support the House bill. However, House Republicans indicated late last week that Trump does, in fact, support the legislation.  Three key FISA provisions lapsed on Sunday night after the Senate failed to reauthorize them before the deadline. The House bill addressed bipartisan concerns about possible overreach by the surveillance courts and ended an already deactivated National Security Agency program that allowed the organization to obtain, with judicial approval, Americans’ phone records in terror investigations.  The legislation strengthened privacy statutes and placed new restrictions on the FISA courts — inspired in part by Trump’s frequent complaints about his former campaign adviser, Carter Page, who was wiretapped as part of the U.S. government’s initial investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

"The House is unlikely to return from recess next week as scheduled, with Democratic leaders expected to keep the chamber dark until the next coronavirus stimulus package is ready for a vote, according to multiple Democrats.  Speaking on a conference call with the caucus Monday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told Democrats not to plan to return March 23 as scheduled and to stay tuned for more updates on Thursday. The announcement comes as congressional leaders face dueling missions: how to stave off economic disaster, while simultaneously protecting the hundreds of lawmakers — many of whom are older — from catching and spreading the coronavirus.   Several aides cautioned the chamber could resume legislative action as soon as the next day — March 24 — if the House was ready to vote on a third tranche of recovery money. Congressional leaders are in early negotiations over a massive legislative package they hope will heed off a potential economic collapse as industries, including airlines, hotels and restaurants, shutter to help prevent the spread of the virus.  U.S. airlines are seeking nearly $60 billion in grants and loans, according to a memo distributed on Monday, warning that Congress must act urgently to help several carriers avoid a “potential valley of death” going into the summer months. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, told Democrats he expects the impact on the industry to be “way worse than 9/11,” adding that some airlines are in “free fall,” according to sources on the call Monday.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) instructed Democrats to send ideas about what they’d like to see in the legislation to her office as House and Senate negotiators begin working in earnest on the next bill.  The House left town early Saturday morning after clearing a multibillion dollar stimulus package — its second bill aimed at stemming the outbreak — though it’s currently stalled in the Senate as negotiators hammer out a slew of technical tweaks.  Even so, Democrats and Republicans have been quick to focus their attention on the third legislative response to the outbreak — a measure that is expected to be the biggest so far, with members already comparing its size and scope with the bailouts approved amid the 2008 financial collapse.  Congressional leaders, as well as rank-and-file members of both parties, have already begun floating dramatic plans, such as cash handouts similar to the idea of universal basic income, popularized in the 2020 race by presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Several Democrats asked questions on the call about the possibility of a universal basic income policy — which Pelosi herself had initially been skeptical of, when it was floated at a recent Democratic meeting, though support has been gradually ticking up on both sides.  Pelosi told members on Monday that the priority was to keep people healthy and put money in people’s pockets, specifically mentioning refundable tax credits or some other mechanism, according to people familiar with the call. Top Democrats also discussed the possibility of expanding Medicaid, creating additional price-gouging protections and shoring up local transit and Amtrak.   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday pitched a massive $750 billion proposal that includes direct cash payments as well as substantial support for small businesses and hospitals.   House leaders are also working to balance efforts to prop up the economy with anxiety among their own members, who waited around the Capitol for days while Pelosi negotiated a package of coronavirus response measures with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Members privately worried that they were being forced into packed meetings and hallways crowded with reporters and staff, despite increasingly pitched warnings from experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid those precise situations.  The CDC has now recommended that all gatherings of more than 50 people be canceled for the next eight weeks, complicating plans for the 435-member House and its thousands of staffers. Many Capitol Hill offices have already implemented teleworking strategies for aides, and some lawmakers have either self-quarantined or gotten tested for coronavirus after brushes with people who later tested positive. So far, no member of Congress has reported testing positive for the illness.  House leaders revealed Monday that they would be taking steps to prevent too many members from being on the floor even during votes, the rare occasion when most lawmakers congregate at the same time. Leadership offices in both parties have discussed ideas such as keeping votes open longer, to limit physical contact among members ""[P]lans are being developed to coordinate votes in order to limit the number of Members voting on the Floor at any one time,"" Hoyer's office wrote in a schedule update. Pelosi told lawmakers they may vote according to state or some other procedure when they do come back to limit the number of lawmakers being on the floor at the same time.  On Sunday, Pelosi wrote a letter to House members responding to their growing concerns and encouraging new steps to promote “social distancing” — measures to prevent close contact between people in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus. “This may entail more than half of your Washington staff teleworking from home,” Pelosi wrote. “As this public health emergency develops, the House will continue to take strong, strategic and science-based action to keep the American people safe and ensure the continuity of Congressional operations.”",House eyes extended recess as coronavirus spreads,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/house-coronavirus-recess-132370,politico
"The White House aims to deploy at least $800 billion in aid in the coming weeks to prop up the U.S. economy, as retailers, restaurants, sporting events and other businesses shut down and Americans slow their spending while staying home to guard against the coronavirus pandemic. Among the administration’s targets this week: providing relief in the form of tax deferments, loans or even direct payments to airlines, the hospitality industry and small-to-medium businesses crippled by plunging demand. Officials know they need to release the contours of their plan quickly — potentially as soon as Tuesday — as turmoil accelerates in financial markets, said a person familiar with the White House’s plans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow have specifically cited aid for U.S. airlines, as travelers cancel trips or avoid new bookings and public health experts advise older Americans to avoid flying entirely. “We don’t see the airlines failing, but if they get into a cash crunch, we’re going to try to help them,” Kudlow told reporters Monday at the White House. He said the airlines had been in touch seeking aid, “lots of them,” and that “we’re in touch about their balance sheets and their cash flow.” Hotel CEOs are planning to visit the White House on Tuesday to meet with Vice President Mike Pence, as the hospitality industry also struggles from a serious downturn. The Treasury Department and National Economic Council met several times over the weekend to develop a list of options for the administration’s next phase of fiscal stimulus and held several conversations with President Donald Trump, said one senior administration official. So far, officials have discussed allowing industries such as airlines to defer tax payments or temporarily keep some of the taxes they collect from consumers. Airlines are seeking even greater assistance — nearly $60 billion worth — as they cancel flights and park plans due to collapsing demand for travel. The hotel industry has suggested options to help with their cash crunch including loans from the Small Business Administration, deferring tax liabilities, a temporary payroll tax cut or a tax credit to retain employees. Other suggestions have included offering loan guarantees, loan forbearance or the cancellation of debts through executive action or regulatory changes, said a Republican in close contact with the administration. Within the past week, as business plunged across the nation, the internal discussion among top economic officials has moved toward providing industries with cash and not just tax relief — even if no one in the White House wants to call it a bailout.  Kudlow said he preferred to call it more of a “short-term liquidity issue.” The goal is to help industries deal with the cash-flow crises they’ll likely face in the coming weeks, even if the administration sees no evidence of systemic risk. “They haven’t settled on any one thing at this point,” said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and outside adviser to the president. “We proposed a four-step plan and the best idea is to suspend the payroll tax for the rest of the year. That’s something that would help everyone. It’s clean, and it doesn’t pick winners and losers.” Industries across the board are starting to latch onto the idea of suspending the payroll tax for employers for the rest of the year. The largest business lobbying group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, included the idea in a letter it sent to Congress on Monday, and Trump has said he’d like the payroll tax either cut or suspended through the end of the year. Leaders from sectors including airlines, hotels and casinos have been warning officials behind closed doors about concerns they’ll have to start laying off thousands of employees if the shutdown throughout America continues — including in politically sensitive states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania. Half of the $800 billion in aid, under the latest White House estimates, would come from aid to workers and small businesses, tax deferrals and other moves already underway including deferring student-loan interest, buying oil and additional provisions of a relief bill already moving through Congress. The other half would come from a payroll-tax holiday through the end of the year — a move that would likely cost much more than $400 billion. The administration is also exploring with the Federal Reserve how it can deploy the central bank’s emergency powers to lend to nonfinancial firms, though the central bank’s authorities were curtailed in the political backlash to the 2008 bailout of insurer American International Group. The White House and economic officials are desperate to stave off a potential recession, since the economy has been one of the hallmark achievements of Trump’s first term and a key message for his reelection. The former head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, said in an interview that the March jobs report out early next month might show losses of more than 1 million. “It really could be the worst jobs report we’ve ever seen in our history.” He said he did calculations over the weekend with conservative economist Larry Lindsey showing that the economy could contract by a severe 5 percent in the second quarter, though a swift containment of the virus could lead to a bounce-back in the third quarter.  “There is a dispute between the House and the Senate and the president about what to do,” Hassett said. “But imagine if it’s Friday when the jobs report comes out and it’s worse than we’ve ever seen. Then you’d see Congress act with urgency. The question is if they act with urgency ahead of the terrible numbers.” Hassett, who remains in contact with the White House, says he is not in favor of direct industry bailouts but is arguing for the payroll tax suspension at least for a quarter of the year. “You can do it quickly on the employer side and we need employers not to fire people,” he said. “And on the employee side, it could have a macro-economic effect. You could even offset the 5 percent economic decline with the payroll tax cut. And we don’t have to have a recession if the virus fades and the third quarter booms.”  In addition to hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders directly, the White House is hearing from informal economic advisers such as Moore with their proposals.  Moore said he sent a plan to Kudlow for items to include in the next stimulus proposal that’s expected to emerge from the White House and Treasury Department in the coming days. Moore authored a proposal along with publishing magnate Steve Forbes and supply-side economics guru Art Laffer, a close Kudlow ally. The group suggested financing the payroll tax cut by issuing 50- and 100-year Treasury bonds at 1 percent interest. They also suggested avoiding any direct cash bailouts to hard-hit industries like airlines or hotels. “Every business is materially affected by this. Who is going to make these decisions about who gets aid and who doesn’t?” Moore said. The final piece of the plan would be for the Fed to open lending facilities for low-interest loans to any business that has collateral to avoid cash crunches that could force companies into fire sales of assets to raise cash to replace revenue lost to the crisis. “We aren’t sure which of these Larry and [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin like, but Trump listens to us,” Moore said. “He seeks out our advice. We are urging him not to do things that are bad policy that he would not do otherwise.” A former senior Treasury official still in contact with senior members of the department said Mnuchin is aware that many Republicans will have problems with direct bailout payments to individual industries, but that he may propose them anyway for airlines, cruise lines and the entertainment industry more broadly. “The problem is the Wall Street [Troubled Asset Relief Program] vote still haunts those halls,” this former official said of the 2008 vote to bail out big banks. “It’s going to be like pulling teeth to get Republicans to vote for that. I think the White House is also open to refundable tax credits. And then you have the challenge of, ‘How do you help people exempt from the payroll tax?’’’ The person added that a plan could not wait until the end of the week. “It has to happen right away. Like, right now. Otherwise businesses are just going to start closing and laying people off right away.” Meridith McGraw contributed to this report.",Trump team prepares rescue package of at least $800 billion,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-coronavirus-relief-package-132369,politico
"President Donald Trump on Monday acknowledged the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic, releasing strict new guidelines to limit people’s interactions in an increasingly urgent bid to slow the virus in the next two weeks before U.S. hospitals are overwhelmed. “We have an invisible enemy,” the president said at a news conference, where he released guidelines that called for people to avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people, steer clear of eating and drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts, and work or attend school from home whenever possible. “This is a bad one. This is a very bad one.” The guidelines — including a strict recommendation that anyone with even minor symptoms stay home — are not mandatory. But they were issued with a sense of alarm and a frankness that Trump has not previously displayed. The president acknowledged that the crisis — which has already killed thousands around the world and set off a plunge of world markets — could last until July or August and even plunge the nation into a recession. No country, including the United States, has it under control, he said, though he also suggested America could limit its death toll “if we do a really good job” responding now. “Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus,” Trump said. “If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation, and we will defeat the virus, and we’re going to have a big celebration altogether. With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly.” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that while some people may perceive the guidelines as inconvenient or going too far, they reflect a deteriorating assessment of the containment efforts and should be taken seriously. “When you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak, you are always behind where you think you are if you think that today reflects where you really are. That’s not word speak. It means if you think you’re here,” Fauci said, gesturing to illustrate his point, “you’re really here because you’re only getting the results. Therefore, it will always seem that the best way to address it would be to be doing something that looks like it might be an overreaction. It isn’t an overreaction.” The White House gave the country a 15-day window to flatten the soaring curve of infection, but some disease modelers see a trajectory that could create a crisis, similar to Italy, that would start to overwhelm the U.S. health care system in about 10 days. Fauci called the 15 days “a trial” period for the guidelines to be reconsidered. “It isn’t that these guidelines are now gonna be in effect until July,” he clarified. “What the president was saying is the trajectory of the outbreak may go until then.” The new guidelines come on the heels of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance Sunday night that recommended the cancellation and postponement of gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. It also comes after the Office of Personnel Management declared federal offices in the Washington, D.C., area open but with maximum flexibility for telework. The president’s remarks reflect the increased urgency of the moment. As recently as Sunday, Trump was telling Americans to “relax” and that the pandemic would pass. And on Monday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow predicted that the outbreak would only impact the economy in the short term — “weeks and months,” he said, not years.  But hours later, Trump said the situation was “bad,” and administration officials pointed to new predictive modeling showing a need for more stringent social distancing measures. The case for aggressive social distancing is clear: A coronavirus vaccine is at least a year away, and the acceleration of the outbreak within the U.S. has put the it on track with some of the world’s hardest-hit nations.  “If everybody does what we’ve asked for in the next 15 days, we will see a dramatic difference,” said Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator. More than a month-and-a-half into the response effort and after failed bids to prevent and then contain the disease’s spread, the Trump administration is now scrambling to put its full weight behind a messaging campaign aimed at convincing people to do something simple yet unnatural: stay home. Still, public health experts said the administration has much work to do to sell Americans on such an abrupt change in habits and rebuild its credibility after weeks of mixed messages.  Trump was joined at the briefing by his key health advisers, including Fauci, Birx and Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration’s response.  A growing number of governors earlier Monday followed the lead of fellow executives, announcing closures of bars, restaurants and other venues in states across the country. The new guidance similarly calls for any bars, restaurants, food courts, gyms and other venues to be closed in areas where there’s evidence of community transmission. Trump held separate video teleconferences with G-7 leaders and governors on Monday morning to discuss the response to the coronavirus. “Went very well,” he tweeted after speaking to governors. During the call, however, Trump urged governors to try to get respirators, ventilators and other equipment themselves. Hospital systems have raised alarms over a lack of beds and medical supplies to handle the crush of anticipated patients, and already some hospitals are beginning to postpone certain procedures in an effort to free up space and medical personnel. “We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves,” the president told them, according to a source in the room. “Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.” The New York Times first reported the president’s remarks to governors. Trump told reporters that governors would be able to get what they need sooner if they don’t rely on the federal government. Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, said while “the words did not quite come out right,” the president encouraged states to use whatever supply chains they have access to while the federal government attempts to maintain more respirators and ventilators. Administration officials also stressed the important role millennials can play in combating the spread of the virus. Birx called that generation “the core group that will stop the virus.” She said millennials are the most likely group to be the least symptomatic but also the group most likely to be out and about and in social gatherings. That means they could unknowingly spread the virus to older people or those with underlying issues, who are more vulnerable, if they ignore guidance and recommendations, but they’re also adept at communicating via text and across social media platforms. “Public health people like myself don’t always come out with compelling and exciting messages that a 25- to 35-year-old may find interesting and something that they’ll take to heart,” Birx said. “But millennials can speak to one another about how important it is in this moment to protect all of the people.” Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CNN on Monday morning that the U.S. was “at a critical inflection point,” noting that America now has the same number of cases that Italy had two weeks ago. Italy is now on lockdown as it deals with more than 27,000 cases of the coronavirus, trailing only China, where the outbreak began. And public health experts have warned that without further dramatic steps, the U.S. could look like Italy by month’s end, with hospitals swamped by sick patients and hundreds of thousands of infected people freely circulating. “We have a choice to make: Do we want to really lean into social distancing and mitigation strategies and flatten the curve or do we just want to keep going on with business as usual and end up being Italy?” Adams said. As of Monday afternoon, more than 4,100 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., though experts expect that number to rise as more testing becomes available. More than 70 people have died.

"Polls will not open for Ohio's primary election Tuesday after a late-night decision from Gov. Mike DeWine, effectively upheld by the state Supreme Court, to delay in-person voting until June in an effort to protect voters and poll workers from the coronavirus outbreak. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. The election was in limbo for several hours Monday night after a state judge in Columbus denied a last-minute attempt by the state to postpone the primary election. But DeWine responded with an unprecedented order closing physical polling places as the legal battle moved up to the Ohio Supreme Court. Early Tuesday morning, four judges on that court issued a unanimous, unsigned ruling declining to stop the state from shuttering polls. Three other judges on the court recused — two because they're currently running for reelection and the other because he is DeWine's son. The ruling effectively overturns the Monday ruling from Franklin County Judge Richard Frye that the primary had to continue as scheduled. Frye said it was too late to move back the primary and that doing so would confuse and suppress voters. Frye also took issue with the state’s claim that moving the election to June would alleviate voters’ health concerns, saying there's no medical evidence the pandemic will have disappeared by then. Now, officials and voting rights experts say it's not clear whether and how voters will be able to participate in the still-scheduled primary with polling places shuttered, though DeWine, a Republican, has pledged to ""to extend voting options."" ""Every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,"" he said Monday. But the state has not yet laid out the path to letting people vote.  ""What I find most confusing is whether the governor is purporting to call off the election or not,"" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California-Irvine. ""Saying one is closing polling places is not the same as postponing the election."" Ohio is one of four states with primaries scheduled on Tuesday, along with Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Officials in the other three states said that their Tuesday primaries would proceed as planned. Meanwhile, Kentucky's top elections official announced that his state's primaries would move from May to June as well. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced that he and Gov. Andy Beshear had agreed to delay the state's May primary until June 23. ""There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy us time,"" Adams said in his announcement. Kentucky is the third state to formally delay its primary, following Louisiana and Georgia. Earlier in the day, Ohio officials claimed they were ready to move forward with the election as well should the courts not grant the extension.  ""If that was necessitated, I have no doubt that the patriotic Ohio election officials would get that job done,"" LaRose said. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said both state party chairs were consulted and supportive of the push to postpone the primary, though he acknowledged the last-minute nature of the announcement risks confusing voters. ""In deference to their expertise on this critical health crisis, I support that decision regarding in-person voting tomorrow,"" Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a statement following DeWine's initial press conference. ""Extending an election is an unprecedented step, so we as a party are weighing alternatives on how to best do so — including the possibility to conduct the primary election entirely by vote-by-mail, as is done in several other states, with a deadline much earlier than June 2."" The move represented a significant escalation in state action to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Already, Ohio election officials had relocated or closed nearly 150 polling places that were originally supposed to be in nursing homes and assisted living facilities and recruited backup poll workers to replace those who were not comfortable serving due to their age or health status. Over the weekend, before trying to move election day, Ohio officials ordered county boards of elections to set up curbside voting options and extend the deadline to request an absentee ballot for anyone impacted by the virus.  As recently as Friday, election officials from all four states voting Friday, including LaRose, said that the March 17 elections would go on as scheduled. After DeWine held his press conference, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said that he ""feel[s] good about the decision to let the election go on tomorrow."" ""Look, we have to have our elections continue, in my opinion,"" Pritzker said. ""This is the right thing to do. Our democracy needs to go on. We have to elect leaders."" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also said Monday that she wanted ""to encourage everybody to go out and vote today and if you choose to vote tomorrow, it's going to be safe."" In Florida, Secretary of State Laurel Lee said Monday evening at a press conference that the state will still hold its primary on Tuesday. Lee said nearly 2 million people have already voted. And in Arizona, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said the election will also move forward on Tuesday. ""What it all comes down to is that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,"" Hobbs said at a press conference.  Election officials in the state have worked to minimize risk in polling places across the state, striking a delicate balance between making voting accessible and protecting public health. ""This is a dynamic situation. It’s changing day by day, hour by hour,"" Adrian Fontes, the Maricopa County recorder, told POLITICO in an interview on Monday. ""While the state has closed all rec centers and libraries, we made sure they will still stay open as polling places. We have heightened cleanliness and sanitation protocols, and we're paying close attention to mandates from federal, state and local authorities. ...

"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is stepping up its response to the coronavirus by shutting its border to nearly all non-residents, except for U.S. citizens. Speaking to reporters Monday outside his residence, Trudeau said people who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents will be denied entry into Canada. He noted there are exceptions for airline crews, diplomats, immediate family members of Canadians and, for now, U.S. citizens. ""As the virus continues its spread we've decided to take increasingly aggressive steps to keep you and your family safe,"" said Trudeau, who has been in self-isolation and working from home since last Thursday when his wife tested positive for the coronavirus. ""These measures will help save lives."" Trudeau said U.S. citizens are exempt from the ban because Canada's southern neighbor is in a category of its own. Canada will also strengthen travel restrictions in other areas. Trudeau said that, starting Thursday, international flights will only be permitted to land in four cities' airports: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary. He said flights to Canada from the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean and Saint Pierre and Miquelon will be exempt from this rule. Airlines, he added, will be mandated to test all travelers and to prevent anyone showing symptoms of the virus from boarding a plane. The prime minister said Canadians returning home from abroad will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Earlier Monday, the Canada Border Services Agency added new questions for travelers arriving in Canada from all international destinations. The change, aimed at dealing with coronavirus fears, came amid confusion and criticism of the government’s airport screening process. Ontario Premier Doug Ford called on the federal government earlier Monday to tighten things up at the border. Ford also said he would support a federal government decision to shutter Canada's borders to visitors, including those from the United States, in response to the coronavirus. But Ford added that he would not want to see any closure to cross-border trade and commerce.","Trudeau: Canada to deny entry to all nonresidents except U.S. citizens, for now",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/canada-shuts-border-coronavirus-132332,politico

"The White House and Senate Republicans are considering melding together a House-passed coronavirus aid bill with President Donald Trump's request for $850 billion in stimulus spending, creating one massive aid package that the Senate could pass this week.  The thinking, as described by Senate Republican leadership aides and several Trump administration aides, is that one large-scale package would be easier to push through the Senate immediately. The downside is the House would have to also approve the package, and the House is in recess with no current plan to return. But since Senate Republicans were aiming to amend the House bill anyway, they don't see much practical or political risk.  This will, undoubtedly, create a massive legislative rush this week in the midst of a national health crisis that has brought the nation to a standstill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is slated to attend the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday afternoon, where he is expected to discuss this plan.

"Social distancing hit the set of President Donald Trump’s favorite morning cable news show Tuesday, with the three hosts of “Fox & Friends” scattered across their New York studio in an effort to demonstrate best practices amid the coronavirus pandemic.  “To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart — same studio, plenty of distance,” co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers at the top of the broadcast.   The right-leaning talk show, which airs weekdays from 6-9 a.m. ET and has achieved outsized influence under Trump’s administration, is the latest TV news program to employ the preventative measure as the outbreak tears across the United States. Although the CDC recommends that Americans maintain a distance of six feet to help thwart the coronavirus’ rapid spread, co-host Steve Doocy said that he and his colleagues usually sit only about 18 inches apart on the signature “curvy couch” of the “Fox & Friends” set. Tuesday morning, however, Doocy was alone on the mezzanine-level sofa, while Kimeade anchored “the big plastic desk” one floor below and co-host Ainsley Earhardt was stationed at a lectern nearby in the studio’s “fish bowl area.” “We’re doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is stay away from each other because you don’t want to get infected and you don’t want to spread infection,” Doocy said. “We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,” Earhardt added. “And so if you can keep your distance and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly and help our country as a nation.” The new seating configuration reflects the seriousness with which President Donald Trump and his staunchest allies, both in media and politics, are now taking the nature of the coronavirus threat after previously being dismissive of its risk to Americans. On-air talent and guests at Fox News have drawn special scrutiny for downplaying the disease in recent weeks. Just last Friday, Earhardt remarked that it was “actually the safest time to fly” despite advisories against nonessential travel, and conservative religious leader Jerry Falwell Jr. appeared on the program to accuse people of “overreacting” to the coronavirus. “It makes you wonder if there’s a political reason for that,” Falwell said. “You know, impeachment didn’t work, and the Mueller report didn’t work, and Article 25 didn’t work. And so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.”",The president’s favorite morning show starts social distancing,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fox-and-friends-social-distancing-133619,politico
"Few Americans trust President Donald Trump when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, and fewer than half of respondents believe the federal government is taking sufficient steps to combat the public health crisis.  An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Tuesday shows that only 37 percent of those polled have either “a good amount” or “a great deal” of trust in the the information they hear from the president about the coronavirus, while 60 percent say they do “not very much” or “not at all” trust Trump’s words on the subject.  Among those surveyed, the president’s trust ratings regarding the coronavirus rank lower than other prominent sources of information, including the news media, state and local governments, and public health experts. More Americans than do not disapprove of the way he is handling the pandemic, 49 percent to 44 percent, and his overall job approval rating rests at 43 percent. The poll’s results come after the White House spent weeks downplaying the coronavirus threat to the United States, even as public health officials within the administration sounded alarms over its risk to the country and warned of its rapid rates of transmission. Only recently has Trump adopted a more somber tone when discussing the crisis, acknowledging Tuesday that “this is a very bad one” and cautioning Americans that “we have an invisible enemy.”  The more dire rhetoric from the president was accompanied by a new series of increasingly stern guidelines from the administration, which recommended avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people; working or attending school from home whenever possible; and abstaining from eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts. It remains to be seen whether the latest measures will bolster public confidence in the administration’s ability to fight the coronavirus. Just 46 percent of Americans believe the federal government is doing enough to prevent the disease’s spread, down from 61 percent in February. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll was conducted March 13-14, surveying 835 adults. Its margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",Poll: Most Americans don’t trust Trump on coronavirus information,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/poll-americans-lack-trust-in-trump-on-coronavirus-information-133576,politico
"Bernie Sanders has run up the score among young voters in state after state, but his efforts have hit a wall in South Florida.  In a place where young Cuban-Americans joined their elders in the streets with pots and pans to celebrate Fidel Castro’s death, the Vermont senator’s Democratic socialism and past refusals to wholeheartedly condemn Castro and other Latin American authoritarian leaders are proving costly. “I’m more progressive than Biden, but I also don’t want to stand next to the dummy in the Che Guevara T-shirt at a rally, and that’s true here regardless of age,” said Carmen Pelaez, a founding member of Project Pastelito, a grassroots initiative in Miami that leads get-out-the-vote efforts for progressive candidates.  For Sanders, who posted big margins among young and Latino voters in places like California, Nevada and Texas, the resistance he’s encountering among young Latinos is a harbinger of a rough election night in the state that serves as the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries.  It’s not that Joe Biden is wildly popular among younger Latinos, just that he’s a more palatable alternative for many of them. “Are we excited about Biden’s candidacy? I don’t think so. But it’s just what Bernie represents to those here in South Florida that could be catastrophic, especially in a general election matchup,” said Toni Rodriguez, national political director for College Democrats.  “Here in South Florida, Bernie Sanders’ message is disconnected. And that’s telling people, ‘No, we need to vote for Biden because Bernie won’t resonate here in Florida,” Rodriguez, a student at Barry University in Miami Shores, Fla., added.  Cuban-Americans — known for their high voter turnout rates — have for decades been the largest group of Latinos in South Florida, with more than half of the state’s 2 million Cubans living in the region. But it’s only been in the past 20 years that Cuban-Americans have started playing a big role in Democratic politics as voters under 50 — many born in the U.S. — have broken with the Republican Party and embraced more liberal views than their parents and grandparents.  That generational change was reflected in the last presidential election: In 2004, George W. Bush won 78 percent of Florida’s Cuban-American vote, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of exit polls. By 2016, Donald Trump only managed to capture just over half of that vote. The red-to-blue evolution has its limits, however.  Pelaez points out that other Latino groups in South Florida, like Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, also favor Biden in the primary because of their family and friends’ history with socialist and authoritarian regimes — a sign of their different background and experience than Latinos in the Southwest, where Sanders had more widespread support.  “We come from countries where we’ve seen the slogan ‘Socialismo o muerte’ on the walls. We either survived socialism or have grandparents that did and have grown up with those stories,” Pelaez said. “Other Latinos don’t have that frame of reference.” That difference was reflected in a Florida poll last week that showed Sanders trailing Biden, 48 percent to 37 percent, among Hispanic voters.  Only 18 percent of Florida Hispanics — from Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Central and South America — said they would vote for a self-described socialist, while 70 percent said they would not, according to the survey conducted for Telemundo Station Group by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy.  More than 50 percent of Florida Hispanic voters under 50 years old said they would not vote for a socialist candidate, compared with 31 percent who said they would.  To some Florida Latinos, those numbers are proof that Biden would be a stronger rival to Trump in November — and would provide more top-of-the-ticket protection for Latino down-ballot candidates. “A lot of people in Florida know in order to win you have to have a more moderate standpoint. That’s been known,” said Mayra Macías, executive director of Latino Victory Project, an organization that endorsed Biden and is dedicated to electing Latinos up and down the ballot. Macías explained that in a state like Florida, voters are thinking beyond the presidential matchup, given the history of close races for national, state and local offices. She pointed to the reelection campaigns for Democratic Reps. Debbie Mucarsel Powell and Donna Shalala, both of whom flipped their South Florida districts in 2018 from Cuban Republicans and are up against two well-known Cuban Republican opponents again. Trump took to Twitter to endorse Mucarsel Powell‘s GOP opponent, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, just hours after he launched his campaign in January. “It’s all these candidates that would get affected … and hurt by a campaign’s inability to distinguish their brand of Democratic socialism from the socialism that many folks in Florida fled from or have a negative perception of,” Macías said.  Democrats have chronically struggled to get more Latino candidates on the ballot — the only Cuban-Americans in the Florida congressional delegation are Republican: Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Díaz Balart.  It’s critical for Biden to court Latinos “who came of political consciousness post the Obama years,” Macías said. “It’s going to be extremely important for the campaign to articulate a vision for them.”",Meet the young voters who refuse to vote for Bernie,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-florida-youth-132928,politico
"Polls will not open for Ohio's primary election Tuesday after a late-night decision from Gov. Mike DeWine's administration, effectively upheld by the state Supreme Court, to delay in-person voting until June in an effort to protect voters and poll workers from the coronavirus outbreak. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. The election was in limbo for several hours Monday night after a judge in Columbus denied a last-minute attempt backed by the state to postpone the primary election. But DeWine responded with an order from the state's top health official, Amy Acton, closing physical polling places as the legal battle moved up to the Ohio Supreme Court. Early Tuesday morning, four judges on that court issued a unanimous, unsigned ruling declining to stop the state from shuttering polls. Three other judges on the court recused — two because they're currently running for reelection and the other because he is DeWine's son. The ruling effectively overturns the Monday ruling from Franklin County Judge Richard Frye that the primary had to continue as scheduled. Frye said it was too late to move back the primary and that doing so would confuse and suppress voters. Frye also took issue with the state’s claim that moving the election to June would alleviate voters’ health concerns, saying there's no medical evidence the pandemic will have disappeared by then. DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose insisted voters will still be able to vote. ""Every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,"" DeWine said Monday. But DeWine's unprecedented order — closing physical polling places because an attempt to postpone the election failed — perplexed experts in election law. ""What I find most confusing is whether the governor is purporting to call off the election or not,"" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California-Irvine said late Monday. ""Saying one is closing polling places is not the same as postponing the election."" A directive from LaRose to county elections officials late Monday night, following the polls closure, said the primary was postponed until June 2 and said counties are ""prohibited from tabulating and reporting any results"" until then. ""There hasn't been an order to the Ohio secretary of state's office or to the governor's office that's been violated,"" LaRose told CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday, arguing that state health officials acted within their jurisdiction. ""I serve as the chief elections officer for Ohio, and what I wanted to do was create certainty for Ohioans."" Ohio was one of four states with primaries scheduled on Tuesday, along with Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Officials in the other three states said that their Tuesday primaries would proceed as planned. Meanwhile, Kentucky's top elections official announced on Monday that his state's primaries would move from May to June as well. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced that he and Gov. Andy Beshear had agreed to delay the state's May primary until June 23. ""There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy us time,"" Adams said in his announcement. Kentucky is the third state to formally delay its primary, following Louisiana and Georgia. Earlier in the day, Ohio officials claimed they were ready to move forward with the election as well should the courts not grant the extension.  ""If that was necessitated, I have no doubt that the patriotic Ohio election officials would get that job done,"" LaRose said. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said both state party chairs were consulted and supportive of the push to postpone the primary, though he acknowledged the last-minute nature of the announcement risks confusing voters. ""In deference to their expertise on this critical health crisis, I support that decision regarding in-person voting tomorrow,"" Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a statement following DeWine's initial press conference. ""Extending an election is an unprecedented step, so we as a party are weighing alternatives on how to best do so — including the possibility to conduct the primary election entirely by vote-by-mail, as is done in several other states, with a deadline much earlier than June 2."" The move represented a significant escalation in state action to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Already, Ohio election officials had relocated or closed nearly 150 polling places that were originally supposed to be in nursing homes and assisted living facilities and recruited backup poll workers to replace those who were not comfortable serving due to their age or health status. Over the weekend, before trying to move election day, Ohio officials ordered county boards of elections to set up curbside voting options and extend the deadline to request an absentee ballot for anyone impacted by the virus.  As recently as Friday, election officials from all four states voting Friday, including LaRose, said that the March 17 elections would go on as scheduled. After DeWine held his Monday press conference, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said that he ""feel[s] good about the decision to let the election go on tomorrow."" ""Look, we have to have our elections continue, in my opinion,"" Pritzker said. ""This is the right thing to do. Our democracy needs to go on. We have to elect leaders."" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also said Monday that she wanted ""to encourage everybody to go out and vote today and if you choose to vote tomorrow, it's going to be safe."" In Florida, Secretary of State Laurel Lee said Monday evening at a press conference that the state will still hold its primary on Tuesday. Lee said nearly 2 million people have already voted. And in Arizona, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said the election will also move forward. ""What it all comes down to is that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,"" Hobbs said at a press conference.  Election officials in the state have worked to minimize risk in polling places across the state, striking a delicate balance between making voting accessible and protecting public health. ""This is a dynamic situation. It’s changing day by day, hour by hour,"" Adrian Fontes, the Maricopa County recorder, told POLITICO in an interview on Monday. ""While the state has closed all rec centers and libraries, we made sure they will still stay open as polling places. We have heightened cleanliness and sanitation protocols, and we're paying close attention to mandates from federal, state and local authorities. ... Election administrators have to be ready for anything. Except Godzilla.”  Natasha Korecki and Maggie Severns contributed to this report.","Ohio governor shutters polling places for Tuesday's primary, citing public health",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/ohio-governor-recommends-postponing-tuesdays-primary-132340,politico

"The government’s economic stimulus is set to quickly balloon into trillion-dollar territory in the coming days, the largest rescue in modern American history, as major industries flood the Trump administration and Capitol Hill for aid while huge swaths of the economy stall from the coronavirus crisis. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet with Senate Republicans behind closed doors on Tuesday to present lawmakers with options for aid for airlines, hotels, casinos and small-to-medium-sized businesses. The White House was pushing for a package of more than $800 billion, POLITICO reported Monday, and on Tuesday the Treasury Department was preparing to unveil a package of $850 billion including more than $50 billion for the airline industry, $250 billion for small-business support and $500 billion for a payroll tax holiday. A senior administration official acknowledged the proposal could climb above that Tuesday by the time it’s unveiled.  Democrats are pushing their own package of provisions that don’t overlap entirely with the GOP pitch. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats are pitching a package of “at least” $750 billion that is expected to include more emergency aid for hospitals, expanded unemployment insurance, more funds for small business, help with child care, and food assistance for seniors. The size and scope of the package are morphing rapidly as the economic and market damage mounts. Senate Republicans and the White House are exploring how to fast-track existing legislation with the upcoming stimulus packages. The Trump administration’s goal is to provide sectors and companies with enough cash through emergency loans, tax deferrals or temporary tax cuts to help them survive the sudden downturn. The presentation is also expected to include an idea President Donald Trump has latched onto — a temporary cut or suspension of the payroll tax cut through the end of the year which would benefit both companies and workers. One version of the payroll tax holiday would cost $950 billion alone through the end of the year. CEOs, union leaders and lobbyists have been warning the administration of mass layoffs if the government does not help soon. Senators seem poised to act this week, while the House is still in recess. Cobbling together a stimulus package worth more than $1 trillion would mark a major ideological shift for Republicans, who spent years decrying debt and government bailouts following the 2008 global financial crisis. But with uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus and the volatility in the stock market, the White House does not seem concerned about the price tag — only stopping the financial freefall. Other ideas that have circulated throughout the administration in recent days include inserting into the economic stimulus package a large-scale public works project; tweaks to the EB-5 visa program to boost foreign investment; tariff relief; and even a one-time cash payment to Americans between $500 to $750, according to people close to the administration.  The Federal Reserve and Treasury are already launching programs to provide support through emergency powers. The central bank on Tuesday announced a new lending program, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, under its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The Treasury Department will provide taxpayer backing for the effort with $10 billion in capital from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.  “The economic disruption and uncertainty created by COVID-19 has created challenges for the commercial paper market, constraining access to short-term credit for American businesses,” Mnuchin said. “By providing short-term credit, the CPFF will help American businesses manage their finances through this challenging period.”  Some senior White House officials are also pushing Treasury to issue long-term bonds that would mature in 50 or 100 years to help cover the cost of the stimulus package. Mnuchin has said repeatedly in the past that he is considering issuing such bonds to take advantage of interest rates that the Fed has now pushed to near zero. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has long advocated for the issuance of such bonds, an idea also supported by outside economic advisers to the White House.  Republican Sen. Mitt Romney in recent days has called for giving every American over the age of 18 a check for $1,000 as a form of economic stimulus.  The coronavirus relief packages under consideration now by Congress are set to eclipse prior efforts.  The economic stimulus program cleared through Congress in early 2009 under the Obama administration was nearly $800 billion, including a tax cut, infrastructure and numerous other provisions. The bank bailout plan passed by Congress in 2008 under the Bush administration — formally the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP — authorized $700 billion originally intended to buy toxic assets from banks, mainly mortgage-backed securities that plunged in value during the housing crisis. The money was later diverted to multiple different programs to inject capital into banks. The TARP program ultimately disbursed around $426 billion and eventually recovered $441 billion, earning the Treasury Department a nominal profit of around $15 billion. That figure remains controversial. Taking into account inflation from the time of the bailouts, the government actually lost around $25 billion on the program.  It also generated widespread anger that banks and bankers got bailed out while ordinary citizens received far less. The Trump administration is well aware of this history and taking pains to avoid the same optics; top economic officials like Mnuchin and other senior aides around Trump keep emphasizing the need to help small and medium-sized businesses as well. “Everyone will need assistance and that is the bottom line. This is the demand issue because consumers have stopped spending,” said Alfredo Ortiz, President and CEO of the Job Creators Network, a conservative-leaning group founded by entrepreneurs like The Home Depot founder, Bernie Marcus. “Every industry will need some level of assistance. In the past, Main Street America has not been as represented in some economic stimulus packages.”  Ortiz said he has been in touch directly with Mnuchin, who seems very amenable to including relief for small-to-medium-sized businesses in any package. The TARP program also drew widespread criticism for creating a moral hazard – banks could feel emboldened to take risks knowing the government would rescue them -- while creating fewer and even larger banks that now enjoyed a bigger federal backstop. Part of the reluctance among members of Congress and the administration to direct cash payments to individual industries like airlines and hotels stems from the TARP experience and deep voter resentment to corporations and their highly paid executives getting aid over regular citizens. Senior White House officials know that direct aid to airlines in particular may be necessary to avoid crippling bankruptcies, but they are leery of being seen as handing out bailouts and want to be sure that any such aid is dwarfed by proposals that would direct cash to consumers.  As top economic officials and Senate leadership negotiate this stimulus package, Trump is spending the day on the phone with executives from the restaurant and tourism industries, supply retailers and wholesalers. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet with CEOs of major hotels including Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt and MGM Resorts International.

"The global airline industry on Tuesday intensified its call for urgent government help amid the coronavirus crisis, as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin heads to Capitol Hill to pitch senators on a massive stimulus plan that’s expected to include billions of dollars to prop up U.S. airlines. The CEO of the International Air Transport Association on Tuesday predicted that the airline industry globally would need $150 billion to $200 billion in government assistance. “We are obviously in an extraordinary time, a terrible crisis — one of the most severe we have ever had — and so we have asked governments to take extraordinary measures,” Alexandre de Juniac said on a call with reporters. Governments have already taken steps like waiving “use-it-or-lose-it” slot rules for certain airports, he noted, but IATA wants them to “implement much broader financial support” packages that include direct financial assistance, loans or tax relief. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution.” On Monday, the trade group representing major U.S. airlines requested almost $60 billion in grants and loans, as well as tax relief, saying the industry is facing a situation “much worse” than after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. So far, the administration appears to be readying a stimulus plan worth at least $850 billion. Nothing is set in stone, but the Washington Post reported that it will include around $50 billion for the U.S. airline industry, likely a combination of direct assistance and loan guarantees. “If we want to maintain a strong [global] airline sector able to cope with this difficult crisis, but able also to provide the resources to ensure that the recovery will happen in due time … we need government to act strongly and quickly,” de Juniac said Tuesday, also warning that the crisis may lead to consolidation. Brian Pearce, IATA’s chief economist, said the outbreak is “covering markets which represent … 94 percent of global passenger revenue, so this is now impacting the entirety of air transport.” “In many cases, demand … for the business of many airlines has fallen to zero,” Pearce said, adding that new travel restrictions are exacerbating damage already caused by the outbreak. Earlier this month, IATA said there could be up to $113 billion in passenger revenue losses this year worldwide. The group didn’t provide an updated estimate Tuesday, but Pearce said the numbers are “clearly worse than this, particularly in Europe and particularly in the Americas.” As their revenues are taking a hit, “the vast majority” of carriers around the world “have high levels of debt,” Pearce noted, which is resulting in a “liquidity crisis.” At the beginning of the year, “more or less 75 percent of the airlines that we looked at … had less than three months of cash and equivalents” to cover fixed costs. “Even before COVID, the industry was in a fairly fragile position,” Pearce said. “Only 30 airlines drove the improvement in profitability that we saw in the last 10 years. There was a long tail of airlines with much more fragile finances.”",Airlines intensify calls for up to $200B in government aid worldwide,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/airlines-intensify-calls-for-up-to-200b-in-government-aid-worldwide-133824,politico
"President Donald Trump punched back on Tuesday against criticism from Democratic governors critical of his administration's coronavirus response, wading into his familiar political spats as the White House looks to combat a pandemic. Trump referred to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as the ""failing Michigan governor"" on Monday and lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo after his calls for stepped up federal assistance. Minutes later, he heaped praise on his own administration for ""working very well with the Governors and State officials."" While Cuomo, Whitmer and other governors have been among the most vocal critics of the federal coronavirus response, they have been far from alone. The Trump administration has come under a steady drumbeat of scrutiny over its inability to quickly ramp up coronavirus testing capabilities as well as its weekslong rhetorical campaign to downplay the virus' threat to Americans. Only recently has the president reversed course in his own public utterances to warn the public about the severity of the pandemic's threat. The president's criticism of Whitmer on Tuesday appeared to be triggered by her appearance on MSNBC, where she said her state is working to flatten the curve by closing restaurants and bars after a federal government response that did not take the outbreak “seriously early enough.” She also outlined her plan to expand unemployment benefits as workers lose jobs and are forced to stay home amid the pandemic.  “The federal government did not take this seriously early enough, and now it is on us to make sure we’re doing everything we can based on the best facts and science available and that we are always putting the health of our people front and center,” Whitmer said on MSNBC. Trump soon after tweeted that the Michigan governor ""must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!” During a White House news briefing on Monday, the president also reportedly suggested that state leaders work to obtain medical equipment like respirators and ventilators on their own because of the slow federal process — a suggestion Whitmer called ""mind-boggling.""  “We need federal support. Like I said, we’re pulling out all the stops and reaching out to our partners in the private sector,” Whitmer said. “We’re going to do everything we can to supplement. But it’s not to the exclusion of federal support. We need the federal government to ramp up and to get this done.”  The president's feud with Cuomo, which bubbled up again Tuesday, has simmered for days amid back-and-forth criticism between the two men over the Trump administration's coronavirus response. The New York governor has repeatedly called for more federal help, to which Trump has replied that it is Cuomo who needs to do more. On Tuesday, the president accused Cuomo of playing politics with his criticism of the administration and suggested that a blanket federal policy of the type that some have called for would not be appropriate. ""Cuomo wants ‘all states to be treated the same.’ But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all,"" Trump tweeted, referring to the novel coronavirus by a controversial name that some in his administration have adopted. ""New York is a very big ‘hotspot’, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it.”  Trump ended his tirade against the governors with the tweet praising the federal government’s work with state and local officials, promising that “Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS.”",Trump lashes out at Dem governors amid coronavirus coordination,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-whitmer-cuomo-coronavirus-response-133716,politico
"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced that he was postponing the state's primaries, originally scheduled for late April, to June 2 as the country grapples with the spread of the coronavirus. Maryland is now the fifth state to move its primaries, joining Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky and Ohio, which saw its primary originally scheduled for today pushed until June after an eleventh-hour legal battle. “It would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble … and it would put Marylanders at risk,” Hogan said Tuesday at a press conference. “I am directing the state board of elections to develop a comprehensive plan by April 3 to conduct the primary election in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the Democratic process in our state.” But Maryland will still hold one election on April 28, foreshadowing a potentially broad move toward mail voting that could pave the way for elections across the country to continue during the coronavirus crisis. Hogan said he believed the special election to fill the seat of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, in Maryland's Baltimore-based 7th Congressional District, should forward on as a mail-in only election, the first federal election to be shifted to mail voting in response to coronavirus. “It is imperative that the people of the 7th Congressional District have a voice in the House of Representatives,” Hogan said.  “The State board of elections contacted us last Wednesday and said they were concerned about being able to conduct the election,'' Hogan said at his press conference. “They could not possibly do the mail-in for the whole state. They said they were incapable of getting it done in time ... but on a small basis in one congressional district for that one vacancy, we are going to ask the board of elections to conduct that election on time.  “We are going to encourage people to vote absentee as much as possible, and those who aren't doing the normal absentee ballot will be able to do whatever additional steps they decide to take for mail-in ballots,” Hogan continued. Hogan’s decision comes amid a national push from lawmakers, state officials and election law experts to allow anyone in the U.S. to cast their vote by mail in light of the public health crisis. Currently, 34 states and D.C. allow voters to cast an absentee ballot for any reason, and millions of voters still have to queue up in person on Election Day — an activity that blatantly violates new federal guidance against gathering in groups of 10 or more people, as Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pointed out Monday when calling for the postponement of his state's primary. While advocates have unsuccessfully called for the adoption of universal vote-by-mail for decades, they’re hoping the coronavirus pandemic serves as a wakeup call.  “In the 15 years I’ve been pushing this, we’ve never had a public health and safety argument for this. Now, we do,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the lead author of a federal vote-by-mail bill, told POLITICO. “Now, for states to say they don’t have a fallback plan and they’re just going to cancel or delay elections – that's not acceptable when we’re in the middle of the pandemic.” Last week, Wyden introduced a retooled version of his decades-old bill targeted for situations like the coronavirus pandemic. He’s currently in the process of convincing fellow senators to support it, and pushing for it to be included in one of the upcoming relief packages Congress is currently putting together.  Under the legislation, if 25 percent of states declare a state of emergency, all states have to offer universal vote-by-mail for one election cycle, and the federal government will provide $500 million to make sure pre-paid, self-sealing envelopes are distributed so that voters aren’t spreading germs or having to pay out of pocket.  Even without a federal mandate, Wyden says, the move towards vote by mail is already accelerating in red and blue states alike.  “States are already moving in this direction because people are saying, ‘What other options is there?’” he said. Maryland will likely not be the last state to postpone its primaries. Hogan said “other governors are expected to do” the same “later today, or the days ahead.” A spokesperson for Hogan tweeted that “we expect other Acela states to take similar steps.” The April 28 primary was informally referred to as the Acela Primary, because the states voting that day are connected by the popular Amtrak line. Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are all scheduled to vote on April 28; none of them have modified their primaries as of yet.","Maryland postpones primary, shifts special election to mail voting over coronavirus",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/maryland-postpones-april-28-primary-election-over-coronavirus-133776,politico
"The White House and Senate Republicans are considering melding together a House-passed coronavirus aid bill with President Donald Trump's request for $850 billion in stimulus spending, creating one massive aid package that the Senate could pass this week.   The thinking, as described by Senate Republican leadership aides and several Trump administration aides, is that one large-scale package would be easier to push through the Senate immediately. The downside is the House would have to also approve the package, and the House is in recess with no current plan to return.   But since some Senate Republicans were aiming to amend the House bill anyway, they don't see much practical or political risk.   Another concern for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other senior Republicans is a practical one — if they let the Senate adjourn following passage of the ""Phase 2"" House bill, it may be logistically difficult to get senators back to Washington once they go home because of travel hurdles. Airline service has been severely disrupted so far, and situation may worsen. In addition, if one or more senators contract the virus, returning to Washington may prove impossible.  But the idea of combing two stimulus packages will, undoubtedly, create a massive legislative rush this week in the midst of a national health crisis that has brought the nation to a standstill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is slated to attend the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday afternoon, where he is expected to discuss this plan.   The White House Tuesday morning began signaling it was aiming for $850 billion in stimulus spending, split between a payroll tax cut, support for the airline industry and $250 billion in loans for small business.   ""I don’t know how it happens exactly yet. I know that 'Phase Two' will kind of be the baseline approach and then we’ll try and go from there,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) on Tuesday.   ""There’s a third iteration that we’re working on and how it gets across the floor and back to the House remains to be seen. I mean they could move separately, but maybe there’s a way we combine it,” he said.   The House passed the $100 billion-plus ""Phase 2"" stimulus bill on late Friday night, but then had to amend the package Monday with significant ""technical corrections"" following discussions between Mnuchin, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).   The revised legislation — which provides paid sick days and emergency leave to workers who are ill or have family members with coronavirus — is set to be taken up the Senate this week.   Several senior Democratic aides said combining the two packages into one would be a nonstarter in the House without significant concessions.  House Democratic leaders are already dealing with rank-and-file anger over a “technical corrections” bill the House passed late Monday that actually included a significant rewrite to the paid leave language in a major concession to the White House.  The change — which would allow more businesses to seek exemptions from offering their employees paid leave — was pushed by administration officials as necessary to get the bill through the Senate, according to multiple sources. But now, if the House-passed bill is combined with a huge economic package, they didn’t even need to make that major change, House Democratic aides argued.  In addition, several Democrats said the payroll tax cut was still a nonstarter, citing tepid support for the idea even among Republicans. And they threw cold water on the idea of just cutting checks to people, saying the bureaucracy needed to implement such a massive program could delay payments for weeks if not longer.  “All this stuff can come together fairly quickly,” said one Democrat involved in the negotiations. “The question is what are ideas that can come together fairly quickly? Something new like direct payments to people isn’t feasible.”  Democratic aides said they were instead looking at other ways to pad people’s wallets by expanding credits already written into the tax code.",White House eyes combining House bill with new coronavirus stimulus,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/white-house-senate-republicans-coronavirus-aid-133732,politico
"Social distancing hit the set of President Donald Trump’s favorite morning cable news show Tuesday, with the three hosts of “Fox & Friends” scattered across their New York studio in an effort to demonstrate best practices amid the coronavirus pandemic.  “To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart — same studio, plenty of distance,” co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers at the top of the broadcast.   The right-leaning talk show, which airs weekdays 6-9 a.m. Eastern and has achieved outsize influence under Trump’s administration, is the latest TV news program to employ the preventative measure as the outbreak tears across the United States. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend Americans maintain a distance of 6 feet to help thwart the coronavirus’ rapid spread, co-host Steve Doocy said he and his colleagues usually sit only about 18 inches apart on the show's signature “curvy couch.""  Tuesday morning, however, Doocy was alone on the mezzanine-level sofa, while Kimeade anchored “the big plastic desk” one floor below and co-host Ainsley Earhardt was stationed behind a lectern in the studio’s “fish bowl area.” “We’re doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is stay away from each other because you don’t want to get infected and you don’t want to spread infection,” Doocy said. “We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,” Earhardt added. “And so if you can keep your distance and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly and help our country as a nation.” The new seating configuration reflects the seriousness with which President Donald Trump and his staunchest allies, both in media and politics, are now taking the coronavirus threat after being dismissive of its risk to Americans. On-air talent and guests at Fox News have drawn special scrutiny for downplaying the disease in recent weeks. ast On Friday, Earhardt remarked that it was “actually the safest time to fly” despite advisories against nonessential travel, and conservative religious leader Jerry Falwell Jr. appeared on the program to accuse people of “overreacting” to the novel coronavirus. “It makes you wonder if there’s a political reason for that,” Falwell said. “You know, impeachment didn’t work, and the Mueller report didn’t work, and Article 25 didn’t work. And so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.”",The president’s favorite morning show starts social distancing,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fox-and-friends-social-distancing-133619,politico
"There’s an easy way to tell that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi negotiated a bad deal on the bipartisan coronavirus response bill that Congress is expected to pass this week. It’s not the liberal complaints that she let the White House limit paid sick leave to about one-fifth of U.S. workers. It’s not the Republican complaints that the bill doesn’t provide tax relief and cash for businesses and individuals hurt by the pandemic. It’s not even the general consensus that this initial legislation will need to be followed up by a much more aggressive economic stimulus bill. No, the easy way to tell Pelosi negotiated a bad deal for Democrats is that she negotiated a deal at all—rather than dictating the terms and telling President Donald Trump to take them or leave them. The lesson of the last congressional response to an economic emergency, President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill, is that when a president desperately needs legislation to address a crisis, anyone with the power to stop him can decide what’s in it. When Obama took office, in the midst of the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression, Democrats controlled the House and Senate as well. But they needed 60 votes to break a Republican filibuster in the Senate, and there were only 57 Democratic senators, which meant Obama had to recruit three Republicans to vote for a stimulus bill. In just his second week in office, his blunt-spoken chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, had to pose a blunt-spoken question to Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania: Whaddya want? Specter’s ask was simple, and by Washington horse-trading standards, noble. He wanted $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health. Then he would vote for the Obama stimulus. “Are you f---ing kidding me?” Emanuel exploded. Emanuel assumed $10 billion-with-a-b was just Specter’s initial bid, a shock-tactic negotiating ploy. But Specter gruffly said no, that was his final offer, take it or leave it. “What the f--- does a vote cost around here?” Emanuel screamed. In Specter’s case, it cost precisely $10 billion. He understood that Obama needed his vote to fix the economy, so he held all the leverage. But today’s congressional Democrats don’t seem to understand that at all. Right now, after initially downplaying the threat of coronavirus, then bungling the response to the pandemic, then watching the swift demise of the bull market he had hailed as proof of his leadership, Trump absolutely needs congressional action to limit the public health disaster and mitigate the economic damage on his watch. House Democrats can pass whatever bill they want, and if Republicans aren’t willing to go along with it, another lesson of American crisis politics is that it’s Trump who will suffer the consequences. Some Democrats have fretted that they might suffer politically if they don’t help Trump clean up the mess, but the opposite happened in 2009. The Republican minority in the House unanimously refused to support Obama’s stimulus, even though the crisis had exploded on his Republican predecessor’s watch, and the very next year those same Republicans took back the majority in the House. In fact, the only Republican in Congress who paid a political price was Specter, who had to switch to the Democratic Party after a GOP backlash over his vote for Obama’s stimulus, and ended up losing his seat anyway. In 2020, Democrats are not acting like a party with that kind of leverage. Instead, Pelosi frantically hashed out a compromise on Friday over 13 phone calls with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who accepted Democratic proposals to expand free COVID-19 testing and unemployment benefits, along with a modest boost in food aid for the poor, but made it clear that permanent legislation mandating universal sick leave was a “non-starter” for Republicans. Trump ratcheted up the pressure by complaining publicly that Democrats weren’t “giving enough” in the negotiations, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the House proposals as “an ideological wish list.” Ultimately, Democrats accepted a temporary mandate that applies only to companies smaller than 500 employees, and allows companies smaller than 50 employees to seek exemptions.  “Democrats preferred to have something rather than nothing,” a Democratic source explained to CNN’s Jake Tapper. “That was the choice we faced.” That was not the choice Democrats faced. Unlike the Republicans in 2009, who only had a filibuster-proof minority in the Senate, they also have a majority in the House, where they could have attached anything they wanted to the must-pass coronavirus testing and dared Republicans to say no.  If the president was unwilling to approve measures to help contain a pandemic and limit the economic fallout because he didn’t want sick workers to be guaranteed paid leave, he could have explained that to the public. He’s the president, the head of state, the “I alone can fix it” guy. He’s the one who will be judged by the outcome of the crisis that he initially insisted was not a crisis, then declared was under control thanks to his leadership. After all, Obama was held responsible for an economic crisis that erupted on George W. Bush’s watch, and the party that fought his efforts to fix the crisis ended up taking back the House, the Senate and eventually the White House. The public doesn’t follow the details of legislation on Capitol Hill, but it blames presidents for bad outcomes. The public also tends to blame presidents for partisan paralysis, while giving them credit for bipartisan cooperation; that’s why McConnell understood he could make Obama look partisan by fighting him, even though Obama’s stimulus was stuffed with tax cuts and other Republican priorities. It is true that Democrats would be accused of trying to exploit the crisis if they tried to load up a coronavirus bill with unrelated priorities such as, say, a “Green New Deal” to fight the climate crisis—although it’s worth noting that Trump and McConnell have already accused them of trying to exploit the crisis just for trying to mandate sick leave during a pandemic. But they still have the leverage to shape legislation just about any way they want if they’re willing to take the heat. In 2009, Republican Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine used her leverage to demand that the Obama stimulus include a technical fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax that added $70 billion to the price tag while providing virtually no economic stimulus. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine insisted on stripping a school construction initiative out of Obama’s stimulus—along with, ironically, an $870 million line item for pandemic preparedness. The 57 Democrats in the Senate also had the power to extract concessions for their votes; Obama had wanted a stimulus without congressional earmarks, but Dick Durbin of Illinois managed to include one for a $1 billion carbon-capture plant that never ended up getting built. Setting aside the question of whether Democrats should try to exploit the leverage to advance long-term policy priorities, they can absolutely exploit their leverage to address the short-term crisis. If they think universal sick leave will help, they should demand universal sick leave. Meanwhile, with Louisiana and Georgia already postponing primaries over the virus, why shouldn’t Democrats attach provisions guaranteeing that Americans will be able to vote by mail in November? Jeff Hauser, director of the left-leaning Revolving Door Project, doesn’t understand why the Democrats didn’t insist on provisions restoring congressional oversight powers to help them ride herd on the administration’s response to the virus, ensuring that Trump and his aides can no longer defy subpoenas for documents and witnesses. Again, if Trump thinks it’s so important to prevent Americans from voting by mail and preventing Congress from overseeing his administration that he would block measures to accelerate the pandemic testing that his own team has botched, he can try to convince the public. “House Democrats don’t have some leverage,” Hauser says. “They have complete leverage.” By giving Trump the emergency measures that he needs most without insisting on the worker protections that Democrats wanted most, Pelosi has sacrificed some of that leverage. She has also helped the president look like a bipartisan consensus-builder, while essentially confirming the GOP talking point that Democrats have a responsibility to meet Trump’s demands in order to avoid a partisan stalemate. In 2009, Republicans simply ignored all the pundits warning that they would pay a huge political price for refusing to help the first black president fix an economic mess he had inherited—and the pundits turned out to be wrong. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders argue that it’s their duty to help Trump save lives and jobs in 2020, even though Republicans didn’t help Obama in 2009, even though Trump routinely calls them traitors, even though an economic downturn could doom his reelection. They’re pro-government people; they’re not inclined to stand in the way of government action during a crisis. When the Great Recession was just getting started in January 2008, Pelosi negotiated a quick bipartisan stimulus bill with Bush’s Treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, and within months Americans were receiving $1,000 checks from the federal government. It’s an honorable approach, even though it also probably reduces Pelosi’s leverage. It’s hard to win a game of chicken when the other driver knows you’re committed to avoiding a crash. Once Trump signs this emergency response bill, he’ll start clamoring for a much larger economic stimulus bill loaded with tax cuts for airlines, cruise lines, his own hospitality industry and other Republican-friendly businesses, along with payroll tax cuts that can help get him reelected. And Democrats will find that many of the same Republicans who mocked the idea of using taxpayer dollars to stimulate the private economy as Big Government when Obama was in the White House—even though they had supported that bipartisan stimulus bill under Bush—will rediscover the attraction of Keynesian economics when it suits their party’s interests. Democrats will have to decide whether to meet Trump in the middle, or whether to risk the obstructionist label by holding out for what they want in a time of economic pain. They will also have to decide exactly what it is they want. Some of Obama’s top economists have publicly called for Congress to send checks to American citizens, which would help the economy and also Trump’s reelection prospects. Again, that’s honorable and responsible, especially since Trump is sure to denounce the Democrats as obstructionists no matter what happens, but it’s not clear it squares with Democratic rhetoric about the danger of Trump’s reelection, especially if they don’t get anything in exchange for helping to rescue the sinking Trump economy. In any case, Trump won’t be able to pass a stimulus bill without them. At a minimum, one thing they can demand for their cooperation is legislative assurance that economic stimulus can no longer be something that happens routinely only under Republican presidents. They should insist on more robust “automatic stabilizers” so that any time the economy craters, no matter who’s in the White House, Washington will automatically spend far more on food stamps, unemployment insurance and other aid to vulnerable families, and perhaps automatically roll back payroll taxes and other economic burdens. That way, members of Congress will no longer have the power to take the economy hostage during crises. For now, though, Democrats absolutely have that power. They need to choose their ransom wisely.",Pelosi Has Trump Over a Barrel,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/nancy-pelosi-trump-stimulus-132388,politico
"Much of American public life is at a standstill. But not the Democratic presidential race — not yet at least. While some future voting has been postponed because of the burgeoning outbreak of coronavirus across the U.S., primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois are still on for Tuesday. Polling places in Ohio, which was set to vote Tuesday, have been closed down by public health officials after the governor pushed to delay the primary amid the public health crisis. Despite that, think of the vote as Super Tuesday, Jr.: The 441 delegates up for grabs in the three states still voting today makes it the third-largest delegate haul on the calendar, behind only March 3 and the slate of primaries planned for April 28. But between the coronavirus beginning to ravage the nation, the unprecedented, widespread closures that have shuttered public spaces across the country and Joe Biden’s now-commanding lead over Bernie Sanders — in polls released on the eve of the March 17 contests, Biden holds double-digit leads across all four states — the primaries are flying below the radar for many Americans. Last week, officials in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio rejected calls to postpone Tuesday’s primaries, saying that they would make accommodations, including extending early voting hours, to prevent large crowds from gathering. But on Monday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a court in Columbus for a last-minute postponement of the primary. When the court refused, saying it was too late to postpone, the state’s health department ordered the polling places shuttered — despite a lack of clarity about how, or even if, voters might be able to cast ballots in the primary. The Ohio Supreme Court later effectively upheld the decision to close the polls. Here’s a state-by-state look at the map for Tuesday: Democrats are hoping that Tuesday’s presidential primary is the springboard to flipping Arizona in November. President Donald Trump won the state by just 4 points in 2016, and polls conducted there show Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are both competitive against Trump in the general election. Arizona will likely be the closest of the four states voting on Tuesday, according to pre-election polls. But Biden still holds a double-digit lead over Sanders in poll after poll — despite Sanders’ enduring, though not overwhelming, advantage among Latino voters. Hillary Clinton defeated Sanders in Arizona four years ago, 56 percent to 41 percent, and carried all nine of the state’s congressional districts. Polls suggest Biden is on pace for a similar victory, barring a surprise. The state is going ahead with its primary despite the coronavirus outbreak. Many voters cast their ballots by mail, but there is still significant disruption. In Maricopa County — which includes Phoenix and is home to roughly 60 percent of registered voters — most polling places are closed for safety reasons. Instead, the county is operating about 150 vote centers on Tuesday, where voters can cast their ballots regardless of where they live within the county. Bernie Sanders was blown out by Hillary Clinton in Florida in 2016 — and his prospects are no more promising in 2020. Polls show Joe Biden with a 2- or 3-to-1 advantage over Sanders, whose lack of support from older Democrats makes him particularly ill-suited for a state that is a magnet for retirees from the eastern third of the nation. Moreover, Sanders’ advantage with Latino voters in other states doesn’t translate to Florida, where many Hispanics are either immigrants or descend from immigrants from Caribbean and Latin American countries whose leftist leaders they despise. Polls show Sanders, who has praised some of the actions of those authoritarian governments, trailing Biden among Hispanic voters in Florida. The state has shuttered and consolidated a number of polling places because of the coronavirus outbreak. The state Democratic Party on Monday identified 91 precincts that were closed after GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered elections officials not to house polling places in nursing homes or assisted-living facilities. But DeSantis resisted calls to reschedule the presidential primaries. “We’re definitely voting,” he told reporters in Tallahassee last Friday. “They voted during the Civil War. We’re going to vote.” Polls close in virtually all of Florida at 7 p.m. Eastern — but remain open an hour later in portions of the Panhandle in the Central Time Zone. Bernie Sanders had the Democratic establishment on edge four years ago when he stormed out of Michigan victorious and nearly beat Hillary Clinton in her home state of Illinois a week later. But in 2020, neighboring Michigan delivered a 16-point rout for Biden and has deflated the Vermont senator’s campaign here. Mike Bloomberg had started to make inroads here but when he, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar folded their campaigns, most of their moderate supporters — and their donors — joined the Biden camp. Gov. J.B. Pritzker also delivered his endorsement to Biden on primary eve. A WGN-TV/Emerson College poll last week showed Biden leading Sanders by 20 percentage points among likely voters in Illinois. Sanders recently rallied in Chicago with Rep. Chuy Garcia and other local Latino officials to help shore up his support. But the cloud hanging over the Tuesday primary is the coronavirus outbreak. Schools have been ordered closed and polling stations are being moved out of senior centers as the number of cases tick up, so it’s unclear what voter turnout will look like. The saga of Ohio’s primary adds significant uncertainty to a race that otherwise seems one-sided. Joe Biden led Bernie Sanders in the latest poll by 23 points — in a state Hillary Clinton carried by 13 points four years ago, winning all but 15 of the state’s 88 counties. Gov. Mike DeWine’s Monday night order closing the polling places came only about eight hours before they were set to open. DeWine said Secretary of State Frank LaRose would petition the courts “to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.” But it’s unclear how that opportunity would be extended, or when. The ambiguity extends beyond the presidential race. Ohio was set to hold all its primaries for the 2020 elections on Tuesday, including for Congress and state Legislature.",How to watch Tuesday’s primaries like a pro,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/how-to-watch-tuesdays-primaries-133318,politico
"For the second time in two years, Rep. Dan Lipinski — one of the last members of a dwindling breed of conservative House Democrats who oppose abortion rights — is at risk of losing his seat in a primary. The Illinois lawmaker faces a rematch Tuesday against Marie Newman, a progressive upstart who nearly unseated him in 2018. But what should have been the left’s clearest shot yet at the incumbent is mired in uncertainty, with high-profile progressives distracted by Sen. Bernie Sanders's floundering presidential campaign and the election itself enveloped by the coronavirus crisis. Both camps are at a loss for how to handicap the race. “I personally don’t know,” said Pete Brodnitz, a veteran Democratic pollster working with Lipinski. “You love to say you’re a guru about these things, but there’s too many things we don’t know the answer to.” Lipinski is liberals' highest-profile 2020 primary target. Lining up behind Newman are Sanders, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Justice Democrats.  Ousting him would be a much-needed victory for these progressives who have struggled to recapture the magic of 2018, including Ocasio-Cortez's defeat of a leading House Democrat, amid a series of roadblocks throughout the primary season. Their latest loss came on Super Tuesday, when Jessica Cisneros, a liberal challenger boosted by the Justice Democrats, failed to oust a moderate Democrat in South Texas. Other progressive Senate candidates also fell short in primaries in Texas and North Carolina. Lipinski's primary may have been their best chance for victory— before the coronavirus outbreak. Newman began March with clear momentum: She was outspending the incumbent on TV 2-1, and Lipinski supporters were nervous enough that they had begun urging Republican-leaning voters to pull a Democratic ballot and cast it for the incumbent. The biggest question mark now is turnout. Both campaigns are operating under the assumption that it could be at a historic low, with leaders, including Illinois' governor, urging citizens to be cautious about venturing into public spaces. Lipinski admitted in an interview last week he is combating a lot of unknowns. “We’ll see where the presidential primary is,” he told reporters in the Capitol. “You don’t know what’s going to happen, don’t know what the coronavirus — what impact that could have. So, just wait and see.” The Newman campaign has urged supporters to vote early, is prioritizing phone banking and has canceled its election night party. Both teams could make a plausible case that low turnout is to their benefit, depending on the age and ideology of who shows up. Lipinski’s team thinks he could have an edge with older voters, who tend to be more reliable and may be more likely to go to the polls. Yet the coronavirus disproportionately affects those 60 and older and public health officials urged elderly people to remain in their homes as much as possible. Other liberal challengers, such Ocasio-Cortez, have won low-turnout races in which the electorate is smaller and more ideological. The 2018 midterms brought roughly presidential-level primary turnout, and Newman came within 2,200 votes of ousting Lipinski. Though a new policy by the House Democratic campaign arm that blacklists consultants who work with primary challengers cost her some top campaign talent, Newman said she feels better prepared this cycle. “As you can imagine, your first time, out you learn a lot. And I did. And there’s things that I didn’t do well,"" she told reporters in a phone call last week.  Now ""we have an amazing voter outreach program,"" she said. ""I started fundraising a lot earlier this time.” Her campaign, she said, has knocked on more than 110,000 doors and made 90,000 phone calls. She had outraised Lipinski by more than $400,000 as of late February, and that contrast is shown particularly stark on television. Newman has spent about $900,000 on television advertising, while Lipinski has dropped less than $450,000, according to an analysis obtained by POLITICO. Plus, a coalition of abortion rights groups, including EMILY’s List, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and Planned Parenthood, has dropped about $1 million in TV ads knocking Lipinski. And outside allies who spent for Lipinski in 2018, such as the bipartisan group No Labels, have largely stayed out this cycle, leaving a stark disparity. “She’s got significantly more independent-expenditure resources than she had last time, and we have significantly less,” said Dave Heller, a media consultant for Lipinski, “which is the only reason why we’re worried.” Lipinski is reviled by the liberal wing of the party for a slew of positions and votes that range from his support for defunding Planned Parenthood to his 2010 opposition to the Affordable Care Act. He is now notably running an ad touting his efforts to protect that law and attacking Newman for supporting a single-payer health care plan. Still, Newman has centered her campaign on other issues like reducing gun violence and making health care affordable. She supports ""Medicare for All"" and the ""Green New Deal."" Lipinski has pitched himself as more in line with the district and suggests Newman is too extreme: ""We should remain focused on what’s important. What really holds us all together as Democrats: the type of agenda that we have had in the House with our majority in this Congress."" Yet there’s evidence to suggest his allies are leaning on independent and Republican voters to boost him in the Democratic primary. An internal campaign strategy document accidentally leaked in November suggested “GOP surrogates” could help Lipinski court Republican voters. Then this weekend, a Newman volunteer received what appeared to be an automated text message mobilizing GOP-leaning voters to ""stop"" Newman and Cook County (Ill.) prosecutor Kim Foxx."" Asked last week about the possibility of courting Republican voters — Illinois doesn't have party registration, so voters can pull whichever party's primary ballot they request — Lipinski said it was not the focus of his outreach but suggested he would take their support. “I think it’s good to have more people vote in the Democratic primary, bring them into the Democratic Party,” he said. Lipinski was first elected in 2004, after his father, then-Rep. Bill Lipinski, announced his surprise retirement and persuaded the state Democratic Party to nominate his son to replace him on that fall's ballot. The younger Lipinski could benefit from Chicago machine politics that boosted him and his father in the past. He will need to run up the margins in the Chicago part of the district, as he did two years ago, while Newman is banking on support in the southwest suburbs. A win by Newman on Tuesday would bring a surge of energy to progressives disheartened by a stinging loss earlier this month against Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, who also opposes abortion.  Cuellar and his fellow moderates have hailed his victory over Cisneros, a 26-year-old immigration attorney, as an indicator that their caucus is still a big-tent party. “It bodes well for moderates and centrists,” said Cuellar, who said he had discussed his race with Lipinski. “A lot of members were very happy I won because they felt that, if I would have lost, then that would have created a momentum.” Sanders’ dismal performance in recent primaries has relieved some Lipinski supporters, who worried Sanders could drive out young and more left-leaning voters out to the polls, and that they would be more likely to support Newman. Interviewed last week at the Capitol as the House scrambled to cobble together a program to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, some top progressives suggested they had not been closely monitoring Lipinksi’s race or were otherwise preoccupied. ""Obviously, I’ve been very busy with the Sanders campaign,” said California Rep. Ro Khanna a top Sanders surrogate. “But I’m supportive of her; we did some fundraising for her.” “I don’t know any of the day-to-day detail stuff,” said Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan, a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who endorsed Newman, when asked if he were following the race. The scaling back of large gatherings precluded any kind of final-weekend rally with big-name headliners like Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez — though it’s unclear whether any would have materialized without the outbreak. Neither campaigned for Cisneros in South Texas. “I was always a little bit worried about this dynamic,” said Sean McElwee, the founder of liberal think tank Data for Progress. “The extent to which the top of the ticket was going to swamp out interest in the down-ticket stuff was always a danger for these primary challengers this cycle.”","This anti-abortion rights, Obamacare-opposing House Democrat is in trouble",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/dan-lipinski-primary-133226,politico
"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden narrowly won the Washington state primary, keeping a lead over progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to The Associated Press.

Washington votes entirely by mail-in ballots.  Biden secured victories in all states except North Dakota, which went to Sanders. His Washington win continues a surge for the former vice president that initially started with a rocky trail behind Sanders.  Biden won by more than 21,000 of the over 2 million votes cast, according to the AP. Though 13 candidates were on the ballot, Biden and Sanders were the main candidates after a litany of prominent Democrats — including Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren — dropped out of the race.

"Seven days before Donald Trump took office, his aides faced a major test: the rapid, global spread of a dangerous virus in cities like London and Seoul, one serious enough that some countries were imposing travel bans.  In a sober briefing, Trump’s incoming team learned that the disease was an emerging pandemic — a strain of novel influenza known as H9N2 — and that health systems were crashing in Asia, overwhelmed by the demand. “Health officials warn that this could become the worst influenza pandemic since 1918,” Trump’s aides were told. Soon, they heard cases were popping up in California and Texas. The briefing was intended to hammer home a new, terrifying reality facing the Trump administration, and the incoming president’s responsibility to protect Americans amid a crisis. But unlike the coronavirus pandemic currently ravaging the globe, this 2017 crisis didn’t really happen — it was among a handful of scenarios presented to Trump’s top aides as part of a legally required transition exercise with members of the outgoing administration of Barack Obama.  And in the words of several attendees, the atmosphere was “weird” at best, chilly at worst. POLITICO obtained documents from the meeting and spoke with more than a dozen attendees to help provide the most detailed reconstruction of the closed-door session yet. It was perhaps the most concrete and visible transition exercise that dealt with the possibility of pandemics, and top officials from both sides — whether they wanted to be there or not — were forced to confront a whole-of-government response to a crisis. The Trump team was told it could face specific challenges, such as shortages of ventilators, anti-viral drugs and other medical essentials, and that having a coordinated, unified national response was “paramount” — warnings that seem eerily prescient given the ongoing coronavirus crisis.  But roughly two-thirds of the Trump representatives in that room are no longer serving in the administration. That extraordinary turnover in the months and years that followed is likely one reason his administration has struggled to handle the very real pandemic it faces now, former Obama administration officials said. “The advantage we had under Obama was that during the first four years we had the same White House staff, the same Cabinet,” said former deputy labor secretary Chris Lu, who attended the gathering. “Just having the continuity makes all the difference in the world.” Sean Spicer, Trump’s first White House press secretary, was among those who participated in the meeting. He said he understood the reasons such exercises could be useful, but described the encounter as a massive transfer of information that ultimately felt very theoretical. In real life, things are never as simple as what’s presented in a table-top exercise, he said. “There’s no briefing that can prepare you for a worldwide pandemic,” added Spicer, who left the administration in mid-2017. The outgoing Obama aides and incoming Trump aides gathered for roughly three hours on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 13, 2017, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House. At least 30 representatives of Trump’s team — many of them soon-to-be Cabinet members — were present, each sitting next to their closest Obama administration counterpart. Incoming Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to keep dozing off. Incoming Energy Secretary Rick Perry was getting along famously with Ernest Moniz, the man he was replacing, several fellow participants said.  But it was clear some on the Trump team had barely, if ever, spoken with the people they were replacing. News had broken that same day about national security adviser Michael Flynn’s unusual contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, so his presence in the meeting added to the surrealness. Some members of both groups kept going in and out of the room, but most paid quiet attention to the presentations, which were led by top Obama aides. Obama aides, in op-eds and essays ripping the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus, officially called COVID-19, have pointed to the Jan. 13, 2017, session as a key example of their effort to press the importance of pandemic preparedness to their successors. In a Friday op-ed, Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, blasted Trump for comments such as “you can never really think” that a pandemic like the coronavirus “is going to happen.” She mentioned the 2017 session as one of many instances of the Obama administration’s efforts to help its successor be ready for such a challenge. She also slammed the Trump team for dismantling the National Security Council section that would play a lead role in organizing the U.S. response to a global pandemic. “Rather than heed the warnings, embrace the planning and preserve the structures and budgets that had been bequeathed to him, the president ignored the risk of a pandemic,” Rice wrote. (Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton, who oversaw the dissolution of the NSC’s global health security and biodefense section, has defended it as necessary streamlining, countering that global health “remained a top NSC priority.” Trump, when recently asked about the reshuffling, called the question “nasty” and said, “I don’t know anything about it.”) Lisa Monaco, Obama’s homeland security adviser, explained the thinking behind the January 2017 session in a recent essay for Foreign Affairs. “Although the exercise was required, the specific scenarios we chose were not,” she wrote. “We included a pandemic scenario because I believed then, and I have warned since, that emerging infectious disease was likely to pose one of the gravest risks for the new administration.” None of the sources argued that one meeting three years ago could have dramatically altered events today. But Obama aides say the Trump administration’s fumbling of the coronavirus outbreak is partly rooted in how unprepared — and in some cases unwilling — it was to engage in transition exercises at all in late 2016 and early 2017. David Shulkin, who was an Obama appointee at the time but had been nominated to be Veterans Affairs secretary in the Trump administration, said in an interview that with the exception of this exercise, which he didn’t recall well, he noticed that in his agency, there had been “little coordination” and “very little interest in working with the Obama appointees.”  “They had said we don’t really have a lot of need to talk to the Obama appointees,” he said. That botched handoff sparked weeks of confusion, all the way up to Inauguration Day. “There was a frenzy before the transition where I was asked to consider staying because the [preparedness] mission was so important,” said Nicole Lurie, who served as Obama’s Health and Human Services assistant secretary for preparedness and response, where she worked on crises like the Ebola virus outbreak and attended the pandemic exercise. “Then through the HHS secretary’s office, the next day, I heard they changed their mind.” The Trump campaign, like the rest of America, was shocked to win the November 2016 election. Soon afterward, Trump cast aside his team’s transition prep work that had happened already and started over; some of his aides described tossing carefully collected binders full of possible personnel picks into trash bins. It was days, sometimes weeks, before his nominees and their aides showed up to meet the people they were replacing — if they did so at all — or to engage in transition meetings. Obama aides said they left detailed memos for their successors, but that quite often it appeared those memos were never read. Many on the Obama side were genuinely surprised that so many actually showed up for the Jan. 13, 2017, exercise, and there were expectations that some would skip it. On the Obama side, several agencies were represented by their second-in-command at the meeting for reasons including a belief that Trump’s principals wouldn’t show. The gathering was held to satisfy a requirement in a 2016 law that updated the procedures around presidential transitions to require, among other things, that the outgoing administration “prepare and host interagency emergency preparedness and response exercises.” Obama also mentioned it in a 2016 executive order laying out his transition goals. The 2016 law came about at the urging of the Partnership for Public Service, a good-government organization that helps administrations and candidates with the transition process. The emergency preparedness provisions were inspired by how George W. Bush handled his transition to Obama; that process, regarded as the gold standard for transition planning, included joint exercises on how to react to improvised explosive devices in cities. Bush had insisted on a detailed and highly coordinated transition planning in part because he felt scarred by the rushed transition he’d experienced from the Bill Clinton administration, not to mention having to deal with the Sept. 11 attacks during his first year. “The idea was hatched after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina precisely to prepare for situations like today,” said David Marchick, director of the Partnership for Public Service’s Center for Presidential Transition.  The Obama and Trump teams met in the afternoon, sitting around tables arranged in a rectangle. Participants were given a binder of unclassified materials titled “Presidential Transition Exercise Series,” the contents of which were obtained by POLITICO. The purpose of the exercise, the documents state, was to “familiarize” the incoming team with “domestic incident management policy and practices and continuity of government programs” in case it faced a major crisis. One key goal was to explain to participants the various legal authorities they had to pursue a response, and which agencies had which capabilities and responsibilities. The references provided included detailed explanations of numerous laws and regulations that might affect their work, such as the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  Aside from the H9N2 pandemic exercise, the participants discussed the case study of how the Obama administration handled Hurricane Sandy in 2012. One section covered a potential cyber incident. Another went through how to respond to a domestic terrorism incident, in this case one carried out by a group of U.S. citizens who placed bombs in nearby spots during a major sporting event in a U.S. city. The terror squad not only detonates the bombs, it also engages in a mass shooting and takes a dozen hostages. Using the materials, Monaco led the discussion. Her incoming counterpart, Tom Bossert, acted as a “semi co-chair,” attendees said. Ross, the then 79-year-old incoming Commerce secretary, was spotted with his eyes closed on more than one occasion. Elaine Chao, tapped to run the Department of Transportation, paid close attention. Several attendees noted the tense body language between Rice and Flynn, who lasted only a few weeks as Trump’s national security adviser and was ousted amid questions over his dealings with Russian officials. And then there was the Energy Department duo: Perry, the incoming secretary who previously served as the governor of Texas, and Moniz, the outgoing secretary and famed physicist. The pair seemed to get along fabulously, which stood out to other attendees given the overall distrust between the two teams and the fact that Perry had once proposed getting rid of the Energy Department altogether. It was a “semi-bizarro lovefest” between the two, a fellow participant said. “They were ready to go make a buddy movie.”  Perry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement, Moniz, who now leads the Energy Futures Initiative, said, “It is correct that [Perry] and I offered relevant perspectives from a governor’s and Cabinet secretary’s seat, respectively. As governor of Texas for a long time, Perry had been through many episodes needing crisis management.” For the most part, however, the Trump team was in receive mode.  Partly, that was not a surprise: Many of Trump’s personnel choices had little or no government experience, and the Obama aides were presenting massive troves of information to them about how a raft of agencies had to work together to respond to various crises. Multiple current and former Trump officials reached by POLITICO said they did not recall much about the briefing. But some Obama aides who attended said they were left with the impression that many of the Trump aides showed up to simply check off a box more than to learn. The impression was boosted in part because the transition overall was going so poorly. Several Trump nominees had barely even spoken to their Obama counterparts.  The State Department representative at the meeting, for instance, was Tom Shannon, a veteran career foreign service officer serving as undersecretary of State for political affairs. Shannon attended instead of Secretary of State John Kerry in part because he would be staying on under Trump and was essentially the “transition designee.” But that Jan. 13, 2017, session was the first time he’d seen the incoming secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in person since Trump picked him for the job a month earlier. (Before the inauguration, Kerry and Tillerson spoke once, by phone, for a few minutes, people familiar with the situation said.) “The problem is that they came in very arrogant and convinced that they knew more than the outgoing administration — full swagger,” one former Obama administration official who attended said.  “There were people who were there who said, ‘This is really stupid and why do we need to be here,’” added another senior Obama administration official who attended, alleging that Ross and incoming Education Secretary Betsy DeVos were especially dismissive in conversations on the sidelines of the session. “But some Trump people, like Tom Bossert, were trying to take it seriously.” Asked for comment, Liz Hill, a spokesperson for DeVos, told POLITICO: “This is nothing more than a hit piece with no basis in reality. This department, under the secretary’s leadership, has taken swift action to support students, parents, and education leaders during this pandemic and will continue to do so. This former Obama official’s wild claims don’t comport with reality.” A Commerce Department spokesperson denied that Ross had dozed off. ""Secretary Ross found the meeting quite interesting and informative, taking many notes during the exercise,"" the spokesperson said. ""He continues to rely upon that knowledge and experience as he assists the president in confronting the crisis at hand."" Another participant noted that such exercises are primarily aimed at helping an incoming administration make it through the first several months of its tenure — “the idea being, of course, that during the transition period we’re uniquely vulnerable.”  Presumably, by the third or fourth year in power, the administration would have its own processes and muscle memory, the participant said. Asked whether information about the pandemic exercise reached the president-elect, a former senior Trump administration official who attended the meeting couldn’t say for sure but noted that it wasn’t “the kind of thing that really interested the president very much.”  “He was never interested in things that might happen. He’s totally focused on the stock market, the economy and always bashing his predecessor and giving him no credit,” the person said. “The possibility things were things he didn’t spend much time on or show much interest in. “Even though we would put time on the schedule for things like that, if they happened at all, they would be very, very brief,” the former official continued. “To get the president to be focused on something like this would be quite hard.”  Anything associated with Obama or his administration was also a no-go zone for Trump aides. If you brought them up, “that would be an immediate rejection, like, ‘Why are they even here? Why the fuck did you ask them?’” Ben Lefebvre contributed to this report.","Before Trump’s inauguration, a warning: ‘The worst influenza pandemic since 1918’",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-inauguration-warning-scenario-pandemic-132797,politico
"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is facing pressure from inside and outside the State Department to be more forthcoming about the coronavirus’s effect on its 75,000 employees around the world.  Pompeo is expected to address the pandemic during a press conference Tuesday afternoon. The illness is forcing U.S. diplomats to scramble to help Americans affected overseas while also concerning them for their own safety.  The department has said it is aware of reports that least one U.S. embassy employee, in Jamaica, has contracted the COVID-19 virus, but has divulged little else. A State Department official familiar with the issue, however, told POLITICO there are several other confirmed cases at posts overseas, but none yet in Washington. State Department spokespeople have not offered comment. Frustration with State’s handling of the issue is growing both internally and externally. Lawmakers and staffers are raising questions about why Pompeo has not been more up front about his workforce’s cases of the virus, while also expressing concerns about a lack of uniform guidance from Pompeo on how employees should adjust their work habits.  The department “has not put forth a coordinated, robust response, which I fear puts the health of its own employees at further risk, and further jeopardizes the health and well-being of the American people,” Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a letter to Pompeo dated Monday.  Eric Rubin, president of the American Foreign Service Association, the diplomats’ union, also called for transparency. “We would urge that the administration share all information that is available so that our people have a clear sense of what the dangers are and what they need to do to be safe,” he said.  Some State Department staffers privately complain that they’ve not heard more from Pompeo directly on the issue. The internal messaging has been delegated largely to other top State Department officials, who have essentially told various bureau leaders and ambassadors to issue their own guidance to their staffers on whether to work remotely or take other measures to reduce the virus’ potential spread.  “The result is inconsistency,” one State Department employee said.  Pompeo has addressed the virus in at least one way: his occasional newsletter to employees. In a recent “Message from Mike,” he offered vague praise at the top for how the “team” has come together to face the crisis. But the message contained no specifics about the virus’s impact on the department itself.",Pompeo faces internal questions about his handling of the coronavirus,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/mike-pompeo-coronavirus-134006,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that the Trump administration was considering offsetting the economic burden of the coronavirus pandemic by ""immediately"" cutting checks to Americans. Mnuchin, speaking at a White House press conference, did not say how much money Americans could potentially expect to receive, and indicated that the administration could seek to exclude those who are well-off from receiving payments. “We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin told reporters. “Americans need cash now, and the president wants to get cash now — and I mean now in the next two weeks.” Mnuchin indicated that the president’s preference for a payroll tax holiday — a six- to eight-month process — would take too long to put money into Americans’ pockets. “The president has instructed me we have to do this now. So this is now,” Mnuchin said. “This is stuff that needs to be done now. The president has instructed me that this is no fault to American workers. For medical reasons, we are shutting down parts of this economy, and we are going to use all the tools we have.” Governors across the country have closed restaurants, bars and other venues across their states as public health officials continue to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. The White House released new guidelines Monday encouraging people not gather in groups larger than 10, work and take classes from home as much possible and avoid dining in bars, restaurants and food courts. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 5,000 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., though experts expect that number to rise as more testing is made available. More than 90 people have died. Mnuchin, who left the White House briefing early for meetings on Capitol Hill, said he would preview the plan at a lunch with Senate Republicans. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has proposed sending every American $1,000 and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas has signaled support for a similar proposal to provide immediate economic relief to American families. “I think it’s clear we don’t need to send people who make $1 million a year checks,” Mnuchin said. “That’s one of the ideas that we like. We’re going to preview that today, and then we’ll be talking about details afterwards.”  President Donald Trump added that checks for everyone “may not be an accurate way of doing it because obviously some people shouldn’t be getting checks for $1,000.” “We’ll have a pretty good idea by the end of the day what we’re gonna be doing,” he said. Mnuchin also announced that Treasury would defer an additional $100 billion in Internal Revenue Service payments, bringing the total to $300 billion. Individuals can defer up to $1 million, Mnuchin said, while corporations can defer up to $10 million. The deferments are interest- and penalty-free for 90 days. Still, Mnuchin encouraged as many Americans as possible to file their taxes by the April 15 deadline to ensure those who are eligible receive their refunds in a timely manner. “We don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” he said. “We want you to make sure you get them. Many people do this electronically, which is easy for them and easy for the IRS.”",Mnuchin: 'We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately',2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/coronavirus-government-payments-checks-133994,politico
"The government’s economic stimulus is set to quickly balloon into trillion-dollar territory in the coming days, the largest rescue in modern American history, as major industries flood the Trump administration and Capitol Hill for aid while huge swaths of the economy stall from the coronavirus crisis. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet with Senate Republicans behind closed doors on Tuesday to present lawmakers with options for aid to airlines, hotels, casinos and small-to-medium-sized businesses. The White House was pushing for a package of more than $800 billion, POLITICO reported Monday, and on Tuesday the Treasury Department was preparing to unveil a package of $850 billion including more than $50 billion for the airline industry, $250 billion for small-business support and $500 billion for a payroll tax holiday. A senior administration official acknowledged the proposal could climb above that Tuesday by the time it’s unveiled.  The Trump administration is pushing to send direct payments to Americans in the next two weeks as huge parts of the economy shut down. “Americans need cash now,” Mnuchin said. “And the president wants to get cash now. And I mean now in the next two weeks.“ He planned to discuss the move with lawmakers and announce details later Tuesday.  Democrats are pushing their own package of provisions that don’t overlap entirely with the GOP pitch. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats are pitching a package of “at least” $750 billion that is expected to include more emergency aid for hospitals, expanded unemployment insurance, more funds for small business, help with child care, and food assistance for seniors. The size and scope of the package are morphing rapidly as the economic and market damage mounts. Senate Republicans and the White House are exploring how to fast-track existing legislation with the upcoming stimulus packages. The Trump administration’s goal is to provide individuals and companies with enough cash through emergency payments, loans, tax deferrals or temporary tax cuts to help them survive the sudden downturn.  The presentation is also expected to include an idea President Donald Trump has latched onto — a temporary cut or suspension of the payroll tax cut through the end of the year which would benefit both companies and workers. One version of the payroll tax holiday would cost $950 billion alone through the end of the year. CEOs, union leaders and lobbyists have been warning the administration of mass layoffs if the government does not help soon. Senators seem poised to act this week, while the House is still in recess. Cobbling together a stimulus package worth more than $1 trillion would mark a major ideological shift for Republicans, who spent years decrying debt and government bailouts following the 2008 global financial crisis. But with uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus and the volatility in the stock market, the White House does not seem concerned about the price tag — only stopping the financial freefall. Other ideas that have circulated throughout the administration in recent days include inserting into the economic stimulus package a large-scale public works project; tweaks to the EB-5 visa program to boost foreign investment; tariff relief; and even a one-time cash payment to Americans between $500 to $750, according to people close to the administration.  The Federal Reserve and Treasury are already launching programs to provide support through emergency powers. The central bank on Tuesday announced a new lending program, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, under its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The Treasury Department will provide taxpayer backing for the effort with $10 billion in capital from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.  “The economic disruption and uncertainty created by COVID-19 has created challenges for the commercial paper market, constraining access to short-term credit for American businesses,” Mnuchin said. “By providing short-term credit, the CPFF will help American businesses manage their finances through this challenging period.”  Some senior White House officials are also pushing Treasury to issue long-term bonds that would mature in 50 or 100 years to help cover the cost of the stimulus package. Mnuchin has said repeatedly in the past that he is considering issuing such bonds to take advantage of interest rates that the Fed has now pushed to near zero. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has long advocated for the issuance of such bonds, an idea also supported by outside economic advisers to the White House.  Republican Sen. Mitt Romney in recent days has called for giving every American over the age of 18 a check for $1,000 as a form of economic stimulus — a move the administration was moving toward by Tuesday.  The coronavirus relief packages under consideration now by Congress are set to eclipse prior efforts.  The economic stimulus program cleared through Congress in early 2009 under the Obama administration was nearly $800 billion, including a tax cut, infrastructure and numerous other provisions. The bank bailout plan passed by Congress in 2008 under the Bush administration — formally the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP — authorized $700 billion originally intended to buy toxic assets from banks, mainly mortgage-backed securities that plunged in value during the housing crisis. The money was later diverted to multiple different programs to inject capital into banks. The TARP program ultimately disbursed around $426 billion and eventually recovered $441 billion, earning the Treasury Department a nominal profit of around $15 billion. That figure remains controversial. Taking into account inflation from the time of the bailouts, the government actually lost around $25 billion on the program.  It also generated widespread anger that banks and bankers got bailed out while ordinary citizens received far less. The Trump administration is well aware of this history and taking pains to avoid the same optics; top economic officials like Mnuchin and other senior aides around Trump keep emphasizing the need to help small and medium-sized businesses as well. “Everyone will need assistance and that is the bottom line. This is the demand issue because consumers have stopped spending,” said Alfredo Ortiz, President and CEO of the Job Creators Network, a conservative-leaning group founded by entrepreneurs like The Home Depot founder, Bernie Marcus. “Every industry will need some level of assistance. In the past, Main Street America has not been as represented in some economic stimulus packages.”  Ortiz said he has been in touch directly with Mnuchin, who seems very amenable to including relief for small-to-medium-sized businesses in any package. The TARP program also drew widespread criticism for creating a moral hazard – banks could feel emboldened to take risks knowing the government would rescue them -- while creating fewer and even larger banks that now enjoyed a bigger federal backstop. Part of the reluctance among members of Congress and the administration to direct cash payments to individual industries like airlines and hotels stems from the TARP experience and deep voter resentment to corporations and their highly paid executives getting aid over regular citizens. Senior White House officials know that direct aid to airlines in particular may be necessary to avoid crippling bankruptcies, but they are leery of being seen as handing out bailouts and want to be sure that any such aid is dwarfed by proposals that would direct cash to consumers.  As top economic officials and Senate leadership negotiate this stimulus package, Trump is spending the day on the phone with executives from the restaurant and tourism industries, supply retailers and wholesalers. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet with CEOs of major hotels including Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt and MGM Resorts International.

"The global airline industry on Tuesday intensified its call for urgent government help amid the coronavirus crisis, as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin heads to Capitol Hill to pitch senators on a massive stimulus plan that’s expected to include billions of dollars to prop up U.S. airlines. The CEO of the International Air Transport Association on Tuesday predicted that the airline industry globally would need $150 billion to $200 billion in government assistance. “We are obviously in an extraordinary time, a terrible crisis — one of the most severe we have ever had — and so we have asked governments to take extraordinary measures,” Alexandre de Juniac said on a call with reporters. Governments have already taken steps like waiving “use-it-or-lose-it” slot rules for certain airports, he noted, but IATA wants them to “implement much broader financial support” packages that include direct financial assistance, loans or tax relief. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution.” On Monday, the trade group representing major U.S. airlines requested almost $60 billion in grants and loans, as well as tax relief, saying the industry is facing a situation “much worse” than after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. So far, the administration appears to be readying a stimulus plan worth at least $850 billion and likely to exceed $1 trillion. Nothing is set in stone, but it’s expected to include at least $50 billion for the U.S. airline industry, likely a combination of direct assistance and loan guarantees. “If we want to maintain a strong [global] airline sector able to cope with this difficult crisis, but able also to provide the resources to ensure that the recovery will happen in due time … we need government to act strongly and quickly,” de Juniac said Tuesday, also warning that the crisis may lead to consolidation. Brian Pearce, IATA’s chief economist, said the outbreak is “covering markets which represent … 94 percent of global passenger revenue, so this is now impacting the entirety of air transport.” “In many cases, demand … for the business of many airlines has fallen to zero,” Pearce said, adding that new travel restrictions are exacerbating damage already caused by the outbreak. Earlier this month, IATA said there could be up to $113 billion in passenger revenue losses this year worldwide. The group didn’t provide an updated estimate Tuesday, but Pearce said the numbers are “clearly worse than this, particularly in Europe and particularly in the Americas.” As their revenues are taking a hit, “the vast majority” of carriers around the world “have high levels of debt,” Pearce noted, which is resulting in a “liquidity crisis.” At the beginning of the year, “more or less 75 percent of the airlines that we looked at … had less than three months of cash and equivalents” to cover fixed costs. “Even before COVID, the industry was in a fairly fragile position,” Pearce said. “Only 30 airlines drove the improvement in profitability that we saw in the last 10 years. There was a long tail of airlines with much more fragile finances.”",Airlines intensify calls for up to $200B in government aid worldwide,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/airlines-intensify-calls-for-up-to-200b-in-government-aid-worldwide-133824,politico
"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced that he was postponing the state's primaries, originally scheduled for late April, to June 2 as the country grapples with the spread of the coronavirus. Maryland is now the fifth state to move its primaries, joining Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky and Ohio, which saw its primary originally scheduled for today pushed until June after an eleventh-hour legal battle. “It would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble … and it would put Marylanders at risk,” Hogan said Tuesday at a press conference. “I am directing the state board of elections to develop a comprehensive plan by April 3 to conduct the primary election in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the Democratic process in our state.” But Maryland will still hold one election on April 28, foreshadowing a potentially broad move toward mail voting that could pave the way for elections across the country to continue during the coronavirus crisis. Hogan said he believed the special election to fill the seat of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, in Maryland's Baltimore-based 7th Congressional District, should forward on as a mail-in only election, the first federal election to be shifted to mail voting in response to coronavirus. “It is imperative that the people of the 7th Congressional District have a voice in the House of Representatives,” Hogan said.  “The State board of elections contacted us last Wednesday and said they were concerned about being able to conduct the election,'' Hogan said at his press conference. “They could not possibly do the mail-in for the whole state. They said they were incapable of getting it done in time ... but on a small basis in one congressional district for that one vacancy, we are going to ask the board of elections to conduct that election on time.  “We are going to encourage people to vote absentee as much as possible, and those who aren't doing the normal absentee ballot will be able to do whatever additional steps they decide to take for mail-in ballots,” Hogan continued. Hogan’s decision comes amid a national push from lawmakers, state officials and election law experts to allow anyone in the U.S. to cast their vote by mail in light of the public health crisis. Currently, 34 states and D.C. allow voters to cast an absentee ballot for any reason, and millions of voters still have to queue up in person on Election Day — an activity that blatantly violates new federal guidance against gathering in groups of 10 or more people, as Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pointed out Monday when calling for the postponement of his state's primary. While advocates have unsuccessfully called for the adoption of universal vote-by-mail for decades, they’re hoping the coronavirus pandemic serves as a wakeup call.  “In the 15 years I’ve been pushing this, we’ve never had a public health and safety argument for this. Now, we do,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the lead author of a federal vote-by-mail bill, told POLITICO. “Now, for states to say they don’t have a fallback plan and they’re just going to cancel or delay elections – that's not acceptable when we’re in the middle of the pandemic.” Last week, Wyden introduced a retooled version of his decades-old bill targeted for situations like the coronavirus pandemic. He’s currently in the process of convincing fellow senators to support it, and pushing for it to be included in one of the upcoming relief packages Congress is currently putting together.  Under the legislation, if 25 percent of states declare a state of emergency, all states have to offer universal vote-by-mail for one election cycle, and the federal government will provide $500 million to make sure pre-paid, self-sealing envelopes are distributed so that voters aren’t spreading germs or having to pay out of pocket.  Even without a federal mandate, Wyden says, the move towards vote by mail is already accelerating in red and blue states alike.  “States are already moving in this direction because people are saying, ‘What other option is there?’” he said. But even some proponents of mail balloting worry about a potential rapid switch to a predominantly mail-in system across the country. “I do think there might be particular challenges to go from in-person voting to almost exclusively vote-by-mail systems,” Dale Ho, the director of the Voting Rights Project at the ACLU, said.  “Look, if a state can do it … it is probably due diligence at this point to explore the possibility. But that is a major, major change in the midst of an election year,” he added, voicing concern that such major change could potentially disenfranchise some, like low-income or Native American voters, who may not have a fixed address on file with the state. Ho said that states should, at a minimum, adopt no-excuse absentee voting and make changes in the law to better accommodate voting by mail. Those changes include pushing back the deadline for when mail ballots must be received, allowing election officials to start processing ballots before Election Day, and providing federal funding to support state and local election administrators. Marc Elias, the prominent Democratic election lawyer who also supports expanding mail balloting, said there also need to be changes to laws in some states that allow individual poll workers to toss out a mail-in ballot if they think the signature on the envelope doesn’t match the signature on file. Voters’ signatures can change over time, they argue, due to age or a disability.  “It's junk science,” said Elias, who is currently suing Michigan over its signature verification law. “At a minimum, voters need to be notified that someone doesn’t think their signature doesn’t match and given an opportunity to fix it.”  Maryland will likely not be the last state to postpone its primaries. Hogan said “other governors are expected to do” the same “later today, or the days ahead.” A spokesperson for Hogan tweeted that “we expect other Acela states to take similar steps.” The April 28 primary was informally referred to as the Acela Primary, because the states voting that day are connected by the popular Amtrak line. Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are all scheduled to vote on April 28; none of them have modified their primaries as of yet.","Maryland postpones primary, shifts special election to mail voting over coronavirus",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/maryland-postpones-april-28-primary-election-over-coronavirus-133776,politico
"Amazon is taking steps to speed the delivery of household staples and medical products amid a surge of demand because of the coronavirus pandemic — a move that threatens to devastate businesses that use its platform to sell less-essential goods. The country's largest online retailer notified vendors and third-party sellers today that it would temporarily halt the arrival of nonessential goods at its fulfillment centers until April 5. Products that are already en route to or stored inside its warehouses as of today will still be sold, Amazon said. ""We understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers,"" an Amazon spokesperson said. The company said it would place the highest priority on products in six broad categories: baby products; health and household goods; beauty and personal care; groceries; industrial and scientific products; and pet supplies. Amazon announced Monday it would hire an additional 100,000 workers in its U.S. warehouses to help handle increased demand. The news comes as several U.S. states and European countries have closed bars, restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and other businesses where people come into close contact in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus. With the business closures and ""social distancing"" recommendations, more people are turning to online retailers like Amazon for basic goods like toilet paper and hand sanitizer.","Amazon expedites grocery, health shipments at expense of other products",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/amazon-expedites-shipments-coronavirus-134271,politico
"Joe Biden’s unequivocal declaration that his running mate will be a woman began the 2020 veepstakes with a brutal cut. There will be no consolation prize for Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg or Julian Castro. There will be no unity ticket pairing Biden with Bernie Sanders. Mansplainers and manspreaders, you can go home. Joe has binders full of women. Perhaps there has never been a more serious veepstakes than this one. Biden won’t say on the record that he would serve only one term as president, but he has given enough hints that many have assumed it. That makes his vice-presidential choice the automatic frontrunner for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination, and potentially the first female president of the United States. This is no time for your last-call, falling-off-your-barstool, so-crazy-it-just-might-work vice-presidential musings. Already, some names Biden has casually thrown out are non-starters. Jeanne Shaheen is highly accomplished as a former governor of New Hampshire, but Biden should not team up with a fellow septuagenarian. Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates is a fun name to bat around, but getting fired by Donald Trump is not a qualification to be a COVID-19 diagnosis away from being commander-in-chief. Beyond a plausible president, the 77-year-old Biden needs a running mate who can help him either win the critical Midwestern states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, or energize the more racially diverse generations of young voters, who could help not only in Midwest cities, but also in Southern swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida. Who can fit the bill? My rankings, on a scale from Sarah Palin to LBJ-carrying-Texas-for-JFK: She’s a rising Democratic star who may have gotten a raw deal in the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia. But the plain fact remains that the pinnacle of her government service is as a state House minority leader. That does not cross the “Ready on Day One” threshold.  Donald Trump’s election showed that experience doesn’t matter to many voters. But Biden is running as the candidate of reassurance. The prospect of a manifestly under-qualified vice president serving under a president who is pushing 80 is the opposite of reassuring.  Warren did Biden two big favors in the primary. She incinerated Michael Bloomberg, and she has declined to endorse Bernie Sanders. Perhaps Biden would have won South Carolina and Super Tuesday anyway, but Warren’s assistance certainly didn’t hurt. Should Biden return the favor, and help unite the party’s populist and pragmatist wings with a Warren pick? Probably not. Warren has a lot of strong attributes, but being a deferential team player is not one of them. Besides, if Warren wants a job with real power that could clamp down on bad behavior from Wall Street, she should lobby for Treasury secretary or attorney general. Susan Rice may be the African-American Democrat with the most national security experience in the country, having served for the entirety of Barack Obama’s administration, first as ambassador to the United Nations then as national security adviser. No one could seriously question her qualifications to assume the responsibilities of the presidency if necessary. Yet Rice comes with the baggage of the Benghazi affair. Shortly after the 2012 attack on the U.S Consulate in Libya, which killed two American officials, Rice went on several TV shows and said the incident began as a “spontaneous reaction” to an anti-Islamic video, which was then joined by “extremist” elements. Rice was citing what was in the initial intelligence assessment, but Republicans accused her of covering up the role of terrorist organizations. (Later reporting concluded the attack was premeditated by members of a terrorist group, and there was no spontaneous protest, though some of the attackers were motivated by the video cited by Rice.)  Even if Rice can handle the rehashing of Benghazi, the last thing a presidential candidate wants from his vice presidential choice is an immediate distraction.  After just one year in office, the Democratic governor of Kansas has managed to strike an agreement with the Republican leader of the state Senate for a bill that takes advantage of the federal aid offered in Obamacare, expands Medicaid and covers an estimated 130,000 uninsured Kansans. There’s just one problem: the bill is stalled, short one vote in the Senate to clear a procedural hurdle and get a floor vote. Regardless of the final legislative outcome, Kelly would be a long-shot pick. She would almost certainly be unable to turn Kansas blue in a presidential election for the first time since 1964. She is not well known enough in the Rust Belt to help flip northern swing states. And as a technocratic moderate, she would not fire up younger progressives.  People who want to put Michigan back to in the Democratic column have an eye on the state’s new governor. On Monday, Whitmer told MSNBC, “It’s not going to be me.”  Even if it is her, Whitmer may not be in a position to help lock Michigan down. When Biden campaigned with her ahead of the Michigan primary, he brought back her 2018 campaign slogan, “Fix the Damn Roads.” However, her attempt to fund the fixing of those roads, a 45-cent gas tax hike, was rejected by the Republican-led state legislature. She’s now issuing bonds to cover the cost of a less ambitious road repair program. A spotlight on Michigan’s partisan gridlock could complicate Biden’s efforts in the state. And a January poll pegged her job approval at a very soft 43 percent (although she was above water, with only 36 percent disapproving.) The New York Times reported this month that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer privately floated the name of the African-American congresswoman from Orlando. In her favor: national prominence after serving as a House impeachment manager, a law-and-order background from her 3 1/2 years as Orlando police chief, an up-from-bootstraps biography as the daughter of a janitor and a maid, and potential vote-getting ability in the swingiest part of the swing state of Florida. But Demings still looks like a stretch. Her political resume is thin, as she is only in her third year in the House. At 63, she may not be the best choice to rally young voters who are skeptical of Biden. And her tenure as police chief is not unblemished. When she first ran for Congress, National Journal reported that the Orlando police department “has a long record of excessive-force allegations,” and in 2009, she was censured “after her gun was stolen from her unlocked truck.” The New Mexican is the only Latina governor in the country. And Biden should like Lujan Grisham’s forceful enactment of a new “red flag law” for gun control. When she signed the bill, she took aim at sheriffs who indicated they may not enforce the provisions. “If they really intend to do that,” she said, “they should resign as a law enforcement officer and leader in that community.”  The Trump campaign has been targeting New Mexico’s five electoral votes. Hillary Clinton won only 48 percent of the vote in New Mexico in 2016. If Trump is truly threatening to poach the state, would Lujan Grisham help protect it? Like Whitmer, her level of support at home is short of intimidating. A January Morning Consult poll found her job approval at just 44 percent. While Lujan Grisham is the only Latina governor, Nevada’s Cortez Masto is the only Latina senator. She’s currently in the middle of her first term. Those who argue Biden is underperforming with Latino voters point to Cortez Masto as a fresh face who can help. Though whether Biden needs that much extra help with Latinos is up for debate. Sanders ran away with the Latino vote in the Nevada caucuses and the California primary. But Biden won with Latinos in swingier Virginia and North Carolina. Plus, Biden stayed closer to Sanders among Latinos in Texas than in California and Nevada. Furthermore, the low-key Cortez Masto has yet to make much of a national impression. That may not be a deal-breaker, but if Biden is looking for a candidate that brings excitement, he should look elsewhere. Today’s Arizona primary should factor into Biden’s decision-making. The increasingly purple state is where the Latino vote might make the most difference for Democrats in November. If Biden’s performance with Latinos is limp on Tuesday, then he should give Cortez Masto and Lujan Grisham, both Arizona neighbors, close looks. The Thai-American senator from Illinois has a gripping biography. While serving as a lieutenant colonel in the Iraq War, she was in a helicopter that was hit by a grenade. She was grievously wounded and had both of her legs amputated. Two years ago, at 50, she became the first senator to give birth while in office. She could easily become an inspirational figure as a vice presidential nominee. However, her backstory isn’t perfect. During her bid for Senate in 2016, Duckworth settled an embarrassing lawsuit accusing her of workplace retaliation when she led Illinois’ Department of Veterans Affairs, a position she was appointed to by newly pardoned ex-con, ex-Governor Rod Blagojevich. Her legal team maintained it was a “nuisance” lawsuit that was settled for only $26,000. But Biden’s vetters should give the case a thorough scrubbing. The moderate Duckworth could also attract barbs from the left. In the summer of 2018, she put some distance between herself and progressive sensation Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Asked on CNN if Ocasio-Cortez represented the future of the Democratic Party, Duckworth snarked, “I think it's the future of the party in the Bronx.” She further argued, “I think that you can’t win the White House without the Midwest and I don’t think you can go too far to the left and still win the Midwest.” Duckworth brings with her the hope that she can appeal both to older, moderates in Midwest swing states, as well as to younger votes who are eager for a woman of color in the White House. But if the ideological left can’t forgive her dismissal of Ocasio-Cortez, she’s not the right choice to help unify the party. Baldwin is a two-term senator from Wisconsin who could help win back a state that’s been on a political knife’s edge. She is the first openly gay U.S. senator in history, which could excite culturally liberal younger voters. And she’s an economic populist, which may even impress devout supporters of Warren and Sanders.  Being white, Baldwin wouldn’t give the ticket a multi-cultural image, and that could deflate some younger voters. But perhaps the biggest downside is that her ascendance to the vice presidency would create a Senate vacancy that gets filled by a special election, not by an appointment by the state’s Democratic governor. And in politically polarized Wisconsin, there’s no guarantee a Democrat would win that election. With the next Senate almost certain to be narrowly divided, the loss of even one seat could spell the end of Biden’s presidential agenda. If Biden really feels he needs help with flipping Midwest states, Amy Klobuchar is the safest pick. She successfully raised her national profile by running for president. She held her own on the debate stage. She showed that she had pull in Trump-curious Minnesota, helping throw to the state to Biden. And Minnesota’s Democratic governor can appoint her Senate replacement.  Yet Klobuchar is not without risk. Allegations of staff mistreatment tainted the start of her campaign, though no one ever went on the record. Biden’s vetters should certainly find out if there are more shoes that could drop. And Klobuchar’s role, while district attorney, in imprisoning a black teenager on reportedly flimsy evidence could be used by Trump to try to weaken Biden’s support among black voters. Progressive voices in the Democratic Party are already signaling they will react poorly to a Klobuchar pick. Markos Moulitsas of Daily Kos tweeted Monday that Klobuchar “would be Tim Kaine 2.0—doing nothing to unify the party, bringing no new demographics to the ticket. It would be (once again) a disaster.” But complaints on the left are an inevitable, and manageable, annoyance. Winning the Midwest takes precedence. But there’s a twist. Biden should conclude, “I don’t need my vice-presidential nominee to win the Midwest. I can win the Midwest all by myself!” Polls and primary results show that he already has strong appeal to white, right-leaning, working-class and suburban swing voters.  Instead, Biden’s vice-presidential nominee would be most useful politically by shoring up his support among culturally liberal young voters eager to elect a woman of color in 2024. That’s why, of all the qualified women of color on the short list, the obvious choice was, and remains, Kamala Harris.  She doesn’t bring a state, but she wouldn’t cost the Democrats a Senate seat either. Besides, who was the last VP to flip a state? Maybe Walter Mondale in 1976. John Edwards couldn’t deliver North Carolina to John Kerry. Paul Ryan couldn’t deliver Wisconsin to Mitt Romney. Flipping home states may be thing that doesn’t happen anymore.  She doesn’t bring the far left, who deride the former prosecutor as a “cop,” but those folks won’t be satisfied with anyone Biden chooses. And if they don’t live in swing states, Biden can let them go. Harris, who is part of both the black community and the Indian-American community (which Trump has been courting heavily), would excite plenty of younger voters who can’t seem to get excited about electing another old white male. She’s a first-term senator who has not produced much successful legislation, but she is a road-tested orator who, over the course of the primary, was vetted by the media without surfacing any uncomfortable surprises. And she proved during the Democratic debates that she is effective at making direct attacks at her political opponents.  Some argue that Harris did too poor a job in the primary to live up to her reputation as a dazzling campaigner. But she didn’t fail because of her stump skills. Where she struggled—as did all the candidates who weren’t septuagenarian men with pre-existing bases of support—was with carving out a distinct ideological profile. She wrongly calculated, in the initial stages of the campaign, that she needed to lean further left than she was comfortable doing. Towards the end of her bid, she let her inner pragmatist shine. She will have no problem echoing Biden’s themes.  A Biden-Harris ticket could aggressively pursue the Upper Midwest, the Southeast and the Southwest, from to Maine or Montana, from Arizona to South Carolina. A thorough vetting process may discover problems that aren’t publicly known. And Biden will, at the end of the day, need to pick someone he feels will be a governing partner, not just a political asset. But the smart money is on Kamala, and no drama.","Biden’s Top 12 Running Mates, Ranked",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/bidens-top-12-running-mates-ranked-134256,politico
"The Federal Reserve is aggressively moving to keep money flowing through financial markets battered by the coronavirus pandemic, making hundreds of billions of dollars available to ensure that cash is available to investors, companies and consumers. Days after the central bank slashed interest rates to zero, the Fed on Tuesday launched an emergency effort to make certain that big creditworthy businesses will continue to be able to access funding, amid concern that the cash would dry up. The Fed said it was reopening a crisis-era investment vehicle that will allow it to purchase IOUs from those companies. ""That is a $1 trillion market, and it is critical to American workers, it’s critical to American business and it’s critical to American savers who have a lot of that money in money market funds,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who had to sign off on the move, said at a White House press briefing. ""We heard loud and clear there were liquidity issues."" That comes on top of efforts to ensure smooth trading in key markets for U.S. government bonds and mortgages, such as by offering massive temporary cash injections and pledging to buy billions in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. More actions are likely to follow, but without more drastic steps by Congress and the administration, its efforts might not be enough to avoid a broader breakdown in markets. Mnuchin and President Donald Trump outlined several ideas under discussion at the White House briefing. “The Fed’s liquidity injections appear not to be working,” Zoltan Pozsar, a managing director at Credit Suisse, said in a note Tuesday morning. “All segments of funding markets ... continue to show growing signs of stress. The Fed may have to do more still.” The stock market has whipsawed wildly over the past several weeks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday reporting its worst point loss in history and its biggest percentage-point drop since 1987. The Dow steadied on Tuesday and went up a bit following the Fed’s latest action and a White House progress report on a rescue package. Still, Bank of America Global Research said investors continue to be stingy about extending credit and there are concerns about the stability of various parts of the financial system. “Markets remain in a fragile state and will likely continue to do so until there is greater certainty around the path of COVID-19 outbreak and the fiscal policy response from governments around the world,” the bank said in a report. The Fed acted Tuesday to unclog the market for short-term business debt, with financial experts worrying that mounting problems there could spread and cripple other types of lending. “By ensuring the smooth functioning of this market, particularly in times of strain, the Federal Reserve is providing credit that will support families, businesses, and jobs across the economy,” the central bank said in a statement Treasury will provide $10 billion of credit protection for the purchases from its Exchange Stabilization Fund. Businesses that want to use the facility must pay a fee to register. Companies rely on the market for so-called commercial paper for quick funding, but mutual funds, a traditional buyer of the debt instruments, have been selling to make sure they have enough cash in case many of their customers are looking to withdraw money. “By providing short-term credit, the [Fed facility] will help American businesses manage their finances through this challenging period,” Mnuchin said in a statement. But Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, said the Fed is ultimately constrained in how much it can do, in part because its emergency lending powers for firms other than banks were reined in after the 2008 financial crisis. Congress and the administration will ultimately have to take expansive action to help calm stressed markets, he added. “The Fed’s efforts, while laudable, are a necessary but not sufficient condition to address the nature of the crisis,” he said. “The bottom line is the reason why the market continues to experience historic levels of volatility is that it requires a fiscal response not exclusively a monetary response.”",Fed wages furious battle to unclog financial markets,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fed-battle-unclog-financial-markets-134282,politico
"In March 1918, with the United States fully mobilized for World War I, soldiers at Camp Funston in Fort Riley, Kansas, began reporting acute flu-like symptoms, including aches, respiratory distress, chills, coughing and high fever. Just a month later, over 1,100 men had come down with the disease; 46 of them (roughly four percent) had died. It was the start of the infamous “Spanish Flu”—a misnomer for the scourge that likely began in the U.S. but, as troops fanned out across Europe, claimed 21 million lives globally, including over 600,000 Americans.  What began in Army camps, where 25 percent of soldiers developed the flu, spread by fall to the civilian population. In Boston, 202 people died on just one day—October 1. Philadelphia later topped that record, with 700 deaths in one 24-hour period. The disease wasn’t discriminatory. It devastated urban populations like Pittsburgh and New York City but also hit vulnerable rural areas like Arkansas, where the public health infrastructure was essentially nonexistent.  Lasting just over a year, the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic stands as a lasting reminder of what happens when governments and their citizens fail to meet a crisis head on. From our perch today, as we brace for the coronavirus’ inevitable spread, the missteps of 1918 seem eerily prescient: A lack of leadership from Washington, with the gaps filled unevenly at the state and local levels. Public officials who either lied, dissembled or made up facts. Hucksters who used popular media to misinform the public and make a quick buck in the process. Public health infrastructure that was inadequate to the challenge. And ordinary citizens who often refused to heed the warning of experts. To be sure, science a century ago was light years from present day. The influenza outbreak was far more lethal in our great grandparents’ time than in our own because treatments were nowhere near as advanced. But even back in 1918, developments in medicine and public health had rendered diseases like cholera, typhoid and diphtheria—in recent memory, sure killers—manageable or even preventable. America’s cities and its military had extensive experience with quarantines and other social measures to stop vectors of transmission. And still, government bungling and a general lack of preparedness helped the pandemic spread like wildfire. Professional historians usually recoil from the old adage that “history is bound to repeat itself” (it really isn’t). And yet, sometimes it does. The lesson is pretty simple. Look at what went wrong in 1918. Then do the opposite. Lots went wrong in 1918. Start with the worst example, Philadelphia, where the local government failed abjectly to meet the public health crisis. The problem silently took root on September 7 when 300 sailors, some of whom were already infected, docked in the Navy Yard. Boston had already been hard hit by the epidemic, so city officials were well aware of its deadly potential. The city, whose infrastructure had buckled even before the war, was now teeming with new workers and migrants who stretched the housing stock, streets and transportation to capacity. It took but 10 days before over 600 servicemen and civilians were sick enough to require hospitalization, including several doctors and nurses who had been treating sick patients. Philadelphia’s director of Public Health and Charities, a political appointment that was, like most other positions, a sinecure of the city’s political machine, was Dr. Wilmer Krusen, a gynecologist who lacked training in epidemiology. From the start, he downplayed the severity of the threat, assuring the public that his office could “confine this disease to its present limits, and in this we are sure to be successful. No fatalities have been recorded. No concern whatever is felt.” When fatalities began to mount, he insisted there was nothing to worry about—it wasn’t the “Spanish flu,” but rather, just a few cases of the “old-fashioned influenza or grippe. … From now the disease will decrease.” True to his word, Krusden took no steps to assemble supplies or to identify doctors and nurses who could be made available in the event of mass hospitalizations. He resisted calls by other medical professionals that the city quarantine the Navy Yard.  And then, on September 18, the city held a monster parade to support the Fourth Liberty Loan Drive.  These were the high water mark days of America’s involvement in World War I. The federal government compelled, shamed and goaded citizens into conforming: From the Sedition Act, which forbade interference in the sale of war bonds, to the legions of Four Minute Men who delivered patriotic speeches in movie theaters as the reels were being changed—to say nothing of horrific acts of popular violence against German Americans—public spirit demanded that the parade go on. Tens of thousands of Philadelphians lined the streets to cheer the procession, providing the disease a tragic opportunity to spread. Within 10 days, over 1,000 Philadelphians lay dead, with another 200,000 estimated ill, and the state government in Harrisburg ordered the city’s public amusements and gathering places closed down, a ban that shuttered saloons, theaters, ice cream parlors and movie theaters. It was too little, too late: As the body count continued to climb, the Catholic archbishop assigned three thousand nuns and seminarians to staff makeshift hospitals and dig mass graves. By March 1919, when the threat of influenza lifted, Philadelphia had lost over 15,000 of its citizens. In Pittsburgh, local officials ignored the price of inaction to the east. They failed to line up hospital space and medical professionals, despite “harrowing stories that had come from other sections of the country of multitudes of dead,” the local Red Cross chapter later observed. When the governor ordered all cities to close most places of public accommodation, the mayor objected that “the whole thing seemed wrong,” echoing the city’s public health chief, who waved off calls to prepare for an onslaught of patients with the bloodless observation that “the disease was not affecting Pittsburgh to any great extent.” Of course, it soon did. Mortality rates (though not hard numbers) ultimately exceeded those of Philadelphia, though the city’s delayed and begrudging compliance with the state ban, as well as aggressive action by the Red Cross and other voluntary organizations, may have slowed the pace of infection in a way that spared funeral homes the same appalling over-capacity that hit other places. The failure of Philadelphia’s government to respond quickly and forcefully should have alerted other elected officials to the crisis. In some cases, it did, as in San Diego, where city officials took heed of the carnage that had overrun eastern cities like Philadelphia, Boston and New York and acted quickly to close churches, dance halls, gymnasiums, libraries, swimming pools and all public meetings—except, of course, outside war bond drives. Police enforced these measures aggressively. When the number of infected citizens did not immediately drop, municipal officials worked with the Red Cross to produce and distribute thousands of gauze masks, which many citizens balked at wearing, despite the entreaties of public health officials. The San Diego Union dismissed the very idea out of hand, observing that “modern civilization has abolished the mask as part of the human wearing apparel … only highwaymen, burglars, and hold-up men wear masks professionally.” Still, the city’s early and active efforts contributed to smaller mortality numbers than other municipalities. But the broader pattern that emerged was dismissal, dissemblance and outright deception on the part of public officials who either did not perceive the severity of the threat or who would not acknowledge it, for fear of political consequence. What mayor or governor, after all, wanted to go to war with local businesses, which in every city vocally opposed forced shutdowns? What health official wanted to run afoul of the coercive spirit encouraging war bond drives and other acts of solidarity with the men in uniform? In Denver and Cheyenne, officials caved to business pressure and lifted restrictions, only to reimpose them after the rates of infection and fatality climbed again. Even as his city reeled with the onset of disease, New York City’s public health director waved away calls for greater vigilance, finding that “other bronchial diseases and not the so-called Spanish influenza ... [caused] the illness of the majority of persons who were reported ill with influenza.” Though the federal Public Health Service encouraged cities and states to adopt best practices, in the earliest days when quarantines and shutdowns might have flatten the curve (to borrow from contemporary parlance), the U.S. Surgeon General, Rupert Blue, assured Americans that “there is no cause for alarm if precautions are observed”—a nonchalant remark that newspapers widely reported, and which imparted a false sense of calm. Even when the body count manifestly demonstrated otherwise, Colonel Philipp Doane, who led health and safety at the military shipyards where the disease first spread, dismissed the “so-called Spanish influenza” as “nothing more or less than the old-fashioned grippe.”  Woodrow Wilson, who mobilized a formidable public relations effort to generate populate support for the war, said nothing. This was a time before presidents routinely stepped in to counsel, console or calm the nation through a pandemic. It wasn’t only that many elected and appointed officials failed to meet the moment. In many ways, Americans were ill-prepared to confront a pandemic. The state of the country’s health care system was primitive by modern standards. In Pittsburgh, a city teeming with factories and industrial workers, the poor quality of air contributed to widespread, devastating respiratory problems. Even before the influenza set in, rates of pneumonia reached heights of 253 deaths per 100,000—appalling figures that outstripped every city except New York. In 1923 the Mellon Foundation found that unregulated soot and ash from factories was destroying the health of workers and their families, a condition that many other communities also faced. As well, Pittsburgh had no health infrastructure of which to speak: just 20 community hospitals, some staffed by only one nurse, with an acute shortage of beds. The housing stock was also poor, with most working-class residents crammed into tenements that, under the right circumstances, were petri dishes for disease. They were better off than the 50,000 residents who lived in rooming houses, where they not only shared rooms with perfect strangers but also beds, which they occupied in shifts. Rural America was hardly better equipped to weather the storm than big cities. In the 1920s and early 1930s, researchers would discover the scourge of Southern poverty that left large swaths of the population poorly nourished and afflicted with common parasites and disease. No less than their urban counterparts, the residents of small towns and country communities were physically compromised even before the influenza took hold. In the absence of calm and steady leadership from the top, there was no shortage of hucksters standing by, ready to profit from fear. One Dr. Franklin Duane gave interviews and ran advertisements for a fake home remedy (“Dr. Pierce’s Pleasant Pellets”), arguing that “the more you fear the disease, the surer you are to get it.” Dr. Bell’s Pine Tar Honey, Schenck’s Mandrake Pills, Beecham’s Pills and Miller’s Antiseptic Snake Oil also promised protection or relief from the flu. “When [Vick’s] VapoRub is applied over the throat and chest,” one wide-circulation ad informed readers, “the medicated vapors loosen the phlegm, open the air passages and stimulate the mucus membrane to throw off the germs.” Ordinary people could be forgiven a certain level of gullibility, notwithstanding very real advances in medicine and science that rendered such snake oil ads suspect. But in many localities, they resisted closures and quarantines with as much gusto as the owners of stores, saloons, theaters and restaurants. Neither did they segregate themselves at first indication of infection. In Seattle, according to a local newspaper, “every worker who sniffles is shot with [a] serum … they blow their noses and return to work,” despite entreaties from city health officials that they stay home. After the mayor unwisely suggested that if people observed the quarantine and closure rules, “the epidemic would be ended in five days,” residents began flouting the restrictions entirely. After all, if the mayor wasn’t concerned, why should they be? On one afternoon, when a “trophy train” packed with memorabilia parked itself downtown, thousands of Seattle citizens congregated for nine hours to inspect its wares. We don’t yet know how severe a toll COVID-19 will take on the United States. But we do know a lot. As in 1918, the White House and federal administration have been hopelessly ineffectual —even worse, irrelevant to the national response. Donald Trump’s stature as president appears to shrink with every passing hour. He wasn’t even able to deliver a factually correct speech to the nation while reading off a teleprompter.  As in 1918, state and local officials have responded in widely varying ways. Some, like Republican Governor Mike DeWine of Ohio and Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, have stepped up forcefully to compensate for the glaring incompetency of the Trump administration. Others, like Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who dithered in closing bars, restaurants and schools and even yesterday visited his own gym in defiance of every sound expert reccomendation—or Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt and California Congressman Devin Nunes, Republicans who encouraged people to ignore the closures and self-quarantines—have likely endangered thousands of fellow Americans. As in 1918, cities have been slow to impose the types of sacrifices and hardships on local businesses and ordinary people that might have slowed the spread of the disease and thereby flattened the curve. And too many ordinary people have flouted the advice of medical experts until faced with blunt police force. As in 1918, the gaps in America’s health care infrastructure are potentially deadly. Every red state governor or legislator who refused the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid reimbursement has burdened its citizens with rural and small-town hospital closures. Their communities are unprepared for this disease. Many of their citizens suffer respiratory or immunodeficiency diseases that went untreated and have rendered them more susceptible to COVID-19. The absence of universal health coverage has contributed to poorer health, generally, and will likely encourage people everywhere, in red and blue states alike, to ration health care in precisely the moment when they should not.  There was a lot we could have learned from the example of 1918, but didn’t. There’s still more we can learn. It’s a critical week in America, and now more than ever, a little history might be just what the doctor ordered.","Rampant Lies, Fake Cures and Not Enough Beds: What the Spanish Flu Debacle Can Teach Us About Coronavirus",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/spanish-flu-lessons-coronavirus-133888,politico
"The Chinese government announced Tuesday it would yank the press credentials for reporters of major U.S. news outlets, further escalating tensions between the two countries in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic which originated there.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that journalists from The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal whose reporting credentials expire this year will have four days to notify Department of Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 10 days to turn in their press passes.  “They will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions,” the announcement says.  The move comes weeks after the White House moved to limit the number of Chinese citizens who could work in the U.S. for several Chinese state-controlled outlets and ordered them to register as foreign missions. The foreign ministry admitted in Tuesday's statement that the moves are retaliatory, calling the Trump administration's restrictions “expulsion in all but name.” In addition to the three U.S. outlets facing expulsion, Chinese authorities announced that two more U.S. news organizations — Voice of America and Time Magazine — will be designated as “foreign missions” and required to turn over information regarding their “staff, finance, operation and real estate in China.”  Tensions between the global superpowers, already at a peak due to ongoing trade disputes, have spiked in recent months in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The disease, which originated in Wuhan, China at the end of last year, has now spread across the globe and in the past several weeks has forced U.S. leaders to take drastic measures in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.",China to expel journalists from 3 U.S. outlets ,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/china-to-expel-journalists-from-3-us-outlets-134170,politico
"President Donald Trump denied Tuesday that he has adopted a more dire tone in confronting the coronavirus crisis, insisting that he always took the public health emergency seriously despite several past dismissive remarks regarding the threat it posed to Americans. Speaking at the White House coronavirus task force’s daily press briefing, the president was questioned by reporters about his mood at Monday’s news conference, when he struck a graver note relative to his previous appearances discussing the burgeoning outbreak. “I didn’t think — I mean, I have seen that, where people actually liked it,” Trump said Tuesday of the response to his more sober-seeming public-facing demeanor.  “But I didn’t feel different,” he continued. “I’ve always known this is a real — this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” The president has been criticized over the course of several weeks for repeatedly minimizing the coronavirus threat, while public health officials within his administration have issued urgent warnings as to the risk the disease posed to the nation. In his first statements on the coronavirus in late January, Trump said the United States had it “totally under control” and tweeted days later that it “will all work out well.”  The president’s efforts to downplay the pandemic continued steadily until as recently as earlier this month. He accused the World Health Organization of producing an inaccurate mortality rate, falsely claimed that “anybody that wants a test can get a test,” and predicted that “it will go away. Just stay calm.” But the White House’s optimism seemed to dim significantly Monday, as the coronavirus continued to ravage communities and the federal government rolled out a new slate of stern guidelines intended to counter its rapid spread. Announcing the new measures, a subdued Trump lamented the “invisible enemy” facing Americans and acknowledged that “this is a very bad one.” The apparent shift in messaging coincided with the release of a report by British researchers estimating that as many as 2.2 million people in the U.S. could perish as a result of the coronavirus if drastic steps were not taken to fight its transmission. Addressing reporters Tuesday, however, the president argued that “there was no difference yesterday from days before” in his assessment of the coronavirus, and asserted that he had “always viewed it as very serious.” “I feel the tone is similar, but some people said it wasn’t,” he concluded.","Trump, who downplayed pandemic threat, says he ‘always viewed it as very serious’",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-shifting-coronavirus-tone-134100,politico
"Last-minute negotiations between Democratic leaders and the White House have downsized the scope of a paid leave program for workers affected by the coronavirus outbreak, angering some Democrats who see it as a major concession to the White House.  The House on Monday night approved a slate of last-minute “technical” corrections to a sweeping aid package, paving the way for swift adoption by the Senate. But several Democrats and progressive advocates say changes pushed by the White House are actually significant revisions to the bill’s paid leave program, undermining one of their top priorities in the package.  “I think the changes the Republicans insisted on made this far worse,” Rep. Stephanie Murphy, who has pushed for far more expansive paid sick and medical leave provisions in the package, said in an interview Tuesday.  “The intent of the package was to provide workers the support they needed to stay home and prevent the spread of this disease,” Murphy said, adding that Democrats would push to restore the provisions in future bills. “We have a chance to take another swing at it. My hope is that we can get Republicans to understand the public health rationale.”  The latest version of the bill, which the Senate is expected to pass this week, includes a major change to federal paid sick leave and family medical leave policy for affected workers, a program long championed by Democrats.  The legislation initially allowed workers up to 10 weeks of paid leave — as part of the federal family and medical leave program — for three different scenarios: if they become sick or are forced to be quarantined, if they are caring for a sick person, or if they are caring for a child whose school or daycare has been closed. Under the latest changes, however, there is only one category that qualifies for the extended family and medical leave: Individuals who are taking care of children.  Pelosi appeared to address the criticism from some in her caucus in a statement on Tuesday, in which she vowed to push for expanded paid leave in the next package. “As the House develops our third Families First package, we are working to advance additional steps to expand the emergency leave mandate,” Pelosi wrote, laying out several provisions, including allowing workers who are sick to access longer term leave.  Democratic negotiators have also stressed that the core tenet of the program — paid sick leave for 14 days — remains intact, potentially helping as many as 87 million people during the public health crisis.   Pelosi was also able to secure other victories in the bill, such as ensuring that individuals who take paid medical leave remain entitled to health care coverage from their employer, which the White House had proposed rolling back. Democrats also upped the size of a tax credit for businesses who continue to offer health coverage to their employees, helping to defray the costs.  Still, several Democrats have been privately livid at the changes to the paid leave program, which was approved when members were back in their districts. And Democratic lawmakers and aides say the concession may be all for naught now that Senate negotiators are talking about combining the House-passed bill with a third major stimulus package and passing it all as one measure this week.   Democrats have complained that they already made major concessions in talks with Mnuchin as they tried to clear the package with House Republicans. The paid sick leave plan envisioned by Democrats had initially been far more dramatic — an entirely new program run by the Social Security Administration. But Republicans had revolted, and eventually both sides agreed to instead bolster tax credits to help businesses expand existing programs.  Now, Democrats say, Mnuchin has again moved the goal posts in an attempt to sell the package to Senate Republicans, some of whom remain skeptical about the costs on small businesses.  “It drives me crazy that it's been sold as a technical change. It's not. It's a major change,” one Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations said. “We had already moved a couple miles from what we introduced. Now we're talking about different worlds. This is extremely narrow now. “  The most recent version of the bill has also sparked confusion over a provision allowing small businesses to obtain exemptions from providing paid leave. The Labor Department can issue regulations exempting certain companies with fewer than 50 employees from requirements that they offer paid family leave and paid sick leave — an apparent difference from the original legislation allowing exemptions from paid family leave only, advocates said.   ""We think that paid sick time and family leave are pretty essential ingredients in how we’re going to be able to manage this,"" said Amanda Ballantyne, the national director of small business advocacy group Main Street Alliance. ""Exempting employers of 50 and fewer exempts a massive part of our workforce.""  In another significant change, the corrected version of the bill eliminates a provision that would have prevented states from receiving greater federal Medicaid funding if those states checked beneficiaries' eligibility more than once a year.  Several states conduct such checks multiple times per year, meaning the initial version could have deprived them of crucial funding ahead of an expected surge of coronavirus patients.   Senate Democrats led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand are expected on Tuesday afternoon to unveil new legislation designed to expand paid leave to all American workers.",Democrats say Mnuchin squeezed paid sick leave program,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/sick-leave-coronavirus-package-congress-134101,politico
"The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration could scare their communities from seeking out care for coronavirus, potentially hastening the spread of a deadly outbreak that’s growing rapidly in the United States, advocates and public health groups are warning. Those serving immigrant populations have reported significant drop-offs in immigrants seeking health care during Donald Trump’s presidency over fears of his administration’s tough enforcement measures. Immigration advocates and health care providers in some parts of the country say there are signs the novel coronavirus is already spreading in immigrant communities, intensifying efforts to fortify the populations against the highly contagious disease. Marco Trujillo, who handles immigrant outreach for a health care coalition in Cincinnati, says he’s fielded questions on coronavirus from dozens of people in the past few days. At least two of those people told him they had symptoms consistent with the virus but refused his pleas to contact a doctor. “They didn’t want to go to the hospital because they are afraid, because of their immigration status,"" said Trujillo, a member of Cincinnati’s Central Community Health Board. “They don't even want to give their information to a doctor.” Democrats have steadily warned that Trump’s immigration policies could undermine efforts to detect and stamp out the virus that’s effectively shuttered large sections of American life. Joe Biden in Sunday night’s Democratic debate, decrying Trump’s policies, said even “xenophobic folks” should want undocumented immigrants to seek out care for coronavirus without fear of deportation. “It’s even in their interest that that woman come forward or that man come forward because it deals with keeping the spread from moving more rapidly,” Biden said. Mary’s Center, a Washington-area health care nonprofit predominately serving Latino immigrants, said it’s starting to see potential cases of coronavirus among its patients, though it’s still awaiting results on the limited number of tests they’ve run. Executive Director Maria Gomez said she’s less concerned the center’s patients will be afraid to access care — the center is known and trusted in the immigrant community — and worried more about economic upheaval that’s already affecting their hourly wage jobs. She worries pressures to stay employed and avoid scrutiny of immigration officials will push immigrants to keep working even if they’re infected, increasing the chance of spreading coronavirus to others. “How will they pay the rent?” Gomez said. “They’re afraid to go get any help now because they were just working very hard to make ends meet.” Some lawmakers have called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement to suspend immigration raids and arrests around hospitals and medical clinics amid the outbreak. The immigration enforcement agency, responding to concerns around coronavirus, said it ""does not conduct operations at medical facilities, except under extraordinary circumstances."" Public health experts say fears of seeking out care are very real among immigrants — and the clinicians who serve them. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist who studied a 2018 outbreak of mumps in an immigrant community in Pennsylvania, found the outbreak was exacerbated by dozens of people who were undocumented immigrants and legal immigrants without insurance avoiding medical care. Doctors in the area also hesitated to order lab tests or report potential cases out of concern their patients could be reported to immigration authorities. “The doctors had no intention of collecting immigration status, but they were nonetheless conflated with other government officials who did,” said Nuzzo, an associate professor at John Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. “That made it difficult for public health workers to learn how many cases there were and who had the disease.” Democratic officials meanwhile have also pushed the Trump administration to halt a new measure that could make it harder for legal immigrants to get a green card if they’ve used — or are deemed likely to use — safety net programs like Medicaid or food stamps. The revised so-called public charge rule, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect last month, had a chilling effect on legal immigrants seeking out care before it even took effect, advocates say. CDC Director Robert Redfield in Capitol Hill testimony last week acknowledged concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers that the public charge rule could discourage immigrants to get care. But other Trump administration officials have tried to tamp down those concerns. The Department of Homeland Security's immigration agency over the weekend updated its public charge webpage with an alert that ""encourages"" all immigrants with Covid-19 symptoms to seek medical care and said it won't count against their legal status. Still, the guidance — which was promised to lawmakers by Ken Cuccinelli, an immigration hardliner who heads the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services — notes that immigration officials must continue to look act use of certain public benefits, including ""those that may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-19"" when they're making a decision about a person's legal status. An agency spokesperson also said the policy isn't meant to discourage immigrants from seeking necessary care — although immigration advocates and health clinics have long said that’s a clear effect of the rule. The Trump administration had estimated 77,000 people were likely to forego Medicaid because of the public charge rule, but health experts predicted millions of people may drop public benefits out of fear they fall under stricter guidelines. Nearly half of the nation’s community health centers reported immigrants were refusing to enroll in Medicaid and some even dropped coverage amid confusion about the public charge rule, according to a survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation last fall. Some immigration advocates say there’s been little outreach from official channels on coronavirus geared toward immigrant communities. Those advocates, along with some states and local public health departments, have been trying to fill the gap. In the Texas county that includes the progressive-minded Austin, county officials have set up a coronavirus hotline at clinics that provide care to the uninsured and undocumented. “We are making sure everyone has access to quality care regardless of their citizenship status,” said Ted Burton, vice president of communications at Central Health. “As a community everybody has been really focused on response, prevention and education.”",Trump's immigration crackdown could hurt coronavirus containment efforts,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-immigration-coronavirus-134112,politico

"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday acknowledged that there are at least “a couple” of State Department employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus, an admission that comes as he faces pressure from inside and outside his workforce to be more forthcoming about the illness’ impact on his 75,000 staffers worldwide. Pompeo addressed the pandemic during a brief but wide-ranging press conference Tuesday afternoon, but offered few specifics and only after repeated questions. The coronavirus crisis is forcing U.S. diplomats to scramble to help Americans affected overseas while also concerning them for their own safety. “We've had a couple of employees, count them on one hand, who have positive tests,“ Pompeo told reporters at the State Department headquarters in Washington. He did not say where the employees were working, but insisted that the department is handling the cases according to health guidelines.  The department has said it is aware of reports that least one U.S. embassy employee, in Jamaica, has contracted the COVID-19 virus, but otherwise it has divulged little else. A State Department official familiar with the issue, however, told POLITICO there are several other confirmed cases at posts overseas, but none yet in Washington. State Department spokespeople have not offered comment. Frustration with State’s handling of the issue is growing both internally and externally.  Lawmakers and staffers are raising questions about why Pompeo has not been more up front about his workforce’s cases of the virus, while also expressing concerns about a lack of uniform guidance from Pompeo on how employees should adjust their work habits.  The department “has not put forth a coordinated, robust response, which I fear puts the health of its own employees at further risk, and further jeopardizes the health and well-being of the American people,” Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a letter to Pompeo dated Monday.  Eric Rubin, president of the American Foreign Service Association, the diplomats’ union, also called for transparency. “We would urge that the administration share all information that is available so that our people have a clear sense of what the dangers are and what they need to do to be safe,” he said.  Pompeo said during his Tuesday news conference that the department has taken “many measures” to protect its workforce, referring to “some 15 guidelines“ along with placing limits on travel. But he declined to go into the “intricacies“ of the department’s actions. Some State Department staffers have privately complained that they’ve not heard more from Pompeo directly on the issue. The internal communication and messaging have been delegated largely to other top State Department officials, who have essentially told various bureau leaders and ambassadors to issue their own guidance to their staffers on whether to work remotely or take other measures to reduce the virus’ potential spread.  “The result is inconsistency,” one State Department employee said.  Prior to Tuesday, Pompeo had addressed the virus in at least one way for his employees: his occasional newsletter. In a recent “Message from Mike,” he offered vague praise at the top for how the “team” has come together to face the crisis. But the message contained no specifics about the virus’s impact on the department itself. Pompeo spent much of the press conference Tuesday addressing other aspects of the coronavirus, including bashing how Iran has handled the crisis in its borders. Pompeo has been a champion of President Donald Trump’s maximum pressure policy toward Iran, which involves heavily sanctioning the Islamist regime there. Those economic sanctions, some critics argue, have hampered Iran’s ability to react to the virus ravaging its population. Pompeo, however, disagreed, arguing that the U.S. anti-Iran campaign allows for humanitarian aid and saying it was the regime’s incompetence and corruption that was fueling the coronavirus crisis. “The Iranian regime is an accomplice,” he said. Pompeo also used the term “Wuhan virus” during the news conference, in a jab at China, where officials have been suggesting, with zero evidence, that the coronavirus may have originated from the United States. Wuhan is the city that has been the epicenter of the virus in China.",Pompeo faces internal questions about his handling of the coronavirus,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/mike-pompeo-coronavirus-134006,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that the Trump administration was considering offsetting the economic burden of the coronavirus pandemic by “immediately” cutting checks to Americans. Mnuchin, speaking at a White House press conference, did not say how much money Americans could potentially expect to receive, and indicated that the administration could seek to exclude those who are well-off from receiving payments. “We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin told reporters. “Americans need cash now, and the president wants to get cash now — and I mean now in the next two weeks.” Mnuchin indicated that the president’s preference for a payroll tax holiday — a six- to eight-month process — would take too long to put money into Americans’ pockets. “The president has instructed me we have to do this now. So this is now,” Mnuchin said. “This is stuff that needs to be done now. The president has instructed me that this is no fault to American workers. For medical reasons, we are shutting down parts of this economy, and we are going to use all the tools we have.” Governors across the country have closed restaurants, bars and other venues across their states as public health officials continue to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. The White House released new guidelines Monday encouraging people not gather in groups larger than 10, work and take classes from home as much possible and avoid dining in bars, restaurants and food courts. President Donald Trump discussed on a call with restaurant executives Tuesday morning the important role drive-thru and delivery options can play as Americans adjust to their new normal while the nation grapples with the global pandemic. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 5,000 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., though experts expect that number to rise as more testing is made available. More than 90 people have died. Mnuchin, who left the White House briefing early for meetings on Capitol Hill, said he would preview the plan at a lunch with Senate Republicans. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has proposed sending every American $1,000 and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas has signaled support for a similar proposal to provide immediate economic relief to American families. “I think it’s clear we don’t need to send people who make $1 million a year checks,” Mnuchin said. “That’s one of the ideas that we like. We’re going to preview that today, and then we’ll be talking about details afterwards.”  Mnuchin also announced that Treasury would defer an additional $100 billion in Internal Revenue Service payments, bringing the total to $300 billion. Individuals can defer up to $1 million, Mnuchin said, while corporations can defer up to $10 million. The deferments are interest- and penalty-free for 90 days. Still, Mnuchin encouraged as many Americans as possible to file their taxes by the April 15 deadline to ensure those who are eligible receive their refunds in a timely manner. “We don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” he said. “We want you to make sure you get them. Many people do this electronically, which is easy for them and easy for the IRS.” It’s also possible that trading hours could be reduced at the nation’s stock markets given the economic damage of the coronavirus, Mnuchin said, cautioning that the goal was to keep exchanges open to maintain confidence. While stocks edged upward early in the afternoon Tuesday, repeated selloffs in recent weeks have raised the question of whether exchanges will remain open as the damage continues. “Americans need to know they have access to their money,” Mnuchin said. But “we may get to a point where we shorten the hours if that’s something they need to do.” Trump, whose rhetoric and tone has notably shifted in recent days to reflect the the seriousness of the situation, claimed he always knew “this was real — this was a pandemic,” despite repeatedly downplaying the threat of the coronavirus. He also acknowledged that there could be a 100 percent chance the coronavirus plunges the nation into a recession. “It could be,” he said, insisting he doesn’t think in terms of recession or not. “When we are finished with the virus, we will win. When that victory takes place, our economy will go through the roof. It is so pent up, so built up, it is so ready to go in an upward duration. We have to knock out this enemy.” Toby Eckert and Kellie Mejdrich contributed to this report.",Mnuchin: 'We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately',2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/coronavirus-government-payments-checks-133994,politico
"The global airline industry on Tuesday intensified its call for urgent government help amid the coronavirus crisis, as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin heads to Capitol Hill to pitch senators on a massive stimulus plan that’s expected to include billions of dollars to prop up U.S. airlines. The CEO of the International Air Transport Association on Tuesday predicted that the airline industry globally would need $150 billion to $200 billion in government assistance. “We are obviously in an extraordinary time, a terrible crisis — one of the most severe we have ever had — and so we have asked governments to take extraordinary measures,” Alexandre de Juniac said on a call with reporters. Governments have already taken steps like waiving “use-it-or-lose-it” slot rules for certain airports, he noted, but IATA wants them to “implement much broader financial support” packages that include direct financial assistance, loans or tax relief. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution.” On Monday, the trade group representing major U.S. airlines requested almost $60 billion in grants and loans, as well as tax relief, saying the industry is facing a situation “much worse” than after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. So far, the administration appears to be readying a stimulus plan worth at least $850 billion. Nothing is set in stone, but it will include around $50 billion for the U.S. airline industry, likely a combination of direct assistance and loan guarantees. “If we want to maintain a strong [global] airline sector able to cope with this difficult crisis, but able also to provide the resources to ensure that the recovery will happen in due time … we need government to act strongly and quickly,” de Juniac said Tuesday, also warning that the crisis may lead to consolidation. Brian Pearce, IATA’s chief economist, said the outbreak is “covering markets which represent … 94 percent of global passenger revenue, so this is now impacting the entirety of air transport.” “In many cases, demand … for the business of many airlines has fallen to zero,” Pearce said, adding that new travel restrictions are exacerbating damage already caused by the outbreak. Earlier this month, IATA said there could be up to $113 billion in passenger revenue losses this year worldwide. The group didn’t provide an updated estimate Tuesday, but Pearce said the numbers are “clearly worse than this, particularly in Europe and particularly in the Americas.” As their revenues are taking a hit, “the vast majority” of carriers around the world “have high levels of debt,” Pearce noted, which is resulting in a “liquidity crisis.” At the beginning of the year, “more or less 75 percent of the airlines that we looked at … had less than three months of cash and equivalents” to cover fixed costs. “Even before COVID, the industry was in a fairly fragile position,” Pearce said. “Only 30 airlines drove the improvement in profitability that we saw in the last 10 years. There was a long tail of airlines with much more fragile finances.” U.S. airports largely back U.S. airlines' request for cash, and are asking separately for $10 billion in aid — a number based on an expected 40 percent drop in revenues. “We need to be a part of whatever it is Congress and the administration try to get done here in the near term,” Joel Bacon, a lobbyist for the American Association of Airport Executives, told reporters on a call Tuesday afternoon. “We are quickly reaching a crisis point at airports across the country.” AAAE wants the $10 billion to “be made available to airports as quickly as possible and with as few strings attached as possible.” Bacon noted that airports have $100 billion in collective debt, and that $7 billion in debt and interest payments are due by the end of 2020. “I’m not suggesting that airports are going to shut down,” Bacon added. “What we are worried about is the ability to meet ongoing operational concerns and to pay for ongoing projects and existing debt.”",Airlines intensify calls for up to $200B in government aid worldwide,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/airlines-intensify-calls-for-up-to-200b-in-government-aid-worldwide-133824,politico
"President Donald Trump punched back on Tuesday against criticism from Democratic governors critical of his administration's coronavirus response, wading into his familiar political spats as the White House looks to combat a pandemic. Trump referred to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as the ""failing Michigan governor"" on Monday and lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo after his calls for stepped up federal assistance. Minutes later, he heaped praise on his own administration for ""working very well with the Governors and State officials."" While Cuomo, Whitmer and other governors have been among the most vocal critics of the federal coronavirus response, they have been far from alone. The Trump administration has come under a steady drumbeat of scrutiny over its inability to quickly ramp up coronavirus testing capabilities as well as its weekslong rhetorical campaign to downplay the virus' threat to Americans. Only recently has the president reversed course in his own public utterances to warn the public about the severity of the pandemic's threat. Although Trump and Cuomo sparred Tuesday on social media, it appeared the two made amends after a morning phone call. Not long after Cuomo praised the Trump administration for being ""responsive"" at a press conference on Tuesday, Trump told reporters at the White House press briefing that they were both ""doing a really good job."" ""We had a very good talk,"" Trump said. ""I think we are right there on the same track. It's going to be very successful."" But Trump didn't let up on Whitmer during Tuesday's press briefing — defending his attacks on the Michigan governor.  ""I only do that when I have to respond,"" the president said in response to a question about his criticism of Whitmer and other high profile Democrats. ""She said that will something that was false, and therefore I did do that, and I will continue to do that. If they're not going to play fair because, you know, they have the media on their side. I don't. I just have me. And if they are not going to play fair, I'm going to do that. If they are going to play fair, there's going to be nobody better than Donald Trump in terms of bipartisanship.""  The president's criticism of Whitmer on Tuesday was triggered by her appearance on MSNBC, where she said her state is working to flatten the curve by closing restaurants and bars after a federal government response that did not take the outbreak “seriously early enough.” She also outlined her plan to expand unemployment benefits as workers lose jobs and are forced to stay home amid the pandemic.  “The federal government did not take this seriously early enough, and now it is on us to make sure we’re doing everything we can based on the best facts and science available and that we are always putting the health of our people front and center,” Whitmer said on MSNBC. Trump soon after tweeted that the Michigan governor ""must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!” During a White House news briefing on Monday, the president also suggested that state leaders work to obtain medical equipment like respirators and ventilators on their own because of the slow federal process — a suggestion Whitmer called ""mind-boggling.""  “We need federal support. Like I said, we’re pulling out all the stops and reaching out to our partners in the private sector,” Whitmer said. “We’re going to do everything we can to supplement. But it’s not to the exclusion of federal support. We need the federal government to ramp up and to get this done.”  The president's feud with Cuomo, which bubbled up again Tuesday, has simmered for days amid back-and-forth criticism between the two men over the Trump administration's coronavirus response. The New York governor has repeatedly called for more federal help, to which Trump has replied that it is Cuomo who needs to do more. On Tuesday, the president accused Cuomo of playing politics with his criticism of the administration and suggested that a blanket federal policy of the type that some have called for would not be appropriate. ""Cuomo wants ‘all states to be treated the same.’ But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all,"" Trump tweeted, referring to the novel coronavirus by a controversial name that some in his administration have adopted. ""New York is a very big ‘hotspot’, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it.”  Trump ended his tirade against the governors with the tweet praising the federal government’s work with state and local officials, promising that “Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS.”",Trump lashes out at Dem governors amid coronavirus coordination,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-whitmer-cuomo-coronavirus-response-133716,politico
"The White House and Senate Republicans are considering melding together a House-passed coronavirus aid bill with President Donald Trump's request for $850 billion in stimulus spending, creating one massive aid package that the Senate could pass this week.   The thinking, as described by Senate Republican leadership aides and several Trump administration aides, is that one large-scale package would be easier to push through the Senate immediately. The downside is the House would have to also approve the package, and the House is in recess with no current plan to return.   But since some Senate Republicans were aiming to amend the House bill anyway, they don't see much practical or political risk.   Another concern for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other senior Republicans is a practical one — if they let the Senate adjourn following passage of the ""Phase 2"" House bill, it may be logistically difficult to get senators back to Washington once they go home because of travel hurdles. Airline service has been severely disrupted so far, and situation may worsen. In addition, if one or more senators contract the virus, returning to Washington may prove impossible.  But the idea of combing two stimulus packages will, undoubtedly, create a massive legislative rush this week in the midst of a national health crisis that has brought the nation to a standstill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is slated to attend the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday afternoon, where he is expected to discuss this plan.   The White House Tuesday morning began signaling it was aiming for $850 billion in stimulus spending, split between a payroll tax cut, support for the airline industry and $250 billion in loans for small business.   ""I don’t know how it happens exactly yet. I know that 'Phase Two' will kind of be the baseline approach and then we’ll try and go from there,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) on Tuesday.   ""There’s a third iteration that we’re working on and how it gets across the floor and back to the House remains to be seen. I mean they could move separately, but maybe there’s a way we combine it,” he said.  The House passed the $100 billion-plus ""Phase 2"" stimulus bill on late Friday night, but then had to amend the package Monday with significant ""technical corrections"" following discussions between Mnuchin, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).   The revised legislation — which provides paid sick days and emergency leave to workers who are ill or have family members with coronavirus — is set to be taken up the Senate this week.   Several senior Democratic aides said combining the two packages into one would be a nonstarter in the House without significant concessions.  House Democratic leaders are already dealing with rank-and-file anger over a “technical corrections” bill the House passed late Monday that actually included a significant rewrite to the paid leave language in a major concession to the White House. The change — which would allow more businesses to seek exemptions from offering their employees paid leave — was pushed by administration officials as necessary to get the bill through the Senate, according to multiple sources. But now, if the House-passed bill is combined with a huge economic package, they didn’t even need to make that major change, House Democratic aides argued.  Pelosi appeared to address the criticism from some in her caucus in a statement on Tuesday, in which she vowed to push for expanded paid leave in the next package.  ""As the House develops our third Families First package, we are working to advance additional steps to expand the emergency leave mandate,"" Pelosi wrote, laying out several provisions, including allowing workers who are sick to access longer term leave.  In addition, several Democrats said the payroll tax cut was still a nonstarter, citing tepid support for the idea even among Republicans. And they threw cold water on the idea of just cutting checks to people, saying the bureaucracy needed to implement such a massive program could delay payments for weeks if not longer.  “All this stuff can come together fairly quickly,” said one Democrat involved in the negotiations. “The question is what are ideas that can come together fairly quickly? Something new like direct payments to people isn’t feasible.”  Democratic aides said they were instead looking at other ways to pad people’s wallets by expanding credits already written into the tax code.

"Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, has tested negative for coronavirus, a party spokesman announced on Wednesday, just days after she displayed flu-like symptoms following a trip to Mar-a-Lago. “On the advice of her doctor, @GOPChairwoman was administered a test for COVID-19. That test has fortunately come back negative,” Michael Ahrens, the RNC communications director, posted on Twitter. McDaniel had come down with symptoms on Friday after attending a fundraiser at President Donald Trump’s private club in Florida last week. A number of officials and foreign visitors had exhibited symptoms after visiting the club in the past month. Trump hosted a delegation from Brazil, including President Jair Bolsonaro, at the club last week, a number of whom tested positive for coronavirus and had direct contact with Trump. The White House physician, Dr. Sean Conley, announced last Friday that a person seated at Trump’s dining table had tested positive, but that the risk of infection was low for the president. Trump tested negative for the virus, the White House announced on Saturday morning. Bolsonaro posted on Facebook that he had also tested negative for the virus. Several of Trump’s closest associates and aides have gone into self-quarantine after coming in contact with the Brazilian delegation or otherwise engaging with people at Mar-a-Lago.

"Bernie Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, sought to pre-empt questions about Sanders’ future by sending a statement to reporters Wednesday morning implying he has no immediate plans to drop out.  It didn’t work as planned. Instead, after the Vermont senator lost Florida, Illinois and Arizona by double digits, he spent his Wednesday shooting down rumors about his campaign folding, canceling all of his digital ad spending, and lashing out at a reporter who asked about what he often refers to as “political gossip.” Sanders’ campaign had hoped he could pull off an upset in just one state that voted on Tuesday. Having fallen short of that mark, Shakir’s statement attempted to buy some time for the campaign as it assessed its future. “The next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,” he said. “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.” In an email to supporters, Shakir was even more blunt. “No sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted,” he said. After likely voting on coronavirus legislation, he said, Sanders would fly from Washington to his home in Burlington, Vt., where he would ""begin holding conversations with supporters to get input and assess the path forward for our campaign."" One ally whom Sanders’ campaign reached out to Tuesday was Scott Slawson, president of the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America Local 506, which has worked closely with the campaign. Slawson spoke at Sanders’ kickoff rally last March, and Sanders talked about his union members at a CNN town hall. He argued Sanders should stay in the race. “There’s still a lot of states that got to weigh in. I think you got to do your due diligence and stay in till the end at this point,” he said. “I know that he’s got a pretty big following in Pennsylvania. There’s a lot of delegates still hanging out there.” Even so, Sanders’ nosedive has led to intense questioning from the media about the future of his campaign, culminating in an inaccurate report on Axios that said he was suspending it. And the wall of pressure from centrist Democrats to abandon his bid for the White House has only intensified after his losses Tuesday. Both factors are likely to aggravate Sanders, who has long brawled with moderates and the news media. “This campaign’s over. He needs to acknowledge that and be gracious about it,” said Matt Bennett, co-founder of the center-left think tank Third Way. “Not only for party unity, which is up to him, but just for the sake of humanity, it would be better for him to wrap this up.” As he weighs his options, many of Sanders’ aides and allies are urging him to press forward, even if it is nearly impossible to win the nomination at this point. They see a benefit for him in trying to push Joe Biden to the left and continuing to grow the progressive movement. “The campaign is so useful for building lists, leadership and organizational infrastructure that I think it’d be a big blow for the left if he dropped out any time before the convention,” a Sanders aide said. David Segal, executive director of the progressive group Demand Progress, co-wrote a Wednesday op-ed that argued Sanders should not drop out. He said he was speaking for himself and not the organization. “The alternative is an intentional, monthslong process where Bernie and Biden actually come to a deeper consensus and unity around a set of issues and especially around personnel,” he told POLITICO. “It’s important that you actually have a coming-together that feels more real than the last one in 2016.” Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the progressive political action committee Democracy for America, said that while Sanders’ path to the nomination is “significantly steeper” after Tuesday, “the reality is this is a contest that has changed overnight repeatedly throughout the entire primary, and no one really knows what’s going to happen moving forward.” Sanders, he said, had time to figure out his next steps: “The next contest isn’t for weeks, so I think we’ve got a lot of time.” Sanders’ staffers did not provide a time frame on when he would make his decision. Mike Casca, Sanders’ communications director, said “his head really is in the coronavirus response.” Sanders’ concern with the pandemic sweeping the world was evident on Wednesday, when he snapped at a reporter who asked about timing on his decision. “I’m dealing with a f---ing global crisis,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. ""Right now, I'm trying to do my best to make sure that we don't have an economic meltdown and that people don't die. Is that enough for you to keep me busy for today?"" On Wednesday, Sanders’ campaign canceled all digital ads, including online fundraising spots he launched just on Tuesday. Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ senior adviser, insisted that they pulled the ads because it is unclear when the next primaries will be held as states postpone elections because of the coronavirus. “We make ad spending decisions based on many criteria,” he said. “One of the most important is when the election in a state is happening because advertising is most effective closer to Election Day. Primary dates are all moving back and our ad spending reflects that.” Other presidential candidates who have pulled their advertising and said they were reevaluating their campaigns have often withdrawn within hours. But at least one hasn’t followed that path: Sanders. In April 2016, his senior strategist, Tad Devine, said Sanders was reassessing his campaign after a string of losses to Hillary Clinton made it virtually impossible for him to win the nomination. A day later, his campaign announced that it was laying off hundreds of staff and zeroing in on winning delegate-rich California. This year, Sanders does not have California to look forward to after he won the Golden State on Super Tuesday. But his aides have thought he would have a good chance in New York, which casts ballots on April 28 and already has Sanders staff. As a son of Brooklyn, the state also holds an emotional significance for him. But 2020 and 2016 are different in important ways. Sanders personally likes Biden and badly wants to defeat Trump. Because of the coronavirus epidemic, Sanders also cannot hold the large rallies that project excitement and energy, and that he personally enjoys. While the result on Tuesday further deflated Sanders’ supporters, progressives surveying the map nevertheless found one major sign of progress in their movement. As Sanders was getting shellacked in Illinois, incumbent Rep. Dan Lipinski, a Democrat known for his opposition to abortion rights and Obamacare, was felled by Marie Newman, a progressive who supports Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Unlike Sanders, Newman was able to unite left-wing activists like the Justice Democrats and more traditional liberal groups such as EMILY’s List. She also carried Sanders’ endorsement. “This is now the third incumbent that has been beaten by a Justice Democrats progressive in the last cycle and a half,” said Rebecca Katz, a progressive consultant who advised Cynthia Nixon in her primary campaign against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2018. “It’s a big win, and it also shows what happens when the left comes together.”","Bernie’s rough day after

"House Democrats are drafting a new stimulus bill to address the coronavirus pandemic — legislation designed as their counter-offer to a trillion-dollar package currently being assembled in the Republican-controlled Senate.  On a private call Wednesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi directed her leadership team and committee chairs to begin further efforts to address the looming economic disaster caused by the growing coronavirus crisis.  The House Democratic plan will incorporate proposals from several panels and is expected to include additional unemployment insurance payments, expanded Medicaid coverage, an airline rescue package, relief for homeowners and renters, support for small businesses, and additional food security measures, according to Democratic lawmakers and aides.  “Time is of the essence, and the House will move swiftly to protect public health and provide relief for the American people,” Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday.   Each House committee will submit their own plans to Pelosi, who will compile a large-scale relief package in the coming days. Pelosi and her top deputies plan to review the ideas with Democrats — who are working from their districts this week — on a conference call Thursday afternoon.  Democratic sources cautioned, however, that their proposal won’t be formally finished until next week. And it’s still unclear if Pelosi intends to bring the House back to vote or just use the Democratic initiative as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Senate and President Donald Trump.  At times, the call showed the stress facing even lawmakers, as they attempt to hammer out next steps: Pelosi and House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), for instance, had a tense exchange during the call over whether the 2008 Wall Street bailout focused too heavily on big banks and not enough on average Americans, a point both lawmakers made, according to multiple sources who were listening. A source close to Pelosi downplayed the exchange.  Pelosi’s move comes as House Democrats have essentially been locked out of high-stakes negotiations over the so-called “Phase 3” coronavirus relief package. The White House — through Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — and top Senate Republicans are rushing to draft a trillion-dollar measure that will help keep airlines and small businesses afloat. Mnuchin and Senate Republicans are also considering a $500 billion plan to send direct cash payments to millions of Americans. The Kentucky Republican is hoping to unveil a GOP position on this new package as early as Thursday, and then enter into discussions with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Senate Democrats have floated their own $750 billion economic package that includes hundreds of billions in spending to help Americans in economic distress.  McConnell has made clear he wants to deal with Schumer alone, not both Democratic leaders.   ""I anticipate what I've said repeatedly, which is we're in a process of deciding exactly where we are and where the administration is — and then we obviously intend to sit down with Sen. Schumer,"" McConnell told CNN. ""And I'm sure he will keep the speaker in the loop and we'll move to getting a bipartisan agreement.""  Speaking to her leadership team, Pelosi argued that the “fastest way to get a third package finished by early next week” is for all four senior congressional leaders to sit down and negotiate together, according to an aide on the call. Schumer also made the same argument on the Senate floor Wednesday.  Pelosi is in a race against time as McConnell and GOP leaders have vowed to move the third tranche of recovery legislation through the Senate at “warp speed.” McConnell needs 60 votes to pass any legislation, and House Democrats are concerned he could pick off some Senate Democrats and move a bill through that chamber that they don’t support — leaving them in a difficult position both politically and policy wise.  Pelosi spoke to both Mnuchin and McConnell separately on Tuesday about the next package. But McConnell has rejected Pelosi’s idea of a “four corners” negotiation that includes the quartet of party leaders in both chambers. Schumer has also called for a “four corners” negotiation.  Democratic sources with knowledge of Pelosi’s move said it’s important that they lay down a marker of what proposals the House will and won’t accept, even if they’re not directly in the room with McConnell.   Even Senate Democrats have complained that they’ve been boxed out of the talks in the early stages of legislation that is likely to exceed a trillion dollars. “Republicans have not consulted any Democrats as to what we want in there,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said during a press conference on Wednesday, when asked about the state of talks on the third package. “Right now, they are doing this from their side only.”  The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a multi-billion-dollar aid bill that moved through the House last week. The bill, known as “Phase 2,” expands safety net programs including paid sick leave, unemployment insurance and food assistance to help Americans impacted by the coronavirus. Congress previously passed legislation to bolster the public health system.  Pelosi has said the House and Senate should consider refundable tax credits, expanded unemployment insurance and direct payments. But the California Democrat has been firm that any of the proposals “MUST be targeted,” her spokesman Drew Hammill wrote on Twitter this week.  Pelosi led the negotiations on the second bill, consulting with Mnuchin dozens of times via phone last week as the two worked to quickly hammer out the legislation. McConnell deferred to Mnuchin on the talks but has taken control of the negotiations of the latest legislation.  Congressional leaders are hoping to act quickly to pass the “Phase 3” package both to try to steady the financial markets, which continue to be in a tailspin as the long-term impacts of the virus remain unknown, and to limit the potential exposure lawmakers have to the coronavirus. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) announced Wednesday he had become the first lawmaker to test positive with the virus.",Pelosi looks to lay down marker on next stimulus plan,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/nancy-pelosi-coronavirus-stimulus-plan-136142,politico
"Probably for most of us, the coronavirus crisis will soon enough—Six months? A year?—recede in our minds and come to seem like a hallucinatory moment. Maybe it will be like a hurricane that forced everyone to rush inland and then only glanced the coast.  Or maybe it will be like a hurricane that really does hit. Even then, human nature being what it is, most people will clean up and move on. Yet no matter how the coronavirus pandemic passes, or how quickly, there is likely in these strange housebound weeks a new political epoch being born. There are two large reasons to believe the political echo of this crisis will last much longer than the crisis itself. The first is that many of the people whose expectations and routines are most dramatically upended by the pandemic are students. The interruption, and in some cases irreplaceable loss, of important experiences in their education, as campuses empty and untold events are canceled, will likely shape their consciousness in more lasting ways than for the rest of us. Like most catastrophes, the pandemic’s malign consequences will fall most heavily on the underprivileged. Unlike most catastrophes, its costs are also being paid heavily by some segments of the most privileged. Those college seniors whose spring terms and graduation ceremonies are suddenly deleted include many people who are future leaders of the public and private sectors. No, it’s not the end of the world for them. But it’s a piercing loss even so—one being paid more for the benefit of older, less healthy people than for pure self-protection. More profoundly, the dynamics of the coronavirus moment likely will resemble the dynamics of other great public policy issues shadowing the next generation. In particular, the global pandemic and the harsh choices it imposes offer—in highly concentrated fashion in coming months—much the same choices that responses to global climate change will impose in coming decades. Like the coronavirus emergency, climate change is a problem whose dimensions are largely the province of scientific experts—employing complex data models aimed at illuminating future trends that the average citizen can understand in broad concept but not in detail. The essential question: Do you trust these experts, or not? Like the coronavirus, climate change is a problem for which remedies are not solely the province of experts but are primarily the realm of community values. These remedies involve tangible and immediate costs for benefits that are abstract and imponderable.  In the case of coronavirus, for instance, the shutdown of the economy required by enforcing social distancing imposes costs that are immediate and quite likely already in your midst—layoffs of someone you know, uncertainty about future income, concern for a favorite neighborhood business about to go under. As to the benefits, meanwhile, no one knows—certainly not now, maybe not ever. Perhaps the massive response won’t really be effective and a public health catastrophe unfolds anyway. Or maybe the response in retrospect will seem overblown. In the case of climate change, the tension between immediate certain consequences—whether paying a carbon tax or substantially altering consumption habits—for diffuse and distant benefits is more acute. The rewards for the deep and comprehensive changes needed to replace a carbon-fueled economy and halt the warming of the planet will be enjoyed—one hopes—primarily by people not yet born. Finally, of course, coronavirus is like climate change in the sense that it is impervious to national borders. One way to gauge the power of these currents—crisis fueled by frightening science—is by watching the change in President Donald Trump. There is no way to know for certain what the coronavirus means for his reelection. But already it is evident what it has meant for Trumpism. It has sent it hurtling into retreat. Trumpism as an idea is about promoting and protecting American sovereignty and singularity. In some contexts, even Trump foes might agree it’s an attractive concept: Well might we wish to seal our borders from the virus. But the only way this would be effective would be if the United States had years ago opted to adjourn from the modern interconnected global economy. Yes, the coronavirus first presented itself in China. How many people were surprised to learn only in the past few weeks that nearly all U.S. antibiotics also come from China. Trumpism as a style is defined not just by boasting and bluster; his triumphalism depends on projecting certitude. The president early on acted as if he could indeed create reality by proclamation, when he assured the public that U.S. infections would soon be down to zero. Only in recent days, as the possibility of widespread domestic disease mounts, has Trump acknowledged imprecision—the fragmentary nature of our understanding of how far the virus has spread, how effective efforts to blunt its impact will be, or when these efforts will be deemed sufficient.  One way to appreciate the murkiness of our circumstances—and the moral implications of this murkiness—is to view them through the eyes of young people. No need to overstate things. Missing spring semester is not the same as dodging sniper fire in Kabul, nor the same as being laid off from your job handling bags at O’Hare.  But nor should one understate things. Suppose baseball has been your consuming passion since age 6 and now at 22 you are expecting one last idyll as team captain. Now that season will never happen. Maybe you were planning to spend the semester in Peru and are now scrambling to see if you can find a flight home. Planes and restaurants will fill up again. In all likelihood that semester abroad is gone for good. Psych 101 perhaps can be taken remotely; the exhilarating 1 a.m. conversation in the dorm lounge will not be.  Out of curiosity, I read various college and university presidents’ letters announcing the closure of their campuses. Most were filled with the same kind of bromides as your workplace or mine offered about caring first and foremost for the health and etc., etc., of our community. One letter, by Williams College president Maud Mandel, stuck out for its candor: “A healthy person could reasonably choose to stay and accept the personal risk of catching COVID-19, but the decision would unacceptably increase the chance of contagion for others.” Indeed, that 21-year-old might plausibly calculate, even if he or she gets sick the chances are, not for everybody but for most, that it would be a miserable few days rather than life-threatening illness. Those institutions closed less to protect their campus communities than to protect the broader society. The coronavirus pandemic does not remotely have the cataclysmic shock and violence of 9/11. For many people, however, the virus’ actual day-in, day-out impact will be more pervasive. 9-11 was followed by a period, which turned out to be short-lived, of national connection and goodwill. Trump, who has made mockery and castigation of opponents his signature, surely did not conjure fuzzy feelings from many quarters with his appeal at the White House on Wednesday that, “We are all in this together.” Yet the pandemic has a logic that transcends politics and personal feeling. Never mind how one feels about Trump. Never mind how we feel about one another. The reality of a dangerous virus is that we are all in this together. ",The Pandemic is the End of Trumpism,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/the-coronavirus-generation-comes-to-life-136491,politico
"Hospitals are struggling to find enough doctors, nurses and other health care workers to care for mounting numbers of critically ill coronavirus patients. The staffing problems are on top of the equipment problems — the lack of ICU beds, ventilators, and masks and other protective equipment needed to prevent the healers from becoming patients. Hospitals are taking extraordinary measures to bulk up the workforce, from calling on retirees for help to assigning medical students to answer the phones. The Trump administration on Wednesday announced new rules that would let doctors practice across state lines, without going through layers of recertification and licensing. And CMS is releasing recommendations on limiting non-essential elective procedures, which will also free up personnel and resources — although hospitals, which rely on some revenue-producing elective procedures, raised alarms over the weekend over how to define “elective care.” “They will not only preserve equipment, but it also allows doctors and nurses to help those that are on the front lines,” said CMS Administrator Seema Verma at a White House press briefing Wednesday. The VA is also preparing to help bolster the civilian health care system. But the numbers of physicians is finite — and older ones, as well as those with their own health conditions, are at risk from Covid-19. The problem is compounded by the infectious nature of the disease, which is exposing dozens of frontline workers who need to self quarantine if they have the virus. Some have already fallen ill. “Dozens of frontline caregivers in the United States have been exposed,” wrote two Harvard University medical students Adam Beckman and Suhas Gondi and Yale University health policy expert Howard Forman on the Health Affairs blog Wednesday. “This trend will accelerate in the coming weeks and months, as health care workers increasingly come into contact with patients with Covid-19 and shortages of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) worsen.” Hospitals will have to figure out how to steer any surging workforce, who should concentrate on coronavirus patients and who should take care of people who still come in with other serious diseases and injuries. And some community physicians, who may not have been in an ICU since their training but want to lend a hand, say they haven’t gotten a lot of guidance. Hospitals are taking a sweeping look at how they can boost their staff — and already retired doctors have offered step up if they can easily renew their licenses and admitting privileges. “It’s all hands on deck — especially well-educated clinical hands,” said Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association’s vice president for quality and patient safety policy. She said some hospitals have reached out to medical and nursing schools asking who can “offer extra hands.” Widespread school closures have also created problems for medical workers — as well as other hospital personnel including food service and the crews who more than ever who have to clean and disinfect — with kids now at home with no one else to take care of them. Some facilities are creating on-site child care facilities and also subsidizing these services, as the AHA and America’s Essential Hospitals call on more dollars from Congress to help. “As they start closing schools down … it creates downward pressure on the availability of staff,” said Alan Levine, CEO of Ballad Health, which has more than 20 hospitals serving rural Tennessee and Virginia. “We lose some of our nurses and health care manpower.” The Association of American Medical Colleges called on med schools to bar students from their clinical work with patients for two weeks — and some students are instead performing telehealth screenings or babysitting the children of doctors and nurses, so they can go to work. Meanwhile, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is asking medical, nursing and public health schools for detailed information on how many students and staff could pitch in, and what their specialties are. At Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, staffing is the primary concern. They have two coronavirus teams of six staff each — and contingency plans for freeing up more staff, while also working with the other hospitals in the city on how to manage an influx of patients. Some doctors say they are ready to help — even if they aren’t pulmonologists or ICU doctors, they can still care for patients, freeing up colleagues to concentrate on the pandemic. But it’s not at all clear that hospitals have figured out how exactly to pull these levers. The American Nurses Association suggested that nurses with inactive licenses, school nurses and senior nursing students can take on roles like helping out at drive-thru testing sites or long-term care facilities. Rural areas haven’t been hit as hard yet as their urban counterparts in places like New York, the Seattle area, and parts of California. But they already are seeing boosts in patients and workforce shortages. Their hospitals are already very lean, and a lot of the physicians are older, meaning they have their own coronavirus risks. And 48 percent of rural hospitals operate on a loss, according to the National Rural Health Association, making any surge in patients particularly difficult. “In a small rural hospital, each employee wears several different hats, and if you lose just one of those, it’s like you’re losing a couple different employees, and soon the facility will be unable to function,” said Maggie Elehwany, the association's government affairs and policy vice president. For instance: In Indiana, one rural health member relayed to the national association that two staff members are quarantined, while the hospital is running low on money. They have four EMS personnel on staff, and are unsure how they would make up for the staffing loss if those front line workers have to self isolate. But worries over the fast-moving coronavirus don’t stop at staffing shortages. “We’re actually rather desperate for help right now,” said Cassie Sauer, president and CEO of the Washington State Hospital Association, where one of the most severe outbreaks is taking place. “We’re asking the navy to send a Navy Ship up here from San Diego — a medical ship — we’re asking for field hospitals, we’re asking for the National Guard, we’re asking for a release of the national strategic stockpile for PPE.” President Donald Trump did deploy two hospital ships on Wednesday though not necessarily to Seattle. Shortages of personal protective equipment, bed capacity and key lifesaving equipment are mounting as more and more confirmed coronavirus cases crop up around the country. Washington State Hospital Association is calling on other industries, such as dentists, veterinarians and even automakers, to share their supplies of personal protective equipment. Levine said Ballad Health ordered more ventilators, but estimates they will take eight to 10 weeks to arrive. “Italy bought them up,” he said. He’s considering reopening one shuttered hospital as a Covid-19 hub — but will have to staff it. The Ohio Hospital Association is talking to local nursing homes about using an empty wing or a building to treat non-coronavirus patients safely, freeing up hospital rooms for Covid-19 patients. They may even turn to floors of hotels for the less seriously ill patients. University of California San Francisco has converted a floor of its largest facility, which has 600 beds, to an environment that can house coronavirus patients. The hospital has about two weeks of personal masks, gowns and gloves on hand, and is treating about 40 per day – and testing about 100 more. Trump on Wednesday invoked the Defense Production Act, which puts the economy on a wartime footing against the virus. The VA is also preparing to share both medical personnel and equipment to shore up a civilian health care system about to face unprecedented demands. But there’s still uncertainty for how much further the health care system will be pushed — and if it’ll reach a breaking point. “I think there’s a lot we don’t know and I know that there are folks out there modeling scenarios,” Beth Feldpush, the senior vice president of policy and advocacy at America’s Essential Hospitals. Debra Kahn, Susannah Luthi and Alice Miranda Ollstein contributed.

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday invoked the Defense Production Act to get medical equipment to hospitals in the fight against the coronavirus. But don't expect new masks, ventilators, gloves and goggles to show up in the field right away. The Trump administration has yet to complete a comprehensive assessment, despite weeks of discussion about using the act to help prevent the medical system from being overrun, according to current and former administration officials. Even Trump said on Wednesday that he's in no hurry to order the supplies. In an executive order issued Wednesday afternoon, Trump granted authority primarily to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to determine “the proper nationwide priorities” and to allocate all necessary health and medical resources and services. Azar will work with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the heads of other agencies as appropriate, the order says. “To ensure that our healthcare system is able to surge capacity and capability to respond to the spread of COVID-19, it is critical that all health and medical resources needed … are properly distributed to the Nation's healthcare system and others that need them most at this time,” the order says. Invoking the DPA means that if the government places an order with a private company for any medical equipment to treat the coronavirus — masks and ventilators are the two prime examples — then that company would be required to fulfill the government’s order before anyone else’s. But while it gives the government priority, invoking the act does not do anything to increase production of these items, which increasingly are in short supply. “It doesn’t help capacity,” said Doug Jacobson, an international export-control lawyer in Washington. “If you only have capacity to produce X number of units, it doesn’t help that. It just simply reprioritizes where the supply chain is oriented to.” A White House spokesperson didn't respond when asked whether the administration is positioned to immediately begin placing orders with private companies, or what those orders would might like. And Trump followed up the order with a tweet in which he indicated that he is in no rush to use the authorities. ""I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!"" Lawmakers and former government officials who have been responsible for disaster preparedness and participated in exercises to game out responses in such national crises expressed alarm at the seemingly blasé approach. ""The government should be placing purchasing orders for this equipment and they should know what they are asking for,"" said Katrina Mulligan, former director for preparedness and response in the National Security Division of the Justice Department and former member of the National Security Council staff. ""And right now, it appears that neither of those things are happening."" “They have not done this assessment,"" said Mulligan, who is managing director of national security and international policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. ""It is shocking. It is malpractice.” Taking full advantage of the authorities by definition poses significant challenges. ""It’s been used, but not like this,” said Kelly Magsamen, a former Pentagon official and National Security Council staffer in the Bush and Obama administrations. “It’s a pretty big step."" She, too, said it remains unclear how quickly the powers can now be set in motion most effectively and efficiently. ""So far, we haven’t seen the White House actually issue any orders to manufacturers,"" Magsamen said. ""That’s the next step. They have to issue orders so that the private sector and manufacturers can figure out how to fill them. The White House has to do its own homework in terms of assessing its ventilator reserves, which hopefully is underway. ""Somebody in the federal government needs to be doing that assessment so that you can have an informed ask of the manufacturing community,"" she added. “I’m hoping they’ve been working on it for some time."" Chris Brooks, chief strategy officer for Seattle-area Ventec Life Systems, said he's fielding inquiries and orders from more than 60 countries, including the U.S. government. But with the U.S., he said the focus is still on working out what exactly it needs. “I want to say we’re doing everything we can to ramp up as quickly as possible and to put products in place to be able to make as many [ventilators] as possible,” he said. “Certainly, with a definitive answer about what that need is, we could provide a definitive answer as to whether we could meet that need.” Mulligan said what is required is ""a 50-state breakdown of how many days of personal protective equipment do you have, where your gaps are the biggest."" Then, she added, ""you would identify the manufacturers domestically who produce those items. Do you have the capacity to do more within your current manufacturing capacity? Can you ramp up production? For the last month, we could have been figuring these questions out. There is absolutely no reason why we are starting that now."" In fact, talk of invoking the Defense Production Act to help deal with the current crisis dates back at least to late February. ""We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary to enable that our contracts go to the front of the line on contracting,"" Azar told reporters on Feb. 2. ""So that is an authority that we have, and we intend to use it to acquire anything that we need to acquire."" Azar said he could not specify all the items it will be used to produce but noted, ""of course, we've been very clear in the supplemental of the core items that we've got to do, which is personal protective equipment."" That includes protective equipment for health care workers. ""We've spoken of procuring at least 300 million N95 masks,"" Azar said. ""We need additional gowns ... as well as gloves. So that kind of personal protective equipment most immediately."" Azar also stressed that ""if we need to, we will use it. We won't hesitate."" Trump on Wednesday defended the timing. ""Well, you know, hospitals are supposed to have ventilators, too,"" he told reporters. ""And when we have thousands of ventilators — it sounds like a lot, but this is a very unforeseen thing. Nobody ever thought of these numbers. Nobody ever saw numbers like this, even with regard to testing."" Others have been pressing the administration to ramp up its special authorities more quickly. ""America is not as ready as we should be,"" said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, who co-wrote a letter this week to Trump pressing him to utilize the DPA. ""In France, factories that once manufactured fancy perfumes are starting to churn out needed hand sanitizer instead,"" he said. ""You can’t do these things overnight. It takes planning and coordination. President Trump is finally taking needed steps, but we’ve got to do more."" There could be other delays, however.

"A specter haunts progressive America—the possibility that a private company might make too much money solving the world’s coronavirus problem. True to form, Bernie Sanders expressed this worry in the crudest and most simplistic terms at the last Democratic debate, calling the leaders of the pharmaceutical industry “a bunch of crooks,” who are saying to themselves in the midst of the epidemic, “Wow, what an opportunity to make a fortune.” Op-eds have sprung up warning, “Drug Companies Will Make a Killing from Coronavirus” (The New York Times) and “How Big Pharma Will Profit from the Coronavirus” (The Intercept).  This would seem the least of our problems right now, but the pharmaceutical industry has become such a boogeyman that it gets roundly attacked even while racing to provide an indisputable boon to public health.  Bernie’s view that the people running the drug companies are “crooks” betrays his Marxoid belief that profit is a form of theft. Of course, even people who aren’t socialists stuck in amber circa 1930 are great scourges of the industry. Pharma brought much of this on itself with the opioid debacle, which was the product of genuine abuses. Yet these companies routinely create medical miracles for which we all should be grateful and that markedly improve human welfare.  Yes, they make money doing it, but the profit motive is the reason why they exist in the first place.  There’s a reason we introduce more new therapies than any country in the world. When faced with what’s been called a once-in-generation pathogen, would we rather have a robust commercial drug industry or not? Brilliant, creative people scattered throughout companies and universities working to be the first to a solution or not? Investors looking to back promising research, or not?  If your answer to any of these questions is “no,” you are probably a socialist, a populist firing at the wrong targets, or someone incapable of doing basic cost-benefit calculations.  As Chris Pope of the Manhattan Institute notes, if a new drug—even an expensive one—obviates hospital stays and physician care, it can reduce health care costs over time.  Consider the current crisis. The costs of the “medieval” methods we are using to try to control the coronavirus virus are unimaginably high—shutting down swaths of the economy, throwing millions out of work, disrupting air travel and the free movement of people. Gross domestic product could drop 5 percent or more this quarter.  What would we pay for a vaccine to make this all unnecessary? Even if it were a trillion dollars, the price of the Trump-proposed stimulus package, it would be a bargain, saving untold human suffering and economic dislocation. Even if it required cutting a check directly to the most stereotypical mustache-twirling, profiteering-in-a-crisis, uncaring businessman it would be a great deal.  That said, the price for a vaccine probably won’t be exorbitant. The nightmare stories of ungodly expensive treatments usually involve drugs for rare diseases. In these cases, there is a very small base of people who potentially need the drug. Companies therefore charge higher prices to recoup research costs and make a profit. Also, there are unlikely to be any competitors providing a cheaper alternative.  With the coronavirus, there’s an incredibly vast pool of people who will want the vaccine, meaning it can be priced accordingly. Since so many companies are chasing a vaccine, there will almost certainly be competition, putting further downward pressure on the price.  The overall picture of prescription drugs is more complicated than advertised. Chris Pope writes that prescription drugs account for a lower percentage of overall health spending here than in most other advanced countries, and the per capita cost for hospital services has been rising at a much more rapid clip in recent years than the per capita price of prescription drugs. Once new drugs come off patent, cheaper generic drugs arrive. This is why per capita spending on traditional drugs has been declining.  As for patents, the point of them is, as the Constitution puts it, “to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.” They ensure that companies get the benefit of research that is expensive, time consuming and risky. Success is never guaranteed, and failure more common. Even in the best circumstance, after perhaps spending $2 billion or more on the research process, a company may wait 10 years or more for approval from the Food and Drug Administration.  If a company doesn’t have a period of protection for its intellectual property when it can reap the market benefits, much of this research would dry up. And who’s going to step up and fill the gap?  It’s true that the government provides support for basic research through the National Institutes of Health. That is well and good—and an entirely worthy government project—but it’s not the same as bringing a drug to market.  It is a marvel that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is already working with a Cambridge, Mass., company, Moderna, on a vaccine trail. This is a model of public-private cooperation. Anyone who would want to subtract Moderna from the process because it stands to profit from its work is an ideological zealot heedless of public health.  Drug pricing is a complicated matter and there are, to be sure, more things that the government can be doing to foster competition and keep companies from gaming the system. But this crisis brings home the incalculable value of a world-class pharmaceutical sector. We can shelter in place and try to mitigate the harms of this virus, or hope the “crooks” pursuing treatments and a vaccine make the current disruptions in our national life a thing of the past as soon possible.",Only the ‘Crooks’ of the Pharmaceutical Industry Can Save Us Now,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/only-the-crooks-of-the-pharmaceutical-industry-can-save-us-now-136255,politico
"Coronavirus has finally reached Congress. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a ninth-term Florida Republican, and Rep. Ben McAdams, a freshman Democrat from Utah, revealed on Wednesday that they had tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first U.S. lawmakers to contract the virus that‘s spreading across the country. Diaz-Balart, 58, said he began to develop symptoms on Saturday, just hours after he left the House floor for a vote on a coronavirus response bill. More than 400 members of Congress also voted during the early-Saturday session. Diaz-Balart’s statement indicates he decided to “self-quarantine in Washington D.C.” after the vote. His statement doesn’t indicate why he believed he needed to self-quarantine before developing symptoms or whether he informed staff or other members of Congress that he might have exposed them to the illness. “I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better,” Diaz-Balart said in the statement. “However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus. We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times.” McAdams, 45, also said his symptoms began mildly on Saturday night, after he had returned to Utah. He immediately began self-quarantining on the advice of his doctor. “My symptoms got worse and I developed a fever, a dry cough and labored breathing and I remained self-quarantined,“ McAdams said in a statement. “On Tuesday, my doctor instructed me to get tested for COVID-19 and following his referral, I went to the local testing clinic for the test. Today I learned that I tested positive.“ Diaz-Balart said he decided to remain in Washington on Saturday because he was concerned about being in his South Florida home, where his wife, who has a pre-existing condition, would be “at exceptionally high risk.” Like Diaz-Balart, McAdams didn‘t indicate whether he had urged any of his colleagues or aides to self-quarantine. The news of two members testing positive has already begun rippling across Congress. Rep. Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.) said on Wednesday night that the House doctor had advised him to self-quarantine until March 27 because he “was in contact with a member of Congress on March 13th that has since tested positive for COVID-19.“ The House minority whip, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), said on Wednesday that he, too, would self-quarantine because he had held an “extended meeting“ with Diaz-Balart late last week. Scalise is now the highest-ranking lawmaker to self-quarantine amid the outbreak. Though Diaz-Balart and McAdams are the first in Congress to develop coronavirus, the illness has struck among a small number of congressional aides. It’s sure to heighten already-acute fears on Capitol Hill that members themselves, particularly the high proportion of elderly lawmakers, are vulnerable when they meet in Washington. The development appears likely to revive an internal House debate about whether to permit remote voting for lawmakers amid a pandemic that‘s ravaging the country, pummeling the economy and limiting members‘ ability to travel across the country. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats have resisted the idea, worrying that it would set a damaging precedent for the future and signal a lack of confidence from government in the country‘s fight against coronavirus. But with two lawmakers ill and untold others exposed, some lawmakers say it‘s time to think again. “In. Person. Voting. Should. Be. Reconsidered,“ Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a freshman Democrat from Florida, said in a tweet late Wednesday. “For the safety of our communities, during this emergency, we must be able to legislate from our districts.“ Earlier in the day, 50 lawmakers of both parties wrote to House leaders asking them to reconsider remote voting as well, arguing that Congress must hold itself to the same standards it‘s asking of other Americans.",First 2 members of Congress test positive for coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/first-member-of-congress-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-136300,politico
"The Trump administration is considering a controversial proposal to boost the number of visas offered to wealthy immigrants who invest money in the United States as it tries to boost a faltering economy amid the escalating coronavirus outbreak, according to four people familiar with the situation. The proposal, which could be included in one of the Senate’s coronavirus rescue bills, would significantly boost the number of visas offered annually from 10,000 to 75,000 while halving the investment required to earn legal residence from $900,000 to $450,000, they say.  Half the recipients of the EB-5 visa program — investors and their families — come from China, according to a report by the Brookings Institution think tank. Many others come from South Korea and Taiwan. Immigration hardliners, who are generally supportive of President Donald Trump’s policies, oppose the proposal because of concerns about increasing the number of foreigners coming to the U.S., especially from China, which Trump blames for its handling of the coronavirus. “Using a coronavirus package to give more green cards to shady investors from the country where the virus originated would be Washington at its worst,” said RJ Hauman, government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, who has been in touch with the White House and the Senate about the proposal. “If an immigration proposal doesn’t enhance public safety or protect American workers, it doesn’t belong in there. Period.” The proposal comes as the Trump administration is putting temporary holds on other types of visas for lower-income immigrants — including agricultural workers, camp counselors and resort workers — as U.S. unemployment is expected to soar. The administration is also considering reversing its recent decision to increase by 35,000 the number of nonagricultural seasonal workers the U.S. brings in each year, such as landscapers, crab-pickers and lifeguards, two people familiar with the situation say.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump made cracking down on immigration the centerpiece of his 2016 campaign and a top priority of his presidency. “Our country is full,” Trump warned in April, standing at the southern border in California. He has implemented harsh travel restrictions on numerous majority-Muslim nations and cut refugee caps, but he has also backed proposals that would increase the number of immigrants and offer citizenship to some here illegally. The EB-5 program was created in 1990 to boost rural areas and economically distressed urban ones. But in recent years developers have found ways to carve high-income areas into the locations. The program has been used for years by property developers in New York City, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, to oversee projects that have helped create jobs and generate tax revenue, according to a person close to the White House. The Trump administration enacted a new rule in November raising the minimum investment amount and pushing the program to be used in rural and high-unemployment areas. Investments are supposed to lead to the creation of 10 U.S. jobs but that requirement has been interpreted in different ways. The proposed changes are likely to meet resistance from governors in states with large rural populations who believe the program — as it is currently structured — ignores them, according to a second person close to the White House. The proposal indicates immigrants would have to be “cleared first,” but it’s unclear whether that refers to the coronavirus or the immigrants’ investments. It could also address lengthy wait times that have led to a reduction in participation.  Groups that favor immigration restrictions including FAIR and Numbers USA are lobbying senators to keep changes to the program out of their bill and asking supporters across the country to call their senators. “It's ridiculous to think that there are some in Congress who are looking to take advantage of a national health crisis by pushing for a massive increase in the number of green cards made available for foreign investors,” said Chris Chmielenski, deputy director at NumbersUSA, which supports immigration restrictions. “While millions of American workers are concerned about their health and job status, Congress should be focusing on helping them and not selling off green cards.” The expansion is being pushed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a Trump ally who has supported easing restrictions in the past, according to one of the people. His office did not respond to a request for comment. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has long considered the program corrupt and tried to change the system but in 2018 called for it to shut down altogether. “The American people understand that our citizenship is a blessing, and shouldn’t be given away cheaply,” he said on the Senate floor that year. “Unfortunately, for too many years this body has witnessed the perversion and degradation of a program that sells, yes sells, our citizenship.”",Trump considers increasing visas for foreign investors ,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-considers-visas-foreign-investors-135985,politico
"AUSTIN, Texas — Texas is a big state with a proud small-government philosophy. And that’s being tested by the Covid-19 pandemic. Strict bans on public gatherings to curtail the virus' reach and widespread testing and treatment run counter to the politics of top Texas officials. Instead they're calling on local officials to lead the response. As governors in states including New York and California have imposed statewide measures such as closing schools and limiting commerce, Texas leaders have been reluctant to set restrictions conservative voters might consider draconian and business leaders oppose. They’ve also opposed steps to expand health insurance coverage.  Texas’ Republican Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration Friday — after dozens of states already had done so — and activated the National Guard on Tuesday, after more than a dozen states already had. State officials have yet to impose statewide limits on public gatherings, close schools or beaches or issue a special open enrollment period for health insurance, as California, New York and other big states have. And some health providers say Texas has been slow to boost coronavirus testing capacity and help them meet equipment needs. “In this instance, President Trump is right: Governors need to step up,” Clay Jenkins, a Democrat and Dallas County’s top elected official, said in an interview. “When it comes to stemming the tide of the loss of life that we’re staring at, the governor is in a unique position to act.”  Abbott is fully in charge of the state’s response, because as part of the small-government philosophy, the state’s Legislature meets only in odd years for 140 days. So far, more than 60 coronavirus cases and one death have been confirmed in the state. Abbott said he expects the number of cases to explode next week as more testing capacity comes online and more diagnoses are counted. Abbott, who has been governor for five years, tends to shine in moments of crisis. He’s been relatively hands-off during legislative sessions, but has played an active role in managing during disaster. Abbott earned praise for providing a steady hand during Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston in 2017. But the swift-spreading coronavirus public health crisis is catching Texas unprepared. The state, which didn’t expand Medicaid, has the highest uninsured rate in the country meaning millions of people don’t have doctors to call if they show symptoms. And Abbott has opposed local paid sick leave ordinances, which could encourage sick people to stay home and keep from spreading the virus, saying they hamper business growth. “I am pleased that Governor Abbott is engaged in a way that is certainly more substantive than President Trump — but that is such a low bar,” Democratic Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett wrote in an emailed statement. “Like Trump, he has shifted responsibility for the toughest decisions to local leaders and declined to provide leadership on limitations and closures. He has provided no leadership on health care access in the state with the most uninsured.” Health providers say the state has been slow to ramp up testing, relying instead on local officials and private companies to step up efforts. About 1,200 people have been tested so far — a fifth of the number that have been tested in California and half the number that have been tested in Minnesota, according to a POLITICO analysis of state tallies. Christopher Crow, president of Dallas-based Catalyst Health Network, said his group of clinics, which serves 1.2 million patients in the state, is ready to roll out Covid-19 testing but lacked protective gear to keep doctors and nurses from becoming infected. On Tuesday evening the group finally got equipment from the national stockpile — enough to last for two or three days of testing.  “We haven’t had to do a 180-degree turn in a moment. That is really hard,” Crow said. “I wish we had more coming from our public officials than we have right now.” Texas isn’t the only state to drag its feet on a response. But the state’s population of 30 million people and its high uninsured rate makes the state a potential hotbed for virus spread. “At some point the needs will overwhelm the health care system” in Texas, said James Hodge, Jr., director for Arizona State University’s center for public health law and policy.  Abbott’s office says the governor believes in taking a decentralized approach letting local officials take the lead in imposing restrictions and relying on private companies to help boost testing capacity. Several Texas cities and counties have already closed schools and limited public gatherings. That includes Austin, which issued an order Tuesday banning gatherings of more than 10 people and shutting down restaurants and bars through early May. “County judges and mayors have done a very good job in listening to local health officials,” Abbott’s spokesman John Wittman said in an interview. “What is best in Dallas may not be best for Amarillo or Abilene.” Some local officials say Abbott is responding to conservative Texas voters who will chafe at what they see as overly restrictive measures. “The biggest challenge there is still a lot of people in our communities who are trying to figure out if we are overreacting or underreacting,” said Jerry Mouton, mayor of Deer Park southeast of Houston. The outbreak is coming at the same time as a downturn in oil and gas revenue, a lifeblood for the $110 billion annual Texas budget. While the state has a rainy day fund totaling more than $11 billion, some state lawmakers worry that needs for social services will skyrocket at a moment when state coffers will be emptier. The next session will be “frightening,” said Democratic state Sen. Nathan Johnson. “We are looking at a higher demand for state services and will be less financially able to deliver them.” Johnson added that he hopes the outbreak will spark a conversation about expanding health coverage and paid sick leave policies in the state.  “If we have a stronger, better thought out system of services, I think we can avoid some of the pain the next time around,” he said.

"The coronavirus may do more to unravel U.S.-Chinese ties than trade wars, technology threats and presidential tweets ever did.  The two countries’ relationship — already under enormous pressure in recent years — is on the verge of imploding as both sides seek to assign blame for the virus’ origin and exchange tit-for-tat recriminations on other fronts, including expelling journalists.  The fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability given the importance of both countries to international trade.  Beyond trade, the virus’ spread could even lead to more long-term shifts in how the U.S. and China are perceived. China, which has continued to shore up its military power in the face of longstanding U.S. supremacy, has now begun offering aid to other countries crippled by the virus as a way to showcase its global leadership amid a slow, limited U.S. reaction.  “I cannot think of a more dangerous time in the U.S.-China relationship in the last 40 years, and the carnage from the coronavirus has barely begun in the U.S.,” China analyst Bill Bishop wrote this week in his widely read Sinocism newsletter.  The first phase of the trade deal that the two sides agreed to in December eases, but does not fully eliminate, the tariffs President Donald Trump put into place and has China agreeing to buy some $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services over the next two years.  China appears to be meeting some of the deal’s deadlines for now, but there are concerns that, given the damage the virus — as well as the trade war — has done to its economy, it may not be able to buy all the U.S. goods as quickly as it had promised. The virus’ effect on U.S. businesses, meanwhile, could dampen some industries’ ability to offer the goods and services China might want. Despite pressure from U.S. businesses, Trump said Wednesday he wouldn’t be suspending tariffs that remain, although the administration has exempted certain medical supplies from the import penalties.  When asked whether he would lift more the penalties, Trump said, “China is paying billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there's no reason to do that,” reiterating his incorrect assertion that China, not U.S. businesses and consumers, pays the tariffs. “They haven't even spoken to me. China hasn’t asked me to do that.”  The response and rhetoric surrounding the pandemic is now throwing into question whether the two sides will enter into a second phase of negotiations to address some of the more systemic issues that have plagued the U.S.-China trade relationship.  The virus may prove to be the most compelling reason for the two countries to “decouple” economically, as some of Trump’s hawkish advisers have long wanted. Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week that will place new “Buy America” requirements on government purchases of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has been leading the effort, which would attempt to reduce reliance on China for vital drug ingredients and supplies like masks and gloves.  “The problem we’re facing is that any time we have a public health emergency, people wake up to the extreme foreign dependency that we have,” he said. “And after the crisis is over, they promptly go back to sleep.” Steve Bannon, a former chief strategist in Trump’s White House who has long warned about the dangers posed by a rising China, said any goodwill built up as a result of reaching the initial trade deal is now moot. He blamed Beijing’s early actions — when it was accused of trying to cover up the crisis and resisting outside help — for “metastasizing” the pandemic.  “Now you can see they are on a propaganda offensive to blame this on the West, particularly the United States, and it’s going to lead to a further confrontation. There is a confrontation coming,” Bannon said.  He said a confrontation would likely involve an escalation “in the information war and the economic war.” Since the virus began to spread globally, officials on both sides have used social media and other platforms to attack each other.  Trump, for instance, has taken to calling the coronavirus the “Chinese virus,” a term critics say is racist and xenophobic. He says Beijing’s ruling Communist Party has left him no choice but to do this because Chinese officials are floating conspiracy theories that the COVID-19 illness began in the U.S. or was planted in China by the U.S. military.  “I have to call it where it came from; it did come from China,” Trump said Tuesday when asked about his use of the “Chinese virus” label. “So I think it’s a very accurate term.” He continued: “I didn’t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them.” Trump on Wednesday pushed back on mounting criticism for his use of the term, insisting, “It’s not racist at all.” Scientists believe the virus was first spotted in China’s Hubei province, where the city of Wuhan was an epicenter. But as China has, through strict quarantines and other measures, appeared to bring the virus under control, it has gone about trying to fudge that history.  A spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, Lijian Zhao, has been particularly brash, using Twitter — a platform banned for most Chinese — to share articles and raise questions about whether the U.S. was the origin of the illness.  “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” Zhao tweeted on March 12.  The Washington-Beijing clash is going well beyond just rhetoric.  China said this week that it is expelling American journalists working for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. It also announced new restrictions on several U.S.-based outlets including Voice of America.  American reporters have been among the most aggressive in covering the coronavirus outbreak in China, as well as other issues deemed sensitive there.  China said it was merely taking reciprocal action after the Trump administration recently announced new restrictions on Chinese media outlets in America, including capping the number of Chinese citizens working for them. The Trump administration also has designated several Chinese media outlets as foreign missions — effectively treating them as arms of the Chinese government, which plenty of analysts say is a fair characterization.  In a briefing with reporters Wednesday, a senior State Department official defended the Trump administration’s approach in high altitude terms, saying that for decades the U.S. has tried to build a “normal relationship” with China, but that the Chinese have taken advantage of America’s relatively open system without offering similar access.  “For the last 40 years, you can characterize a relationship of them competing while we’ve been trying to cooperate. This administration has understood that this is a relationship characterized by strategic competition,” the official said. Many public health experts have raised alarms about the U.S.-China rhetoric and reciprocal actions during the coronavirus crisis.  They argue that now is not the time for either side to insult the other, because working together will help speed up efforts to contain the virus across the world.  And the U.S., to its credit, has sent tons of humanitarian aid to China and offered millions in additional assistance to help it fight the virus. Trump himself has avoided criticizing Chinese leader Xi Jinping directly. It’s a cautious approach he’s long taken despite the trade war and other scuffles, apparently believing that keeping a strong personal relationship with Xi could pay off down the line. In January, when Trump was downplaying the spread of the illness, he even thanked Xi in a tweet praising China for “working very hard” to contain the coronavirus. But Trump aides feel they cannot allow the Chinese to rewrite history. In a phone call with a senior Chinese foreign policy official earlier this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned “that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat,” according to a State Department readout.  While some Democrats have blasted the Trump administration and its supporters for its heated rhetoric toward China, there’s strong bipartisan support in Washington for the broader idea that the U.S. needs to be tougher on China. And there are plenty of signs that sentiment isn’t on pause amid the coronavirus pandemic.  In recent weeks, U.S. lawmakers have sent legislation to Trump that allows for paying rural telecom carriers $1 billion to eliminate and replace materials in their networks that come from Huawei and ZTE. Both are Chinese telecommunications firms that U.S. officials fear could be a means of exposing U.S. networks to Chinese hacking and spying.  In mid-February, the U.S. Department of Justice filed racketeering and conspiracy charges against Huawei and some of its subsidiaries, alleging they were trying to steal trade secrets from American companies.  The Chinese Communist Party, which saw its reputation dealt a major blow over its initial handling of the virus within its borders, is now trying to capitalize on its recent successes containing the illness’ spread.  China has sent experts to assist Italy as it battles severe outbreaks of the virus, while offering assistance to Spain. It has pledged to send at least 100,000 test kits to the Philippines. And it has made clear, through actions and pledges, that it will help other nations that need it.  Chinese charities have also stepped up to offer assistance to other countries, including the United States. In requesting Beijing’s assistance, Serbia’s president declared this week: “The only country that can help us is China.”  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Wednesday that the Chinese government would be donating 2 million surgical masks, 200,000 N95 masks and 50,000 testing kits to the European Union.  “This support is highly valued and we are grateful for it,” she said.  It’s clear that Beijing sees itself filling a global leadership role that would traditionally be held by the United States, but which, under Trump’s “America First” philosophy, appears vacant.  Chinese state-controlled media websites are filled with stories about the U.S. struggle to control the virus in its borders. They’re also filled with stories about Chinese leader Xi offering words of comfort to his counterparts abroad.  “Sunshine always comes after the rain,” Xi said, according to a Chinese media report of his conversation with Spain’s prime minister.

"General Motors is studying whether to retool its shuttered production lines to make ventilators and other needed medical equipment to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, company officials said Wednesday. GM CEO Mary Barra was in contact with administration officials on Wednesday updating them on a decision to suspend production for the rest of the month. “She also indicated GM is working to help find solutions for the nation during this difficult time and has offered to help, and we are already studying how we can potentially support production of medical equipment like ventilators,” a GM spokesperson told POLITICO. The U.S. faces a shortage of life-saving ventilators if patients infected with Covid-19, a respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, overwhelm U.S. hospitals. President Donald Trump on Wednesday invoked the Defense Production Act, which will allow him to direct domestic manufacturers to produce medical supplies and other necessary items during the crisis. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Wednesday that he was in touch with leaders of two of the three major U.S. automakers. Ford and Fiat Chrysler also said they would suspend production of automobiles until at least March 30. “One of them told me that even though the men and women may be off for two weeks due to the virus, she’s going to try to call them back so they can produce ventilators,” Kudlow said on Fox News, in an apparent reference to Barra, the only female CEO of a major U.S. auto company. “They might even ask them to do it on a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons,” he said. The auto industry in Canada has also expressed a willingness to produce necessary medical supplies for demand in that country. “We’ve got the capacity to make things from simple one-shot molds to complex assemblies. We make 500,000 of something every year, a thousand a day,” said Flavio Volpe, president of Canada’s Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. “The country needs masks, gowns, goggles, ventilators. Can we assign some of our capacity to be able to help the cause,” he said in an interview with CBC. “The response has been overwhelming from auto parts makers. We’re in, just get us the specs.”",Auto industry could shift to make ventilators,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/auto-industry-could-shift-to-make-ventilators-136256,politico
"Can the state tell your favorite local restaurant to close, or tell you that you must stay at home unless it’s absolutely necessary to leave, because of an emergency? The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have closed down bars, movie theaters and dine-in restaurants. Six counties in the San Francisco Bay Area have imposed a shelter-in-place order that allows people to leave their homes only for essential activities. In response to these drastic measures intended to slow down the spread of coronavirus, there are plenty of voices on social media, and even some in government, denouncing such measures as unprecedented, un-American and unconstitutional. Most of us have never imagined such impositions outside of a situation of armed conflict, but allegations that those measures in the current circumstances are unlawful are wrong. And this is a case where legal misinformation can exacerbate a public health crisis. States—and their cities and counties by extension—possess what has long been known as a “police power” to govern for the health, welfare and safety of their citizens. This broad authority, which can be traced to English common law and is reserved to the states by the 10th Amendment, is far from radical; it justifies why states can regulate at all. The police power of the states has been invoked on multiple occasions by the Supreme Court, often in contrast to the limited powers of the federal government—for example, in Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion in the 2012 Obamacare case. This power also has been recognized in the context of public health for decades. In a 1905 Supreme Court case that upheld mandatory smallpox vaccinations, the court observed that “upon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.” What does this mean for the drastic coronavirus responses we’re seeing across the country? State and local governments can indeed decide to force even unwilling businesses to shut down, require people to stay mostly at home, impose curfews and even threaten noncompliance with arrest if necessary. (Thankfully, with COVID-19, we have so far seen mostly peaceful, even if begrudging, compliance to “flatten the curve” so that our health care workers and hospitals are not overwhelmed.) But, you might ask, don’t I have individual rights, even in a pandemic? Of course you do. We possess constitutionally protected rights to assemble and travel, for instance. State and local governments must be careful to make sure that measures they impose to protect people are not overly broad and are taken only for justifiably important reasons. Our legal history is filled with cases where government has had insufficiently important reasons to justify restrictive measures, or where the measures themselves are overly broad. Or even cases where government restrictions turn out to have been implemented for impermissibly discriminatory reasons, such as when the city of San Francisco targeted only its Chinese residents in a bubonic plague outbreak in 1900. Not all exercises of the police power will withstand constitutional scrutiny. But the very existence of this framework—the balance between the need to protect the public and individual rights—assumes that there will be times when there are truly compelling emergencies justifying severe measures. A global pandemic that spreads even among those who are asymptomatic and could exceed the capacity of the American health care system would appear to be just such a compelling situation. When prominent voices tell the public that these drastic measures are somehow inherently unlawful or obviously unconstitutional, they detract from the social solidarity we need right now. People who are misled about what the government may do, and confused about its established powers, might not take heed of the necessary measures to protect their own health and that of their communities. At some point in the future, we could see a coronavirus response that has gone on too long or is too broad to justify its burdens. Or we might see instances of people who were denied civil liberties without real justification. Even now, you might feel that these measures are too little, too late, or that they are drastic, and burdensome. But if we are facing a window of opportunity that is rapidly closing, to say that the states cannot try to use their most basic authority to save lives is not only wrong—it might be deadly.","Yes, States and Local Governments Can Close Private Businesses and Restrict Your Movement",2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/states-police-power-coronavirus-135826,politico
"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday that his company is stepping up its efforts to combat misinformation about the coronavirus — but has not received requests from governments worldwide to turn over its users' data. Speaking to reporters by phone, Zuckerberg said discussions in Washington, Brussels and elsewhere have focused on ways that Facebook could combat misinformation connected to Covid-19, and not on how governments could use people’s digital information to combat the virus. “I don’t think it would make sense to share people’s data if people haven’t opted in for that,” he said. “At a high level, the answer is probably no,” Zuckerberg added in response to questions about whether he would be open to such data sharing with government agencies. Facebook already partners with public health organizations to monitor global diseases based on data from users who have opted to share their location information, he said. European governments, privacy regulators, telecom operators and digital companies have been considering reducing global data protection standards in recent days so officials can access large amounts of social media data to model how the coronavirus is spreading. U.S. authorities have also had discussions with companies like Facebook and Google about how their data could aid in the virus response, according to some news reports, although White House officials have told POLITICO they have not requested data on the companies' users. The big online companies possess a wealth of information on their billions of users, include their travels, friendships, interests and even diet and exercise habits. But while some of that data could be useful for public health efforts like the virus response, the companies are also wary of retriggering the same alarms about privacy violations that have triggered outcries and investigations in both the U.S. and Europe. In recent weeks, false reports have spread on Facebook's messaging platform WhatsApp as people seek information about how to protect themselves against the coronavirus. Zuckerberg said WhatsApp has limited the ability of people to forward digital messages, a move that has helped reduce the spread of falsehoods. He said governments have not ramped up pressure to reduce its encryption levels to combat coronavirus misinformation, but added that his company would not change its policy on so-called end-to-end encryption. Countries like the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom have consistently called for the company to alter its stance on encryption, in part to tackle online terrorist content. “We really believe there are other ways to get at preventing harm that are more effective than getting rid of encryption,” Zuckerberg said. Facebook has also come under pressure to clamp down on the spread of false reports across its main platform and Instagram as well, and Zuckerberg announced several new initiatives that would be rolled out in the coming days. Facebook’s latest response efforts include a “coronavirus information center” that will be added to the top of users’ news feeds with links to reputable information about the illness and the websites of government health agencies. That would start to show up on people’s social media pages in the U.S. and Europe in the next 24 hours, and will be updated as public health officials release new information, Zuckerberg said. The company is also making its enterprise software, called Workplace, available to governments and emergency organizations free for the next year to help them more easily communicate while working remotely. Zuckerberg, who like many people in the U.S. is now working from home, empathized with the fact that such arrangements are proving difficult for his workers and others across the country. “It’s a huge change to work from home, especially with the schools all closed and there are kids around,” he told reporters. “It’s a difficult and stressful time for people.” Among those working from home now are scores of content moderators who are tasked with identifying and removing the platform's most harmful or obscene content. Zuckerberg acknowledged that some content moderation tasks can’t be carried out from home, meaning Facebook will rely more heavily on artificial intelligence systems with varying degrees of accuracy. The company will also shift more moderators to look for content that indicates a user may be considering suicide or self-harm as increased isolation during the coronavirus outbreak could have an impact on mental health, he said. The challenge comes as Facebook is also experiencing peak usage, eclipsing high-traffic moments like midnight on New Year’s Eve, the result of more people being physically isolated from friends and family. ""We really need to make sure we're on top of this from an infrastructure perspective, to make sure that things don't melt down, and can continue to provide the level of service that people need in a time like this,” Zuckerberg said.",Zuckerberg: Governments have not asked for user data for coronavirus fight,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/mark-zuckerberg-coronavirus-user-data-136028,politico
"The FDA is so desperate for information about shortages in coronavirus testing supplies that it is turning to an unlikely source of information: Twitter. Wading into the Wild West of social media for help during a global pandemic may seem unsophisticated for an agency charged with regulating the nation’s drugs and medical devices. But thanks to a decades-old law, the FDA cannot require device manufacturers to report shortages in the same way it can for drugmakers. This fundamental gap in the flow of information has made it difficult for the FDA to identify weaknesses in the supply chain for coronavirus testing and in the nationwide push to test hundreds of thousands of patients. The agency is responsible for regulating coronavirus tests used by U.S. laboratories. So the FDA is making plaintive appeals on Twitter, in addition to negotiating with companies behind the scenes. “@US_FDA suggests companies make public their inventory, production schedule and a hotline number to address questions regarding availability of reagents and other supplies needed for #COVID19 testing,” Anand Shah, the agency’s deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs, tweeted on March 17. “If you have an allocation plan to maximize efficient testing, please post.” The FDA is seeking information about swabs, test kits, instruments and supplies for transporting and preparing samples for analysis, Shah said in a subsequent tweet that tagged the @FDADeviceInfo account. A spokesperson for the medical device trade lobby AdvaMed told POLITICO that it is working with the FDA “to find the best way to ensure the appropriate information gets to the FDA during this time of crisis.” The Trump administration has sought to tighten rules for device makers in recent years, bringing them in line with the regulations that require drug manufacturers to warn the government when a shortage seems likely — and how long it could last. The president’s 2020 budget request proposed requiring device-makers to tell the FDA if a significant interruption of essential products was likely, and to file regular reports on their manufacturing capacity. Similar plans have been gaining steam in Congress. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a bill in February to bolster FDA’s authority to monitor device shortages, and Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) and Bob Casey (D-Penn.) unveiled similar legislation in March. But with those proposals in legislative limbo, the agency may have to get creative to track potential shortages at a time when countries around the world are competing for the same basic testing supplies. Michael Heyl, a medical device attorney at Hogan Lovells, says that the FDA can glean clues from lists of approved device suppliers to get a window into where companies source materials. “Those are all available to FDA for review upon inspection,” Heyl said. “An argument can be made that at least who the suppliers are is something that FDA has the ability to see.” Others argue that a global crisis is not the time to change the rules for device manufacturers. “There's a balance that has to be struck between giving that information to FDA and creating additional reporting requirements in a time where people can't quite keep up with all that they're required to do already in terms of getting these tests up and running,” said Scott Danzis, an attorney at Covington & Burling who specializes in medical diagnostics. In the meantime, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told reporters this week that the agency is monitoring the stock of testing supplies and personal protective equipment “very closely.” “There is pressure on the supply chain with respect to the reagents, swabs, or transport media that are needed to perform these tests,” Hahn said. “We have been leaning in with manufacturers — both of the tests, but also of these other supplies that are needed.”",FDA turns to Twitter to help track testing supply shortages,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/fda-twitter-coronavirus-testing-136014,politico
"Bill Weld ended his quixotic primary campaign against President Donald Trump on Wednesday after winning only a single delegate in the 2020 contest.  ""While I am suspending my candidacy, I want to be clear that I am not suspending my commitment to the nation and to the democratic institutions that set us apart,"" Weld wrote in an email to supporters.  Weld, the former two-term Massachusetts governor, pitched himself as an anti-Trump, pro-choice former prosecutor who supported cutting taxes and combating climate change. He backed Trump's impeachment, and was among a handful of Republicans who ran for the nomination and dropped out over the course of the election cycle.  Weld won a single delegate in Iowa, but had trouble competing with Trump's popularity among the GOP base. Weld was also hampered by Republican rules that use a winner-take-all formula to award delegates, including in his native Massachusetts. Weld's exit from the race means Trump is now the party's presumptive nominee — though it was never really in doubt. Trump amassed the number of delegates needed to win the party's nomination on Tuesday night after polls closed in Illinois, Arizona and Florida.  ""Nobody motivates our base more than President Trump, as evidenced by the historic turnout we've seen in state after state this primary season,"" said RNC chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. ""[We] are thrilled to have President Trump as our party’s presumptive nominee once again."" Weld ran for vice president as a Libertarian in 2016, alongside former presidential candidate Gary Johnson. In the days leading up to the general election in 2016, Weld encouraged voters to choose Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump. The former Massachusetts governor re-registered as a Republican in 2019 to run for president.  Announcing the end of his campaign, Weld thanked his ""tens of thousands of supporters and donors.""  ""I am intensely grateful to all the patriotic women and men who have stood with me and supported me during the past eleven months in our effort to bring better government to Washington, D.C.,"" Weld said.",Weld ends long-shot bid for GOP nomination,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/bill-weld-ends-2020-campaign-135951,politico

"Ford and General Motors are halting production at all North American plants through March 30, the companies confirmed today. GM said production status would be reevaluated week-to-week after March 30.  Ford temporarily closed the Michigan Assembly Plant final assembly building earlier today after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus. The company is instructing those who had direct contact with the employee to self-quarantine and seek medical attention. All other plants will close after Thursday evening‘s shifts. In a statement, Ford said manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico will be closed so they can be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized and to protect workers from the spread of the novel coronavirus. GM said its plants will be closing “in a cadence, with each facility receiving specific instructions from manufacturing leadership.“ Leaders from the companies and the United Auto Workers will work together on plans to restart production in compliance with social distancing protocols among workers, including at shift change times, and to maximize cleaning times between shifts changes. UAW President Rory Gamble called the temporary shutdown “prudent,” giving leaders time to “review best practices“ to prevent the spread of the virus. Ford, UAW, GM and Fiat Chrysler announced Sunday they were forming a Coronavirus Task Force “to implement enhanced protections for manufacturing and warehouse employees at all three companies.“ The Associated Press has reported that FCA is also shuttering plants in Michigan but FCA did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation. Ford is also closing manufacturing sites in Germany and Romania. A Ford plant in Spain already halted production Monday after three workers were diagnosed with the coronavirus over the weekend.","Ford, GM to halt North American production ",2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/coronavirus-ford-gm-halting-production-135917,politico
"The White House has issued a “temporary pause” on congressional testimony for senior officials involved in the coronavirus response, according to correspondence obtained by POLITICO — a move that has some House Democrats complaining about stonewalling even as they acknowledge the need to give health officials space to manage the crisis. The halt in high-level officials appearing at hearings is slated to last through the end of the month and is intended, according to the March 16 letter, to ensure that the Trump administration is “directly focused on executing its day-to-day response to COVID-19.” “Due to the full Administration mobilization underway, we are instituting a temporary pause with respect to the involvement in hearings of government witnesses who are engaged in the coronavirus response,” Cassidy Hutchinson, a White House legislative affairs official, wrote to top House committee aides. “Right now, the Executive Branch needs all of its resources directly focused on executing its day-to-day response to COVID-19.” “This pause is effective immediately. It is intended to last for three weeks, through the end of March,” Hutchinson added, emphasizing that the administration would “continue to offer full transparency to Congress and the American people.” The letter has prompted grousing among congressional Democrats, who say that while they understand the urgency facing the administration, the move closely followed explosive testimony to the Oversight Committee from top Trump health officials that shed a negative light on the administration’s handling of the crisis. In particular, lawmakers note, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci told lawmakers last week that there had been a “failing” by the government to implement testing early in the spread of the illness. “It’s no coincidence that the White House ordered key officials to stop testifying before Congress right after Dr. Fauci warned the Oversight Committee that the Trump Administration’s testing program is failing,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), a member of the oversight panel. Democrats also say Fauci’s testimony directly played a role in convincing the NBA to suspend its season, an example of the profound impact sworn testimony from senior health officials can have on decision-makers going forward. The Oversight committee’s chairwoman, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, (D-N.Y.) said she hoped to be able to “work with the Administration in a reasonable way to make sure Dr. Fauci and other key officials are allowed to continue providing information to Congress in this critical period, even as we recognize the key functions they are serving.” “Congress plays a critical role to ensure all federal resources are used effectively and efficiently in this time of crisis, especially when state and local entities are saying they do not have what they need to fight this pandemic,” Maloney added. A senior administration official emphasized that the pause in public testimony would be brief and would not preclude other forms of information-sharing with Congress. “Agencies that are involved in the coronavirus response are working with Congressional committees to postpone hearings temporarily while they fully focus their resources on the mission,” said a senior administration official. “The Administration will continue to practice ‘radical transparency’ with Congress and the American people during this public health emergency.” The White House has been holding near-daily press briefings to provide updates on the coronavirus response. And Fauci is far from silenced; he’s been a ubiquitous presence on television, appearing on multiple Sunday news shows and giving interviews. In addition, lawmakers themselves don’t appear to be clamoring to hold any public hearings in the near-term. The House is in a long-planned weeklong recess while leaders work with the Senate on a massive economic stimulus package, and House officials have recommended that members and staff practice social distancing for the foreseeable future, limiting the prospect of gathering for high-profile public hearings. However, House Democrats say direct communication between lawmakers and senior officials remains crucial during the crisis. The frustration voiced by some Democrats captures a lingering tension between the Trump administration and the House, which has been seeking additional documents and information about the administration’s pandemic preparation. For example, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), whose state had one of the earliest cases of the virus, has been requesting information from CDC on testing capacity, and says the response he's received has been ""incomplete and still fails to give us a complete picture of the country’s ability to process coronavirus tests.""  House Democratic aides say they’ve also struggled to get detailed information on decision-making surrounding the availability of coronavirus tests; whether the administration heeded warnings from public health experts in January; and other important questions about the early days of the crisis. But they also acknowledge that senior officials should be focused on handling the immediate challenges the nation is facing, especially while experts urge Americans to stay home when possible. “We’ve also been trying to give them distance to respond to the outbreak,” said one House Democratic aide. “So, we’re going to have a long list of questions after this is over.” “Hopefully this won’t look like pointing fingers,” said another Democratic aide, who agreed that the House plans to ramp up oversight after the immediate crisis subsides. “America is in the emergency room right now. We’re trying to stabilize the patient first.”",White House pauses testimony for officials handling coronavirus response,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/white-house-coronavirus-officials-testimony-135806,politico
"Last week, to protect the Supreme Court from coronavirus, Chief Justice John Roberts banned visitors and then this week postponed hearing oral arguments altogether. But the virus isn’t the only thing endangering the court, and the chief justice should also take steps to protect the institution. Last month, President Donald Trump questioned the impartiality of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, suggesting they recuse themselves from cases involving him. Earlier this month, while addressing a crowd gathered outside the Supreme Court building, Sen. Chuck Schumer seemingly threatened Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, saying the two would “pay the price” for their conservative decisions. Roberts issued a swift public statement admonishing Schumer for politicizing the court, and Schumer responded by accusing Roberts of deliberately misinterpreting his comments while staying silent about Trump’s similar rhetoric. In fact, Roberts has been fighting against the perceived political leanings of judges for some time. In 2018, in response to Trump’s claim that “Obama judges” rule against his administration’s policies, Roberts rebutted that there are no “Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.”  But if Roberts is serious about protecting his fellow jurists from future political attacks, then he must do more than issue stern statements of disapproval. Instead, he should reconsider the way the court conveys its decisions to the public. Specifically, he should make per curiam opinions—anonymous opinions, issued without disclosing the identity of the authoring judge or the voting blocs’ membership—the new standard. Per curiam opinions circumvent the political cues associated with a given justice’s identity and instead allow the court to present its holdings as an institution. Not only would this shield the justices from being targeted as individuals, but research also shows that it would strengthen public support for the court’s decisions. From the Supreme Court’s perspective, political attacks against its members are worrisome, no matter who levies them. Without a mechanism to enforce its holdings, the Supreme Court must rely on the other political branches to respect its decisions. Critiques that frame the court’s behavior as political can erode its perception as a legitimate institution. And without widely accepted public deference, the court is powerless. The court has issued per curiam opinions throughout its history, although its use of these opinions has been far from methodical, ranging from landmark cases to the mundane with no rhyme or reason up to now as to why. Systematically removing the identity of the opinions’ authors would convey several benefits. First, peer-reviewed research, conducted by myself and several coauthors, has shown that the use of per curiam opinions strengthens the level of support decisions receive. In a series of survey experiments, we held constant a court opinion’s content—that is, the actual legal holding of the case—but we randomized the identity of the authoring justice. In one study, we investigated whether support for a given case was conditioned on the ideology of the authoring justice. In another, we sought to gauge whether the use of per curiam opinions garnered more support compared to cases with an identified author. In both instances, we found that individuals adjust their level of agreement based on their perception of the opinion author rather than the case disposition itself, and per curiam opinions garnered the greatest level of support of all. Second, from a practical standpoint, there would be no way for a political actor to target an individual justice for a disagreeable per curiam opinion. Being unable to target a single justice leaves only the Supreme Court—as an institution—as a possible target. And the risk that such general attacks will spark an institutional crisis for the court is low, because the public has long held the court as a whole in high regard, at least compared with Congress and the Executive, irrespective of the opinions they may hold toward individual justices. The court currently enjoys its highest level of approval since 2009—despite being entangled in pronounced Senate gamesmanship since Justice Antonin Scalia’s passing in 2016. Even among those who view the court as more of a political institution than a legal one, research indicates that individuals are reluctant to support drastic political reprisals against the court and its justices, such as efforts to “pack” the court or to impeach justices. And even those more extensive reforms would only exacerbate the particularized attacks by politicians against individual justices, which Roberts has described as “inappropriate” and “dangerous.”  Instituting the norm of per curiam opinions would be easy because the Supreme Court already issues such holdings, albeit infrequently. Since 2013, from six to 14 cases per term have been per curiam majority opinions, and so far this term these opinions account for three of the court’s 14 holdings. Per curiam opinions are distributed fairly evenly across issue areas, and the voting blocs within these types of cases vary from 5-4 splits to unanimous decisions and everything in between. Whether or not a case will be decided per curiam is within the chief justice’s control. And to be sure, these sorts of opinions up to now have not been reserved for inconsequential or unimportant cases. Bush v. Gore is but one example of a per curiam majority opinion used in a prominent, highly political case. Chief Justice John Marshall, during the court’s infancy, established the norm of announcing a decision via a single Opinion of the Court, penned by a justice in the majority—rather than a series of opinions written by each member of the bench. (Thomas Jefferson supported the prior setup of “seriatim” opinions, which still, on rare occasion, are used today.) In the same way, Roberts can establish a new norm of per curiam opinions.  Some critics have spoken out in the past against the use of per curiam opinions, claiming this form of legal decision skirts the notion of judicial accountability. But this critique glosses over a cornerstone principle of our constitutional framework: judicial independence. The reason the Constitution grants Supreme Court justices life tenure—rather than connecting them to the populace through regular elections—is to ensure that they are able to make decisions free from outside influences, especially political pressure. Our system of government allows for the judiciary to be checked by constitutional amendments, not individualized, political finger-pointing. What’s more, the use of per curiam opinions does not forgo internal accountability from within the court. Dissenting opinions may still be used by the minority bloc as an effective method for calling the public’s attention to any flaws or shortcomings in the per curiam majority opinion’s reasoning, consequently laying the groundwork for future legal challenges. The politicization of the Supreme Court by outside actors, and the popular discourse it creates, stands in stark contrast with the court’s reality. Since Roberts was confirmed as chief justice in 2005, 79 percent of cases have been decided by something other than a 5-4 split, and unanimous decisions have been the most common.  Of course, justices may be averse to changing the deep-rooted tradition of issuing signed opinions. And there’s no doubt, as Ginsburg herself notes, that disclosing “votes and opinion writers may nourish a judge’s ego,” so directing justices to cede the renown that can accompany authoring revered decisions may be a tall order. But there’s also little reason to suspect political attacks against the Supreme Court will stop any time soon without intervention. Protracted politicization puts the court on tenuous footing, and the chief justice can do more to act on his presumably sincere desire to insulate the court’s members from further political targeting. The exclusive use of per curiam opinions would erect a formidable defense against such future attacks while cementing the chief justice’s legacy as a vigilant protector of “the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court” that he so long ago promised to be.",The One Change John Roberts Can Make to Depoliticize the Supreme Court,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/john-roberts-political-supreme-court-opinions-135769,politico
"Senate Democrats and unions appear to be hardening their desire to attach strings to airline aid for coronavirus relief, and Wednesday slammed the White House’s $50 billion proposal for airlines, calling for stricter limits on executive bonuses, stock buybacks and even carbon emissions. The White House package would allow $50 billion in secured loans for the airline industry with limits on increases in executive compensation until they are repaid, according to a memo by the Treasury Department. But the head of one of the biggest U.S. unions for flight attendants scoffed in response. ""Is this a joke?"" tweeted Sara Nelson, the head of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA in response to the White House plan. ""No more buybacks. No more bonuses. We need to make sure money goes to workers — period."" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he wouldn’t support $50 billion in loans to airlines unless more conditions are attached. Along with “really severe limits on executive compensation,” Blumenthal said there should be “conditions that protect workers.” He said pilots and flight attendants should have “better working conditions” and higher pay and that airlines must “commit to do better” in terms of charges, fees, baggage handling and seat size. Earlier Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also targeted airline stock buybacks in comments on the Senate floor. The practice has attracted criticism from progressive Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after the airline industry requested a nearly $60 billion bailout from Congress this week, including $29 billion in grants and another $29 billion in loans or loan guarantees. “One of the reasons, let’s not forget, that many airlines are so short of cash right now is they spent billions on stock buybacks — money they had to send out when they should have been saving it for a rainy day, for their workers and customers,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday. “That issue should be addressed.” Later, Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told POLITICO that demands could also include limits on executive pay and provisions that would see taxpayers take on stock in airlines, similar to how the government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis. ""If we do anything like that, it would have to be done on a business-like basis, which would be demanding preferred shares in the company, so when they recover, taxpayers will get the benefit of the investment,"" Reed (D-R.I.) said. ""We have restrictions on share buybacks, on dividends, on executive pay, we make sure their workforce is treated fairly, that they're not the victims of this after use of our resources — similar to some of the things we did with the banks Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) said she wanted to ensure that airplane mechanics aren't put out of work, saying ""the last time this happened, we wiped out the heavy repair industry and all those jobs went to Mexico and Brazil."" ""The last time we helped out the airlines we didn’t actually put any guardrails around some of this money, whether it’s task credits for repair work — so the maintenance companies actually went out of business,"" she added. ""The airlines came back but all of those maintenance jobs went overseas and we need to make sure that we keep those jobs here. So the MROs, the maintenance repair operators, they need to be protected as well."" Some Senate Republicans have cringed at the idea of “bailing out” industry, but on Wednesday, a key Republican appeared open to the idea of providing loans. Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said he “would have some real concerns” about a “bailout” for the airline industry, but loans are “different.” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who leads the Senate’s transportation spending panel, said she has spoken with some airlines and she has “no doubt that this is a financial crisis for them.” “And I think, given their importance to our economy, and to our eventual recovery, that we are going to have to provide some sort of assistance — whether it should be in the form of loans, secured loans, I’m not sure yet,” Collins said. Separately, a group of eight Democratic senators led by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, wrote to congressional leadership today asking them to include provisions pushing the airline sector to cut carbon emissions in any aid package. The sector produces about 2.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions today. “Given the poor records of some companies in these industries, we believe that any such financial assistance should be paired with requirements that companies act in a more responsible fashion,” read the letter, also signed by Sens. Martin Heinrich (N.M.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (Ct.), Tina Smith (Minn.) and Debbie Stabenow (Mich.).

"The stock market’s latest plunge on Wednesday did more than wipe out billions of dollars in investor equity. It also nearly obliterated President Donald Trump’s favorite measure of his economic success. The Dow Jones Industrial Average's decline below 20,000 almost completely erased all of the iconic index's previous gains since Trump's inauguration, jeopardizing a key talking point for his reelection campaign. Earlier in the day, the S&P 500 fell by more than 7 percent, triggering a marketwide trading halt. Since his 2016 victory, Trump has tweeted dozens of times about the record stock gains under his watch, posting as recently as Feb. 19 that it was the “Highest Stock Market In History, By Far!” He has repeatedly suggested that Americans check their 401(k)s to tote up their gains, and argued that the markets would have crashed had Hillary Clinton defeated him. Now the upheaval sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with plunging oil prices and fears that shares were already inflated, has panicked investors, sending the Dow below the 19,827 where it stood on Jan. 20, 2017, the day Trump was inaugurated. Stocks pared their losses late in the day, and the Dow closed at 19,904. Trump, for his part, always uses the election as the starting point, noting that the market surged the morning after the results were in. The Dow closed at 18,332, on Nov. 8, 2016, Election Day. Trump's top economic aides have also eagerly made the connection between the health of the stock market and the success of his presidency. In a CNBC interview a month after Trump’s inauguration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he “absolutely” views the stock market as a “report card” for the administration. The stock plunge underscores the risk Trump took in tying his presidential reputation to stock prices, which can go down as easily as they can go up, and in any case are only one indicator of the health of the economy. President Barack Obama, for instance, oversaw one of the longest bull runs ever in the markets, but economic growth averaged just a tepid 1.6 percent through his two terms in office. “Letting equity markets grade your performance is perilous, and this is why,” said Tony Fratto, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies and a former Treasury Department official. “Markets are fickle. There are things far beyond your control.” “They can point to the coronavirus and say the market was great except for that, but it may be a long time before the market recovers,” he added. “And now they have to shift to focusing on underlying fundamentals, which is what they should have been focused on all along.” The more than 6 percent drop in the Dow today comes after weeks of whipsawing prices in markets, including three more times in the past couple of weeks where stocks dropped enough that it triggered a “circuit breaker” that caused a halt in trading for 15 minutes. Stocks could fall further as investors continue to seek more dramatic action from the administration and Congress to shore up the economy.","Dow tumbles again, nearly wiping out gains of Trump’s presidency",2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/donald-trump-stock-market-dip-135807,politico
"President Donald Trump said Wednesday the Department of Housing and Urban Development will suspend foreclosures and evictions for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration until the end of April, a move that will affect about 8.1 million mortgages. The Federal Housing Finance Agency also ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the companies behind about half of the nation’s $11 trillion mortgage market, to suspend foreclosures and evictions for any single-family mortgages they back for “at least 60 days,” the agency said.  Trump's move, announced at a White House press conference, is part of a broad-based response by the administration to the fallout from the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic, which threatens to shut down large swaths of the economy and has wreaked havoc in many countries overseas. FHFA Director Mark Calabria said the foreclosure and eviction suspension will allow people ""to stay in their homes during this national emergency,” Fannie and Freddie ""are working with mortgage servicers to ensure that borrowers facing hardship because of the coronavirus can get assistance,” Calabria said in a statement, adding that those borrowers should get in touch with their mortgage servicers as quickly as possible. Calabria told economists on a conference call this afternoon that the agency is seeking to help both those borrowers affected by the virus and those who were struggling to make payments before the outbreak. Out of a public health concern, he said, Fannie and Freddie would make sure people who were already behind on their mortgages aren’t evicted and put on the street in the middle of a pandemic. HUD Deputy Secretary Brian Montgomery said he has not been in any discussions with the Trump administration about urging commercial lenders to suspend mortgage payments in the crisis. Italy suspended mortgage payments last week. Montgomery said the FHA has a “robust set of tools” to deal with turmoil in the housing market in a crisis, noting they’ve suspended foreclosures and evictions before at a regional level in the wake of natural disasters like hurricanes. “For the time being, it just hits the pause button and provides steadiness to the housing market,” Montgomery said in a phone interview. “This is a first step; people who were concerned about [losing their homes] can cross that off their list for now.” The FHFA earlier this month had announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would provide payment forbearance — allowing mortgage payments to be suspended for up to a year — to borrowers hit by the outbreak. The two government-owned enterprises also reminded mortgage servicers that hardship forbearance is an option for borrowers unable to make payments. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Kathy Kraninger, the chief official tasked with helping consumers struggling with the economic fallout from the outbreak, released a statement today praising the housing agencies for the suspensions. The bureau has “encouraged financial institutions to work with their customers affected by the coronavirus,” Kraninger said in an email. “Consumers’ first stop in the face of hardship is with their creditors and their financial institutions, so our message was important for regulated entities to hear,” she added.","HUD, Fannie, Freddie suspend foreclosures, evictions during outbreak",2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/hud-suspends-foreclosures-evictions-coronavirus-135783,politico
"U.S. stock exchanges temporarily halted trading Wednesday, as coronavirus fears again sent stock prices plummeting in a massive selloff. Shortly before 1 p.m., the S&P 500 index hit the 7 percent decline needed to trigger a mandatory 15-minute break under Securities and Exchange Commission trading rules. It was the fourth mandatory break in two weeks as economic damage from the virus has triggered a punishing series of trading runs. As was the case on Monday, pre-market trading had already shown signs of strain in stock futures. By the time markets opened, all three major indices — the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite index — had dropped 5 percent, hitting the maximum allowable selloff for futures before the start of trading. That outlook persisted despite the fact the White House spoke Monday and Tuesday of plans for spending hundreds of billions of dollars to help ease the economic damage caused by virus-related shutdowns and layoffs. And the Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced significant expansions in lending from a stabilization fund to make sure creditworthy businesses could continue to access funding. Following all those announcements, markets recovered slightly during trading Tuesday, with the S&P advancing 6 percent. But Tuesday's bounce followed a historic bloodbath in the markets on Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst single-point loss in history, declining 2,999 points or 12.9 percent. Investors were clearly expecting a rough start to the week after a weekend of government announcements to rapidly expand containment measures, including through school closures as well as shuttering bars and restaurants. The Federal Reserve also cut interest rates to zero on Sunday, but that didn't avert the selloff. There are three possible market-wide circuit breakers, which regulators put in place in 2013 to ensure that declines in stocks are orderly. If the S&P 500 index drops 7 percent or 13 percent before 3:25 p.m., trading will stop for 15 minutes. After 3:25 p.m., declines in those levels don’t halt market-wide trading. But a 20 percent market decline at any time of day halts trading for the rest of the day. There were two trading pauses last week and one on Monday. Before that, the only time a market-wide break occurred was in 1997, under different thresholds and rules established by the SEC following a stock market crash in 1987.",Stock plunge triggers fourth trading pause in 2 weeks,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/stock-plunge-triggers-trading-pause-135792,politico

"President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday he is dispatching the Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort to New York Harbor, while also invoking the Defense Production Act to expand the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak. Speaking beside Trump in the White House, Defense Secretary Mark Esper also announced that he has alerted field and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as needed to support the response. The Navy has two hospital ships. The other, USNS Mercy, is being prepared to deploy to a location on the West Coast, Trump said. The ships will be launched in the next week, he said, noting that he spoke with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who announced the Comfort deployment in a press conference minutes before the president's comments. ""They are in tip-top shape,"" Trump said. The Navy is getting ships crewed and ready to launch, defense officials said. Mercy should be underway in days, but Comfort could take two weeks to deploy because it is still finishing up maintenance, according to chief Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman. Esper told reporters Tuesday that the Pentagon is preparing the ships, which are equipped with 1,000 hospital beds each, for a potential deployment to hotspots to relieve civilian hospitals dealing with the virus. Defense officials noted that the hospital ships aren't conducive to containing infectious disease outbreaks, but can be used to treat non-coronavirus patients while existing medical facilities focus on disease treatment. ""Our capabilities are focused on trauma ... they don't have necessarily the segregated spaces that you need to deal with infectious diseases,"" Esper said Tuesday, adding that deploying the hospital ships could ""take the pressure off of civilian hospitals when it comes to trauma cases to open up civilian hospital rooms for infectious diseases."" In addition to the hospital ships, the Pentagon has put on alert 1,000 ""deployable"" beds from a variety of different medical units, said Joint Staff Surgeon Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs. These temporary units are designed to deal with trauma patients, he said. Esper said Wednesday that Army Corps of Engineers officials are in New York meeting with Cuomo to go over options for additional actions. Separately, the Pentagon has opened its 16 certified coronavirus testing labs to test non-DoD personnel, will make available up to 5 million respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from its own reserves and distribute up to 2,000 deployable ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services, Esper said. Meanwhile, the Air Force on Tuesday flew 500,000 swabs used as part of testing kits from Italy to Memphis, Tenn., on a military cargo plane, officials said, confirming a report by Defense One. In Memphis, the shipment was loaded onto FedEx aircraft and distributed per HHS direction around the country, Hoffman said. The Air Force is in discussions to provide additional transport capability for test kits, and to support evacuations with cargo aircraft modified to treat infectious diseases, according to Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein. By invoking the Defense Production Act, the administration would be allowed to direct U.S. industry to ramp up production of critical medical supplies. The act, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is designed ""to expedite and expand the supply of resources from the U.S. industrial base to support military, energy, space, and homeland security programs."" ""We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary to enable that our contracts go to the front of the line on contracting,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters on Feb. 28.

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday began to invoke the rhetoric of “a wartime president” as he told reporters he views himself as one, while his administration fights to contain the spread of coronavirus and mitigate the economic fallout from the global pandemic. “I do, I actually do, I'm looking at it that way,” Trump told reporters during a press briefing at the White House when asked whether he considered the U.S. to be on a wartime footing. “I look at it, I view it as, in a sense, a wartime president. I mean, that's what we're fighting.“ Trump has repeatedly referred to U.S. attempts to battle the virus — which has sickened thousands across the U.S. and killed more than 100 — as a “war” against an “invisible enemy.” But during Wednesday’s briefing he went the furthest yet in adopting the rhetoric of a commander in chief during wartime.  At the top of his remarks, the president pointed to the havoc the virus has begun to wreak on the economy, telling reporters in the White House briefing room that the pandemic would require a response unseen since World War II. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” he told reporters, offering examples like teenagers volunteering to fight in the war and workers sleeping on factory floors. “To this day, nobody has ever seen like it, what they were able to do during World War II,” he continued. “Now it's our time. We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we will come through together. It's the invisible enemy. That's always the toughest enemy, the invisible enemy.” ""It's a very tough situation here. You have to do things,” he explained later. “You have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they've ever been. And then one day you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy ... but we're doing it and we're doing it well.” The comments coincided with a number of announcements from the president on an expanded coronavirus response across the federal government centered on a mobilization of military resources at the Pentagon as the outbreak worsens. The number of confirmed cases has exploded in recent weeks, with deaths topping 100 for the first time on Tuesday night and one Washington county alone reporting 10 new deaths Wednesday afternoon.  Trump for the first time said he would invoke the Defense Production Act, and announced the deployment of military hospital ships to virus hotspots, though he later wrote in a tweet that he had only done so “should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future.“ Additionally, Trump declared that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was now “fully engaged at the highest levels” and operating in every region of the country, though he didn’t elaborate. He also announced that his housing department would temporarily suspend evictions and foreclosures. The unfamiliar rhetoric from Trump came as Congress is speeding to put a second multibillion-dollar emergency aid package on his desk this week before immediately turning to a third package to prop up industries that have been gutted by the outbreak. Trump also announced a slew of other measures aimed at blunting the spread of the virus, including that his administration is looking into self-administered coronavirus tests in an effort to dramatically expand access to tests for the fast-spreading disease. Trump told reporters that his administration is working with “several groups” to determine whether a “self-swab” is as accurate as the tests health providers are currently performing. He added he's pushing for speedy FDA approval of the self-swab test that people can do themselves. He didn’t elaborate on the timeline of getting the diagnostic to market, or who’s producing it. “It would free up a lot,” Trump argued. The new process, he said, would be a “much easier process than the current process that's not very nice to do — I can tell you, because I did it. But we have a current process that's a little bit difficult, if you haven't done.” Trump announced last weekend that the White House physician had tested him for coronavirus late Friday evening. Late Saturday his top spokesperson, Stephanie Grisham, issued a memo saying the president did not have the virus. On Wednesday, Trump also said that he would invoke the Defense Production Act, which would significantly increase the production of critical equipment including hospital beds and other medical supplies by allowing the administration to direct U.S. industry to ramp up production of critical medical supplies. Officials have repeatedly warned of a shortage of ventilators and respirators to treat patients who have tested positive for coronavirus, as well as masks for health care providers. Administration officials couldn’t clarify how many ventilators are currently available around the country for critically sick COVID-19 patients, and Trump conceded the system was caught off-guard with the shortfall in ventilator supply — calling the situation a “very unforeseen thing.” “We have tremendous numbers of ventilators but there's never been an instance like this, where no matter what you have it’s not enough,” Trump said. Vice President Mike Pence said the government had more than 10,000 ventilators stockpiled to deploy out to hospitals, roughly echoing an estimate from over the weekend from the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who had put the number at just under 13,000. The Defense Department pledged on Tuesday to send HHS about 2,000 ventilators to add to its stock — but as growing numbers of hospital report shortages, it’s unclear whether supply can keep up with mounting critical cases.  Several local and state leaders had been pleading with Trump for several days to deploy military resources to assist in fighting the disease, including asking the Army Corps of Engineers to quickly erect hospitals to house coronavirus patients. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said during Wednesday’s briefing that the Army Corps was in New York — which has become the biggest hot spot on the East Coast — meeting with leaders there, while Trump announced that the Pentagon was deploying two military hospital ships: one there and another to an undetermined location on the West Coast. Esper added that he’d put a number of field and expeditionary hospitals on notice for deployment at Trump’s request.  In addition, Trump said that the Department of Housing and Urban development, in an attempt to provide “immediate relief” for homeowners and renters, would be suspending foreclosures and evictions through the end of April. Amid the mad scramble and confusion over shortages in protective gear for front-line hospital workers, the Center on Medicare and Medicaid Services is recommending conservation as of Wednesday. In another attempt to avoid overcrowding in hospitals, Pence and CMS Administrator Seema Verma urged hospitals to delay elective procedures “across the country in our healthcare system to ensure that medical supplies and medical capacity go where they are needed most.” Verma urged a widespread limit on elective medical visits and surgeries — like dental visits — where clinicians need masks, but announced that more detailed rules would come later in the day, although they won’t be mandatory as some local officials have threatened. “We believe that these recommendations will help surgeons, patients and hospitals prioritize what is essential, while leaving the ultimate decision and the heads of state and local health officials and those clinicians who have direct responsibility to their patients,” she said. “And we urge providers and clinicians and patients to seriously consider these recommendations. They will not only preserve equipment, but it also allows doctors and nurses to help those that are on the front lines. And it'll protect patients from unnecessary exposure to the virus.” Front-line doctors and nurses are worried specifically about the dwindling supplies of respirator masks, which they need for intubating a critically sick COVID-19 patient to protect themselves against infection. But clinicians treating infectious diseases burn through protective gear quickly, and some doctors have already begun to get sick themselves.  The Defense Department is offering five million masks, but only one million of these are available right away. Trump acknowledged the pressing need, as hospitals continue reporting that they’re days away from running out of their supplies.  “We have targets for masks, the numbers of masks are incredible,” he said. “We've ordered millions of them. But we need millions more. A thing like this has never been requested, and we've never had to even think in terms of these numbers. But we need millions of masks and all that will be ordered.” Nearly one-third of nursing homes, whose residents are among those most at risk of dying from the virus, don’t have these masks on hand, nor are they used to supplying them. Also at Wednesday’s briefing, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, sounded a new alarm about data that show young people as well as old are getting seriously ill from COVID-19, flagging concerns based on reports from Italy and France that show some cases of young people in critical hospital care.  “It may have been that the millennial generation — our largest generation, our future generation that will carry us through for the next multiple decades — there may be disproportional numbers of infections among that group,” she said. Birx also sent out an urgent call for young people to stay home if their offices or schools have shuttered, and to conscientiously avoid social gatherings.  “We can't have these large gatherings that constantly do occur throughout the country for people who are off work, to then be socializing in large groups and spreading the virus,” she said. Photos from earlier in the week showed thousands of people flocking to Florida beaches, where the pandemic didn’t appear to stall spring break activities even as the rest of the country was shutting down. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis responded Tuesday by ordering a crack-down on beach crowds and warned that beachgoers would have to adhere to the CDC guidelines of social distancing. Despite looking to project a sense of control over the pandemic on Wednesday, Trump rejected challenges to his credibility and a lack of confidence in his handling of the outbreak.  When one reporter pointed to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll from the day before that found 60 percent of Americans putting “not very much” or no trust in Trump to handle the crisis, the president pointed to his overall approval rating among Republicans, which has remained high. He then pivoted to a brief attack on former Vice President Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. Trump also flatly denied that he’d seen an internal report from the Department of Health and Human Services predicting that the outbreak could stretch as much as 18 months, and sparred with reporters over his recent references to the virus as the “Chinese virus.” Meanwhile, stock markets dove during the White House briefing.  Just before the coronavirus task force wrapped up its briefing, the S&P 500 index hit the 7 percent decline needed to trigger a mandatory 15-minute break under SEC rules — the fourth such triggering of the so-called circuit breaker in two weeks.",Trump labels himself ‘a wartime president’ combating coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-administration-self-swab-coronavirus-tests-135590,politico
"Nearly 500 Homeland Security employees are quarantined because of the novel coronavirus, and at least 13 are confirmed or presumed COVID-19 positive, according to documentation reviewed by POLITICO.   A DHS spokesperson would not to comment on the record for this story. The department previously revealed that eight Transportation Security Administration officers had contracted COVID-19. But the latest numbers are higher and highlight the challenge the novel coronavirus poses to the federal workforce. More than 240,000 people work for DHS, making it the third-largest workforce in the federal government. Many of those employees interact with numerous people every day as part of their work, including employees with Customs and Border Protection and the TSA. “The department’s leadership is going to have to pay very close attention as this public health crisis evolves,” said John Cohen, former acting undersecretary of intelligence and analysis. “It has to be concerned that its ability to carry out its core mission could be compromised if there’s a widespread outbreak of the virus among DHS personnel. And quite frankly, that’s something that federal, state, and local officials need to be concerned about across the board — that this virus will spread among first responders, law enforcement, and Homeland Security personnel, compromising the ability of those organizations to protect the public.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have advised people to “put distance” between themselves and others if the virus is spreading in their community. Thousands of Americans are following this directive, and numerous workplaces have directed their employees to work from home.  The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents TSA officers, has criticized the department over its handling of the outbreak. The union pushed for them to be able to wear respirators at work, but, according to a statement from AFGE, TSA management refused, only allowing surgical masks.  A TSA spokesperson said the agency is deferring to CDC guidance that such respirators should be reserved for health care workers. The safety of the DHS workforce has also drawn attention from the Hill.  “It’s important to remember that during this pandemic, the DHS workforce is still manning the frontlines, protecting our skies and borders,” House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson said in a statement. “It’s critical they are properly protected — and the Administration has a long-term plan for this. Not just for their own health and safety, but to ensure we have a fully functional frontline workforce in the months to come.” The diagnoses and quarantines come as DHS employees have faced significant strain under the Trump administration, according to David Lapan, the department’s chief spokesperson for the first nine months of Trump’s presidency.  “Because of the president’s outsized focus on the immigration enforcement part of the DHS mission set — since immigration is not the only thing in DHS’ mission — the organization has been under a lot of strain over the last three years,” he said. “The focus on immigration, lots of attention, lots of presidential pressure, vacancies, changes in leadership, the government shutdown, people having to work without pay — after all of that, add on this pandemic and I think you have cause for concern about a workforce that has been under extended stress now having to endure yet more.”",Documents show undisclosed coronavirus cases at DHS,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/undisclosed-coronavirus-cases-at-homeland-security-135569,politico
"The COVID-19 outbreak is causing massive disruption to the U.S. economy as global supply chains break down, travel is canceled and people practice “social distancing,” avoiding everything from restaurants and retail outlets to conferences and office meetings. One-fifth of U.S. workers already report losing hours or work because of the pandemic.  Worker layoffs are often seen as an inevitable part of an economic crisis like the one we’re living through. Unfortunately, job losses carry a high price for individuals and the economy—laid-off workers have less income to take care of their families, lose access to health insurance and deepen the economic crisis by spending less. And, laying off workers can even slow a recovery when employers must spend valuable time and money to rebuild their workforce as the economy improves.  But, unless a business has been forced to fully close, there’s a way to keep workers on the payroll, ease the pain of a downturn and speed economic recovery. It’s called “work-sharing.”  This is an idea that other countries have used in past downturns to far greater effect than the United States. State and federal officials should act now to ramp up this option here. Twenty-six states covering about 70 percent of the U.S. workforce already have formal programs to provide financial help to employers who embrace shared-work policies; those states need to do more to make employers aware of the option. And states that don’t yet have formal shared-work programs can and should put them in place quickly.  Here’s how work-sharing, or “short-time compensation” programs work. Employers experiencing a temporary reduction in business agree to cut employees’ hours instead of laying off workers entirely. Employees on reduced hours receive unemployment benefits in proportion to the reduction in their hours. Businesses benefit by retaining valued employees and avoiding recruitment and training costs when economic conditions return to normal. Workers benefit by retaining most of their income and access to health insurance — a critical factor in a public health-triggered economic crisis like this one.  By helping to keep people in their jobs, work-share programs mitigate unemployment. And short-time compensation benefits are well targeted, reaching exactly the people who are suffering a drop in earnings and are likely to need the money the most. In this sense, they are better targeted and more likely to provide direct economic stimulus than cutting payroll taxes or sending checks to everyone.  In short, shared-work programs are specifically designed to help businesses and workers—and their communities—get through temporary economic disruptions like those caused by COVID-19.  Business surveys show that employers using shared-compensation programs are overwhelmingly very satisfied with them. The problem is that, even in states with a short-term compensation program, most businesses don’t know about the option. During the Great Recession—a period when shared work could have been helpful to many businesses—relatively few employers operating in states with shared-work programs made use of them. In response, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 included provisions to bolster use. Under the law, the federal government funded state marketing to raise employer awareness about the program and reimbursed states’ short-time compensation costs for three years.  Our research shows that even modest efforts to advertise short-time compensation programs can significantly raise employer awareness and use. In large demonstration projects done in cooperation with Oregon and Iowa, we found that low-key advertising campaigns raised employer awareness of the shared-work option by 15 to 30 percentage points. In Oregon, these efforts increased employer participation in work-share plans by 50 to 100 percent. These demonstrations were run during an economic expansion; Outreach should be even more effective during a slowdown—like the one we are currently experiencing.  What should states and the federal government do now to ensure that employers can and will implement work-sharing?  First, states with short-time compensation options should do more to get the word out to employers. Public service announcements, mailings and targeted outreach in industries where sales are especially hard-hit by the coronavirus outbreak can be effective ways to quickly reach businesses that might benefit from the program. Federal subsidies could help to spur such outreach.  Second, the federal government should subsidize states’ short-time compensation programs during the COVID-19 crisis. Under existing law, employers’ unemployment insurance tax rates are tied to the past benefits paid to their workers. This means that many employers’ unemployment insurance tax rates will increase if they lay off workers or use work-share programs. Congress should pass legislation providing reimbursement to states for the costs of work-share benefits paid during the current crisis and stipulate that the tax rates of employers who set up short-time compensation plans will not go up. Some employers might choose to reduce employee hours instead of laying off people regardless, but unless they participate in a work-share program, their employees will not have access to prorated unemployment insurance benefits. Removing the tax consequences of participation in work share should increase employer use of this beneficial program that gets money to people who need it.  Third, states without a short-time compensation option should move quickly to adopt it as part of their unemployment insurance system. The current crisis—which we hope will be relatively short-lived—is a perfect example of the circumstances in which short-time compensation can be most helpful to businesses, workers and communities. It’s better for workers and for their communities if temporary downturns don’t turn into permanent job loss. Every state in the country needs this option.  Short-time compensation is a crisis-mitigation tool we already have in our arsenal to fight this pandemic’s economic fallout. Other countries already are taking steps to encourage the use of shared work during this crisis. Federal and state decision-makers need to act quickly to make it available throughout the United States. The health of our population — and our economy — may depend on it.

"Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey announced Wednesday the state is delaying primary runoff elections that were scheduled for later this month until July 14 because of concerns about coronavirus, delaying the GOP Senate runoff between former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville for more than three months. ""The ability to hold free and fair elections is an inherent right as citizens of the United States and the great state of Alabama, but the safety and wellbeing of Alabama citizens is paramount,"" Ivey said in a statement released by her office. Tuberville and Sessions finished in the top two spots in the March 3 primary and were set to face each other in the March 31 runoff to face Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. Ivey's decision delays Republicans nominating a candidate to face Jones for more than three months. The race is Republicans' top offensive target on the Senate map this cycle and has significant implications for which party controls the Senate next year. President Donald Trump endorsed Tuberville after the former football coach earned the top spot in the primary, a blow to Sessions campaign with just weeks until the original runoff date. It's unclear how the postponement will affect the race, although it will likely force both candidates to raise significantly more funds for the intraparty election and delay the beginning of a general election campaign against Jones, who won his party's primary uncontested. Sessions said in a statement that the ""safety and health of Alabamians must take precedence."" He also took a shot at Tuberville, hinting at the implications of a longer primary election between the two candidates. “We intend to maintain our vigorous campaign up until the last day, even as we are careful to do so in a manner that puts the health and safety of the public first,"" Sessions said. ""It will be very difficult for Tommy Tuberville to hide from debates for four months. He will have to conquer his fears, and face me and the voters.” In a statement from his campaign, Tuberville said he understood the decision to delay the election. His campaign did not address Sessions' criticism. ""I understand Gov. Ivey's decision to postpone the runoff until July 14 and join her in encouraging all Alabamians to stay safe, be kind to their fellow citizens and follow all guidelines related to the Coronavirus,"" Tuberville said. ""I pray that the current health crisis will be brought under control and that lives will be saved."" Jones, in a statement, also praised the decision. He called for expanding voting access by enacting early voting and expanding vote-by-mail. Ivey, during a press conference announcing the decision to postpone the runoff, said she did not see a reason to implement no-excuse absentee voting or expanding vote-by-mail, but also encouraged voters to request absentee ballots by citing health concerns over coronavirus. The decision also postpones runoffs between Republicans running in for two open, GOP-leaning congressional seats.",Alabama Senate runoff postponed until July,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/alabama-senate-runoff-postponed-coronavirus-135557,politico

"The coronavirus pandemic has yet to land fully and already some U.S. industries are angling for federal bailouts. The airlines want $60 billion in direct assistance and loan guarantees to counter the passenger fall-off, compared with the $15 billion they received after 9/11. The casino industry has thrust out its hat, as have the cruise lines, the hospitality industry, the oil shale operators and others. While the coronavirus crisis—and all but certain recession—is real and demands emergency action, the government must resist dispensing cash aid to every imperiled industry and faction that petitions for help. No industry, no single company, no individual has an automatic moral claim on the contents of the U.S. Treasury, no matter how severely the crisis has injured their bottom lines. Nor does the federal government have the capacity to restore every industry company and individual to their prior economic standing. Today’s trickle of requests will likely turn into a stampede if the government blindly accedes to corporate requests. Already, entrenched K Street lobbyists are presenting their “asks” to the federal government, as POLITICO’s Theodoric Meyer reports. As we draw the blueprint for how best to enlist the government in rebuilding the wounded economy, let’s study the lessons taught by earlier bailouts so we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past. In 2001, the federal government bailed out the airline industry with a $15 billion package. But by 2004, the program’s deficiencies were glaring. The airlines were already in trouble before 9/11, and the bailout propped up the ailing ones at the expense of the healthy ones, as the New York Times reported in a 2004 postmortem. “The bailout program may actually have made matters worse, some experts say, by forestalling a badly needed shakeout in the industry, keeping the weakest carriers alive at the expense of the others and perpetuating a glut of flights and seats,” the Times wrote. CBS News later reported that some of the bailout money went to already bankrupt companies, package delivery fleets and Grand Canyon tour helicopters. Today, and presumably for the coming months, the government is discouraging discretionary travel to beat the virus, which means we won’t need as many airline seats in the short term. The rational thing for the government to do would be to let the weaker airlines go out of business as the stronger but still viable carriers continue flying under Chapter 11 bankruptcy—as they have done in previous airline downturns. A new airline bailout would only repeat 2001’s mistake of preserving the weaker airlines at the expense of the better-run ones. The biggest Washington bailouts have traditionally gone to the largest, most politically connected industries: The railroads, the automakers, aviation, the banks. The Tuesday Washington Post explains how the cruise lines, less crucial to the economy than the railroads, automakers and banks, might soon navigate their way to the federal trough. President Donald Trump counts Carnival Corp. Chairman Micky Arison as a friend. His firm was also an advertiser on Trump’s Apprentice show. The Norwegian Cruise Line has also made friends with the Trumps. It made a $100,000 donation to his foundation in 2005 after Melania Trump christened one of its ships. (She was named the ship’s “godmother.”) Brian Ballard and Pam Bondi, two Trump loyalists, were registered lobbyists for Carnival North American last year. Meanwhile, the federal government’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising travelers against taking a cruise. What sort of sense does it make for one branch of the government to discourage cruise travel and another to encourage continued voyages with subsidies? This would be as crazy as the government subsidizing tobacco farmers at the same time it spends millions on discouraging smoking—something that it does. So I guess there’s a precedent, but it’s an insane one.  The fattest target among the bailout pleaders is the casino industry. Trump, by the way, was once a casino owner and counts among his biggest campaign donors the casino megaowner Sheldon Adelson. On Monday, the gambling lobby told the Washington Post that the $260 billion industry was at a “near standstill” and begging for funds to continue. While sympathies should go out to every showgirl, valet, bartender, maid and craps dealer on the Las Vegas strip, it’s unconscionable to use federal money to prop up an industry that serves gamblers! Gambling, like attending a movie or baseball game, is entertainment, and hardly essential to our way of life the way electricity, roadways, food and shelter are. If we’re performing economic triage, there can’t be a worse candidate for a bailout and a better candidate for Chapter 11 reorganization than the casinos. We’ve never bailed out failing entertainment companies before, and this is no time to start. Besides, if we’re going to bail out the casinos, why not bail out MLB, the NBA, the NHL, the Masters golf tournament, the Kentucky Derby and the other sports businesses that have paused their operations (but not yet asked for bailouts)? What’s next? Bailouts for shuttered nightclubs and concert halls? The Regal, Landmark and Alamo movie theaters that just closed? Where does it end? While no request for a bailout or other relief should be categorically rejected, neither should any program of temporary relief become permanent or inviolate. Every bailout and accommodation should come with some sort of sunset provision so that businesses don’t become wards of the state or dependent on government largesse. “Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program,” economist Milton Friedman once wrote. If we make mistakes with our bailouts, we should leave ourselves in a position to correct them quickly. Perhaps there are instances and industries that deserve government handouts. Writing in the Wednesday Washington Post, business columnist Steven Pearlstein makes a guarded case for issuing federally guaranteed loans to select stressed companies that come with stringent conditions: no cash gifts like the airlines and cruise lines appear to want, and terms that should be no better “than if they were seeking capital from Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway.” In the very short term, we should be gung-ho for subsidizing the making of ventilators, masks and essential medical supplies. There’s also much to commend Mitt Romney and Andrew Yang’s proposal to give every American $1,000 to tide them over until the complexity of the coronavirus crisis is fully understood. But we should approach bailouts and other emergency actions with trepidation and guided by the understanding that anything we bail out now is likely to leave us with one less dollar to bail out something else later.

And why? “I just read an article in Science Magazine about the worry about the spread of COVID-19 in Africa. As attention has turned to the outbreak in the U.S., it reiterated to me what many of us in global health have been thinking about -- that we must also stay focused on how the epidemic grows in low- and middle-income countries where U.S. global health programs operate. We know how outbreaks can have a ripple effect across critical health initiatives and as resources shift to urgent situations, it is near impossible to predict what the broader impact on countries could be.

This likely scenario speaks to an ongoing need for investments in health systems building blocks worldwide.” What’s a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn’t get enough attention? “Maybe at this stage it isn't fair to call COVID-19 a trend that isn't getting enough attention given how the situation has evolved in recent weeks, but many of us in the global health community have been working over the years to call attention to the threat of a pandemic like this. We need to figure out how to break the cycle of experts pointing at all of the warning signs, and real attention on preparedness and response not happening until too late. If we have learned anything from past outbreaks like Zika and Ebola, it’s that there will be more to protect beyond a basic emergency response.

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday insisted that he was justified in branding the coronavirus pandemic as the ""Chinese Virus,"" disregarding criticism that the label is racially offensive and inaccurately depicts the global nature of the disease's threat. ""It's not racist at all. No, not at all. It comes from China, that's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate,"" Trump told reporters at the White House coronavirus task force’s daily news briefing as he was pressed on his repeated use of the term. Earlier Wednesday, the president invoked the controversial descriptor in three morning Twitter posts, initially assuring Americans forced out of work by the burgeoning outbreak that the ""onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault!"" Trump then wrote that he would be holding a news conference to discuss an announcement from the Food and Drug Administration ""concerning the Chinese Virus"" and claimed he had ""always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously,"" despite his previous comments minimizing its risk to the country.  Trump first employed ""Chinese Virus"" online Monday and again Tuesday, lamenting the industries and states that have been affected by the pandemic, which he had until then stylized as the ""CoronaVirus"" in messages on social media. He also mentioned the ""Chinese Virus"" in his opening remarks at a White House meeting with tourism industry executives on Tuesday, as well as at the outset of Wednesday's briefing. The president's decision to switch labels for the coronavirus comes after he referred to COVID-19 as a ""foreign virus"" in an Oval Office address last Wednesday, and represents another apparent attempt to deflect blame for the public health crisis. Trump last Friday charged without evidence that former President Barack Obama was responsible for the current administration's failure to test large numbers of Americans for the coronavirus, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, remarking, ""I don't take responsibility at all."" He also insisted Monday that the coronavirus is ""nobody’s fault, unless you go to the original source,"" and said Tuesday that ""I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic"" — an assertion that did not square with his past attempts to downplay the threat. Trump's adoption of ""Chinese Virus"" is a twist on the phrase ""Wuhan virus,"" which gained some prominence in news reporting on the outbreak and has since been echoed by White House allies and administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who note that the novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, a city in China's central province of Hubei. Chinese officials have lashed out over the word choice, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang last Monday condemning ""the despicable practice of individual U.S. politicians eagerly stigmatizing China and Wuhan by association with the novel coronavirus, disrespecting science and WHO,"" according to The Washington Post. American officials in turn have accused China of spreading misinformation by hinting without evidence that the disease may have originated in the U.S.  ""I have a great love for all the people from our country, but as you know, China tried to say at one point that — maybe they've stopped now — that it was caused by American soldiers,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""That can't happen. It's not going to happen. Not as long as I'm president. It comes from China."" Still, the president's language has been met with resistance from other administration officials. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar committed that he would no longer ascribe a nationality or region to the outbreak, saying during congressional testimony last month that ""ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus."" Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's emergency program, also emphasized Wednesday that ""viruses know no borders"" and scolded Trump for his statements regarding the ""Chinese Virus."" ""It's really important that we be careful in the language we use, lest it lead to profiling of individuals,"" Ryan said in Geneva. ""This is something we need to all avoid. I'm sure anyone would regret profiling a virus along ethnic lines.""  Democratic lawmakers have raised similar objections. ""I've said it once & I'll say it again loud enough for the @WhiteHouse, @FoxNews, & everyone else to hear: coronavirus does not discriminate. Bigotry against people of Asian descent is unacceptable, un-American, & harmful to our COVID-19 response efforts,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted Tuesday. During Wednesday's briefing, the president was asked about increased incidents of anti-Asian discrimination in the wake of the pandemic, including an account by CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang that an unnamed White House official ""referred to #Coronavirus as the 'Kung-Flu' to my face.""  But Trump denied that his use of the term ""Chinese Virus"" put Asian Americans at risk. ""No, not all. I think they probably would agree with it 100 percent. It comes from China. There's nothing not to agree,"" he said. Some on Capitol Hill have also defended the president's rhetoric as they admonish the authoritarian government in Beijing for its handling of the outbreak. ""I don't understand why China gets upset bc we refer to the virus that originated there [as] the 'Chinese virus,'"" Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote Wednesday on Twitter. ""Spain never got upset when we referred to the Spanish flu in 1918&1919."" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said Monday on Fox News that ""anyone who complains that it's racist or xenophobic to call this virus the 'Chinese coronavirus' or the 'Wuhan virus' is a politically correct fool."" Cotton, who has floated the unsubstantiated theory that the coronavirus was manufactured by the Chinese in a bioweapons lab, also warned in an ominous statement last Thursday that the U.S. ""will hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world.""  Trump said Wednesday that he did not believe China was ""inflicting"" the coronavirus upon Americans, but argued that Beijing ""could have given us a lot earlier notice"" about the disease. ""I know where it came from. I don't know if you'd say China is to blame,"" the president said. ""Certainly we didn't get an early run on it. It would have been helpful if we knew about it earlier. But it comes from China. It's not a question about that. Nobody's questioning it.""",Trump on 'Chinese virus' label: 'It's not racist at all',2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-pandemic-drumbeat-coronavirus-135392,politico
"Don’t be fooled by the barren grocery store shelves: There’s plenty more food on the way. Meat, dairy and produce groups as well as federal regulators say the U.S. has an ample amount of products in cold storage to handle the unexpected demand for food and household products from Americans. The latest Agriculture Department data shows record-high stocks of frozen poultry, cheeses like American and Swiss and red raspberries, while frozen pork supplies are up 11 percent from last year. Rice producers, whose grains have been flying off of store shelves along with other inexpensive and long-lasting foods, say there’s no shortage and those items are being “quickly replenished.” “If you see depleted rice shelves in your local grocery store, it is not a supply problem; it is a signifier of changing logistics in the retail market,” said USA Rice President Betsy Ward in a statement. On Tuesday, federal meat inspection agencies said they continue to operate as normal. Food imports continued to flow across the Southern border despite restrictions on nonessential travel. And the Trump administration and grocery executives stressed that the supply chain is holding firm, even if consumers see long lines at stores across the country. Top retail chains like Walmart, Kroger and H-E-B have reduced store hours to give workers more time to restock high-demand products overnight, and agriculture groups insist there’s no threat of food shortages. Amazon, the largest online retailer, announced it would hire an additional 100,00 workers in its U.S. warehouses to help handle increased demand for household staples, including groceries, while temporarily halting intake of nonessential goods at distribution centers through April 5. Meanwhile, the White House and Congress are on the verge of what could be a $1 trillion stimulus package for workers and industries like airlines and small businesses. It will likely include at least $1 billion in extra food assistance, which could see more demand as restaurant workers, service employees and other Americans are laid off or forced to stay home for an indefinite amount of time. The food industry, for its part, is urging consumers to remain calm and avoid hoarding, suggesting that fears of shortages are overblown. “This is a demand issue, not a supply issue,” said Heather Garlich, vice president of media and public relations at FMI, the food industry association formerly known as the Food Marketing Institute. “The supply chain isn’t broken. The warehouses are pushing out as much inventory as possible in a 24-hour period.” Meat supplies have not been disrupted as processing plants continue to operate, according to USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service and groups representing major meat firms like Smithfield Foods and Cargill. FSIS is required by law to be present at more than 6,200 plants across the country. It employs about 7,800 inspectors to ensure the safety of meat, poultry and processed eggs. Without federal inspectors, plants can’t process the more than 330 billion pounds of beef, chicken, pork, lamb and turkey produced annually. Planning for absenteeism is a regular part of its food safety operations and the department is closely tracking the status of employees who are sick or out for other reasons, USDA said in a statement on Tuesday. Mindy Brashears, USDA’s deputy undersecretary for food safety, assured the agriculture industry that the department is protecting the health and safety of employees while still delivering services to keep the food supply moving. “Field personnel will be working closely with establishment management and state and local health authorities to handle situations as they arise in your community,” Brashears said in a letter. “As always, communication between industry and government will be key. We are all relying on early and frequent communication with one another to overcome challenges as they arise."" Sarah Little, spokesperson for the North American Meat Institute, said if plants are closed because of staffing shortages other facilities will likely pick up some of that capacity. “It is impossible to predict, however, the scenarios for individual plants across the nation,” she said. “Many companies are operating normally but they have contingency plans to address the threat of coronavirus.” At the retail level, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen told CNBC that grocery stores are “getting deliveries every day,” including household goods like toilet paper, though he acknowledged there’s a shortage of hand sanitizers with “very little coming in."" McMullen spoke to President Donald Trump on Sunday along with other top grocers and food manufacturers, and he said he urged the president to spread the message to consumers that “there’s plenty of food in the supply chain.” Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain, is also considering giving seniors and shoppers with medical conditions exclusive access to stores for an hour in the morning, allowing them to avoid crowds later in the day. “We’re starting to test it in a few markets in the next couple of days to see how it works,” McMullen said. “If it works well, we’ll expand it to other markets as well.” Laura Strange, a spokesperson for the National Grocers Association, which represents independent grocery stores, said the group’s members are hiring cashiers and staffing up for round-the-clock restocking. “It’s really an all-hands-on-deck situation where everyone is lending a helping hand where they can,” including CEOs stocking shelves and manning cash registers, Strange said. Anthony Hucker, CEO of Southeastern Grocers, whose brands include Winn-Dixie, told CNBC in a separate interview that his stores have seen demand for certain items spike as much as 200 percent, but they’re well versed in handling those surges. Hucker said they’ve “built a very strong muscle, especially around our computer-generated ordering systems,” after dealing with catastrophic hurricanes in recent years. He said fresh foods like produce, seafood and deli products sourced from local suppliers are readily available to shoppers. The U.S. imports nearly half of its fresh fruits and vegetables from Mexico. Of the $26 billion worth of agricultural goods shipped across the southern border each year, more than $13 billion is produce. As of Tuesday, fresh produce continued to flow across the Arizona border without any hiccups, said Jaime Chamberlain, president of a distributing company in Nogales, Ariz., that sources peppers, squash, tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables from 14 growers in Mexico. Chamberlain is also board chairman of the Greater Nogales and Santa Cruz County Port Authority, through which about $3.5 billion worth of food and 360,000 trucks pass annually, he said. “So far there are no disruptions,” Chamberlain said. “We’re in the middle of our produce season. It’s typical. Things are in short supply because of the enormous demand and some weather issues this spring, but our growing season is the same.” Chamberlain said his business has experienced a drop in sales to restaurant and food service sectors like hotels and cruise lines, but grocery retailers have made up for those losses. He added that he expects international trade will continue, even if Trump bans travel between the U.S. and Mexico, similar to the current restrictions on the EU. However, heightened travel restrictions for passengers can also weigh on imports of fresh foods like berries flown in from other continents, according to Peter Friedmann, executive director of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition. “Much of the capacity for air cargo is at the bottom of passenger flights,” he said. “Now, because there’s no passengers on the top of the plane, a lot of those airlines are just not flying those planes, and therefore we’ve lost a lot of capacity to bring air cargo into the U.S.” Friedmann said the “severe backup in the global supply chain” emanating from China — which shut down factories and ports earlier this year, causing trans-Pacific shipments to plummet — has also led to logjams throughout the U.S. He also called on federal transport regulators to loosen trucking rules for food and farm goods amid the crisis, like they did for medical devices and other items needed to address the outbreak. “We need to have that same [flexibility] for agriculture, for food, because it will reduce congestion,” Friedmann said. “We’ll be able to more dependably supply supermarkets and other places where the product needs to go.” One potential threat to the food supply is the temporary shutdown of U.S. embassies and consulates in Mexico, effective Wednesday, which help process visas for seasonal farm workers, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. The U.S. agriculture industry has already been dealing with chronic labor shortages for at least a decade, and without comprehensive immigration reform, has increasingly relied on the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program. Applications for H-2A visas jumped by nearly 11 percent in fiscal 2019 over the previous year. The visas are to fill more than 257,000 jobs in states like Florida and California where much of America’s produce is harvested, according to Labor Department data. “The decision to halt visa application processing in Mexico will restrict the number of immigrant workers being allowed to enter the country,” Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall said in a statement Tuesday. “Under the new restrictions, American farmers will not have access to all of the skilled immigrant labor needed at a critical time in the planting season. This threatens our ability to put food on Americans’ tables.” Duvall said he has urged the Trump administration to find “practical ways” to admit farm laborers under emergency visas while still protecting public health. Immigrant laborers with previous work experience in the U.S. and who do not require in-person interviews will be allowed to return in the H-2A program. Friedmann, of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition, suggested it could take months to unwind the knots in the food and agricultural network, but cargo can be rerouted and other changes can be made. “The agriculture supply chain is like water. It will find the path of least resistance,” he said.",No need to hoard: There’s plenty of food in the system,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/food-supply-coronavirus-135481,politico
"Will a president with authoritarian tendencies actually try to suspend a constitutionally mandated presidential election? That’s the question Americans asked in the spring and summer of 1970. At the end of the 1960s, a wave of violence—domestic terrorism, urban riots, assassinations and rising crime—set the public on edge. A presidential panel, decrying a national “crisis of violence,” found that 41,000 bombings or bomb threats had occurred in the U.S. in the preceding 15 months. Richard Nixon—whose abuses of presidential power would ultimately lead to his resignation—struck his critics as so heedless of democratic norms and the rules of fair play that he was capable of attempting almost anything. Today, people are starting to ask the same questions. The fiasco over Ohio’s scheduled Democratic primary—with the governor and a judge waging an eleventh-hour war over whether it should proceed—and other states’ postponement of their primaries could well be a preview of a looming constitutional donnybrook over November’s vote. If the coronavirus is still largely unchecked this fall, the crowds necessitated by a presidential election would pose a huge threat to public health. Worst of all, because President Donald Trump has repeatedly shown contempt for the rule of law and the spirit of democracy, it’s not unreasonable to worry that he could try to use the pandemic as a pretext to cancel the election and remain in power. Unless Congress acts quickly to provide for nationwide early, absentee and mail-in voting this fall, these fears will surely multiply. The story of Nixon and the canceled-election rumor of 1970 shows why. That year, political violence, combined with the age-old suspicion that Nixon’s regard for the Constitution was less than sincere, spawned a rumor that he was planning to cancel the 1972 elections. Rumors are by nature hard to trace, but by one account, this one originated with the countercultural journalist and provocateur Paul Krassner. As early as 1969, Krassner began telling college audiences that, while stoned on LSD at a party, he’d been told by the wife of an executive at the Rand Corporation, the defense-industry think tank, that the Nixon administration had ordered a study of the consequences of canceling the elections. After circulating among students for many months, the rumor seems first to have landed in print on April 5, in the chain of newspapers owned by the Newhouse family: the Staten Island Advance, the Oregonian and others. According to the squib that ran in these papers, the administration had tasked Rand with studying whether “rebellious factions using force or bomb threats would make it unsafe to conduct an election,” as well as how the president should respond. The journalist Ron Rosenbaum, then a young reporter for the Village Voice, heard about the Newhouse article indirectly, from a Staten Island cab driver who had seen it in the Advance. Rosenbaum looked into it. Eleven days later, he reported in the Voice that Rand and the administration both denied that any such study existed. But he then mischievously pointed out that they would surely deny it if it were true. Rosenbaum added that the country would just have to wait until 1972 to see. Whether or not Rosenbaum’s cheeky tone encouraged the rumors, or simply failed to quash them, other publications were soon running with the story—from the alternative Los Angeles Free Press to the Nation. Most treated the tale with due skepticism, but some of the more marginal publications presented the study as established fact. The rumor spread fast, assuming sinister connotations. One group called the Urban Coalition claimed that Nixon had commissioned not only the Rand study but also a second study, from MIT, to survey how voters would react to an announcement of suspended elections. Another version of the rumor held that Nixon, to ensure he had pretext for the move, was arranging for provocateurs to instigate acts of violence, to create his own version of the infamous 1933 Reichstag fire, which many people believed to have been a Nazi act designed to justify a power grab (what today might be called a “false flag” operation). “The burning of government buildings in Germany, though first blamed on Communist arson, has since been exposed as the act of Hitler himself,” comedian and activist Dick Gregory wrote (not quite accurately) in the Freedom News, an underground publication. Nixon, he intimated, was about to do the same. Nixon administration officials realized the rumor was gaining strength. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then serving as a White House domestic policy aide, tried to squelch the talk in a Fordham University commencement address he gave that spring. In his speech, he said that he knew the story had reached “just about every campus in the nation” and, ever the sociologist, chalked up its currency to students’ “growing distrust of all social institutions.” Moynihan reassured his audience that the report was “not so.” But then—either playing for a laugh or falling victim himself to the pervasive mistrust—he added: “Or at least I think that it is not so.” Like Rosenbaum, Moynihan couldn’t summon enough confidence in Nixon to deny the rumor categorically. At some level, he had to concede that the Nixon-hating conspiracy theorists might well be on to something. His remarks, too, failed to put the concerns to rest. In July, a new left-wing, countercultural magazine called Scanlan’s Monthly—run by Warren Hinckle, formerly of Ramparts, and Sidney Zion, formerly of the New York Times—joined the fracas. Scanlan’s claimed to have obtained one page of a memo allegedly written by an aide to Vice President Spiro Agnew. The memo, which Scanlan’s published in its August issue, was dated March 11, 1970, and referred to three possible schemes being planned by the administration. The first was to cancel the 1972 elections under the ostensible threat of violence, but in reality to keep the administration in power. The second was to secretly orchestrate pro-administration rallies by labor groups that would purport to be spontaneous. By the time Scanlan’s shared the contents of this supposed memo, Americans knew that the administration had in fact collaborated with labor groups to stage anti-anti-war events in the spring. That knowledge seemed to give the whole memo a whiff of plausibility. The final item in the allegedly official memo was that Nixon would eventually “repeal” the Bill of Rights. Scanlan’s advertised its “scoop” heavily. At one point, a New York Times reporter asked Agnew about the memo. The vice president erupted in anger, denouncing it as “completely false” and thereby ensuring his reaction would be covered in the paper. But Zion—whether truly convinced of the memo’s authenticity or, more likely, eager to perpetuate a hoax that was winning attention for his fledgling magazine—did not back down. “The document came directly from Mr. Agnew’s office, and he knows it. We do not hesitate to submit our credibility against his,” he said. A week later, Attorney General John Mitchell also denied and denounced the story at a breakfast meeting with reporters, possibly giving it even more oxygen. Nixon personally became so incensed about the rumor, according to White House aide John Dean, that he ordered an audit of the magazine—though as a brand new publication, it turned out, it had yet to file taxes. It’s doubtful that many people expected Nixon to suspend the election, let alone repeal the Bill of Rights. The journalists who inspected the alleged Agnew memo mostly judged it a hoax. But its authenticity mattered less than the fact that so many people considered it plausible that Nixon might entertain a power grab at all. The Nation, while stopping short of accepting the rumor, grouped it with such recent “internal security” measures as stepped-up wiretapping and infiltration. Calling Nixon “an old-time Red-hunter,” the editors argued that he was “inclined by temperament in that direction himself.” Ron Rosenbaum, in a follow-up to the pieces he wrote the previous spring, maintained that “the Rand rumor is metaphorically and cosmically true, even if proven mundanely false.” During the Nixon era, he argued, entertaining paranoid fantasies made a certain amount of sense. It is very unlikely that Trump could get away with postponing the November elections; who knows if he even wants to try. But as the Nixon example shows, that doesn’t mean we won’t all be talking about this as a live possibility as our crisis worsens. Presidents who make a show of flouting norms and arrogating power shouldn’t be surprised when large portions of the population assumes that when the crunch comes, they’ll do more of the same.",Could Trump Try to Cancel the 2020 Election?,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/18/could-trump-try-to-cancel-the-2020-election-134349,politico
"Washington is mobilizing to rescue the country from potentially disastrous economic consequences from the global coronavirus outbreak, with the Senate on Wednesday passing a multi-billion dollar emergency package and quickly getting to work on a larger stimulus agreement. With Senate leaders vowing to work at “warp speed” to blunt the financial fallout from the pandemic, the Treasury Department unveiled to lawmakers a plan for $250 billion in direct payments to Americans starting April 6.  Meanwhile, Senate Republicans were inching closer on Wednesday to unveiling their proposal for a third, even larger stimulus package to address the epidemic, which is likely to include some of Treasury's ideas. The Senate’s approval Wednesday of the House-passed coronavirus bill, known as “phase two,” comes as Republican senators are expected to begin negotiations with Democrats on a trillion-dollar “phase three” stimulus package as early as Wednesday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell backed the House bill, which grants paid sick leave to hourly employees and expands unemployment insurance. “It is a well-intentioned bipartisan product assembled by House Democrats and President Trump’s team that tries to stand up and expand some new relief measures for American workers,” McConnell (R-Ky.) said of the House bill, which House lawmakers passed early Saturday and later approved technical corrections on Monday. Despite “real shortcomings” in the legislation, McConnell said, “in this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers.” Earlier Wednesday, the White House sent a proposal to the Senate with a list of potential policy options discussed at a meeting the previous day, a senior administration official said. According to the Treasury Department’s proposal, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO, the so-called “phase three” proposal would include $50 billion to aid the hard-hit airline industry, $150 billion for other distressed sectors of the economy, two rounds of direct payments of $250 billion each on April 6 and May 18, and the creation of a small business interruption loan program. The document notably does not mention a payroll tax cut, which President Donald Trump has suggested he wanted to be included in the package. But the idea lost steam in recent days as lawmakers from both parties rejected the idea, citing the need to grant immediate, large-scale relief. “There are a lot of steps along the way here, but I think everybody has the motivation to get to a solution as quickly as possible,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said. “There are lots of wheels in motion — hopefully driving in the right direction.” As the coronavirus spreads across the country and the stock market continues to plunge, there is widespread recognition that the Senate needs to act swiftly and assist individuals as well as small businesses as part of the massive aid package expected to be unveiled in the coming days. McConnell has been adamant that the Senate will not leave Washington until it passes the “phase three” package. McConnell created three so-called “task forces” to come up with specific proposals to assist small businesses as they deal with the plummeting demand that comes with the lockdown orders in several cities across the country. At Senate Republicans’ lunch meeting on Wednesday, members of each task force presented the proposals they are working on, according to an attendee. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) discussed direct payments to Americans, which could potentially include an income cap. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) talked about his small business proposal and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) discussed the deferment of student loans — potentially for up to three months, the attendee said. In a sign of the personal precautions members are taking against the coronavirus, McConnell urged his colleagues to avoid congregating on the Senate floor and to leave the chamber as soon as each of them voted on Wednesday. While no lawmaker reportedly has contracted the virus, several senators have self-quarantined after possible exposure. At least one Senate staffer has tested positive for the coronavirus. And senators are continuing to urge Trump to take drastic actions usually only taken during wartime. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on the president to invoke the Defense Production Act, which could significantly increase the production of critical equipment, including hospital beds and other medical supplies. Trump later announced he was doing just that. “If you ignore the public health crisis with the equipment and infrastructure and personnel that is needed in many more numbers than we’ve ever seen, the economy won’t get better,” said Schumer, who spoke by phone with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about the ""phase three"" package, according to a spokesman. During a meeting with Republican senators on Tuesday, Mnuchin warned that the unemployment rate could spike to double digits if Congress doesn't take action, according to a source familiar with the remarks. House Democrats are also drafting a third stimulus bill to act as a counter-offer to the ""phase three"" package senators are currently drafting.  Democratic lawmakers and aides say the House plan could include expanded Medicaid coverage, additional unemployment insurance payments, relief for homeowners and renters, support for small businesses, an airline rescue package and additional food security measures.  Democrats familiar with the proposal said the plan won't be completed until next week, and it remains unclear if Speaker Nancy Pelosi will bring the House back to Washington to vote.  In the meantime, some Senate Democrats are already laying out their demands for the stimulus package. They’re warning that Congress’ third phase of aid must include a far more broad paid sick leave policy, or it will not clear the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to pass. “In the next package, all of us are insisting that this provision on paid sick leave and family leave be part of it,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash) said on a conference call with reporters. “It’s a non-starter if it’s not included in the next package,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), another long-time proponent of paid sick leave. “That next tranche of investment in the economy is going to require 60 votes. If it's not included, I don't believe Democratic support will be for the measure.”  Sarah Ferris, Heather Caygle and Nancy Cook contributed to this report.

"A critical lack of testing kits. A shortage of ventilators. Not enough ICU beds.  America’s struggle to deal with the spread of the highly infectious new virus Covid-19 is bad enough, with the number of confirmed cases surging, hospitals begging for help and entire cities going on lockdown.  But it’s also exposed just how unprepared the U.S. is for a threat many would-be Cassandras have been warning about for years: a targeted biological attack. “When one thinks about what a bioterror attack would look like—it is crystal clear we are not even close to being ready,” said former Department of Homeland Security official Daniel Gerstein, now a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation.  Today’s mantra of “flattening the curve” — or lessening the spike in illnesses, thereby slowing the infection rate to reduce the burdens on the health care system — would not apply to a bioterror attack. “The people in that cloud would be infected all at once, so you would see a very large spike of very sick patients,” Gerstein said. As the response to the outbreak from governments at all levels has shown, the U.S. was completely unprepared for a slowly creeping pandemic — let alone a biological attack that would overwhelm it all at once. Potential biological weapons include anthrax, which, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, “makes a good weapon because it can be released quietly and without anyone knowing”; smallpox, frozen stocks of which are still maintained by the U.S. and Russia; tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, which attacks the skin, eyes, lymph nodes and lungs and was stockpiled by the U.S. military and the former Soviet Union after World War II; and botulism, which is caused by exposure to toxins made by C. botulinum — the most toxic substances known to humankind, which attack the body’s nerves and can lead to respiratory failure.  More than six weeks into the Trump administration’s response effort — which began Jan. 29 with the announcement of a coronavirus task force and, two days later, the declaration of a public health emergency — ramped-up testing for the virus has only just begun, hospital systems say they don’t have enough beds and medical supplies to handle the onslaught of anticipated patients, and there is a shortage of respirators, ventilators and other protective equipment for nurses and doctors on the front lines. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, only recently shifted his tone: On Sunday, he called the virus “something we have tremendous control of.” By Monday, he was urging people to stay home and beginning to hurl the full might of thefederal government at what he described as “an invisible enemy.” But with confirmed cases soaring past 7,000 and now reaching into 50 states, officials are warning privately that it may be as long as 18 months before the pandemic is brought to heel. To biodefense experts, the Trump administration’s sluggish response revealed a dangerous failure of imagination throughout the system, and showed how unprepared the government still is to handle a catastrophic biological event.  “The sense is that we haven’t fully prepared” for that possibility, said a U.S. government official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “If we had an attack, and even if we had the treatment or the vaccine that everyone needed, we don’t have the capacity to get that to 330 million Americans if we were in a lockdown situation where trucks weren’t moving. So that’s one thing that we’ve looked at.” Other basic logistical questions also have yet to be resolved, the official added. “Can we create a capacity? What does that look like? Do we set it up in gymnasiums? Who’s going to do it? How are the things going to get delivered if you have sort of a general breakdown in the system?” Covid-19 was not manufactured, and the risk of it being weaponized is extremely low given its highly infectious nature that would likely backfire on any group trying to spread it, experts said.  But an administration official cautioned that the prospect of intentional exposure targeting U.S. government employees “is a concern,” and noted that the Defense Department “has imposed a lot of travel restrictions” despite a certain amount of exposure being “inevitable.”  The FBI, whose field offices are known to allow “walk-in” tipsters, is also taking extra precautions. “In support of our mission, we are enacting measures to protect the FBI workforce, including heightened hygiene practices, social distancing options, like telework and flexible work schedules where appropriate, and authorizing only essential operational travel until further notice,” a spokesperson said.  The scale of the outbreak is the closest thing the U.S. has seen to how a bioweapon—which may take the form of viruses, bacteria, toxins, fungi and rickettsiae—can shut down a society and severely strain resources, several sources said.  “We haven’t seen anything that appears to be this pathogenic and transmissible since maybe 1918 or 1957,” said the U.S. government official. And the response so far to coronavirus, the official added, “shows that we don’t have the systems in place to rapidly diagnose cases, or to scale up a mass response very quickly.”  “We are in the realm now where biological weapons are really becoming possible,” the official said. “People have talked about [gene editing in bioweapons] for 50 years. … It is not science fiction anymore. Literally in the last five years we’ve crossed that threshold.""  George echoed those concerns. “What we’re seeing are all the places where we are vulnerable,” she said. “You can see people not really having thought about what impact a biological event would have on the nation in any number of different sectors.”  With the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, she said, a national strategy for pandemic influenza was already in place, though Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force response coordinator, acknowledged in a news conference on Tuesday that “now we are seeing we have to revise” the flu pandemic preparedness plan. And because the U.S. deals with seasonal influenza every year, manufacturers already knew how to produce the necessary vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization protocol, which clears labs to produce tests in the event of an outbreak, has also gotten more complicated—while it was streamlined for Ebola, Zika, and H1N1, the FDA was slow to trigger the workaround for coronavirus testing. “It feels like we have regressed considerably,” said Gerstein.  The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, established in 2014 and co-chaired by former Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, warned in 2018 that “the United States is underprepared for biological threats” from both terrorists and “nature itself,” via emerging and reemerging infectious diseases like Covid-19. “Despite significant progress on several fronts, the Nation is dangerously vulnerable to a biological event,” reads the organization’s bipartisan report. “The root cause of this continuing vulnerability is the lack of strong centralized leadership at the highest level of government.” The threat of a large-scale biological catastrophe, particularly one that hits all at once instead of over a period of weeks or months, is particularly problematic because the U.S. health care system is still “the weakest link” in the nation’s ability to respond effectively to an outbreak, said Ali S. Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “Routinely, we are not even able to surge for a bad flu season,” said Khan, who served as the CDC’s director of public health preparedness and response and helped establish the CDC’s bioterrorism program. During the 2017-18 flu season, one of the deadliest in 40 years, with more than 61,000 flu-related deaths across the country, overwhelmed hospitals in some parts of the country pitched tents outside ERs and used ambulances as stand-ins for patient rooms.  The detection capabilities are behind, too: While DHS has a BioWatch program that gathers air samples in 30 U.S. cities to monitor the threat of bioterrorism, it’s nearly two decades old and takes from 11 to 13 hours to determine whether a biological agent has been deployed. The emergence and spread of Covid-19 should have been easier to predict and prepare for than a bioterror attack would be—but it still caught the administration by surprise. It’s not as though the emergence of a novel disease with a significant mortality rate is “brand new,” Khan said, pointing to the SARS outbreak roughly 17 years ago. “We knew this was a possibility, so there are so no excuses. We are eight weeks behind where we should have been in terms of our planning.” One of the biggest issues with planning effectively is that “public health is largely invisible, underappreciated, and as a result underfunded,” Umair A. Shah, a top Texas health official, told the House Homeland Security Committee in October. “This ‘Invisibility Crisis’ problem has unfortunately led to funding cuts for public health and public health preparedness at every level of government.”  George emphasized that the issue doesn’t lie just with the executive branch — Congress, with the power of the purse, needs to be an active partner in developing an agenda, assigning responsibilities and allocating the appropriate funds, instead of just “spitting out emergency supplementals.” The U.S. launched a national stockpile program 20 years ago as a way to prepare for biological, chemical or nuclear attacks on the homeland. Its goal was initially to prepare for an unusual threat and was very oriented toward specific biological agents, George said. It now houses the country’s largest supply of vaccines and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency, like an outbreak of smallpox and anthrax, or widespread radiation sickness. The stockpile is a work in progress, however. While the CDC now says there is enough smallpox vaccine in the stockpile for every American, it initially housed only 15 million doses, 90,000 of which were available for immediate use. The renowned epidemiologist D.A. Henderson, who led preparedness for the Department of Health and Human Services after 9/11, wrote in 2009 that the CDC also hadn’t checked the vaccines’ potency in nearly eight years, instead of every three as is required. (An HHS spokesperson also said in a statement that the Strategic National Stockpile participates in the FDA/DOD Shelf-life Extension Program “to extend the life of some products beyond their original use-by dates.”) As the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated, the possibilities for a catastrophic biological event go beyond what was initially envisioned — so there needs to be an attendant increase in what goes into the stockpile, George said. Supplies are running low, particularly when it comes to ventilators — a growing necessity as Covid-19, a respiratory virus, spreads. In a news briefing on Monday, HHS Secretary Alex Azar declined to reveal the exact number of ventilators in the stockpile, citing “national security concerns.” (Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the number is around 12,700.)  George and Khan explained that the numbers are a matter of national security because they could reveal a vulnerability. The idea is to prevent adversaries from exploiting a shortage by launching a biological attack that would require people to use a resource, like ventilators, in numbers too large to accommodate. “We don’t want to give our adversaries a road map,” Khan said.  But it is generally well known that ventilators and essential medical supplies like needles, gauze and gloves are in short supply, George said, as are other kinds of medicines, like fever reducers, which are necessary in cases like this, where the best that can be done for now is supportive rather than preventive care. A deployable vaccine is still at least a year away, Fauci said last week.  “We are in the exponential phase right now,” said Gerstein. “It’s only going to get worse. We are nowhere near the end of our transmission.”  Jason Millman contributed this report.",'It is not science fiction anymore': Coronavirus exposes U.S. vulnerability to biowarfare,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-biowarfare-terror-136194,politico
"A plunging stock market. Restaurants, gyms and movie theaters shutting their doors. Workers losing more income each day. It’s an unprecedented public crisis, and it’s also billions of dollars in state tax revenue that’s evaporating quickly — and scrambling the economic equation for governors and mayors across the nation. The cascading impacts of the novel coronavirus come just as governors, state lawmakers, mayors and city councils would normally be hammering out their budget plans for the coming year. But with no telling how long the coronavirus pandemic will shut down everyday life, a crystal ball may prove as effective as economic formulas for the fiscal year ahead. Governors of both parties are now calling on President Donald Trump and Congress to step in with billions in federal aid and reductions in red tape. They'd also be wise to dust off their playbooks from more than a decade ago when the Great Recession last caused revenues to nose-dive with little notice. Starting in the fall of 2008, California wrote and rewrote its budget three times in less than a year because projections quickly went into the dustbin within months of printing a new spending plan. Leaders in states across the nation are bracing for a similar year of drafting their documents in pencil, knowing that the situation will be hard to pin down until the world emerges from hibernation. Unlike the federal government, states and cities must balance their budgets each year. Some states, like California, may be better prepared to weather the storm, sitting on a surplus and $20 billion reserve fund built after lessons learned from the previous downturn. But others will have to figure out which programs to cut for the first time in years. Illinois, for instance, doesn’t even have a rainy day fund. That was on Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s wish list for this year’s legislative session — which has now been put on hold. States such as New York are already talking about building contingencies into their spending plan. Trigger cuts — a well-worn tool during the last recession — are already entering the conversation. Washington, of course, can use its borrowing powers where states can't, as it did during the 2008-09 recession with a massive public works package intended to create jobs and buoy local economies. Congress and the Trump administration are now discussing a package of more than $1 trillion in stimulus, and state and local leaders have begun to press for emergency federal aid to support sectors from transportation to dining. “We’re going to need the federal government with us in a big way,” said New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who expects states will ultimately need collective federal aid of $3 trillion to $4 trillion. “And I think everybody recognizes that — and I don’t mean just New Jersey. We’re going to need help. This is beyond any one state.” But Democrats in particular wonder if the Trump administration will be eager to increase funding to areas it previously slated for cuts, such as Medicaid and social service programs that would serve as a safety net for those hit hardest by coronavirus economic damage. POLITICO’s reporters in state capitals and major cities throughout the country are watching the budget and economic impact of the pandemic closely — here’s a look at what’s happening in several major states. Florida’s leaders are used to planning their budgets around hurricane-induced disasters and even oil spills. Coronavirus is different: Economists in the Republican-led Sunshine State say it’s difficult to forecast how hard the virus will hit the state’s tourism-dependent economy — the fourth biggest in the country — with theme parks and beaches now shuttered. The pandemic played a big-money role as the Legislature wrapped up its two-month legislative session last weekend — lawmakers scaled back planned tax cuts and boosted the state’s $3.9 billion cash reserves by $300 million to prepare for the coronavirus response. The state has set aside $50 million for bridge loans, and laid-off employees can apply for unemployment assistance. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who came to power as a close Trump ally, delivered a rebuke to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on March 17 after the secretary said the federal stimulus package should include rules to keep money from going to millionaires who don’t need it. DeSantis said federal red tape could delay aid for months. An early version of a House stimulus bill now scheduled to go before the Senate sought to distribute funds through the Social Security Administration. DeSantis said he told has told Florida Sen. Marco Rubio that the first federal stimulus bill should be packed with assistance for people who will be left jobless. It also should include more bridge loan money for small businesses facing closure, he said. The full picture of the coronavirus impact in Florida might not come into focus for some time. Lawmakers decided on $300 million in added reserves before Walt Disney Co. and NBCUniversal closed theme parks in Orlando and cities including Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach closed beaches that were packed with spring break revelers. (For context, $3 billion of the state’s forecasted $36.5 billion in general revenue this year was expected to come from tourism sales tax revenue.) Gov. Gavin Newsom insists his state is better prepared than most to deal with a downturn. California is working with a $222.2 billion budget and a record surplus and reserves. But the nation’s most populous state, which has the fifth largest economy in the world, is heavily dependent on tax revenue from wealthy earners and hence capital gains — making it particularly vulnerable to stock market swings. So expect a wild ride. Last week, the UCLA Anderson Forecast lowered its expectations for GDP growth and trade but stopped short of predicting a recession. By Monday, UCLA economists had changed their minds. Monday’s revised report said the U.S. economy has entered a recession expected to last until September, and that California will suffer more than most. California is expected to lose more than 280,000 payroll jobs by the first quarter of 2021, with more than a third of those in the leisure, hospitality, transportation and warehousing sectors, according to the report. State Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek, an influential voice on the state budget, said that “while the impact on state revenues is not yet clear, the extreme market volatility and rapidly weakening economic situation obviously have negative implications.” He issued a memo Wednesday projecting ""several billion dollars"" less in capital gains through mid-2021 and said the state would likely have to delay budget passage beyond its June 15 deadline. Still, Petek pointed to California's robust reserve fund as a buffer against potential budget cuts. Christopher Thornberg, founder of Beacon Economics in Los Angeles, is taking an optimistic approach. While this is unprecedented at a national level, he said, regions have bounced back from such natural disasters fairly quickly. It’s not necessarily like the 2008 financial crisis, which had a long-term impact on the economy and permanent loss of jobs, he said. “It’s business delayed, not business canceled. It’s spending delayed, not spending canceled,” Thornberg said. “If we’re looking at four weeks, it’s a hurricane. But to be clear, if this goes 40 weeks, California is not in a good position. … Our revenue system in the state is so hypersensitive to shifts in capital gains that if the stock market really did stay down where it is right now, we’re going to take a massive hit.” New York’s economy faces a massive hit: In a best-case scenario, tax revenues will likely be $4 billion lower than projected for the coming fiscal year, the state comptroller says, and New York City alone faces at least a $3.2 billion hit to its bottom line as travel dwindles and restaurants, bars and theaters close indefinitely, a steep loss in tax revenue that will extend for six months. Financing the massive coronavirus response, meanwhile, is going to upend Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s previously planned efforts to fill a major Medicaid budget hole. State leaders are scrambling to finish their state budget this week, but Cuomo said the original forecast is practically moot now with an expected economic downturn in weeks and months to come. The state was already staring down a roughly $6 billion budget gap, primarily due to a $4 billion Medicaid shortfall. Cuomo’s plan to address that relied on limiting the amount of local spending on Medicaid that is picked up by the state. But the second federal coronavirus bill — which would give the state billions of dollars — would make that strategy ""impossible,"" the governor complained over the weekend, because it contains language prohibiting any changes to localities' reimbursement rates. Sources close to the legislation say Cuomo is working with the New York delegation for language in additional federal coronavirus bills to allow him flexibility to move forward with his Medicaid savings plan. The state’s comptroller, Tom DiNapoli, has long suggested New York's reserves are not built up to withstand disaster or severe economic downturn. The budget Cuomo proposed would get the two largest statutory reserve funds to under $2.5 billion, about 3.1 percent of General Fund expenditures, and far below other large states such as California, Texas and Michigan. In the City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has enjoyed an unprecedented economic boom since taking office in 2014; he’s expanded the city budget from $75 billion six years ago to a proposed $95.3 billion for the upcoming fiscal year. That streak has now ended this month, with a city economy dependent on tourism and entertainment grinding to a halt. As bad as the picture is now for the city, it still has room to get worse. De Blasio and Cuomo are looking at plans to potentially shut down roads, bridges, tunnels and trains to halt travel in and out of the city. That would drain city coffers further and could have ripple effects for national and global markets. Texas is used to booms and busts in the oil and gas sector blowing a hole in the state’s $110 billion annual budget. It’s got a rainy day fund that has more than $11 billion. “The ups and downs are nothing new for us,” said Jerry Mouton, mayor of Deer Park, which has a Shell manufacturing site. “It’s a normal part of the budgeting process. I’m not overly concerned.” But the oil and gas downturn is coming at the same time as the outbreak — meaning that state budget writers will have to make some tough decisions when they gather in Austin for the next session in January. An oil production tax provides 6.1 percent of the state’s revenue and natural gas production tax generates 2.7 percent. That, combined with an expected plunge in sales tax from shuttered restaurants, hotels and businesses and a lack of income tax, means Texas will have a tough time cushioning the blow. Typically, state budget writers have blunted oil price busts by drastically cutting services like education. But the state, which has the highest uninsured rate in the country, is lagging in its response to the outbreak, meaning that the virus spread could stretch thin hospitals and other services. Lawmakers will have to figure out where to get the money to help hospitals and providers while boosting health services. If Democrats take the majority in the state House this year, they will insist on not balancing the budget on the backs of low-income residents. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said that he expects the federal government to throw the state a financial lifeline — as it did after Hurricane Harvey. Illinois is particularly vulnerable budgetwise. Not only does it not have a rainy day fund, but the state a few years ago also passed a constitutional amendment that restricts the use of motor fuel fees and taxes to road construction and repair only. So Illinois has much less flexibility than other states in funneling money to a fund to respond to the impacts of the coronavirus. Meanwhile, the city of Chicago, which is grappling with a $30 billion unfunded pension debt, relies on tax revenues from conventions, tourism and hotel and restaurant activities. The city has already lost at least 20 conventions, with a combined 200,000 visitors, as a result of the 30-day ban on gatherings of 1,000 or more. (The governor has since put the ban at no more than 50 people.) “This is putting a severe dent in those industries. With Chicago being the economic engine of the state of Illinois, putting that engine in neutral while we’re navigating the social isolation necessary to combat the coronavirus puts state and local finances in a very precarious position,” said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government watchdog that is often called to testify and provide independent opinions about state and city finances. Msall said the situation is reminiscent of the economic impacts of the attacks of 9/11. “The difference is in 9/11, we knew we needed to secure against additional attacks and rebuild. Here, we don’t know when the virus will stop attacking or when it will be effectively limited — and when people can socialize again and when businesses can conduct normal operations, when entertainment, colleges, universities and schools can reopen.” In New Jersey, the economic fallout could quickly eat through the state’s $1.5 billion projected surplus, which amounts to just 3.8 percent of the state’s current $39.9 billion budget. The revenue estimates used to project the surplus made no assumptions about any economic downturn, let alone the coronavirus, and state officials don’t immediately plan to announce an updated forecast. Murphy, who has fought with fellow Democrats in the Legislature over his proposal to raise taxes on millionaires, suggested that some sort of revenue raise could be needed. Still, he said, the damage could be far more than New Jersey could handle on its own. Extending the state’s top tax rate to those earning from $1 million to $5 million would raise less than $500 million a year, based on those now-outdated projections. Murphy is working with the state's congressional delegation to lobby for federal aid in the form of block grants. In the short term, the Wall Street selloff could temper income tax losses when tax season rolls around in 2021, but a drop in dividends and, more importantly, mass layoffs are sure to suck hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars out of the state’s coffers. The state collects sales tax on all online sales, potentially stabilizing that major revenue source. State Senate President Steve Sweeney proposed on Saturday a two-month holiday from the state sales and payroll taxes and deferral of other taxes, including property taxes — a potential short-term hit to local governments. Murphy said the state may not be able to afford it. The Boston marathon may be postponed, but Massachusetts lawmakers maneuvered around questions of how coronavirus will impact the state budget early this week, calling the situation ""fluid."" Officials said instead they are focused on legislation to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, and closed the State House to visitors other than elected officials and staffers. Massachusetts hammers out its budget details over the course of the spring, but the state is used to having its budget come late into the summer.

"A president who shaped his first three years in office trying to sell Americans on obscure corporate tax provisions, minute details of tariffs and the rollback of mind-numbing regulations has a new approach: Keep it simple. Facing the most sudden economic crisis to hit any modern American leader, President Donald Trump is now pushing to send Americans four-figure checks, establish broad corporate bailout programs and lend billions of dollars to small businesses so they can keep paying their bills. The crisis approach jettisons long-held Republican philosophies about using the tax code — and the tax code alone — to reward businesses and individuals for certain types of economic behavior.  It’s a sharp reversal for a GOP that just weeks ago was railing against socialism. The new raft of proposals adopts philosophies popularized by a field of Democratic presidential candidates, like showering the public with government money and imposing strict conditions on corporate welfare.  “Both the White House and the Democrats tend to believe that helping workers affected by the shutdown with direct cash payments is the best and is the right strategy,” said Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. “Now, not every Republican likes that idea. Some do.” Top officials hope these moves will help rehabilitate Trump as he comes under assault for his faltering approach to the novel coronavirus over the past two months — with troubles continuing to this date. The U.S. still does not have enough testing kits to know the full range of Americans potentially infected by the coronavirus. The pandemic has spread to all 50 states, and the lack of confidence in the administration’s efforts, combined with the shutdown of businesses, schools and restaurants, has triggered steep declines in the stock market — which Trump has always viewed as a key form of polling for his presidency. The administration’s goal this week includes pushing through Congress another economic stimulus package that is likely to top $1.3 trillion, the centerpiece of which will be checks sent directly to thousands of Americans. In recent days, President Donald Trump has latched onto the idea of the checks as a way to quickly give Americans money to cover housing payments, food and expenses as much of America’s social and business life shuts down as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.  Behind the scenes, the Treasury Department is working on the mechanics of giving Americans direct checks, with the amount depending on one’s income and family size. The administration has considered sending anywhere from $500 to $1,000 per check and has proposed Congress spend a total of $500 billion on the measure, with the IRS issuing the first of two rounds of payments starting April 6, according to the Treasury proposal obtained by POLITICO. “We are looking at different numbers. We are looking at timing that would be different,” Trump told reporters Wednesday. “Splitting the time, splitting the payments. We are looking at a lot of different things. It hasn't been determined yet, but it will shortly be determined. But people want to go big. Everybody seems to want to go big.” The direct payments have received a much better reception on Capitol Hill than the president’s earlier proposal to cut or suspend the payroll tax, a move that would have helped both employees and employers.  One senior administration official said top economic aides presented the president with a list of possible options this week to help Americans financially, and he liked the check idea because it’s an easily understood concept and the money goes out quickly, a second senior administration official said. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) also outlined the check proposal earlier this week and then spoke with Trump about it on Wednesday, a person familiar with the conversation said.  Other Republican lawmakers seem equally amenable to it. “It’s a novel idea, and if it will help a lot of people help the economy because we’re in challenging times right now,” said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), one of the lawmakers involved in brainstorming ways to financially help out airlines as part of the broad rescue package. “It’s a lot of money, but the idea is to put cash in people’s hands [to] mitigate the economic effects.” I want to see who is going to receive the money. Is it everyone? Is it someone who is laid off? Is it someone who is quarantined? I just need to see the final details,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said. “That’s more of a demand-side remedy. I think to solve this problem we're going to need both demand and supply.“ Senior administration officials caution the idea of a payroll tax cut could still reappear in the coming weeks, with one official noting it still remains under consideration within the administration. Trump’s top economic aides are also weighing which industries will receive government help in the form of loans. The Treasury proposal earmarked $150 billion for industries slammed by the coronavirus downturn, money that would fund loans or loan guarantees.  An additional $50 billion in loans would support the airlines. The Trump administration supports limits on raising executive compensation and reducing service, but Democrats are pushing for stricter provisions.  But the Treasury proposal does not specify which industries could access that $150 billion pool of money. That uncertainty has set off a fierce lobbying effort among hotels, cruise ships, the tourism industry and retailers, all of whom have been in close touch with the White House about the sudden and sharp declines in their businesses. The lobbying is intense because the Senate wants to negotiate this third coronavirus rescue package by the end of the week — putting one of the largest stimulus packages in modern history on an incredibly tight time frame.",Trump adopts the greatest hits of the 2020 Dems,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-economy-coronavirus-democrats-136462,politico
"When America is at war, voters prefer not to swap presidents in the middle of battle. James Madison sailed to reelection after launching the War of 1812. Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the Confederacy surrendered at Appomattox. In the shadow of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt notched a third term. And the year after deploying troops to Iraq, George W. Bush defeated a war veteran, Democrat John Kerry. What if the enemy is invisible? Not a foreign country, or the perpetrators of a brazen terrorist attack, but a lethal disease that forces Americans to shelter in place indefinitely as their health, jobs and wages hang in the balance?  President Donald Trump is about to find out.  After fumbling his administration’s initial response to the devastating spread of COVID-19, and dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus for months as it spread from China, Trump has turned to the one concept that seems to work politically to overcome monumental challenges. Days after he issued a national emergency declaration to help combat the global pandemic, the New York businessman — who famously avoided the Vietnam draft multiple times — informed Americans on Wednesday that he is now “a wartime president,” and said the country should prepare to fight. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” Trump said at a White House briefing featuring Defense Secretary Mark Esper, U.S. Veterans Affairs chief Robert Wilkie and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force.  “Now it’s our time,” Trump continued, recalling the bravery America showed during World War II. “We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we will come through together.”  The wartime posture Trump has adopted in his tone and actions — he invoked the Defense Production Act on Wednesday, giving him the authority to influence private industries for emergency response purposes — marks an extraordinary new phase in his attempt to reclaim public support for his handling of the deadly outbreak, and it raises questions about the potential measures Trump could take if the crisis spirals even further out of control.  “He is trying to create a sense of command-and-control and authority now that it’s obvious this is going to be a big challenge for the country,” said Tony Fratto, a White House aide to President George W. Bush.  Trump already has announced plans to dispatch two Navy ships with operating rooms and hospital beds to New York Harbor and the West Coast to assist local medical workers as they grapple with an influx of patients who have contracted COVID-19 and require treatment for the virus. The idea to reposition the two ships — the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort — gained steam after Trump last Friday issued his emergency declaration, which served as a “green light” for the Pentagon to begin taking more aggressive measures, according to a well-placed Defense Department official. Earlier on, there had been internal disagreements between Pentagon officials who wanted the administration to take “prudent measures,” such as travel restrictions, and those who wished to avoid rash decisions that could exacerbate political consequences and the current economic downturn, the official said. Some White House officials were hesitant to enlist the Navy ships prematurely since the Comfort is currently undergoing maintenance that could take weeks to complete. (The Mercy, which is currently stationed in San Diego, could deploy within days.) The administration is also weighing the deployment of National Guard and Reserve troops at the federal level if conditions worsen in the coming weeks. Contingency planning began Tuesday at the Pentagon, where officials discussed enlisting guardsmen to deliver food and medical supplies to vulnerable populations, build temporary hospitals and retrofit facilities that could be used as hospitals, and work with local police units to enforce curfews like they have in coastal areas facing hurricanes. Nearly 20 governors have already activated national guardsmen as they work to contain the rapidly spreading virus within their own states, and some have encouraged the president to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers in a further step to address the outbreak. “We believe the use of active duty Army Corps personnel would not violate federal law because this is a national disaster,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday.  For now, the president’s greatest tool has been his rhetoric — particularly the ways in which he is using the war metaphor to try to boost public morale, reach supporters who remain dismissive of the worldwide pandemic and preemptively position himself as a president who rose to the occasion when voters weigh their options this November.  “President Trump has figured out that he has to put aside that proudly reckless style of governance that has been a staple of his presidency to date, and adopt a posture that’s more typical of what presidents have done in crises,” said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University history professor. “At the same time, it’s not so much about calling himself a wartime president as it is about whether he matches the rhetoric with actions that make us safer,” Greenberg added.  To that end, Trump has enlisted the help of nearly everyone in his usual orbit — and beyond. According to two people familiar with the discussions, Trump has privately encouraged White House aides, personal friends and corporate executives to brainstorm creative steps they can take to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, keep health care professionals equipped to manage patients and prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded and doctors overwhelmed.  Officials involved with the White House Office of American Innovation, for example, have spent the past several days conferring with major tech companies about how they can help distribute public service announcements related to COVID-19 and prevent severe supply shortages as consumers prepare for weeks of minimal social contact outside their homes and hospitals worry about the availability of protective personal equipment — including surgical masks, goggles and gloves — and office supplies.  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has spearheaded much of the outreach to Big Tech and other industries, is specifically trying to marshal the private sector behind the president. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are pressuring GOP lawmakers to quickly pass a massive aid package of more than $1 trillion to stabilize the economy and soften a coronavirus-induced recession. And on Wednesday, Trump announced a mutual agreement with Canada to close the United States’ northern border to all nonessential traffic — a step that came as the president simultaneously weighs new restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border. Ultimately, Trump’s push to portray himself as a wartime leader has gained broad attention not because of his efforts to get the military, the government and private industries involved in responding to the coronavirus outbreak, but because of the manner in which his entire administration and 2020 campaign appeared to adopt the same message overnight.  By Wednesday morning, the president, his allies and top administration officials were nearly all employing the rhetoric of war: encouraging sacrifice, promising better days ahead while acknowledging difficulties now, promoting patriotism and praising “bold” actions that might quickly return the country to normalcy. In the opinion pages of USA Today, Pence asked young and healthy Americans — some of whom spent last weekend going about their normal lives — to commit to making small sacrifices to keep others safe, writing that “there is no substitute for the action of the American people.” In an email blast Wednesday afternoon, the Republican National Committee praised Trump’s “wartime footing” and “whole of America” approach.  Senior Pentagon officials even advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former Defense Department official.  Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who is close to securing his spot as Trump’s Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, described the coronavirus outbreak in warlike terms. Speaking to supporters from his Delaware home after a series of primary victories Tuesday, Biden said “tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” “This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak…,” Biden said. An outside adviser to the Trump campaign said the president’s 2020 team is hoping to capitalize on Trump’s new messaging strategy by launching a series of digital ads as soon as next week that highlight the president’s efforts to battle the “invisible enemy” — a phrase Trump has recently used to describe the deadly respiratory syndrome. A Trump campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.  “I wouldn’t mind seeing the Trump campaign expend some resources to communicate to his supporters that this is important,” Fratto said. “And if he has to use wartime language to do it, it’s in all of our interests to let him.”  If the president’s strategy works, he could have a shot at finding himself back on the Speaker’s balcony for his second swearing-in ceremony next January, having won reelection because voters either cut him slack — something his predecessors who became wartime leaders appeared to benefit from even as economic turmoil persisted — or because the country recovered from a war their commander-in-chief led them through.  But there’s no guarantee Trump will meet the same fate as Madison, Lincoln, Roosevelt or Bush even if Americans agree that this is war.  Damaged by his handling of the war in Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson stunned the country in 1968 when he announced he would not run for reelection.  And a quarter century later, President George H.W. Bush lost his bid for a second term to an Arkansan named Bill Clinton a year after the 1991 Gulf War.",Trump’s machine quickly transforms for ‘a wartime president’ ,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-wartime-president-coronavirus-136892,politico
"Government officials promise that the closing of the U.S.-Canada border to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus won’t affect trade between the two partners, but a slowdown may be inevitable as the two countries work out what business purposes should be deemed “essential.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday that deliveries of food, fuel and medicines would continue under the agreement. But for a binational relationship with tight cultural and commercial ties, many specifics remained unanswered. “They’ve focused on supply chains, which is good, they’ve focused on the crew of an airplane, the driver of a truck … but what they need to focus on and what we need more guidance on right away is essential commercial travel,” said Maryscott Greenwood, a former diplomat who now heads the Canadian-American Business Council. “What is that, who qualifies, how will you decide and, if there is a disagreement, how do you resolve it?” Greenwood said one example is specialized utility company employees from Canada who may need to cross to work on plants or equipment in the United States. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is still working out the details with Canadian counterparts Wednesday after both countries’ leaders announced the contours of the deal. Greenwood warned that an “ad hoc” system “would create chaos at the border.” “It would be counterproductive and counterintuitive and an incredibly bad idea to restrict essential commercial travel in a way that harms the economy,” she said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced Wednesday evening that it will close its enrollment centers for Trusted Traveler programs beginning Thursday until ""at least"" May 1 to limit employees' and the public's exposure to the virus. That could make it more difficult for any worker who is considered ""essential"" but whose membership in expedited entry lanes has lapsed to cross the border. The overarching economic worries won't be helped by the border restrictions. During the 2008-09 financial crisis, global trade volumes plunged sharply as consumer demand and business activity dried up, as is currently happening because of coronavirus fears. Two-way U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico also took a hit during the 2008 financial crisis. U.S. exports to its northern neighbor dropped by 21 percent and imports from that country fell by one-third. U.S. exports to Mexico fell nearly 15 percent and imports from below the border fell 18 percent. It took two years for overall U.S. exports to return to pre-crisis levels and three years for imports to fully bounce back. The U.S.-Canada goods trade last year was $612 billion, or about 15 percent of total U.S. trade, according to U.S. Census data. Oil and vehicles and their parts were among the biggest U.S. imports in 2019, while cars, trucks and auto parts were among the top exports to Canada. Trump administration officials say they expect a quick recovery once the coronavirus passes and companies resume full operations and consumers begin spending freely again. Some economists caution that the return to normalcy could be hard to predict. ""In 2008-09, there was a lot of bad debt that needed to be purged of the system. It took several years for the rebound to begin to take hold,"" said Dan Ikenson, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies. ""It’s unclear how quickly economies will rebound from the pandemic. We are in the process of putting the economy into an induced coma and it’s anyone’s guess how the patient will react once it’s reawakened."" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the coming restrictions “will in no way impede the essential trade happening” across the border, without delving into how that will be defined. “We understand on both sides of the border,” she said. “The last thing the Canadian or U.S. economies need right now is another blow.” DHS did not respond to a request for comment on the forthcoming joint statement, though people who work on cross-border relations said they expect it later Wednesday. Freeland indicated that the restrictions would go into effect within hours or days. The announcement marks the most dramatic limits to the shared land border since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when all ports of entry were shuttered for days. “If there’s anything to learn from 9/11, it’s that decisions governing the management of the border need to be made jointly and that there needs to be absolute clarity about what those decisions mean in terms of facilitating the movement of everyday travelers, workers and goods between the two countries,” said Mark Fisher, president and CEO of the Council of the Great Lakes Region. Daniel Ujczo, an international trade lawyer at Dickinson Wright, said the two countries’ stewardship of the border has drastically changed in the decades since, with greater investments in screening technologies and human resources and border agencies that frequently talk to each other. Plus, he said, the threat this time is known, unlike the days immediately following Sept. 11 when more attacks were feared. Trusted trade programs borne out of that time — FAST, Partners in Protection and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism — also offer a starting point for security officials to determine which businesses should have priority to cross, Ujczo said. “It’s a different reality,” he said. Still, Fisher suggested that some trade flows, like the food and medical supplies already highlighted by Trudeau, may need to be prioritized over others while keeping watch on the economic impacts of the tightened border. “I think certain judgments are going to have to be made,” he said.

"President Donald Trump’s top political advisers in recent weeks envisioned unleashing a massive advertising campaign against Joe Biden to define him for the general election before he had a chance to recover from the primary. Then the novel coronavirus arrived. With the death toll rising and daily life grinding to a halt, Trump’s sprawling political operation has put on hold any plans to use its nine-figure war chest to unload on the former vice president. The strategy, mimicking the playbook of Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign against Mitt Romney, was aimed at crippling the lesser-funded Biden before he could unify the Democratic Party behind him and marshal his forces for November. The reprieve is a blessing for Biden: Rather than spending valuable time fending off an assault, he is free to present himself as a steady leader amid a national crisis and to regroup for the general election.  The Trump operation’s reassessment underscores how the pandemic has disrupted virtually every element of the campaign for both parties. With less than eight months until Election Day, Trump and Biden are being forced to rethink their plans on everything from fundraising to field operations to staffing. “With Biden running away with it now, this would have been a good time to define him right off the bat. But it won't break through now, nor would it look good,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary in the George W. Bush White House. “This hiatus in many ways helps Biden.” Club for Growth President David McIntosh, whose pro-Trump group has aired a series of TV commercials bolstering the president, said he would be temporarily shelving any plans to take down Biden. “The response to the coronavirus has pushed the whole election off the front page,” McIntosh said, “and it will restart and readjust once the immediate crisis is over.” The Trump team isn’t completely backing down. The reelection effort has gone after Biden on Twitter the past few days, including on his response to the pandemic. And Trump couldn’t resist getting his licks in during a coronavirus news briefing Wednesday. The president noted that he was “beating Sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida” and “in other states.”  But Trump allies say that, for the time being at least, his reelection hopes hinge almost entirely on his ability to manage the crisis. While they acknowledge his initial response was lacking and that the virus poses a mortal threat to his 2020 prospects, they foresee a possible silver lining. If the virus passes and businesses and schools reopen before the election, they say, the president could present himself as the protagonist in an American comeback story. “If President Trump manages the pandemic well and gets the economy restarted he gets reelected,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally who is currently residing in coronavirus-devastated Italy. “If he fails to do so he probably gets defeated.” “The Trump team should focus on communicating about the virus and the economy,” Gingrich added, before noting that there would be “plenty of time for Biden later.” While the crisis has impeded Trump’s ability to damage Biden, it's also hemmed in the former vice president. Biden has scrapped campaign events and isn’t attending fundraisers, which could hamper his efforts to narrow Trump's massive fundraising advantage. The Biden campaign itself isn’t running ads against the president, though two liberal super PACs — Priorities USA and American Bridge — have recently gone on the air against Trump in battleground states. Biden aides say they are clear-eyed about their financial deficit. But on balance, they're grateful: Every day that passes without a Trump ad onslaught assault amounts to a reprieve. “He’s definitely getting a break,” Pete Giangreco, a Democratic strategist who worked on Obama’s presidential campaigns, said of Biden. “Right now, [the Trump campaign] can’t drive any of the contrast [with Biden] because it’s all, ‘What is the president doing about the coronavirus?’” Indeed, the Trump campaign has been essentially frozen in place by the virus, and they say there are currently no plans in place for a pricey anti-Biden ad campaign. “Americans want to see their president taking action to protect this nation, which is what President Trump is doing. At the campaign we just amplify that,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the reelection effort. The idea of a post-primary Biden takedown has its roots in the 2012 campaign. With Romney reeling after a costly and divisive primary, the Obama campaign unloaded on him with an ad campaign that painted him as a cold-hearted ex-venture capitalist who slashed working class jobs to make a profit.  In one ad of several ads savaging Romney from the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, a laid-off factory worker declared that he ""made over $100 million"" by shutting down his plant.  ""Romney had a great team, but it takes time to recover from the wounds of the primary contest, to restock the bank account, and retool the machinery for the general election,"" said Paul Begala, a consultant to Priorities that year. ""The coronavirus pandemic will, in fact, make it difficult — or even impossible — for Trump to do to Joe what we did to Mitt.""  Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who advised Romney’s campaign, recalled the destructive effect advertising blitz had on the GOP nominee. Romney didn’t have the money to respond at the time, Newhouse noted, and he never fully recovered. But Newhouse, who is working for several party committees this election cycle, argued that Trump still has time to prosecute a forceful case against the former vice president. “While the desire to define Biden is without question, this health crisis is going to kick the campaign's timing down the road a bit. It may not make it more difficult to define Biden, it just delays it,” Newhouse said. “Effectively, the campaign will be compressed into a narrower window.” But some Democrats are skeptical that Trump will have the same ability to tattoo Biden. David Axelrod, who served as senior strategist on Obama’s reelection effort, contended the former vice president is far better known than Romney was at this point in 2012 — and therefore will be harder to redefine.  ""It’s a very complicated challenge for the Trump team,"" Axelrod said. The Trump campaign faces other complications, such as determining how they want to go after Biden. While Trump’s team has tried to brand the 77-year-old former vice president as senile, there is some skepticism among his advisers about whether it will prove effective. Others Biden allies don’t buy the idea the trigger-happy Trump will lay off for now. “He may have made a political judgment that he shouldn’t hit us now,” Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a Biden campaign co-chair said. “Then he’ll lash out like the person we all know he is.”",Coronavirus shelves Trump's barrage on Biden,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-biden-coronavirus-136197,politico
"As the globe confronts the coronavirus pandemic, one urgent problem is the shortage of key pieces of equipment, including high-quality masks, test kits and—perhaps most important of all—ventilators. It seems hundreds of thousands of lives might be saved, if only manufacturers could quickly ramp up the production of such equipment, perhaps by a factor of 100 or 1,000, within a few weeks. The United States has done something similar, on a nationwide scale, once before—eight decades ago during the emergency of World War II. At that time, there was a desperate need to radically accelerate the output of items such as ships, tanks and bombers. With decisive government action, including taking a little bit of control from corporations, this effort was hugely successful. Might there be lessons to be learned now, from that history? Here are five takeaways from the World War II industrial mobilization to help inspire creative thinking by business leaders and policymakers today. During World War II, manufacturers of key items were guaranteed that national government agencies would purchase all of their output, even if the equipment ultimately wasn't needed. That was a response to the experience of World War I, during which some contractors had been left holding unwanted goods when the conflict ended suddenly in November 1918. During World War II, the technique of guaranteed sales was used to good effect in the machine tools industry. This was the essential sector that supplied the drills, lathes, grinders and other equipment that all sorts of manufacturers needed to turn pieces of metal into finished products. To encourage maximum production of machine tools, the Tools Division of the War Production Board, an emergency civilian coordinating agency, created what it called the pool-order mechanism, guaranteeing purchases of maximum output. As the official history of the Tools Division put it soon after the war, this device “encouraged output at a rate manufacturers could not have afforded otherwise.” The lesson for 2020 is that if we want more ventilators as soon as possible, the national government needs to guarantee it will purchase them. During World War II, expert manufacturers shared designs and techniques with other firms, so that key items could be produced on multiple production lines, simultaneously. This was done on a grand scale in the U.S. aircraft industry. For example, Pratt & Whitney, the top aircraft engine manufacturer, shared drawings and knowledge with Ford Motor Co. and General Motors, the giant automakers, so that they could mass-produce engines, under licensing agreements with nominal fees. Similarly, Boeing worked with competitors, including Lockheed and Vega, so the Boeing-designed B-17 bomber could be made at its rivals’ plants in California, as well as in the company’s home facility in Seattle. These arrangements were encouraged and facilitated by the U.S. Army Air Forces, which, like other military organizations, served as a top manager and coordinator of the war economy. Today, public authorities and business leaders might use a similar approach, by arranging to have the best versions of key items like tests, ventilators, medications and vaccines made by multiple companies, using temporary deals that would bypass delays that might come from concerns about proprietary technology and competitive advantage. World War II saw the emergency construction of manufacturing plants, the vast majority of which were paid for and owned by U.S. government agencies but operated by companies in the private sector. Indeed, the main mechanism for the biggest expansions of industrial capacity in World War II was the government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) plant. The famed Kaiser shipyards, which turned out big merchant vessels in a matter of days, were GOCO facilities, as were most of the big new bomber plants run by the top airframe manufacturers, including Douglas, Martin and North American. The atomic bomb project, like the conventional explosives program, was based on GOCO plants, run by some of the country’s leading corporate manufacturers, including DuPont and Eastman Kodak. By eliminating risk to private producers and their bankers, this model of government financing and ownership proved much more effective than other schemes used during World War II, including tax incentives and government promises to buy privately financed plants over a five-year period. Today, the GOCO model could be useful in cases where new production lines—for respirators, vaccines or other items we realize are now essential—need to be built fast, without waiting to see whether private capital will fund them. The record of World War II shows it is possible, if not easy, to produce emergency alternatives closer to home when global supply chains are disrupted. Many of the combatant nations in World War II did this more than the United States, which was fortunate to have vast natural resources and the world’s largest national economy. But even the U.S. was forced into an all-out emergency scramble to replace imports with new domestic sources, most importantly in the case of rubber. Here American authorities failed to anticipate an enormous problem for the war effort that occurred when Japan’s victories in early 1942 cut off imports of natural rubber from Indonesia. This threatened to cripple the production of items like military trucks and aircraft, which needed rubber for their tires. However, a massive, rapid effort, using GOCO plants and the expertise of oil, chemical and tire companies, allowed the United States to rapidly build from scratch a big new synthetic rubber industry. Today, as the disruption of global supply chains is making it harder to procure a variety of key components for the coronavirus fight, it makes sense for policymakers and business leaders to engage in some quick planning and cooperation, to find and finance domestic substitutes. U.S. authorities successfully contained the problem of profiteering—and, perhaps more important, the problem of public outrage at perceived illegitimate profit-taking in time of crisis—with a multidimensional array of controls. These included direct caps on prices, special war taxes and very high marginal income tax rates on war manufacturers, and congressionally mandated “renegotiation” (clawbacks) of corporate profits deemed by the War and Navy Departments to be excessive. These measures did not prevent all profiteering, nor public complaints about it, but they did improve on the record of World War I. The high taxes paid for nearly half of the war effort (with most of the rest financed by war bonds), keeping deficits in check. Thanks in part to the price and profit controls, public morale—and the legitimacy of private- and public-sector authorities—remained high enough for Americans to sustain an energetic, multiyear mobilization. In 2020, targeted taxes and controls could similarly limit hoarding and profiteering, boosting public morale. And if emergency stimulus measures are so big as to trigger inflation, sharply progressive taxes could be an equitable way to tame a rise in prices, while holding down deficits. To be sure, none of these techniques from 80 years ago might be perfectly applicable to our situation in 2020. Perhaps most important, it is likely that the current mobilization needs to go even faster. During World War II, the giant war plants used to ramp up production took months to build. Today, it would appear that we have not months, but weeks. A quicker mobilization would likely test the limits of some of the technologies that have developed over the past decades, including quick modular construction, computer modeling, 3-D printing and robotics. Nonetheless, despite the different timetable, some of the techniques outlined above, including various forms of public assumption of risk, might remain relevant for today’s policymakers. Of course, today’s crisis makes it clear that there has been systematic underinvestment, over the past several decades, in planning, in-house government labs and plants, surge capacity and public health. One reason for this is that American leaders failed to learn properly from the record of World War II. That failure came not only from forgetfulness or oversight, but also from a deliberate effort to obscure the importance of public investment, public regulation and public coordination by those who preferred a story of World War II in which the only heroes on the homefront were for-profit companies. Today, we need to relearn the real lessons from that war. By using new, creative solutions inspired by a fuller understanding of the real history, we will be better armed to combat the biggest challenges of the 21st century.",The 5 WWII Lessons That Could Help the Government Fight Coronavirus,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/19/coronavirus-defense-production-world-war-two-lessons-135814,politico

"OTTAWA — Across Canada, provincial health authorities have limited access to coronavirus tests to conserve resources, even as the World Health Organization calls on nations to expand testing to slow the spread of the disease. Several provinces, including Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, are instructing people with mild symptoms of Covid-19 to self-isolate rather than seek testing, partly to guard against shortages. But on Wednesday, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to ""isolate, test, treat and trace."" “If they don’t, transmission chains can continue at a low level, then resurge once physical distancing measures are lifted,"" he told reporters. In Ottawa on Wednesday, chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam once again stressed the need to flatten the curve of the virus' spread, pointing to a ""sharp rise in cases"" during the past week. ""This is a signal there is some degree of community spread,"" she said. ""Our time to act is now."" As of Wednesday evening, Canada had recorded nearly 730 confirmed and presumptive cases of Covid-19 and nine deaths, including a first death reported in Quebec earlier that day. Though the numbers are clearly increasing, health experts say it’s hard to know how many cases there actually are in Canada, since not everyone with symptoms is being tested. But they disagree about how much the real numbers matter. Some point out that the available data shows the rate of spread, if not the total number of people infected, and say as long as people with symptoms self-isolate, Canada has a chance to slow transmission of the virus and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. Others counter that people are less likely to self-isolate if they don’t know whether they have Covid-19, and argue it’s much harder to control the virus when you don’t know exactly where it is. David Fisman, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, said testing is the best way to get control of an epidemic early. By the time people start to die, he said, there have likely been generations of transmission that have gone undetected. “And that’s how you get completely hosed by this,” he said. “The testing is kind of our eyes and ears in terms of what’s happening. … I think we’re missing a ton of this stuff.” Fisman said the real number of cases in Canada could be much larger than the number on the books. “We have the sense that our positives are increasing exponentially,” he said. “The question is what fraction of the true total cases does that represent.” Moreover, the cases being confirmed today are likely people who got sick a week ago or more, said University of Toronto epidemiologist Dr. Jeff Kwong. “In an ideal world, we would be testing everybody,” he said. “It’s just the reality is we don’t have the resources to do that.” Ottawa’s medical officer of health, Dr. Vera Etches, has warned there could be hundreds of undiagnosed cases in the city, though there is still no proof of community transmission. Fisman said that may well be the case in many Canadian cities. Even if the confirmed cases are a significant underestimate, though, they still give a sense of the virus’ trajectory, said Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre. “I think that as long as we keep doing the same thing … the numbers from one day to the next are telling us something about how the epidemic is growing,” he said. Canada is “actually doing a really good job” at testing, given limited resources, said Jason Kindrachuk, assistant professor at the University of Manitoba and Canada Research Chair in emerging viruses. “I don’t think the overall accuracy of the definitive numbers is really important at this stage,” he said, pointing instead to the importance of social distancing and self-isolation to flatten the curve of the virus' spread. Still, Dr. William Cherniak, an emergency room physician who has been testing patients for Covid-19 for about a month, said the ideal solution would be a test that people could administer themselves. “My thing is always that knowledge is power,” he said. Self-isolation would be effective “if people really stayed at home for 14 days if they had the symptoms,” he said. But if they haven’t been diagnosed with Covid-19, he believes, they’re less likely to take those instructions seriously.  On Wednesday, Health Minister Patty Hajdu announced Canada has approved two new diagnostic tests to allow provincial labs to expand testing. “Early diagnosis is a critical component of slowing down the spread of the illness and Canadians can be encouraged that Canada has been leading in terms of our testing capacity,” she said. Certainly, Canada has been doing more testing than the U.S., relative to population size. Tam said Wednesday that more than 50,000 people have been tested for Covid-19 in Canada. Meanwhile, the COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run accounting of every coronavirus test administered in the U.S., was reporting a total of about 76,000 tests on Wednesday evening, for a population 10 times the size of Canada's. Still, Canada’s efforts don’t compare to the work being done in South Korea, which now has the ability to test up to 20,000 people a day. What many Canadians are watching for these days is whether this country is on the same trajectory as Italy was a few weeks ago, before its hospitals were flooded with patients needing emergency care. If Canada has any chance of avoiding that, Kindrachuk said, now is the time to take social distancing seriously, regardless of the exact number of cases. “It’s the calm before the storm in a lot of ways. We cannot become complacent,” he said. “If we don’t do anything different, we know where this is going.”","Canada has tested more than 50,000 people for Covid-19.

"A critical lack of testing kits. A shortage of ventilators. Not enough ICU beds.  America’s struggle to deal with the spread of the highly infectious new virus Covid-19 is bad enough, with the number of confirmed cases surging, hospitals begging for help and entire cities going on lockdown.  But it’s also exposed just how unprepared the U.S. is for a threat many would-be Cassandras have been warning about for years: a targeted biological attack. “When one thinks about what a bioterror attack would look like—it is crystal clear we are not even close to being ready,” said former Department of Homeland Security official Daniel Gerstein, now a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation.  Today’s mantra of “flattening the curve” — or lessening the spike in illnesses, thereby slowing the infection rate to reduce the burdens on the health care system — would not apply to a bioterror attack. “The people in that cloud would be infected all at once, so you would see a very large spike of very sick patients,” Gerstein said. As the response to the outbreak from governments at all levels has shown, the U.S. was completely unprepared for a slowly creeping pandemic — let alone a biological attack that would overwhelm it all at once. Potential biological weapons include anthrax, which, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, “makes a good weapon because it can be released quietly and without anyone knowing”; smallpox, frozen stocks of which are still maintained by the U.S. and Russia; tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, which attacks the skin, eyes, lymph nodes and lungs and was stockpiled by the U.S. military and the former Soviet Union after World War II; and botulism, which is caused by exposure to toxins made by C. botulinum — the most toxic substances known to humankind, which attack the body’s nerves and can lead to respiratory failure.  More than six weeks into the Trump administration’s response effort — which began Jan. 29 with the announcement of a coronavirus task force and, two days later, the declaration of a public health emergency — ramped-up testing for the virus has only just begun, hospital systems say they don’t have enough beds and medical supplies to handle the onslaught of anticipated patients, and there is a shortage of respirators, ventilators and other protective equipment for nurses and doctors on the front lines. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, only recently shifted his tone: On Sunday, he called the virus “something we have tremendous control of.” By Monday, he was urging people to stay home and beginning to hurl the full might of thefederal government at what he described as “an invisible enemy.” But with confirmed cases soaring past 7,000 and now reaching into 50 states, officials are warning privately that it may be as long as 18 months before the pandemic is brought to heel. To biodefense experts, the Trump administration’s sluggish response revealed a dangerous failure of imagination throughout the system, and showed how unprepared the government still is to handle a catastrophic biological event.  “The sense is that we haven’t fully prepared” for that possibility, said a U.S. government official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “If we had an attack, and even if we had the treatment or the vaccine that everyone needed, we don’t have the capacity to get that to 330 million Americans if we were in a lockdown situation where trucks weren’t moving. So that’s one thing that we’ve looked at.” Other basic logistical questions also have yet to be resolved, the official added. “Can we create a capacity? What does that look like? Do we set it up in gymnasiums? Who’s going to do it? How are the things going to get delivered if you have sort of a general breakdown in the system?” Covid-19 was not manufactured, and the risk of it being weaponized is extremely low given its highly infectious nature that would likely backfire on any group trying to spread it, experts said.  But an administration official cautioned that the prospect of intentional exposure targeting U.S. government employees “is a concern,” and noted that the Defense Department “has imposed a lot of travel restrictions” despite a certain amount of exposure being “inevitable.”  The FBI, whose field offices are known to allow “walk-in” tipsters, is also taking extra precautions. “In support of our mission, we are enacting measures to protect the FBI workforce, including heightened hygiene practices, social distancing options, like telework and flexible work schedules where appropriate, and authorizing only essential operational travel until further notice,” a spokesperson said.  The scale of the outbreak is the closest thing the U.S. has seen to how a bioweapon—which may take the form of viruses, bacteria, toxins, fungi and rickettsiae—can shut down a society and severely strain resources, several sources said.  “We haven’t seen anything that appears to be this pathogenic and transmissible since maybe 1918 or 1957,” said the U.S. government official. And the response so far to coronavirus, the official added, “shows that we don’t have the systems in place to rapidly diagnose cases, or to scale up a mass response very quickly.”  “We are in the realm now where biological weapons are really becoming possible,” the official said. “People have talked about [gene editing in bioweapons] for 50 years. … It is not science fiction anymore. Literally in the last five years we’ve crossed that threshold.""  George echoed those concerns. “What we’re seeing are all the places where we are vulnerable,” she said. “You can see people not really having thought about what impact a biological event would have on the nation in any number of different sectors.”  With the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, she said, a national strategy for pandemic influenza was already in place, though Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force response coordinator, acknowledged in a news conference on Tuesday that “now we are seeing we have to revise” the flu pandemic preparedness plan. And because the U.S. deals with seasonal influenza every year, manufacturers already knew how to produce the necessary vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization protocol, which clears labs to produce tests in the event of an outbreak, has also gotten more complicated—while it was streamlined for Ebola, Zika, and H1N1, the FDA was slow to trigger the workaround for coronavirus testing. “It feels like we have regressed considerably,” said Gerstein.  The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, established in 2014 and co-chaired by former Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, warned in 2018 that “the United States is underprepared for biological threats” from both terrorists and “nature itself,” via emerging and reemerging infectious diseases like Covid-19. “Despite significant progress on several fronts, the Nation is dangerously vulnerable to a biological event,” reads the organization’s bipartisan report. “The root cause of this continuing vulnerability is the lack of strong centralized leadership at the highest level of government.” The threat of a large-scale biological catastrophe, particularly one that hits all at once instead of over a period of weeks or months, is particularly problematic because the U.S. health care system is still “the weakest link” in the nation’s ability to respond effectively to an outbreak, said Ali S. Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “Routinely, we are not even able to surge for a bad flu season,” said Khan, who served as the CDC’s director of public health preparedness and response and helped establish the CDC’s bioterrorism program. During the 2017-18 flu season, one of the deadliest in 40 years, with more than 61,000 flu-related deaths across the country, overwhelmed hospitals in some parts of the country pitched tents outside ERs and used ambulances as stand-ins for patient rooms.  The detection capabilities are behind, too: While DHS has a BioWatch program that gathers air samples in 30 U.S. cities to monitor the threat of bioterrorism, it’s nearly two decades old and takes from 11 to 13 hours to determine whether a biological agent has been deployed. The emergence and spread of Covid-19 should have been easier to predict and prepare for than a bioterror attack would be—but it still caught the administration by surprise. It’s not as though the emergence of a novel disease with a significant mortality rate is “brand new,” Khan said, pointing to the SARS outbreak roughly 17 years ago. “We knew this was a possibility, so there are so no excuses. We are eight weeks behind where we should have been in terms of our planning.” One of the biggest issues with planning effectively is that “public health is largely invisible, underappreciated, and as a result underfunded,” Umair A. Shah, a top Texas health official, told the House Homeland Security Committee in October. “This ‘Invisibility Crisis’ problem has unfortunately led to funding cuts for public health and public health preparedness at every level of government.”  George emphasized that the issue doesn’t lie just with the executive branch — Congress, with the power of the purse, needs to be an active partner in developing an agenda, assigning responsibilities and allocating the appropriate funds, instead of just “spitting out emergency supplementals.” The U.S. launched a national stockpile program 20 years ago as a way to prepare for biological, chemical or nuclear attacks on the homeland. Its goal was initially to prepare for an unusual threat and was very oriented toward specific biological agents, George said. It now houses the country’s largest supply of vaccines and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency, like an outbreak of smallpox and anthrax, or widespread radiation sickness. The stockpile is a work in progress, however. While the CDC now says there is enough smallpox vaccine in the stockpile for every American, it initially housed only 15 million doses, 90,000 of which were available for immediate use. The renowned epidemiologist D.A. Henderson, who led preparedness for the Department of Health and Human Services after 9/11, wrote in 2009 that the CDC also hadn’t checked the vaccines’ potency in nearly eight years, instead of every three as is required. (An HHS spokesperson also said in a statement that the Strategic National Stockpile participates in the FDA/DOD Shelf-life Extension Program “to extend the life of some products beyond their original use-by dates.”) As the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated, the possibilities for a catastrophic biological event go beyond what was initially envisioned — so there needs to be an attendant increase in what goes into the stockpile, George said. Supplies are running low, particularly when it comes to ventilators — a growing necessity as Covid-19, a respiratory virus, spreads. In a news briefing on Monday, HHS Secretary Alex Azar declined to reveal the exact number of ventilators in the stockpile, citing “national security concerns.” (Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the number is around 12,700.)  George and Khan explained that the numbers are a matter of national security because they could reveal a vulnerability. The idea is to prevent adversaries from exploiting a shortage by launching a biological attack that would require people to use a resource, like ventilators, in numbers too large to accommodate. “We don’t want to give our adversaries a road map,” Khan said.  But it is generally well known that ventilators and essential medical supplies like needles, gauze and gloves are in short supply, George said, as are other kinds of medicines, like fever reducers, which are necessary in cases like this, where the best that can be done for now is supportive rather than preventive care. A deployable vaccine is still at least a year away, Fauci said last week.  “We are in the exponential phase right now,” said Gerstein. “It’s only going to get worse. We are nowhere near the end of our transmission.”  Jason Millman contributed to this report.",'It is not science fiction anymore': Coronavirus exposes U.S. vulnerability to biowarfare,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-biowarfare-terror-136194,politico
"When America is at war, voters prefer not to swap presidents in the middle of battle. James Madison sailed to reelection after launching the War of 1812. Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the Confederacy surrendered at Appomattox. In the shadow of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt notched a third term. And the year after deploying troops to Iraq, George W. Bush defeated a war veteran, Democrat John Kerry. What if the enemy is invisible? Not a foreign country, or the perpetrators of a brazen terrorist attack, but a lethal disease that forces Americans to shelter in place indefinitely as their health, jobs and wages hang in the balance?  President Donald Trump is about to find out.  After fumbling his administration’s initial response to the devastating spread of COVID-19, and dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus for months as it spread from China, Trump has turned to the one concept that seems to work politically to overcome monumental challenges. Days after he issued a national emergency declaration to help combat the global pandemic, the New York businessman — who famously avoided the Vietnam draft multiple times — informed Americans on Wednesday that he is now “a wartime president,” and said the country should prepare to fight. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” Trump said at a White House briefing featuring Defense Secretary Mark Esper, U.S. Veterans Affairs chief Robert Wilkie and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force.  “Now it’s our time,” Trump continued, recalling the bravery America showed during World War II. “We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we will come through together.”  The wartime posture Trump has adopted in his tone and actions — he invoked the Defense Production Act on Wednesday, giving him the authority to influence private industries for emergency response purposes — marks an extraordinary new phase in his attempt to reclaim public support for his handling of the deadly outbreak, and it raises questions about the potential measures Trump could take if the crisis spirals even further out of control.  “He is trying to create a sense of command-and-control and authority now that it’s obvious this is going to be a big challenge for the country,” said Tony Fratto, a White House aide to President George W. Bush.  Trump already has announced plans to dispatch two Navy ships with operating rooms and hospital beds to New York Harbor and the West Coast to assist local medical workers as they grapple with an influx of patients who have contracted COVID-19 and require treatment for the virus. The idea to reposition the two ships — the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort — gained steam after Trump last Friday issued his emergency declaration, which served as a “green light” for the Pentagon to begin taking more aggressive measures, according to a well-placed Defense Department official. Earlier on, there had been internal disagreements between Pentagon officials who wanted the administration to take “prudent measures,” such as travel restrictions, and those who wished to avoid rash decisions that could exacerbate political consequences and the current economic downturn, the official said. Some White House officials were hesitant to enlist the Navy ships prematurely since the Comfort is currently undergoing maintenance that could take weeks to complete. (The Mercy, which is currently stationed in San Diego, could deploy within days.) The administration is also weighing the deployment of National Guard and Reserve troops at the federal level if conditions worsen in the coming weeks. Contingency planning began Tuesday at the Pentagon, where officials discussed enlisting guardsmen to deliver food and medical supplies to vulnerable populations, build temporary hospitals and retrofit facilities that could be used as hospitals, and work with local police units to enforce curfews like they have in coastal areas facing hurricanes. Nearly 20 governors have already activated national guardsmen as they work to contain the rapidly spreading virus within their own states, and some have encouraged the president to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers in a further step to address the outbreak. “We believe the use of active duty Army Corps personnel would not violate federal law because this is a national disaster,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday.  For now, the president’s greatest tool has been his rhetoric — particularly the ways in which he is using the war metaphor to try to boost public morale, reach supporters who remain dismissive of the worldwide pandemic and preemptively position himself as a president who rose to the occasion when voters weigh their options this November.  “President Trump has figured out that he has to put aside that proudly reckless style of governance that has been a staple of his presidency to date, and adopt a posture that’s more typical of what presidents have done in crises,” said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University history professor. “At the same time, it’s not so much about calling himself a wartime president as it is about whether he matches the rhetoric with actions that make us safer,” Greenberg added.  To that end, Trump has enlisted the help of nearly everyone in his usual orbit — and beyond. According to two people familiar with the discussions, Trump has privately encouraged White House aides, personal friends and corporate executives to brainstorm creative steps they can take to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, keep health care professionals equipped to manage patients and prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded and doctors overwhelmed.  Officials involved with the White House Office of American Innovation, for example, have spent the past several days conferring with major tech companies about how they can help distribute public service announcements related to COVID-19 and prevent severe supply shortages as consumers prepare for weeks of minimal social contact outside their homes and hospitals worry about the availability of protective personal equipment — including surgical masks, goggles and gloves — and office supplies.  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has spearheaded much of the outreach to Big Tech and other industries, is specifically trying to marshal the private sector behind the president. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are pressuring GOP lawmakers to quickly pass a massive aid package of more than $1 trillion to stabilize the economy and soften a coronavirus-induced recession. And on Wednesday, Trump announced a mutual agreement with Canada to close the United States’ northern border to all nonessential traffic — a step that came as the president simultaneously weighs new restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border. Ultimately, Trump’s push to portray himself as a wartime leader has gained broad attention not because of his efforts to get the military, the government and private industries involved in responding to the coronavirus outbreak, but because of the manner in which his entire administration and 2020 campaign appeared to adopt the same message overnight.  By Wednesday morning, the president, his allies and top administration officials were nearly all employing the rhetoric of war: encouraging sacrifice, promising better days ahead while acknowledging difficulties now, promoting patriotism and praising “bold” actions that might quickly return the country to normalcy. In the opinion pages of USA Today, Pence asked young and healthy Americans — some of whom spent last weekend going about their normal lives — to commit to making small sacrifices to keep others safe, writing that “there is no substitute for the action of the American people.” In an email blast Wednesday afternoon, the Republican National Committee praised Trump’s “wartime footing” and “whole of America” approach.  Senior Pentagon officials even advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former Defense Department official.  Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who is close to securing his spot as Trump’s Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, described the coronavirus outbreak in warlike terms. Speaking to supporters from his Delaware home after a series of primary victories Tuesday, Biden said “tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” “This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak…,” Biden said. An outside adviser to the Trump campaign said the president’s 2020 team is hoping to capitalize on Trump’s new messaging strategy by launching a series of digital ads as soon as next week that highlight the president’s efforts to battle the “invisible enemy” — a phrase Trump has recently used to describe the deadly respiratory syndrome. A Trump campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.  “I wouldn’t mind seeing the Trump campaign expend some resources to communicate to his supporters that this is important,” Fratto said. “And if he has to use wartime language to do it, it’s in all of our interests to let him.”  If the president’s strategy works, he could have a shot at finding himself back on the Speaker’s balcony for his second swearing-in ceremony next January, having won reelection because voters either cut him slack — something his predecessors who became wartime leaders appeared to benefit from even as economic turmoil persisted — or because the country recovered from a war their commander-in-chief led them through.  But there’s no guarantee Trump will meet the same fate as Madison, Lincoln, Roosevelt or Bush even if Americans agree that this is war.  Damaged by his handling of the war in Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson stunned the country in 1968 when he announced he would not run for reelection.  And a quarter century later, President George H.W. Bush lost his bid for a second term to an Arkansan named Bill Clinton a year after the 1991 Gulf War.",Trump team’s new mission: Defend the ‘wartime president’,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-wartime-president-coronavirus-136892,politico
"How/where are you celebrating your birthday and with whom? “My beautiful fiancee and I will be celebrating at home, following the White House and CDC’s guidelines.

Todd Rokita (R-Ind.). I was fresh out of college, had no ties to Indiana, no connections in Republican politics and no clue what I was doing.

"Probably for most of us, the coronavirus crisis will soon enough—Six months? A year?—recede in our minds and come to seem like a hallucinatory moment. Maybe it will be like a hurricane that forced everyone to rush inland and then only glanced the coast.  Or maybe it will be like a hurricane that really does hit. Even then, human nature being what it is, most people will clean up and move on. Yet no matter how the coronavirus pandemic passes, or how quickly, there is likely in these strange housebound weeks a new political epoch being born. There are two large reasons to believe the political echo of this crisis will last much longer than the crisis itself. The first is that many of the people whose expectations and routines are most dramatically upended by the pandemic are students. The interruption, and in some cases irreplaceable loss, of important experiences in their education, as campuses empty and untold events are canceled, will likely shape their consciousness in more lasting ways than for the rest of us. Like most catastrophes, the pandemic’s malign consequences will fall most heavily on the underprivileged. Unlike most catastrophes, its costs are also being paid heavily by some segments of the most privileged. Those college seniors whose spring terms and graduation ceremonies are suddenly deleted include many people who are future leaders of the public and private sectors. No, it’s not the end of the world for them. But it’s a piercing loss even so—one being paid more for the benefit of older, less healthy people than for pure self-protection. More profoundly, the dynamics of the coronavirus moment likely will resemble the dynamics of other great public policy issues shadowing the next generation. In particular, the global pandemic and the harsh choices it imposes offer—in highly concentrated fashion in coming months—much the same choices that responses to global climate change will impose in coming decades. Like the coronavirus emergency, climate change is a problem whose dimensions are largely the province of scientific experts—employing complex data models aimed at illuminating future trends that the average citizen can understand in broad concept but not in detail. The essential question: Do you trust these experts, or not? Like the coronavirus, climate change is a problem for which remedies are not solely the province of experts but are primarily the realm of community values. These remedies involve tangible and immediate costs for benefits that are abstract and imponderable.  In the case of coronavirus, for instance, the shutdown of the economy required by enforcing social distancing imposes costs that are immediate and quite likely already in your midst—layoffs of someone you know, uncertainty about future income, concern for a favorite neighborhood business about to go under. As to the benefits, meanwhile, no one knows—certainly not now, maybe not ever. Perhaps the massive response won’t really be effective and a public health catastrophe unfolds anyway. Or maybe the response in retrospect will seem overblown. In the case of climate change, the tension between immediate certain consequences—whether paying a carbon tax or substantially altering consumption habits—for diffuse and distant benefits is more acute. The rewards for the deep and comprehensive changes needed to replace a carbon-fueled economy and halt the warming of the planet will be enjoyed—one hopes—primarily by people not yet born. Finally, of course, coronavirus is like climate change in the sense that it is impervious to national borders. One way to gauge the power of these currents—crisis fueled by frightening science—is by watching the change in President Donald Trump. There is no way to know for certain what the coronavirus means for his reelection. But already it is evident what it has meant for Trumpism. It has sent it hurtling into retreat. Trumpism as an idea is about promoting and protecting American sovereignty and singularity. In some contexts, even Trump foes might agree it’s an attractive concept: Well might we wish to seal our borders from the virus. But the only way this would be effective would be if the United States had years ago opted to adjourn from the modern interconnected global economy. Yes, the coronavirus first presented itself in China. How many people were surprised to learn only in the past few weeks that nearly all U.S. antibiotics also come from China. Trumpism as a style is defined not just by boasting and bluster; his triumphalism depends on projecting certitude. The president early on acted as if he could indeed create reality by proclamation, when he assured the public that U.S. infections would soon be down to zero. Only in recent days, as the possibility of widespread domestic disease mounts, has Trump acknowledged imprecision—the fragmentary nature of our understanding of how far the virus has spread, how effective efforts to blunt its impact will be, or when these efforts will be deemed sufficient.  One way to appreciate the murkiness of our circumstances—and the moral implications of this murkiness—is to view them through the eyes of young people. No need to overstate things. Missing spring semester is not the same as dodging sniper fire in Kabul, nor the same as being laid off from your job handling bags at O’Hare.  But nor should one understate things. Suppose baseball has been your consuming passion since age 6 and now at 22 you are expecting one last idyll as team captain. Now that season will never happen. Maybe you were planning to spend the semester in Peru and are now scrambling to see if you can find a flight home. Planes and restaurants will fill up again. In all likelihood that semester abroad is gone for good. Psych 101 perhaps can be taken remotely; the exhilarating 1 a.m. conversation in the dorm lounge will not be.  Out of curiosity, I read various college and university presidents’ letters announcing the closure of their campuses. Most were filled with the same kind of bromides as your workplace or mine offered about caring first and foremost for the health and etc., etc., of our community. One letter, by Williams College president Maud Mandel, stuck out for its candor: “A healthy person could reasonably choose to stay and accept the personal risk of catching COVID-19, but the decision would unacceptably increase the chance of contagion for others.” Indeed, that 21-year-old might plausibly calculate, even if he or she gets sick the chances are, not for everybody but for most, that it would be a miserable few days rather than life-threatening illness. Those institutions closed less to protect their campus communities than to protect the broader society. The coronavirus pandemic does not remotely have the cataclysmic shock and violence of 9/11. For many people, however, the virus’ actual day-in, day-out impact will be more pervasive. 9-11 was followed by a period, which turned out to be short-lived, of national connection and goodwill. Trump, who has made mockery and castigation of opponents his signature, surely did not conjure fuzzy feelings from many quarters with his appeal at the White House on Wednesday that, “We are all in this together.” Yet the pandemic has a logic that transcends politics and personal feeling. Never mind how one feels about Trump. Never mind how we feel about one another. The reality of a dangerous virus is that we are all in this together.

"Coronavirus has finally reached Congress. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a ninth-term Florida Republican, and Rep. Ben McAdams, a freshman Democrat from Utah, revealed on Wednesday that they had tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first U.S. lawmakers to contract the virus that‘s spreading across the country. Diaz-Balart, 58, said he began to develop symptoms on Saturday, just hours after he left the House floor for a vote on a coronavirus response bill. More than 400 members of Congress also voted during the early-Saturday session. Diaz-Balart’s statement indicates he decided to “self-quarantine in Washington D.C.” after the vote. His statement doesn’t indicate why he believed he needed to self-quarantine before developing symptoms or whether he informed staff or other members of Congress that he might have exposed them to the illness. “I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better,” Diaz-Balart said in the statement. “However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus. We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times.” McAdams, 45, also said his symptoms began mildly on Saturday night, after he had returned to Utah. He immediately began self-quarantining on the advice of his doctor. “My symptoms got worse and I developed a fever, a dry cough and labored breathing and I remained self-quarantined,“ McAdams said in a statement. “On Tuesday, my doctor instructed me to get tested for COVID-19 and following his referral, I went to the local testing clinic for the test. Today I learned that I tested positive.“ Diaz-Balart said he decided to remain in Washington on Saturday because he was concerned about being in his South Florida home, where his wife, who has a pre-existing condition, would be “at exceptionally high risk.” Like Diaz-Balart, McAdams didn‘t indicate whether he had urged any of his colleagues or aides to self-quarantine. The news of two members testing positive has already begun rippling across Congress. Rep. Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.) said on Wednesday night that the House doctor had advised him to self-quarantine until March 27 because he “was in contact with a member of Congress on March 13th that has since tested positive for COVID-19.“ The House minority whip, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), said on Wednesday that he, too, would self-quarantine because he had held an “extended meeting“ with Diaz-Balart late last week. Scalise is now the highest-ranking lawmaker to self-quarantine amid the outbreak. Overnight, four more lawmakers announced self-quarantines. Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) told the Miami Herald that she would isolate herself and that another member of the Florida delegation was being tested based on symptoms. Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) also announces self-quarantines.  Though Diaz-Balart and McAdams are the first in Congress to develop coronavirus, the illness has struck among a small number of congressional aides. It’s sure to heighten already-acute fears on Capitol Hill that members themselves, particularly the high proportion of elderly lawmakers, are vulnerable when they meet in Washington. The development appears likely to revive an internal House debate about whether to permit remote voting for lawmakers amid a pandemic that‘s ravaging the country, pummeling the economy and limiting members‘ ability to travel across the country.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats have resisted the idea, worrying that it would set a damaging precedent for the future and signal a lack of confidence from government in the country‘s fight against coronavirus. But with two lawmakers ill and untold others exposed, some lawmakers say it‘s time to think again. “In. Person. Voting. Should. Be. Reconsidered,“ Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a freshman Democrat from Florida, said in a tweet late Wednesday. “For the safety of our communities, during this emergency, we must be able to legislate from our districts.“ Earlier in the day, 50 lawmakers of both parties wrote to House leaders asking them to reconsider remote voting as well, arguing that Congress must hold itself to the same standards it‘s asking of other Americans.",First 2 members of Congress test positive for coronavirus,2020-03-18,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/first-member-of-congress-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-136300,politico
"The Labor Department reported 281,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, a 70,000 jump over the previous week that it attributed to the coronavirus epidemic. It was the highest level of claims since September 2017 and the first in a flood of unfavorable economic indicators expected from the Trump administration as businesses shut down and workers go home. Unemployment claims will likely rise higher in coming months as job growth ends, the unemployment rate rises, and GDP sags. The only question is how long the bad times will last, and that will depend on how fast and how far the virus spreads. DOL's new unemployment number records claims filed during the week ending March 14. But reports from unemployment insurance offices around the country indicated the real explosion in claims began this past weekend, and continued unabated this week. In Colorado, nearly 11,000 unemployment claims were filed Monday and Tuesday, compared to only 400 claims filed the previous Monday. In New Jersey, 15,000 people applied for unemployment benefits on Monday, a number twelve times higher than normal levels. Pennsylvania was on track to see more than 100,000 claims on Monday and Tuesday, compared to 12,000 during first week of March. And in the 24 hours after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed an emergency order Monday closing bars, restaurants and other public places, workers filed nearly ten times as many claims as during the entire week one year earlier. Jacob Robbins, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who tracks unemployment insurance claims, estimated that in 14 states roughly 340,000 claims were made on March 16 and March 17 alone — more than fifty percent more than were reported nationwide during the previous week. The surge in unemployment claims accompanied widespread reports of layoffs nationwide. New York-based Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, laid off 80 percent of its workers. On Tuesday Marriott said it expects to lay off tens of thousands of workers worldwide. MGM Resorts International closed 150 restaurants and bars Monday. Experts predicted millions of job losses. The Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimated that 3000 jobs have been lost already, and that job losses could rise as high as 9 million. The Senate on Wednesday passed a multibillion dollar emergency aid package to counter the economic slowdown that included $2 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Senate Republicans are also working on a proposal for a third, larger stimulus package to address the epidemic that likely will include $250 billion in direct payments to Americans starting April 6. Earlier this month DOL advised states that workers affected by the coronavirus are eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. The agency said that states would be permitted to pay benefits to individuals quarantined with the expectation of returning to work, and to those who leave employment to avoid exposure to coronavirus or to care for a sick family member. But it's not clear how well, even with the additional $2 billion in federal assistance, the state unemployment system will cushion the blow. Some state unemployment insurance programs have reduced the number of weeks workers can receive benefits since the last economic downturn in 2007-09. In addition, 22 states and jurisdictions, including California, New York, Illinois and Texas, are also facing dangerously low reserves.",Coronavirus drives up unemployment claims ,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-drives-up-unemployment-claims-137067,politico

"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened fewer than one million travelers on March 17 — making it the slowest day at airports since the so-called “Snowpocalypse“ in 2011.  According to new data from the TSA, the agency screened 983,226 on Tuesday. That was the fewest daily travelers going through TSA checkpoints since Feb. 1, 2011, when a massive blizzard snarled air traffic across North America. Before Snowpocalypse, the last day when TSA officers screened fewer than a million travelers was May 30, 2004, per the agency’s numbers.  As the U.S. has closed its borders to much of Europe and public health officials have warned people against taking unnecessary flights, year-to-day traveler numbers have plummeted. On March 14, a million fewer people passed through TSA checkpoints than did on the same Saturday in 2019.  TSA officials are at the front lines of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The agency has revealed that at least eight of its employees have contracted the virus, which has sickened at least thirteen total Department of Homeland Security officials, per documents POLITICO reviewed. And two sources with knowledge of the situation also said that two contractors from the department’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office have tested positive for the virus. That office plays a role in airport screenings designed to slow the virus’s spread.  The aviation industry has taken a body blow since the coronavirus has spread. The American airline industry’s trade group put out a statement March 16 saying airlines were seeing “a dramatic decline in demand, which is getting worse by the day.” The industry implored the federal government to give it loans, grants, and tax relief, saying the economic situation is “simply not sustainable.” The industry group has sought tens of billions in help from Washington, per CNN.  President Donald Trump said on March 18 that the industry can expect some sort of bailout.  “Airlines would be No. 1,” he said, per USA Today. “You go from having the best year they have ever had to having no passengers because of what we have had to do to win this war — and it’s a war.”  But any bailout will raise tricky political questions — especially since Trump himself lambasted the Obama administration’s auto industry rescue. And Congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have telegraphed that they see any aid package as a chance to call for worker protections and differentiate themselves from Republicans going into the 2020 campaign, as The Washington Post has detailed.  Another complicating factor: According to a Bloomberg report, America’s biggest airlines spent the vast majority of their free cash flow over the last 10 years buying back their own stock. Schumer said on the Senate floor that the companies instead should have saved that money “for a rainy day.”",Airport screenings dip below 1 million per day,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/airport-screenings-dip-below-1-million-per-day-136840,politico

"President Donald Trump’s top political advisers in recent weeks envisioned unleashing a massive advertising campaign against Joe Biden to define him for the general election before he had a chance to recover from the primary. Then the novel coronavirus arrived. With the death toll rising and daily life grinding to a halt, Trump’s sprawling political operation has put on hold any plans to use its nine-figure war chest to unload on the former vice president. The strategy, mimicking the playbook of Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign against Mitt Romney, was aimed at crippling the lesser-funded Biden before he could unify the Democratic Party behind him and marshal his forces for November. The reprieve is a blessing for Biden: Rather than spending valuable time fending off an assault, he is free to present himself as a steady leader amid a national crisis and to regroup for the general election.  The Trump operation’s reassessment underscores how the pandemic has disrupted virtually every element of the campaign for both parties. With less than eight months until Election Day, Trump and Biden are being forced to rethink their plans on everything from fundraising to field operations to staffing. “With Biden running away with it now, this would have been a good time to define him right off the bat. But it won't break through now, nor would it look good,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary in the George W. Bush White House. “This hiatus in many ways helps Biden.” Club for Growth President David McIntosh, whose pro-Trump group has aired a series of TV commercials bolstering the president, said he would be temporarily shelving any plans to take down Biden. “The response to the coronavirus has pushed the whole election off the front page,” McIntosh said, “and it will restart and readjust once the immediate crisis is over.” The Trump team isn’t completely backing down. The reelection effort has gone after Biden on Twitter the past few days, including on his response to the pandemic. And Trump couldn’t resist getting his licks in during a coronavirus news briefing Wednesday. The president noted that he was “beating Sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida” and “in other states.”  But Trump allies say that, for the time being at least, his reelection hopes hinge almost entirely on his ability to manage the crisis. While they acknowledge his initial response was lacking and that the virus poses a mortal threat to his 2020 prospects, they foresee a possible silver lining. If the virus passes and businesses and schools reopen before the election, they say, the president could present himself as the protagonist in an American comeback story. “If President Trump manages the pandemic well and gets the economy restarted he gets reelected,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally who is currently residing in coronavirus-devastated Italy. “If he fails to do so he probably gets defeated.” “The Trump team should focus on communicating about the virus and the economy,” Gingrich added, before noting that there would be “plenty of time for Biden later.” While the crisis has impeded Trump’s ability to damage Biden, it's also hemmed in the former vice president. Biden has scrapped campaign events and isn’t attending fundraisers, which could hamper his efforts to narrow Trump's massive fundraising advantage. The Biden campaign itself isn’t running ads against the president, though two liberal super PACs — Priorities USA and American Bridge — have recently gone on the air against Trump in battleground states. Biden aides say they are clear-eyed about their financial deficit. But on balance, they're grateful: Every day that passes without a Trump ad onslaught assault amounts to a reprieve. “He’s definitely getting a break,” Pete Giangreco, a Democratic strategist who worked on Obama’s presidential campaigns, said of Biden. “Right now, [the Trump campaign] can’t drive any of the contrast [with Biden] because it’s all, ‘What is the president doing about the coronavirus?’” Indeed, the Trump campaign has been essentially frozen in place by the virus, and they say there are currently no plans in place for a pricey anti-Biden ad campaign. “Americans want to see their president taking action to protect this nation, which is what President Trump is doing. At the campaign we just amplify that,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the reelection effort. The idea of a post-primary Biden takedown has its roots in the 2012 campaign. With Romney reeling after a costly and divisive primary, the Obama campaign unloaded on him with an ad campaign that painted him as a cold-hearted ex-venture capitalist who slashed working class jobs to make a profit.  In one ad of several ads savaging Romney from the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, a laid-off factory worker declared that he ""made over $100 million"" by shutting down his plant.  ""Romney had a great team, but it takes time to recover from the wounds of the primary contest, to restock the bank account, and retool the machinery for the general election,"" said Paul Begala, a consultant to Priorities that year. ""The coronavirus pandemic will, in fact, make it difficult — or even impossible — for Trump to do to Joe what we did to Mitt.""  Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who advised Romney’s campaign, recalled the destructive effect advertising blitz had on the GOP nominee. Romney didn’t have the money to respond at the time, Newhouse noted, and he never fully recovered. But Newhouse, who is working for several party committees this election cycle, argued that Trump still has time to prosecute a forceful case against the former vice president. “While the desire to define Biden is without question, this health crisis is going to kick the campaign's timing down the road a bit. It may not make it more difficult to define Biden, it just delays it,” Newhouse said. “Effectively, the campaign will be compressed into a narrower window.” But some Democrats are skeptical that Trump will have the same ability to tattoo Biden. David Axelrod, who served as senior strategist on Obama’s reelection effort, contended the former vice president is far better known than Romney was at this point in 2012 — and therefore will be harder to redefine.  ""It’s a very complicated challenge for the Trump team,"" Axelrod said. The Trump campaign faces other complications, such as determining how they want to go after Biden. While Trump’s team has tried to brand the 77-year-old former vice president as senile, there is some skepticism among his advisers about whether it will prove effective. Others Biden allies don’t buy the idea the trigger-happy Trump will lay off for now. “He may have made a political judgment that he shouldn’t hit us now,” Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a Biden campaign co-chair said. “Then he’ll lash out like the person we all know he is.”",Trump wanted to bury Biden after the primary.

"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged Thursday the U.S. faces months of economic contraction, but predicted a “gigantic fourth quarter” as Americans release “pent up demand” and return to “a normal world.”  In an interview with Fox Business Network, Mnuchin said he believes the economy will see its largest decline in this year’s second quarter, from April through June, followed by a third-quarter recovery as advancements in viral treatments and vaccines eventually halt the spread of the virus.  ""I think you’re going to see a lot of pent-up demand,"" Mnuchin told Bartiromo. ""When we get through the next few months and Americans see what’s happening, and we have killed this virus, people are going to be comfortable going back to work.""  Mnuchin continued: ""We're going to be opening back business and people are going to continue what they do. They are going to live. They are going to shop. They are going to eat out. They are going to enjoy restaurants and travel and entertainment and we will go back to a normal world.”  Bartiromo pressed Mnuchin on company bailouts — a term he continues to push against. He emphasized Thursday that many of these companies will ultimately pay back any loans.  “This isn’t about bailing out bad businesses. This isn’t about banks that made bad loans,"" Mnuchin said. ""These are about very, very good companies that have been instructed to shut down, so they need liquidity. That’s what they need.""  ""In most cases, my expectation is they will be able to pay back these loans. In the case of small businesses, if they can’t afford to pay back those loans, we’ll forgive them,"" he continued. ""I don’t consider that a bailout. I consider that an incentive to keep workers hired.”  Mnuchin also clarified his reported warning to Republican senators on Tuesday that unemployment could spike to 20 percent if action is not taken. “What I said is that 40 percent of our workforce is in small business,"" he explained. ""And I said, if half of them were let go, mathematically, we’d be at 20 percent unemployment.”  Mnuchin’s upbeat outlook comes alongside grim new data emerging from the federal government. The Labor Department on Thursday reported 281,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, a one-third increase over the previous week, a jump it attributed to the pandemic. It was the highest number of claims since September 2017, and economists expect that figure to soar in the coming weeks. Asked if economic data should be ignored in this volatile environment, Mnuchin replied, “The statistics in the short run of economics are obviously not relevant.

"A decade of sharp cuts to state unemployment programs threatens to leave laid-off workers more vulnerable than during the Great Recession. With 10 states having reduced since the 2007-09 recession the maximum weeks employees can receive unemployment benefits, many state unemployment systems will be less generous to the unemployed than they were during that earlier downturn — even with the $1 billion boost that unemployment insurance is set to receive in the legislative package before Congress. In Florida and North Carolina, for example, recipients can stop receiving unemployment benefits after 12 weeks, despite predictions from public health officials and economic experts that the economic aftereffects from the coronavirus pandemic could last much longer. Meanwhile, nearly half of U.S. states and jurisdictions are running dangerously low on unemployment cash, further limiting the amount of stimulus they can deliver to weather the economic fallout. “Unemployment insurance is about more than just giving somebody a check when they’re unemployed,"" said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning National Employment Law Project. ""It’s a macroeconomic stabilizer.” The generosity of unemployment benefits varies greatly among states. Unemployed workers in South Carolina and Missouri may receive $1,500 less and $1,400 less, respectively, than they would have heading into the Great Recession, according to a 2015 Government Accountability Office report. Workers in Kansas could receive $2,000 less, and workers in North Carolina could lose $2,700. Congress’ coronavirus response package would offer states some relief but do little to expand benefits, which are set at the state level. The House-passed bill would give $500 million to help states process the expected surge in unemployment claims, and another $500 million in administrative assistance grants to states that experience a 10 percent increase in unemployment. This second $500 million is conditioned on states waiving work-search requirements, waiting periods and penalties for employers that lay off workers. But it isn't conditioned on states extending benefits for any particular length of time. Federal assistance to state unemployment systems accounts by law for half the number of weeks that states already offer. Consequently, the states that cover the fewest number of weeks would receive the least help from any increase. For example, a state that offers 20 weeks' unemployment benefits would get 10 extra weeks' federal funding, while a state that offers 26 weeks would get 13. “That is a further consequence of the cutbacks that have taken place in a number of states — it also cuts back on the amount of extra weeks you get in a recession,” said Chad Stone, the chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. After the Great Recession, businesses lobbied, often successfully, to limit state taxes to increase state reserves for unemployment insurance, which the recession had depleted. Many states did so by cutting benefits for recipients. An individual employer’s payment rate for state unemployment insurance is typically tied to how many workers the employer lays off, much like a motorist who sees his or her insurance go up after an accident. Cutting benefits was a way to replenish the trust fund while limiting tax increases on business. “At some point, it gets to be a level where employers come to policymakers and say, ‘Hey, this is crazy. I want to hire people but I can’t afford to, because the payroll tax I would have for that is so high,’” said Matt Weidinger, a researcher at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus package denied unemployment assistance to states that cut benefits. But according to Weidinger, states found a loophole: They could receive the assistance if they maintained the same level of benefits but cut the number of weeks these benefits could be received. On the whole, experts agree that state trust funds are in better shape than before the last recession. An AEI report that Weidinger published this month shows aggregate state trust fund balances at 76 billion, 40 percent higher than in 2007. The majority of states maintain sufficient unemployment insurance reserves to weather a recession, according to Labor Department data. But there remain 22 states and jurisdictions — including populous states like California, New York, Texas and Illinois — that have dangerously low reserves. As the crisis worsens, states are beginning to act on their own. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday that even before Congress compels him to, he will waive his state’s one-week waiting period and suspend work-search requirements for recipients, in part to help workers suffering from a state closure of bars and restaurants. On Monday, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer expanded unemployment benefits from 20 to 26 weeks and said that it will cover those taking care of family members. “We’re very mindful of the economic hurt for individuals who will lose their jobs,” DeWine said Sunday. “Look, this is brutally tough. And my heart goes out to them. But we have to do what we have to do to save their lives.”",Many states are ill-prepared for unemployment benefits surge,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/many-states-are-ill-prepared-for-unemployment-benefits-surge-137371,politico
"Last weekend, several major U.S. airports were crowded with travelers returning home from abroad, dealing with new enhanced health screenings due to the coronavirus pandemic and waiting in long lines which themselves raised public health risks. In some ways, they were the lucky ones. As airlines have canceled flights and countries have closed borders, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of Americans are stranded overseas, plotting how to get back and worrying about their families. And with the State Department having declared that Americans abroad should not expect repatriation flights, their options, beyond waiting out the pandemic, are few. On Thursday morning, State issued a level four travel advisory — its highest warning — telling Americans they should not travel internationally, and those abroad should come home or shelter in place. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned. “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO. The U.S. government hasn’t been much help either. In her first attempts to reach the embassy there, Marlin said she repeatedly got an emailed form response which offered no actionable help. When she called an emergency number, it simply played a recording with the same information.  It wasn’t until she had a friend get in touch with the office of her member of Congress, Jim Cooper, that she was able to speak to a human at the embassy. But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Marlin, a retired Spanish teacher, said she has a place to stay and is in good health, but is feeling extreme strain amid an uncertain pathway back home. “Here I am in a pretty decent and safe situation, and I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. I can’t sleep, I’m so stressed out,” she said. “It’s the not knowing if and when I’m ever going to get out.” “Our government, all they seem to care about is the economy. And they are saying ‘don’t count on us to help you,'"" Marlin said. “It just seems like if Trump gave a damn, he’d be pressuring these governments to let us out.” A State Department spokesperson told POLITICO the agency is “considering all options to assist U.S. citizens” stuck in countries which have restricted air travel. But Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the agency says citizens stranded abroad shouldn't rely on the U.S. government to help them get home. ""While the department has evacuated hundreds of Americans, mostly from China, U.S. citizens shouldn’t rely on that as a way to get back instead of finding commercial flights,"" was State's message, according to Bloomberg. In Europe, the Trump administration’s travel ban left an opening for U.S. citizens to return home, but it and other constraints have pushed airlines there to the brink and led to thousands of cancelations. Jeffrey Ouellette, an IT worker from Austin, Texas, was stranded for a few days in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was visiting for a technical meeting with other software engineers. His flight from Vilnius to Helsinki, Finland, the first of four legs, was canceled by Finnair. He bought an expensive replacement through Lufthansa, which itself was canceled hours later. His frustration was boiling over this week, as airlines around the world continue to ask for financial assistance from governments. He said communication was spotty and he was repeatedly assured by airline representatives that his itinerary would be fine, only to see it crumble hours later.  ""The whole system is broken,"" Ouellette said in an email to POLITICO. ""They don't deserve any bailout money if they can't fix this kind of stuff or have contingency plans in place to handle it."" Ouellette on Wednesday had made it to Frankfort, and is booked on a flight Thursday back to the states. He, too, said that the State Department had been “useless.”  “The embassy was not helpful in any way,” he said.  Some stranded travelers around the world banding together to strategize in a WhatsApp group called ""We're stuck (Americans),"" which Marlin said she's trying to join. The federal government’s response has led lawmakers to press for answers about what it's doing to help those Americans stuck overseas. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from nine Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help Americans stuck abroad. And, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home. He said he commends the State Department's efforts so far, but that ""Americans need greater support"" from the agency. ""I urge you to implement a response effort that is comprehensive, nimble, and timely and gets these Americans home as soon as possible,” Warner said. His spokesperson Nelly Decker said that the Virginia Democrat’s office is assisting upwards of 20 Virginians around the world “with the number growing almost hourly.” And lawmakers from New Jersey and Connecticut also reached out to State to say they're concerned that the agency isn't doing enough. ""It appears the United States is lagging behind our allies in terms of providing guidance and assistance,"" wrote Connecticut Sens.Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal. ""We urge you to exercise decisive leadership to provide immediate support for all Americans abroad to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of U.S. citizens and members of the global community.""","Stranded by canceled flights and travel bans, Americans abroad plead for help ",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/stranded-by-canceled-flights-and-travel-bans-americans-abroad-plead-for-help-137329,politico
"Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard announced Thursday that she would end her presidential campaign, formally winnowing the 2020 Democratic field to a two-man race between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. ""Today, I'm suspending my presidential campaign and offering my full support to Vice President Joe Biden in his quest to bring our country together,"" Gabbard said in a video statement posted online. In endorsing Biden, Gabbard said that ""although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know that he has a good heart, and he's motivated by his love for our country and the American people."" ""I'm confident that he will lead our country guided by the spirit of aloha, respect and compassion, and thus help heal the divisiveness that has been tearing our country apart,"" she added. Gabbard closely tied the reasons for her withdrawal from the race to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, saying that ""the best way that I can be of service at this time is to continue to work for the health and well-being of the people of Hawaii and our country in Congress, and to stand ready to serve in uniform should the Hawaii National Guard be activated.""  Gabbard previously served two tours in the Middle East with the Hawaii Army National Guard — in Iraq from 2004-2005 and in Kuwait from 2008-2009 — and stepped away from her campaign in August to report for active duty, participating in a two-week joint training exercise in Indonesia. Apart from Biden and Sanders, Gabbard outlasted all of her Democratic rivals to become the third remaining White House hopeful in what began as a historically diverse and crowded pack of candidates.  The Hawaii lawmaker faced significant criticism for her seemingly quixotic decision to stay in the race beyond the early nominating contests, and now finishes her campaign with only two pledged delegates — less than several of her former rivals who dropped out weeks ago. But Gabbard, long a controversial figure within the Democratic field, had little to lose after declaring in October that she would not seek reelection to a fifth term in Congress, a prospect complicated by a formidable primary challenger and thorny relationships with other Hawaii politicians. She had also become the subject of widespread skepticism among national Democrats, often rebuked for her past anti-LGBT rhetoric, isolationist brand of diplomacy and 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad, whom she declined to label a war criminal despite the dictator's use of chemical weapons to attack his own people. Gabbard typically polled better with independents than self-identified Democrats, and acquired some support from fringe conservatives. She was frequently referenced in Russian media and propaganda, prompting a high-profile clash with Hillary Clinton after the 2016 Democratic nominee claimed the congresswoman was the ""favorite"" of Moscow. Although Gabbard's last appearance in a primary debate was in November, before the Democratic National Committee raised its bar participate, she emerged as a fiery on-stage presence — blasting other candidates for their records and proposals on foreign policy, criminal justice and the impeachment of President Donald Trump, among other issues.  Her exit from the race Thursday after weeks of defying political pressure to drop out reflects the new nature of the Democratic primary, which has become frozen in place amid the COVID-19 outbreak and seen Biden mount a nearly insurmountable delegate lead over Sanders. The senator's campaign manager announced Wednesday he would ""assess"" the state of his White House bid in the days ahead.","Tulsi Gabbard ends White House bid, endorses Biden",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/tulsi-gabbard-ends-white-house-bid-137242,politico
"The head of the Federal Aviation Administration will self-quarantine for a week, after he shook hands with Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart days before the Florida Republican developed coronavirus symptoms, the agency confirmed this morning. Steve Dickson and Diaz-Balart shook hands before an appropriations hearing on March 11. Diaz-Balart has said that he developed a headache and fever the night of March 14. He and Rep.

"The State Department is set to announce a Level 4 travel advisory applying to all international travel, its most severe warning, three individuals with knowledge of the pending announcement said.  The advisory would instruct all Americans abroad to either return to the United States or prepare to shelter in place, given the global threat of the coronavirus outbreak. Americans also would be instructed not to travel abroad. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has approved the advisory, the individuals said. The move would represent a step beyond the department's current Level 3 travel warning, which merely encourages Americans to reconsider travel abroad. Two State Department officials confirmed the pending advisory. The State Department press office did not respond to requests to comment, but announced on Thursday that U.S. passport agencies will only accept applications from customers with life-or-death emergencies who plan to travel within 72 hours. The highly unusual State Department travel advisory is set to come after seven weeks of steadily increasing restrictions on U.S. travel, after President Donald Trump first moved to limit travel from China at the end of January. Other countries have moved to close their borders and impose further travel restrictions as the virus has spread beyond Asia to Europe and the Western Hemisphere. There are more than 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The World Health Organization on Thursday said that there are more than 191,000 confirmed cases across more than 150 countries; an unofficial tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University pegs that number still higher. A State Department official based overseas expressed concern about the pending advisory, saying he worried it would cause panic among Americans. The official pointed out the difficulties of finding flights under the current conditions. Hundreds or maybe thousands of Americans remain stranded abroad, caught between travel bans and massive airline flight cancellations. Some Americans are stranded in countries like Guatemala, which has issued a ban on any flights coming or going, and others are having to pay dearly for what flights are left, often transiting through several countries before finding a way back home.  And the State Department has largely been absent, according to interviews with several Americans stranded abroad, who reported receiving no help from U.S. embassies. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday.

"Climate activists are retooling their strategy for an online existence during the coronavirus pandemic. As mass gatherings are canceled around the world to promote ""social distancing,"" a loose coalition of youth-focused activists has been plotting how to stay relevant without the large demonstrations that have become a staple of the climate movement. Organizers are nixing public rallies and looking for new approaches to stay active in the 2020 campaign without an opportunity to confront politicians in public. “We’re an organization of a bunch of millennials and Generation Z so in many ways we grew up online and are well-equipped to meet this moment,” Evan Weber, national political director for Sunrise Movement, told POLITICO. Global Climate Strike, a coalition inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg's Friday school strikes, has suspended the weekly demonstrations that brought thousands of people to the streets in the U.S. and around the world. Thunberg last week encouraged supporters to participate in a ""digital strike"" instead of gathering in public, and coalition members have been on wall-to-wall calls this week to figure how to keep up public pressure on governments to fight climate change. In the U.S., Sierra Club, Greenpeace, Sunrise Movement and other green groups canceled three days of nationwide protests in April coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. The Sunrise Movement has suspended a voter registration drive on college campuses that aimed to sign up 125,000 new voters; the group registered about 1,000 new voters in Iowa but had planned to kick the campaign into high gear after Earth Day, Weber said. Instead it will next week launch “Sunrise School,” a series of online classes to train high school and college students on organizing and campaigning tactics. The group is also drafting a ""list of demands"" outlining how former Vice President Joe Biden can win their votes if he becomes the Democratic nominee. But where Sunrise members have previously been able to get to Biden on the rope line at a campaign event, it will now have to submit those demands electronically. The League of Conservation Voters Education Fund, one of the environmental movement's largest voter registration programs, has taken a hit because it depends ""on face-to-face interactions,"" Hilda Nucete, the fund's deputy director of civic engagement said in a statement. ""While this is a short-term blow to our in-person voter registration goals, we are not slowing our efforts to increase civic participation,"" she said. ""We are exploring an expansion of our existing digital, mail and phone-based strategies to continue voter engagement during this time and compensate for lost face-to-face opportunities."" Zero Hour and National Children's Campaign, two youth-led groups, had to postpone their voter registration bus tour that was to swing through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin beginning Friday. The groups are targeting new dates in July in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention, said Jonah Gottlieb, co-founder and executive director with the National Children's Campaign. In the absence of rallies and door-to-door canvassing, organizers are stepping up online recruitment and organizing phone banks, noting many people are sitting at home yearning for something to do. Katie Eder, executive director of Future Coalition, a youth-centered climate advocacy group, said coalition members are brainstorming ideas this week and intend to announce more detailed plans next week. Activities could include digital town halls with appearances from celebrities and politicians are being planned to replace the sit-ins at banks, marches and concerts planned for Earth Day. Gaming Facebook’s algorithm to increase visibility, such as encouraging supporters to “check in” for a potential multi-day livestreamed Earth Day event — a tactic previously used during protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline — is under consideration, too. None of that can replace in-person action, but it can potentially help keep people engaged, said Jamie Henn, an activist who is coordinating sit-ins at banks to protest fossil fuel investments through a coalition called Stop the Money Pipeline. Focus is required. Tactics need to “go beyond just tweeting a lot.” “There will be a lot of experimentation in the weeks to come to figure out what works and what makes an impact,” he said. “That’s the challenge right now in the progressive movement. What can we do that continues to hit home?” Dana Fisher, a University of Maryland sociology professor who has studied movements for 20 years, said young climate activists may be uniquely well suited to the current moment because they are far less reliant on in-person meetings than activists in earlier generations. “They just all go on Zoom,” she said, referring to the online video conferencing platform. “Why would I leave my house if I don’t have to?” May Boeve, executive director of climate activism group 350.org, said her organization has operated virtually since it sprung out of campus efforts to fight pipeline construction over a decade ago. Her group has put out training materials and other aids to assist with “navigating this new paradigm,” though she admitted having concrete impact for online-only activism “requires a lot of creativity.” “There are people really trying to test the limit of what virtual meetings can do,” she said, noting much of the heavy lifting for events already occurs online. ""The end product of it is people gathering in the streets but there’s a lot that happens in the street. Obviously it’s the last part of that process where people are having to really stretch.”",Climate activists shift gears in an age of 'social distancing',2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/climate-activists-social-distancing-coronavirus-137216,politico

"The Labor Department reported 281,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, a one-third increase over the previous week that it attributed to the coronavirus epidemic. It was the highest level of claims since September 2017 and the first in a flood of unfavorable economic indicators expected from the Trump administration as businesses shut down and workers go home. Unemployment claims will likely rise higher in coming months as job growth ends, the unemployment rate rises, and GDP sags. ""Today’s hurricane-sized increase is nothing compared to what we can expect in coming weeks,"" Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said in a prepared statement. ""The full weight of this economic shock is still ramping up."" The only question is how long the bad times will last, and that will depend on how fast and how far the virus spreads. According to DOL, layoffs were concentrated in service related industries, as well as in transportation and warehousing. The latest unemployment number covers claims filed during the week ending March 14. But reports from unemployment insurance offices around the country indicated the real explosion in claims began this past weekend, and continued unabated this week. In Colorado, nearly 11,000 unemployment claims were filed Monday and Tuesday, compared to only 400 claims filed the previous Monday. In New Jersey, 15,000 people applied for unemployment benefits on Monday, a number twelve times higher than normal levels. Pennsylvania was on track to see more than 100,000 claims on Monday and Tuesday, compared to 12,000 during first week of March. And in the 24 hours after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed an emergency order Monday closing bars, restaurants and other public places, workers filed nearly ten times as many claims as during the entire week one year earlier. Jacob Robbins, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who tracks unemployment insurance claims, estimated that in 14 states roughly 340,000 claims were made on March 16 and March 17 alone — more than fifty percent more than were reported nationwide during the previous week. The surge in unemployment claims accompanied widespread reports of layoffs nationwide. New York-based Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, laid off 80 percent of its workers. On Tuesday Marriott said it expects to lay off tens of thousands of workers worldwide. MGM Resorts International closed 150 restaurants and bars Monday. Experts predicted millions of job losses. The Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimated that 3000 jobs have been lost already, and that job losses could rise as high as 9 million. The Senate on Wednesday passed a multibillion dollar emergency aid package to counter the economic slowdown that included $2 billion to state unemployment insurance programs. Senate Republicans are also working on a proposal for a third, larger stimulus package to address the epidemic that likely will include $250 billion in direct payments to Americans starting April 6. Earlier this month DOL advised states that workers affected by the coronavirus are eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. The agency said that states would be permitted to pay benefits to individuals quarantined with the expectation of returning to work, and to those who leave employment to avoid exposure to coronavirus or to care for a sick family member. But it's not clear how well, even with the additional $2 billion in federal assistance, the state unemployment system will cushion the blow. Some state unemployment insurance programs have since the last economic downturn in 2007-reduced the number of weeks workers can receive benefits. In addition, 22 states and jurisdictions, including California, New York, Illinois and Texas, are also facing dangerously low reserves. “Today’s numbers reveal that while Congress considers new strategies to help the unemployed, Americans are turning to a jobless safety net that is unable to meet their needs,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation said in an emailed statement. Policymakers should lift the current 26-week cap on jobless benefits, he said, and ""states should be required to roll back cuts that have lingered since the end of the last recession.”",Coronavirus drives up unemployment claims ,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-drives-up-unemployment-claims-137067,politico
"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened fewer than one million travelers on March 17 — making it the slowest day at airports since the so-called “Snowpocalypse“ in 2011.  According to new data from the TSA, the agency screened 983,226 on Tuesday. That was the fewest daily travelers going through TSA checkpoints since Feb. 1, 2011, when a massive blizzard snarled air traffic across North America. Before Snowpocalypse, the last day when TSA officers screened fewer than a million travelers was May 30, 2004, per the agency’s numbers.  As the U.S. has closed its borders to much of Europe and public health officials have warned people against taking unnecessary flights, year-to-day traveler numbers have plummeted. On March 14, a million fewer people passed through TSA checkpoints than did on the same Saturday in 2019.  TSA officials are at the front lines of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The agency has revealed that at least eight of its employees have contracted the virus, which has sickened at least thirteen total Department of Homeland Security officials, per documents POLITICO reviewed. And two sources with knowledge of the situation also said that two contractors from the department’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office have tested positive for the virus. That office plays a role in airport screenings designed to slow the virus’s spread.  The aviation industry has taken a body blow since the coronavirus has spread. The U.S. airline industry’s trade group this week warned carriers were seeing “a dramatic decline in demand, which is getting worse by the day.” The industry implored the federal government to give it loans, grants, and tax relief, saying the economic situation is “simply not sustainable.” The industry group has sought tens of billions in help from Washington, and lawmakers are debating provisions.  President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the industry can expect some sort of bailout.  “Airlines would be No. 1,” he said. “You go from having the best year they have ever had to having no passengers because of what we have had to do to win this war — and it’s a war.”  But any bailout will raise tricky political questions — especially since Trump himself lambasted the Obama administration’s auto industry rescue. And congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have telegraphed that they see any aid package as a chance to call for worker protections and differentiate themselves from Republicans going into the 2020 campaign. Another complicating factor: America’s biggest airlines poured money into buying back their own stock over the past decade. Schumer said on the Senate floor that the companies instead should have saved that money “for a rainy day.”",Airport screenings dip below 1 million per day,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/airport-screenings-dip-below-1-million-per-day-136840,politico
"A critical lack of testing kits. A shortage of ventilators. Not enough ICU beds.  America’s struggle to deal with the spread of the highly infectious new virus Covid-19 is bad enough, with the number of confirmed cases surging, hospitals begging for help and entire cities going on lockdown.  But it’s also exposed just how unprepared the U.S. is for a threat many would-be Cassandras have been warning about for years: a targeted biological attack. “When one thinks about what a bioterror attack would look like—it is crystal clear we are not even close to being ready,” said former Department of Homeland Security official Daniel Gerstein, now a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation.  Today’s mantra of “flattening the curve” — or lessening the spike in illnesses, thereby slowing the infection rate to reduce the burdens on the health care system — would not apply to a bioterror attack. “The people in that cloud would be infected all at once, so you would see a very large spike of very sick patients,” Gerstein said. As the response to the outbreak from governments at all levels has shown, the U.S. was completely unprepared for a slowly creeping pandemic — let alone a biological attack that would overwhelm it all at once. Potential biological weapons include anthrax, which, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, “makes a good weapon because it can be released quietly and without anyone knowing”; smallpox, frozen stocks of which are still maintained by the U.S. and Russia; tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, which attacks the skin, eyes, lymph nodes and lungs and was stockpiled by the U.S. military and the former Soviet Union after World War II; and botulism, which is caused by exposure to toxins made by C. botulinum — the most toxic substances known to humankind, which attack the body’s nerves and can lead to respiratory failure.  More than six weeks into the Trump administration’s response effort — which began Jan. 29 with the announcement of a coronavirus task force and, two days later, the declaration of a public health emergency — ramped-up testing for the virus has only just begun, hospital systems say they don’t have enough beds and medical supplies to handle the onslaught of anticipated patients, and there is a shortage of respirators, ventilators and other protective equipment for nurses and doctors on the front lines. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, only recently shifted his tone: On Sunday, he called the virus “something we have tremendous control of.” By Monday, he was urging people to stay home and beginning to hurl the full might of thefederal government at what he described as “an invisible enemy.” But with confirmed cases soaring past 7,000 and now reaching into 50 states, officials are warning privately that it may be as long as 18 months before the pandemic is brought to heel. To biodefense experts, the Trump administration’s sluggish response revealed a dangerous failure of imagination throughout the system, and showed how unprepared the government still is to handle a catastrophic biological event.  “The sense is that we haven’t fully prepared” for that possibility, said a U.S. government official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “If we had an attack, and even if we had the treatment or the vaccine that everyone needed, we don’t have the capacity to get that to 330 million Americans if we were in a lockdown situation where trucks weren’t moving. So that’s one thing that we’ve looked at.” Other basic logistical questions also have yet to be resolved, the official added. “Can we create a capacity? What does that look like? Do we set it up in gymnasiums? Who’s going to do it? How are the things going to get delivered if you have sort of a general breakdown in the system?” Covid-19 was not manufactured, and the risk of it being weaponized is extremely low given its highly infectious nature that would likely backfire on any group trying to spread it, experts said.  But an administration official cautioned that the prospect of intentional exposure targeting U.S. government employees “is a concern,” and noted that the Defense Department “has imposed a lot of travel restrictions” despite a certain amount of exposure being “inevitable.”  The FBI, whose field offices are known to allow “walk-in” tipsters, is also taking extra precautions. “In support of our mission, we are enacting measures to protect the FBI workforce, including heightened hygiene practices, social distancing options, like telework and flexible work schedules where appropriate, and authorizing only essential operational travel until further notice,” a spokesperson said.  The scale of the outbreak is the closest thing the U.S. has seen to how a bioweapon—which may take the form of viruses, bacteria, toxins, fungi and rickettsiae—can shut down a society and severely strain resources, several sources said.  “We haven’t seen anything that appears to be this pathogenic and transmissible since maybe 1918 or 1957,” said the U.S. government official. And the response so far to coronavirus, the official added, “shows that we don’t have the systems in place to rapidly diagnose cases, or to scale up a mass response very quickly.”  “We are in the realm now where biological weapons are really becoming possible,” the official said. “People have talked about [gene editing in bioweapons] for 50 years. … It is not science fiction anymore. Literally in the last five years we’ve crossed that threshold.""  Asha George, the executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, echoed those concerns. “What we’re seeing are all the places where we are vulnerable,” she said. “You can see people not really having thought about what impact a biological event would have on the nation in any number of different sectors.”  With the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, she said, a national strategy for pandemic influenza was already in place, though Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force response coordinator, acknowledged in a news conference on Tuesday that “now we are seeing we have to revise” the flu pandemic preparedness plan. And because the U.S. deals with seasonal influenza every year, manufacturers already knew how to produce the necessary vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization protocol, which clears labs to produce tests in the event of an outbreak, has also gotten more complicated—while it was streamlined for Ebola, Zika, and H1N1, the FDA was slow to trigger the workaround for coronavirus testing. “It feels like we have regressed considerably,” said Gerstein.  The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, established in 2014 and co-chaired by former Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, warned in 2018 that “the United States is underprepared for biological threats” from both terrorists and “nature itself,” via emerging and reemerging infectious diseases like Covid-19. “Despite significant progress on several fronts, the Nation is dangerously vulnerable to a biological event,” reads the organization’s bipartisan report. “The root cause of this continuing vulnerability is the lack of strong centralized leadership at the highest level of government.” The threat of a large-scale biological catastrophe, particularly one that hits all at once instead of over a period of weeks or months, is particularly problematic because the U.S. health care system is still “the weakest link” in the nation’s ability to respond effectively to an outbreak, said Ali S. Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “Routinely, we are not even able to surge for a bad flu season,” said Khan, who served as the CDC’s director of public health preparedness and response and helped establish the CDC’s bioterrorism program. During the 2017-18 flu season, one of the deadliest in 40 years, with more than 61,000 flu-related deaths across the country, overwhelmed hospitals in some parts of the country pitched tents outside ERs and used ambulances as stand-ins for patient rooms.  The detection capabilities are behind, too: While DHS has a BioWatch program that gathers air samples in 30 U.S. cities to monitor the threat of bioterrorism, it’s nearly two decades old and takes from 11 to 13 hours to determine whether a biological agent has been deployed. The emergence and spread of Covid-19 should have been easier to predict and prepare for than a bioterror attack would be—but it still caught the administration by surprise. It’s not as though the emergence of a novel disease with a significant mortality rate is “brand new,” Khan said, pointing to the SARS outbreak roughly 17 years ago. “We knew this was a possibility, so there are so no excuses. We are eight weeks behind where we should have been in terms of our planning.” One of the biggest issues with planning effectively is that “public health is largely invisible, underappreciated, and as a result underfunded,” Umair A. Shah, a top Texas health official, told the House Homeland Security Committee in October. “This ‘Invisibility Crisis’ problem has unfortunately led to funding cuts for public health and public health preparedness at every level of government.”  George emphasized that the issue doesn’t lie just with the executive branch — Congress, with the power of the purse, needs to be an active partner in developing an agenda, assigning responsibilities and allocating the appropriate funds, instead of just “spitting out emergency supplementals.” The U.S. launched a national stockpile program 20 years ago as a way to prepare for biological, chemical or nuclear attacks on the homeland. Its goal was initially to prepare for an unusual threat and was very oriented toward specific biological agents, George said. It now houses the country’s largest supply of vaccines and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency, like an outbreak of smallpox and anthrax, or widespread radiation sickness. The stockpile is a work in progress, however. While the CDC now says there is enough smallpox vaccine in the stockpile for every American, it initially housed only 15 million doses, 90,000 of which were available for immediate use. The renowned epidemiologist D.A. Henderson, who led preparedness for the Department of Health and Human Services after 9/11, wrote in 2009 that the CDC also hadn’t checked the vaccines’ potency in nearly eight years, instead of every three as is required. (An HHS spokesperson also said in a statement that the Strategic National Stockpile participates in the FDA/DOD Shelf-life Extension Program “to extend the life of some products beyond their original use-by dates.”) As the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated, the possibilities for a catastrophic biological event go beyond what was initially envisioned — so there needs to be an attendant increase in what goes into the stockpile, George said. Supplies are running low, particularly when it comes to ventilators — a growing necessity as Covid-19, a respiratory virus, spreads. In a news briefing on Monday, HHS Secretary Alex Azar declined to reveal the exact number of ventilators in the stockpile, citing “national security concerns.” (Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the number is around 12,700.)  George and Khan explained that the numbers are a matter of national security because they could reveal a vulnerability. The idea is to prevent adversaries from exploiting a shortage by launching a biological attack that would require people to use a resource, like ventilators, in numbers too large to accommodate. “We don’t want to give our adversaries a road map,” Khan said.  But it is generally well known that ventilators and essential medical supplies like needles, gauze and gloves are in short supply, George said, as are other kinds of medicines, like fever reducers, which are necessary in cases like this, where the best that can be done for now is supportive rather than preventive care. A deployable vaccine is still at least a year away, Fauci said last week.  “We are in the exponential phase right now,” said Gerstein. “It’s only going to get worse. We are nowhere near the end of our transmission.”  Jason Millman contributed to this report.",'It is not science fiction anymore': Coronavirus exposes U.S. vulnerability to biowarfare,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-biowarfare-terror-136194,politico
"When America is at war, voters prefer not to swap presidents in the middle of battle. James Madison sailed to reelection after launching the War of 1812. Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the Civil War effectively ended at Appomattox, Va. In the shadow of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt notched a third term. And the year after deploying troops to Iraq, George W. Bush defeated a war veteran, Democrat John Kerry. What if the enemy is invisible? Not a foreign country or the perpetrators of a brazen terrorist attack but a lethal disease that forces Americans to shelter in place indefinitely as their health, jobs and wages hang in the balance?  President Donald Trump is about to find out.  After fumbling his administration’s initial response to the devastating spread of COVID-19, and dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus for months as it spread from China, Trump has turned to the one concept that seems to work politically to overcome monumental challenges. Days after he declared a national emergency to help combat the pandemic, the New York businessman — who famously avoided the Vietnam draft multiple times — informed Americans on Wednesday that he is now “a wartime president” and said the country should prepare to fight. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” Trump said at a White House briefing featuring Defense Secretary Mark Esper, U.S. Veterans Affairs chief Robert Wilkie and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force.  “Now it’s our time,” Trump continued, recalling the bravery America showed during World War II. “We must sacrifice together,because we are all in this together, and we will come through together.”  The wartime posture Trump has adopted in his tone and actions — he invoked the Defense Production Act on Wednesday, giving him the authority to influence private industries for emergency response purposes — marks an extraordinary new phase in his attempt to reclaim public support for his handling of the outbreak, and it raises questions about the potential measures Trump could take if the crisis spirals even further out of control.  “He is trying to create a sense of command and control and authority now that it’s obvious this is going to be a big challenge for the country,” said Tony Fratto, a White House aide to President George W. Bush.  Trump already has announced plans to dispatch two Navy hospital ships to New York Harbor and the West Coast to assist medical workers as they grapple with an influx of patients who have contracted COVID-19 and require treatment for the virus. The idea to deploy the two ships — the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort — gained steam after Trump last Friday issued his emergency declaration, which served as a green light for the Pentagon to begin taking more aggressive measures, according to a well-placed Defense Department official. Earlier on, there had been disagreements between Pentagon officials who wanted the administration to take “prudent measures,” such as travel restrictions, and those who wished to avoid rash decisions that could exacerbate political consequences and the economic downturn, the official said. Some White House officials were hesitant to enlist the Navy ships prematurely because the Comfort is undergoing maintenance that could take weeks. The Mercy, homeported in San Diego, could deploy within days.) The administration is also weighing the deployment of National Guard and Reserve troops at the federal level if conditions worsen in the coming weeks. Contingency planning began Tuesday at the Pentagon, where officials discussed enlisting guardsmen to deliver food and medical supplies to vulnerable populations, build temporary hospitals and retrofit facilities that could be used as hospitals, and work with police to enforce curfews like they have in coastal areas facing hurricanes. Nearly 20 governors have already activated National Guardsmen as they work to contain the rapidly spreading virus within their own states, and some have encouraged the president to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers in a further step to address the outbreak. “We believe the use of active duty Army Corps personnel would not violate federal law because this is a national disaster,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Sunday.  For now, the president’s greatest tool has been his rhetoric — particularly the ways in which he is using the war metaphor to boost public morale, reach supporters who remain dismissive of the worldwide pandemic and preemptively position himself as a president who rose to the occasion when voters weigh their options this November.  “President Trump has figured out that he has to put aside that proudly reckless style of governance that has been a staple of his presidency to date and adopt a posture that’s more typical of what presidents have done in crises,” said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University history professor. “At the same time, it’s not so much about calling himself a wartime president as it is about whether he matches the rhetoric with actions that make us safer,” Greenberg added.  To that end, Trump has enlisted the help of nearly everyone in his usual orbit — and beyond. According to two people familiar with the discussions, Trump has privately encouraged White House aides, friends and corporate executives to brainstorm creative steps they can take to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, keep health care professionals equipped to manage patients, and prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded and doctors overwhelmed.  Officials involved with the White House Office of American Innovation, for example, have spent the past several days conferring with major tech companies about how they can help distribute public service announcements related to COVID-19 and prevent severe supply shortages as consumers prepare for weeks of minimal social contact outside their homes and hospitals worry about the availability of protective personal equipment — including surgical masks, goggles and gloves — and office supplies.  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has spearheaded much of the outreach to Big Tech and other industries, is trying to marshal the private sector behind the president. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are pressuring GOP lawmakers to quickly pass a massive aid package of more than $1 trillion to stabilize the economy and soften a coronavirus-induced recession. And on Wednesday, Trump announced a mutual agreement with Canada to close the United States’ northern border to all nonessential traffic — a step that came as the president simultaneously weighs new restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump’s push to portray himself as a wartime leader has gained broad attention not because of his efforts to get the military, the government and private industries involved in responding to the coronavirus outbreak but because of the manner in which his entire administration and 2020 campaign appeared to adopt the same message overnight.  By Wednesday morning, the president, his allies and top administration officials were nearly all employing the rhetoric of war: encouraging sacrifice, promising better days ahead while acknowledging difficulties now, promoting patriotism and praising “bold” actions that might quickly return the country to normalcy. In the opinion pages of USA Today, Pence asked young and healthy Americans — some of whom spent last weekend going about their normal lives — to commit to making small sacrifices to keep others safe, writing, “There is no substitute for the action of the American people.” In an email blast Wednesday afternoon, the Republican National Committee praised Trump’s “wartime footing” and “whole of America” approach.  Senior Pentagon officials even advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former Defense Department official.  Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who is close to securing his spot as Trump’s Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, described the coronavirus outbreak in warlike terms. Speaking to supporters from his Delaware home after a series of primary victories Tuesday, Biden said, “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” “This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak,” Biden said. An outside adviser to the Trump campaign said the president’s 2020 team is hoping to capitalize on Trump’s new messaging strategy by launching a series of digital ads as soon as next week that highlight the president’s efforts to battle the “invisible enemy” — a phrase Trump has recently used to describe the respiratory syndrome, which can be deadly. A Trump campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.  “I wouldn’t mind seeing the Trump campaign expend some resources to communicate to his supporters that this is important,” Fratto said. “And if he has to use wartime language to do it, it’s in all of our interests to let him.”  If the president’s strategy works, he could have a shot at finding himself back on the speaker’s balcony for his second swearing-in ceremony next January, having won reelection because voters either cut him slack — something his predecessors who became wartime leaders appeared to benefit from even as economic turmoil persisted — or because the country recovered from a war their commander in chief led them through.  But there’s no guarantee Trump will meet the same fate as Madison, Lincoln, Roosevelt or Bush even if Americans agree that this is war.  Damaged by his handling of the war in Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson stunned the country in 1968 when he announced he would not run for reelection.  And a quarter century later, President George H.W. Bush lost his bid for a second term to an Arkansan named Bill Clinton a year after the 1991 Gulf War.",Trump team’s new mission: Defend the ‘wartime president’,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-wartime-president-coronavirus-136892,politico
"President Donald Trump’s top political advisers in recent weeks envisioned unleashing a massive advertising campaign against Joe Biden to define him for the general election before he had a chance to recover from the primary. Then the novel coronavirus arrived. With the death toll rising and daily life grinding to a halt, Trump’s sprawling political operation has put on hold any plans to use its nine-figure war chest to unload on the former vice president. The strategy, mimicking the playbook of Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign against Mitt Romney, was aimed at crippling the lesser-funded Biden before he could unify the Democratic Party behind him and marshal his forces for November. The reprieve is a blessing for Biden: Rather than spending valuable time fending off an assault, he is free to present himself as a steady leader amid a national crisis and to regroup for the general election.  The Trump operation’s reassessment underscores how the pandemic has disrupted virtually every element of the campaign for both parties. With less than eight months until Election Day, Trump and Biden are being forced to rethink their plans on everything from fundraising to field operations to staffing. “With Biden running away with it now, this would have been a good time to define him right off the bat. But it won't break through now, nor would it look good,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary in the George W. Bush White House. “This hiatus in many ways helps Biden.” Club for Growth President David McIntosh, whose pro-Trump group has aired a series of TV commercials bolstering the president, said he would be temporarily shelving any plans to take down Biden. “The response to the coronavirus has pushed the whole election off the front page,” McIntosh said, “and it will restart and readjust once the immediate crisis is over.” The Trump team isn’t completely backing down. The reelection effort has gone after Biden on Twitter the past few days, including on his response to the pandemic. And Trump couldn’t resist getting his licks in during a coronavirus news briefing Wednesday. The president noted that he was “beating Sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida” and “in other states.”  But Trump allies say that, for the time being at least, his reelection hopes hinge almost entirely on his ability to manage the crisis. While they acknowledge his initial response was lacking and that the virus poses a mortal threat to his 2020 prospects, they foresee a possible silver lining. If the virus passes and businesses and schools reopen before the election, they say, the president could present himself as the protagonist in an American comeback story. “If President Trump manages the pandemic well and gets the economy restarted he gets reelected,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally who is currently residing in coronavirus-devastated Italy. “If he fails to do so he probably gets defeated.” “The Trump team should focus on communicating about the virus and the economy,” Gingrich added, before noting that there would be “plenty of time for Biden later.” While the crisis has impeded Trump’s ability to damage Biden, it's also hemmed in the former vice president. Biden has scrapped campaign events and isn’t attending fundraisers, which could hamper his efforts to narrow Trump's massive fundraising advantage. The Biden campaign itself isn’t running ads against the president, though two liberal super PACs — Priorities USA and American Bridge — have recently gone on the air against Trump in battleground states. Senior Biden aides are clear-eyed about their financial deficit compared to Trump but they insist they’ll have the necessary firepower to combat whatever is coming. At the same time, they’re unconvinced that Trump will refrain from attacks even in the face of a pandemic.  “The American people know who Joe Biden is and what his values are,” said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. The aides note that Republicans launched ads critical of Biden as early as last fall in early primary states and the former vice president has still emerged the presumptive nominee.  Still, Biden is “definitely getting a break,” said Pete Giangreco, a Democratic strategist who worked on Obama’s presidential campaigns. “Right now, [the Trump campaign] can’t drive any of the contrast [with Biden] because it’s all, ‘What is the president doing about the coronavirus?’” Indeed, the Trump campaign has been essentially frozen in place by the virus, and they say there are currently no plans in place for a pricey anti-Biden ad campaign. “Americans want to see their president taking action to protect this nation, which is what President Trump is doing. At the campaign we just amplify that,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the reelection effort. The idea of a post-primary Biden takedown has its roots in the 2012 campaign. With Romney reeling after a costly and divisive primary, the Obama campaign unloaded on him with an ad campaign that painted him as a cold-hearted ex-venture capitalist who slashed working class jobs to make a profit.  In one ad of several ads savaging Romney from the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, a laid-off factory worker declared that he ""made over $100 million"" by shutting down his plant.  ""Romney had a great team, but it takes time to recover from the wounds of the primary contest, to restock the bank account, and retool the machinery for the general election,"" said Paul Begala, a consultant to Priorities that year. ""The coronavirus pandemic will, in fact, make it difficult — or even impossible — for Trump to do to Joe what we did to Mitt.""  Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who advised Romney’s campaign, recalled the destructive effect advertising blitz had on the GOP nominee. Romney didn’t have the money to respond at the time, Newhouse noted, and he never fully recovered. But Newhouse, who is working for several party committees this election cycle, argued that Trump still has time to prosecute a forceful case against the former vice president. “While the desire to define Biden is without question, this health crisis is going to kick the campaign's timing down the road a bit. It may not make it more difficult to define Biden, it just delays it,” Newhouse said. “Effectively, the campaign will be compressed into a narrower window.” But some Democrats are skeptical that Trump will have the same ability to tattoo Biden. David Axelrod, who served as senior strategist on Obama’s reelection effort, contended the former vice president is far better known than Romney was at this point in 2012 — and therefore will be harder to redefine.  ""It’s a very complicated challenge for the Trump team,"" Axelrod said. The Trump campaign faces other complications, such as determining how they want to go after Biden. While Trump’s team has tried to brand the 77-year-old former vice president as senile, there is some skepticism among his advisers about whether it will prove effective. Others Biden allies don’t buy the idea the trigger-happy Trump will lay off for now. “He may have made a political judgment that he shouldn’t hit us now,” Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a Biden campaign co-chair said. “Then he’ll lash out like the person we all know he is.”",Trump wanted to bury Biden after the primary.

"President Donald Trump said he will ""slash red tape like nobody has even done it before"" in a bid to get unapproved coronavirus treatments to patients faster and identify effective drugs. The president said Thursday he directed the Food and Drug Administration to ""eliminate out-of-date rules and bureaucracy so this can go forward fast"" — but he did not offer any details. Instead, Trump and top health officials highlighted steps the government has taken in recent weeks to launch clinical trials of potential coronavirus treatments. Trump's remarks came one day after he teased that an ""exciting FDA announcement"" was on the way — news that reportedly caught some in the health agency by surprise as they scrambled to finalize details, said three HHS officials. The president suggested certain programs that the administration could use to get experimental drugs to people quickly outside of clinical trials. One such route, known as ""Right to Try,"" was established by a 2018 law that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence supported to help people who are seriously ill and have no other treatment options. ""What we're talking about today is beyond Right to Try,"" Trump said, adding that the law ""has been a tremendous success."" That program allows patients to appeal directly to drugmakers to use medicines that are still being developed and tested. Bioethicists and drug policy experts argue there are other ways to help people access experimental medicine — like the FDA’s compassionate use route, also name checked by the president — and that Right to Try fuels false hope, while making it difficult to collect data on how well the drugs work. The drugmaker Gilead has provided its experimental antiviral drug remdesivir to patients with coronavirus under compassionate use rules first established in 1987. The National Institutes of Health has also started a clinical trial of the drug in coronavirus patients. Trump name-checked remdesivir at Thursday's briefing, along with two drugs that have been used for decades to treat malaria. He suggested that the malaria drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, could be effective against coronavirus — but the data is still sparse. It is unclear how many people have been treated under the federal Right to Try law for any condition. There are at least nine publicly reported cases. The libertarian Goldwater Institute, which spearheaded efforts to pass the legislation, says at least six of those involved people who received experimental brain cancer vaccine. Goldwater this week pushed for Right to Try to be used amid the coronavirus outbreak. Others are more skeptical about the program's usefulness during the current crisis. ""A lot of these [drug] products are already being deployed through clinical trials as well as compassionate use or emergency use authorities,"" Steve Ubl, CEO of the drug lobby PhRMA, said Wednesday when asked about the Right to Try push. ""I'll leave it at that."" Bioethicists were quick to sound the alarm when Goldwater floated the idea, arguing it would fuel false claims and panic around the outbreak. “Right now, to push the Right to Try pathway seems really irresponsible and dangerous,” said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a bioethicist at University of Pennsylvania. “This is the type of thing that's critically important to preserve clinical trials for or we’re not going to be able to figure out whether this stuff works.” Trump has urged manufacturers to get treatments and vaccines to patients quickly even as other officials have warned that creating an effective vaccine, in particular, will take at least a year. The FDA this week also let researchers alter clinical trials to keep subjects safe during the outbreak and allow for scientists to assess patients remotely. ""What's important is not to provide falsehood but provide hope,"" the agency's commissioner, Stephen Hahn, said Thursday. Hahn instead appeared to lean on compassionate use rather than the newer Right to Try law. ""The important thing about compassionate use — and that's what the president meant [with] this is beyond Right to Try — is that we get to collect the information,"" he said. “At this point, the issues that we have been raising with the administration have been focused more on logistics and ensuring that we online to have the free flow of goods to make sure that we can meet patient needs,” PhRMA’s Ubl told reporters Wednesday when asked about the lobby’s goals amid the government’s response.

"Weeks before President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, Sen. Richard Burr privately offered a grim prognosis for the outbreak while previewing some of the massive disruptions soon to come, according to a previously unreported recording obtained by NPR.  In the recording, which NPR reports came from the North Carolina Republican's remarks at a private luncheon late last month, Burr said that the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak ""is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic,"" which killed an estimated 50 million worldwide.  ""There's one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history,"" said Burr, who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee. Burr also authored the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, the 2006 law that formulated the federal response to outbreaks. In his comments to the Tar Heel Circle in North Carolina on Feb. 27, Burr gave attendees a chilling warning about the severity of the coronavirus at a time when there were only a little over a dozen reported confirmed cases in the U.S. and President Donald Trump was suggesting that number would drop down to zero in short order. But many of Burr’s warnings to the group later came to pass. He instructed attendees to reconsider traveling to Europe, a suggestion that came about two weeks before the president announced a travel ban for foreigners coming to the U.S. from most of Europe. ""You may have to look at your employees and judge whether the trip they're making to Europe is essential or whether it can be done on video conference. Why risk it?"" he asked the group. The senator also said that the virus could prompt the shuttering of schools, something that happened in his home state a couple of weeks later.  “There will be, I'm sure, times that communities, probably some in North Carolina, have a transmission rate where they say, let's close schools for two weeks, everybody stay home,” he says in the recording. Burr even forecast the mobilization of the military, something that has only begun to happen in recent days on a wider scale. ""We're going to send a military hospital there, it's going to be in tents and going to be set up on the ground somewhere,"" he predicted, noting that ""It's going to be a decision the president and DoD make. And we're going to have medical professionals supplemented by local staff to treat the people that need treatment.”  Burr's tone in private went well beyond an op-ed he co-authored with Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), reassuring Americans that although they were rightfully concerned about the outbreak, it was being properly handled by the authorities. ""Thankfully, the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus, in large part due to the work of the Senate Health Committee, Congress, and the Trump administration,"" the two senators wrote. ""The work of Congress and the administration has allowed U.S. public health officials to move swiftly and decisively in the last few weeks."" The Trump administration has faced fierce criticism for not taking the outbreak seriously enough at its outset and for fumbling the early testing process — issues the White House is still scrambling to address.

"House Democratic leaders on Thursday announced that lawmakers will not be required to return to Washington until the next stimulus package for the coronavirus pandemic is ready for a vote, part of an attempt to limit exposure to the virus among members of Congress. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer informed members that he will be “adjusting” the House schedule to require less time at the Capitol and halt the virus’ spread among lawmakers — at least two of whom have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. “It is my intention that the House will not return to session until we are in a position to vote on the third piece of emergency legislation to respond to the economic impact of this crisis,” Hoyer said in a letter to Democrats. Democratic leaders are also looking to reassure members who have grown increasingly anxious about the virus’ spread in the Capitol, and fear the situation could worsen if hundreds of members are forced to be in a single room together. Hoyer confirmed that the House would “adjust our voting procedures” to comply with guidance from federal health agencies, which have strongly warned against all gatherings of more than 50 people. Democrats have considered ideas like holding the vote open longer to limit the number of lawmakers on the floor at one point. The Maryland Democrat did not address the possibility of allowing members to vote remotely from their districts, an idea that has steadily gained traction — particularly among West Coast lawmakers — amid the rapidly intensifying outbreak. “I share the concerns of many Members regarding the number of Members on the House Floor at any one time,” Hoyer said. “No decisions have been made on exactly what these changes will be, but we will be discussing all options.” Speaker Nancy Pelosi has privately dismissed the idea of voting outside of the Capitol in past meetings, as have House GOP leaders, though lawmakers and aides have acknowledged that the situation is fluid. Democratic leaders are expected to discuss the idea with their caucus on a conference call Thursday afternoon.  The push to allow remote voting has amplified in the last 12 hours, with two lawmakers — Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Ben McAdams (D-Utah) — each testing positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  Nearly two dozen members have decided to self-quarantine after potential exposure to the virus, including several who had close contact with Diaz-Balart and McAdams on the floor or in various gatherings on Friday before the House left for recess. But even before the two lawmakers were diagnosed, there was growing anxiety among House members and staff about the inevitability of the virus spreading on Capitol Hill. Several staffers had already tested positive in both chambers. Reps. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and Van Taylor (R-Texas) led a bipartisan letter on Wednesday night calling for remote voting, with signatures from more than 50 members. “When it comes to social distancing and public health best practices, Congress should be an example, not an exception,” Porter wrote on Twitter.",House won't return until stimulus package is ready,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/congress-coronavirus-pandemic-137414,politico
"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the Canada-U.S. border will likely close to nonessential travel on Friday night to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Speaking to reporters from his home in Ottawa this morning, Trudeau said the two governments “are continuing to work on the fine-tuning of the agreement between Canada and the United States,” but said it’s close to being finalized. Trudeau and President Donald Trump both announced Wednesday morning they were working on a mutual agreement to close the border to tourism and recreational travel. The border will stay open to trade, and Trudeau assured Canadians on Wednesday that deliveries of food, fuel and medicine would continue. Still, there remain unanswered questions about what else will be considered essential cross-border travel. The Canada-U.S. agreement will take effect less than 72 hours after Canada closed its borders to most international travelers, other than U.S. citizens. That measure came into effect on Wednesday at noon. Ottawa also says anyone trying to get on a plane to Canada who shows symptoms of the coronavirus will not be allowed to board. On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said all returning snowbirds — Canadians who overwinter in the U.S. — will be able to return to Canada. Canadian citizens who show up at a land border with coronavirus symptoms will be allowed into the country, but will be placed in quarantine.",Trudeau: Canada-U.S. border to close to nonessential travel on Friday night,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/canada-us-border-closing-coronavirus-137433,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged Thursday the U.S. faces months of economic contraction, but predicted a “gigantic fourth quarter” as Americans release “pent up demand” and return to “a normal world.”  In an interview with Fox Business Network, Mnuchin said he believes the economy will see its largest decline in this year’s second quarter, from April through June, followed by a third-quarter recovery as advancements in viral treatments and vaccines eventually halt the spread of the virus.  ""I think you’re going to see a lot of pent-up demand,"" Mnuchin told Maria Bartiromo. ""When we get through the next few months and Americans see what’s happening, and we have killed this virus, people are going to be comfortable going back to work.""  Mnuchin continued: ""We're going to be opening back business and people are going to continue what they do. They are going to live. They are going to shop. They are going to eat out. They are going to enjoy restaurants and travel and entertainment and we will go back to a normal world.”  Bartiromo pressed Mnuchin on company bailouts — a term he continues to push against. He emphasized Thursday that many of these companies will ultimately pay back any loans.  “This isn’t about bailing out bad businesses. This isn’t about banks that made bad loans,"" Mnuchin said. ""These are about very, very good companies that have been instructed to shut down, so they need liquidity. That’s what they need.""  ""In most cases, my expectation is they will be able to pay back these loans. In the case of small businesses, if they can’t afford to pay back those loans, we’ll forgive them,"" he continued. ""I don’t consider that a bailout. I consider that an incentive to keep workers hired.”  Mnuchin also clarified his reported warning to Republican senators on Tuesday that unemployment could spike to 20 percent if action is not taken. “What I said is that 40 percent of our workforce is in small business,"" he explained. ""And I said, if half of them were let go, mathematically, we’d be at 20 percent unemployment.”  Mnuchin’s upbeat outlook comes alongside grim new data emerging from the federal government. The Labor Department on Thursday reported 281,000 new claims for unemployment insurance last week, a one-third increase over the previous week, a jump it attributed to the pandemic. It was the highest number of claims since September 2017, and economists expect that figure to soar in the coming weeks. Asked whether economic data should be ignored in this volatile environment, Mnuchin replied, “The statistics in the short run of economics are obviously not relevant. This is an unprecedented situation where, at the government’s direction, we shut down parts of the economy and now is the time that we provide government support.”",Mnuchin predicts ‘gigantic’ fourth quarter after coronavirus rebound,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/steven-mnuchin-predicts-economic-recovery-137214,politico
"Last weekend, several major U.S. airports were crowded with travelers returning home from abroad, dealing with new enhanced health screenings due to the coronavirus pandemic and waiting in long lines which themselves raised public health risks. In some ways, they were the lucky ones. As airlines have canceled flights and countries have closed borders, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of Americans are stranded overseas, plotting how to get back and worrying about their families. And with the State Department having declared that Americans abroad should not expect repatriation flights, their options, beyond waiting out the pandemic, are few. On Thursday morning, State is expected to issue a level four travel advisory — its highest warning — telling Americans they should not travel internationally, and those abroad should come home or shelter in place. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned. “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO. The U.S. government hasn’t been much help either. In her first attempts to reach the embassy there, Marlin said she repeatedly got an emailed form response which offered no actionable help. When she called an emergency number, it simply played a recording with the same information.  It wasn’t until she had a friend get in touch with the office of her member of Congress, Jim Cooper, that she was able to speak to a human at the embassy. But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Marlin, a retired Spanish teacher, said she has a place to stay and is in good health, but is feeling extreme strain amid an uncertain pathway back home. “Here I am in a pretty decent and safe situation, and I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. I can’t sleep, I’m so stressed out,” she said. “It’s the not knowing if and when I’m ever going to get out.” “Our government, all they seem to care about is the economy. And they are saying ‘don’t count on us to help you,'"" Marlin said. “It just seems like if Trump gave a damn, he’d be pressuring these governments to let us out.” A State Department spokesperson told POLITICO the agency is “considering all options to assist U.S. citizens” stuck in countries which have restricted air travel. But Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the agency says citizens stranded abroad shouldn't rely on the U.S. government to help them get home. ""While the department has evacuated hundreds of Americans, mostly from China, U.S. citizens shouldn’t rely on that as a way to get back instead of finding commercial flights,"" was State's message, according to Bloomberg. In Europe, the Trump administration’s travel ban left an opening for U.S. citizens to return home, but it and other constraints have pushed airlines there to the brink and led to thousands of cancelations. Jeffrey Ouellette, an IT worker from Austin, Texas, was stranded for a few days in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was visiting for a technical meeting with other software engineers. His flight from Vilnius to Helsinki, Finland, the first of four legs, was canceled by Finnair. He bought an expensive replacement through Lufthansa, which itself was canceled hours later. His frustration was boiling over this week, as airlines around the world continue to ask for financial assistance from governments. He said communication was spotty and he was repeatedly assured by airline representatives that his itinerary would be fine, only to see it crumble hours later.  ""The whole system is broken,"" Ouellette said in an email to POLITICO. ""They don't deserve any bailout money if they can't fix this kind of stuff or have contingency plans in place to handle it."" Ouellette on Wednesday had made it to Frankfort, and is booked on a flight Thursday back to the states. He, too, said that the State Department had been “useless.”  “The embassy was not helpful in any way,” he said.  Some stranded travelers around the world banding together to strategize in a WhatsApp group called ""We're stuck (Americans),"" which Marlin said she's trying to join. The federal government’s response has led lawmakers to press for answers about what it's doing to help those Americans stuck overseas. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from nine Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help Americans stuck abroad. And, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home. He said he commends the State Department's efforts so far, but that ""Americans need greater support"" from the agency. ""I urge you to implement a response effort that is comprehensive, nimble, and timely and gets these Americans home as soon as possible,” Warner said. His spokesperson Nelly Decker said that the Virginia Democrat’s office is assisting upwards of 20 Virginians around the world “with the number growing almost hourly.” And lawmakers from New Jersey and Connecticut also reached out to State to say they're concerned that the agency isn't doing enough. ""It appears the United States is lagging behind our allies in terms of providing guidance and assistance,"" wrote Connecticut Sens.Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal. ""We urge you to exercise decisive leadership to provide immediate support for all Americans abroad to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of U.S. citizens and members of the global community.""","Stranded by canceled flights and travel bans, Americans abroad plead for help ",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/stranded-by-canceled-flights-and-travel-bans-americans-abroad-plead-for-help-137329,politico
"The State Department is set to announce a Level 4 travel advisory applying to all international travel, its most severe warning, three individuals with knowledge of the pending announcement said.  The advisory would instruct all Americans abroad to either return to the United States or prepare to shelter in place, given the global threat of the coronavirus outbreak. Americans also would be instructed not to travel abroad. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has approved the advisory, the individuals said. The move would represent a step beyond the department's current Level 3 travel warning, which merely encourages Americans to reconsider travel abroad. Thousands of U.S. citizens are already stuck in limbo abroad, and the new guidance threatens to create further anxiety and confusion among travelers.  Two State Department officials confirmed the pending advisory. The State Department press office did not respond to requests to comment, but announced on Thursday that U.S. passport agencies will only accept applications from customers with life-or-death emergencies who plan to travel within 72 hours. Several current and former U.S. diplomats, some of them with several decades of experience, said they do not recall such a travel advisory ever being issued in the past. The highly unusual guidance is set to come after seven weeks of steadily increasing restrictions on U.S. travel, following President Donald Trump's move to limit travel from China at the end of January. Other countries have closed their borders and imposed further travel restrictions as the virus has spread beyond Asia to Europe and the Western Hemisphere. There are more than 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The World Health Organization on Thursday said that there are more than 191,000 confirmed cases across more than 150 countries; an unofficial tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University pegs that number still higher. A State Department official based overseas expressed concern about the pending advisory, saying he worried it would cause panic among Americans. The official pointed out the difficulties of finding flights under the current conditions. Hundreds or maybe thousands of Americans remain stranded abroad, caught between travel bans and massive airline flight cancellations. Some Americans are stranded in countries like Guatemala, which has issued a ban on any flights coming or going, and others are having to pay dearly for what flights are left, often transiting through several countries before finding a way back home.  And the State Department has largely been absent, according to interviews with several Americans stranded abroad, who reported receiving no help from U.S. embassies. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday.

"Just two weeks ago, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was on the Senate floor haranguing his Democratic counterpart, Chuck Schumer, over the New York senator’s allegedly “threatening” comments toward two Supreme Court justices. Just before that, McConnell and Schumer were locked in a month-long bitter struggle over President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. But as the United States confronts potentially devastating economic consequences from the coronavirus pandemic, the Senate leaders face a stiff challenge on whether they can come together to quickly finalize a massive economic stimulus package. Their ability to reach a bipartisan agreement will shape the crisis’ fallout for millions of Americans.  McConnell and Schumer’s relationship has repeatedly been strained throughout the Trump era, in particular as Congress faced down government shutdowns and fiscal deadlines under an unpredictable, populist president who will attack anyone he sees as a threat, even members of his own party. But both men like to make deals — and they’ve proven skilled at just that in recent years. “Schumer’s a deal maker and McConnell’s a deal maker — he holds his cards very close to the vest but he’s a deal maker,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who worked closely with McConnell on legislation to raise the tobacco purchase age to 21. After deferring to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the White House on the House’s multi-billion dollar “Phase 2” emergency coronavirus bill, McConnell is taking the lead on the so-called “Phase 3” effort. It’s a $1 trillion-plus stimulus package intended to cushion the expected blow to the U.S. economy as businesses shut down and entire industries see plummeting demand for their goods and services, by far the most expensive economic rescue effort for Congress since the Great Recession ended more than a decade ago. ""It is critical that we move swiftly and boldly to begin to stabilize our economy, preserve Americans' jobs, get money workers and families and keep up our fight on the health front,"" McConnell said Thursday. ""This is exactly, exactly what our proposal will do."" But McConnell knows any deal will have to be bipartisan — and will need support from at least seven Democrats, assuming his caucus is united, to move forward. That gives Schumer — who has been in lockstep with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the response to the crisis — leverage in the negotiations.  “This is a massive problem. It takes bold, strong, immediate action. And we'll have to stay at this for a while because there are so many different problems we have to deal with, but we can't be partisan,” Schumer said in a CNN interview Wednesday night. “We can’t be timid. It's got to be bold and strong and comprehensive. And we’re prepared to stay here and do that.” The two leaders have yet to speak about the Senate’s “Phase 3” stimulus package.  McConnell is seeking to first build a consensus among Senate Republicans — on everything from direct payments to loans — and then will bring his proposal to Schumer to iron out the details. Senators expect those talks to last well into the weekend, and McConnell is urging lawmakers to stay close by so that the Senate can quickly vote on and pass the aid package. “I’m about as conservative fiscally as you can find on Capitol Hill. But my approach to this is: I’m pretty much Mr. Senator whatever it takes, we’ve got to get the economy back standing so when the virus is contained and it will be contained we can have an economy to come back to,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said. McConnell and Schumer have seen some ups and downs in their own relationship. In 2018, the pair made a rare joint appearance at the University of Louisville’s McConnell Center, where the two men were jovial and exchanged bottles of bourbon. They also clinched a two-year budget caps agreement last year. But relations soured during Trump's impeachment. There's also residual bitterness at McConnell from Democrats over his decision to block Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, and then use partisan muscle to push Trump picks Neil Gorscuh and Brett Kavanaugh onto the high court. Yet the McConnell-Schumer dynamic is nowhere near as toxic as relations got between McConnell and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). While Reid and McConnell both served on the Appropriations Committee and prided themselves on their legislative flexibility, their relationship completely fell apart by the time Reid retired in 2016. The bitterness between the two men carried over onto the Senate floor, paralyzing the chamber's work. So far, McConnell and Schumer are projecting confidence about their ability to work together again to stave off the unprecedented coronavirus crisis. “Both sides are going to be sufficiently motivated and we need to be bipartisan on this and I’m hoping that spirit of cooperation will really kick in,” said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.).  “I think we always have — after 9/11, after 2008. We’ll do it again,” added Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a top adviser to McConnell. But the 2008 bailout of the U.S. financial services industry was a searing experience for both men. Schumer had ridden into the Senate Democratic leadership on his ability to raise money, especially from Wall Street. Schumer later received criticism from progressives over those corporate relationships. McConnell voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), as the 2008 Wall Street rescue bill was called, only to see the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — then run by Schumer — attack him over the issue during his reelection campaign that year. And McConnell — who is known for never forgetting anything — is running for reelection again this year. Even before confronting each other over the next emergency package, the two Senate leaders will have to get their own members in line. McConnell convinced his caucus this week to vote for the House-passed coronavirus “Phase 2” stimulus package, despite GOP objections over the paid sick leave provisions. In the end, the package passed on Wednesday 90-8. All the ‘no’ votes were Republicans. Republicans are expected to unveil their “Phase 3” proposal Thursday. Among the ideas that were under discussion at a GOP lunch Wednesday were direct payments to individual Americans who make less than a certain amount; the deferment of student loans for potentially three months; and provisions for small businesses.  Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) are discussing giving small businesses forgivable loans, which would be administered by a bank, credit union or some other type of lender.  Meanwhile, Schumer has been speaking directly with Mnuchin, including twice on Wednesday. Schumer and Senate Democrats are proposing at least a $750 billion package to expand paid family leave, paid sick leave and unemployment insurance. The proposal allocates $400 billion in emergency appropriations to support the health care system, child care and small businesses and $350 billion to social safety net programs.  Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday the third stimulus package the Senate will consider must include a much broader paid sick leave policy in order for it to pass. “We can’t just do any type of response that only protects large corporations and businesses and not strengthen the social safety net which is where people are going to be needing the most help,” said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) in an interview. Schumer has joined Pelosi in calling for “four corner” negotiations between the party leaders in both the House and Senate, but McConnell has expressed no desire so far to sit down with Pelosi.  Yet some House Democrats fear that McConnell will try to pick off enough Senate Democrats to reach the critical 60-vote threshold in that chamber, pass a bill, and then try to “jam” the House politically. Pelosi has announced that Democrats will draft their own “Phase 3” proposal to give them bargaining power in the Senate’s talks. The discussions come as coronavirus is finally hitting Congress. Two House lawmakers have contracted the virus and more than a dozen are in self-quarantine after having been exposed to colleagues or other individuals who tested positive.  McConnell has vowed to keep the Senate in session until he and Schumer can pass a bill. Some senators have called for remote voting, but so far, appear to be staying put. The two leaders hope to have a deal in place by as early as this weekend, if they can reach one.",Coronavirus response hinges on McConnell and Schumer,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/mcconnell-schumer-coronavirus-response-137345,politico
"The number of National Guardsmen called up to deal with the coronavirus response may double by the weekend, and a top general says they may help with local law enforcement. More than 2,000 Guardsmen have already been deployed in 27 states to respond to the pandemic, Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel told reporters Thursday. After possibly doubling in days, the number could rise to tens of thousands as the crisis deepens, he said. “When there is a hurricane you can see it on a map, you have a sense of how hard the storm will hit and how long the storm will last,"" said Lengyel, who is chief of the National Guard Bureau. ""With Covid-19 it's like we have 54 separate hurricanes in every state, territory and the District of Columbia.” In their current state-level Title 32 status, the country's 450,000 Guardsmen can be deployed by their governor to transport medical supplies, help with drive-through testing, and assist local law enforcement with enforcing curfews and other tasks, Lengyel said. He advised against federalizing the National Guard under Title 10 — one of the options the administration is considering — because doing so means the states would lose some of those authorities. Under the Posse Comitatus Act, the federal government is prohibited from using U.S. troops for domestic law enforcement. This limitation does not apply to the National Guard when activated by a state's governor and operating under Title 32. Louisiana state officials deployed Guardsmen in this capacity in response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. When under state control, Guardsmen have ""additional authorities that can assist law enforcement and they maintain their direct command and control links within their states,"" Lengyel said. This ""makes it a faster, more rapid, more efficient response for the government and the state emergency response network to use them."" Lengyel said he does not currently see a ""demand signal"" to use National Guard forces in a law enforcement role, but that could soon change as the crisis deepens. ""Anything that the law enforcement capacity normally does, that could be augmented with National Guard troops,"" he said. The primary reason to federalize the National Guard would be in a ""World War III"" scenario where additional forces are needed rapidly to go to war ""with a major peer competitor,"" Lengyel explained. But in the case of the coronavirus, no such action is needed, which he said would cost ""billions and billions of dollars."" ""I think you can get everything you need more efficiently and more effectively if you leave them in a state status,"" Lengyel said. ""There is no need right now to have 450,000 Guardsmen on duty in any given state.""","National Guard call-ups may double by the weekend, chief says",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/national-guard-call-ups-coronavirus-137578,politico
"A decade of sharp cuts to state unemployment programs threatens to leave laid-off workers more vulnerable than during the Great Recession. With 10 states having reduced since the 2007-09 recession the maximum weeks employees can receive unemployment benefits, many state unemployment systems will be less generous to the unemployed than they were during that earlier downturn — even with the $1 billion boost that unemployment insurance is will receive in the legislative package signed by President Donald Trump. In Florida and North Carolina, for example, recipients can stop receiving unemployment benefits after 12 weeks, despite predictions from public health officials and economic experts that the economic aftereffects from the coronavirus pandemic could last much longer. Meanwhile, nearly half of U.S. states and jurisdictions are running dangerously low on unemployment cash, further limiting the amount of stimulus they can deliver to weather the economic fallout. “Unemployment insurance is about more than just giving somebody a check when they’re unemployed,"" said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning National Employment Law Project. ""It’s a macroeconomic stabilizer.” The generosity of unemployment benefits varies greatly among states. Unemployed workers in South Carolina and Missouri may receive $1,500 less and $1,400 less, respectively, than they would have heading into the Great Recession, according to a 2015 Government Accountability Office report. Workers in Kansas could receive $2,000 less, and workers in North Carolina could lose $2,700. Congress’ coronavirus response package offers states some relief but do little to expand benefits, which are set at the state level. The bill, signed by Trump on Wednesday, gives $500 million to help states process the expected surge in unemployment claims, and another $500 million in administrative assistance grants to states that experience a 10 percent increase in unemployment. This second $500 million is conditioned on states waiving work-search requirements, waiting periods and penalties for employers that lay off workers. But it isn't conditioned on states extending benefits for any particular length of time. Federal assistance to state unemployment systems accounts by law for half the number of weeks that states already offer. Consequently, the states that cover the fewest number of weeks would receive the least help from any increase. For example, a state that offers 20 weeks' unemployment benefits would get 10 extra weeks' federal funding, while a state that offers 26 weeks would get 13. “That is a further consequence of the cutbacks that have taken place in a number of states — it also cuts back on the amount of extra weeks you get in a recession,” said Chad Stone, the chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. After the Great Recession, businesses lobbied, often successfully, to limit state taxes to increase state reserves for unemployment insurance, which the recession had depleted. Many states did so by cutting benefits for recipients. An individual employer’s payment rate for state unemployment insurance is typically tied to how many workers the employer lays off, much like a motorist who sees his or her insurance go up after an accident. Cutting benefits was a way to replenish the trust fund while limiting tax increases on business. “At some point, it gets to be a level where employers come to policymakers and say, ‘Hey, this is crazy. I want to hire people but I can’t afford to, because the payroll tax I would have for that is so high,’” said Matt Weidinger, a researcher at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus package denied unemployment assistance to states that cut benefits. But according to Weidinger, states found a loophole: They could receive the assistance if they maintained the same level of benefits but cut the number of weeks these benefits could be received. On the whole, experts agree that state trust funds are in better shape than before the last recession. An AEI report that Weidinger published this month shows aggregate state trust fund balances at 76 billion, 40 percent higher than in 2007. The majority of states maintain sufficient unemployment insurance reserves to weather a recession, according to Labor Department data. But there remain 22 states and jurisdictions — including populous states like California, New York, Texas and Illinois — that have dangerously low reserves. As the crisis worsens, states are beginning to act on their own. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday that even before Congress compels him to, he will waive his state’s one-week waiting period and suspend work-search requirements for recipients, in part to help workers suffering from a state closure of bars and restaurants. On Monday, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer expanded unemployment benefits from 20 to 26 weeks and said that it will cover those taking care of family members. “We’re very mindful of the economic hurt for individuals who will lose their jobs,” DeWine said Sunday. “Look, this is brutally tough. And my heart goes out to them.

In some ways, they were the lucky ones. As airlines have canceled flights and countries have closed borders, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of Americans are stranded overseas, plotting how to get back and worrying about their families. And with the State Department having declared that Americans abroad should not expect repatriation flights, their options, beyond waiting out the pandemic, are few. On Thursday, State is expected to issue a level four travel advisory — its highest warning — telling Americans they should not travel internationally, and those abroad should come home or shelter in place. President Donald Trump also said on Thursday that the military is trying to help a large group of Americans stranded in Peru. ""We have a group of young people in Peru, and we're working on taking care of that with the military,"" he said, though he said the efforts shouldn't be considered an ""evacuation."" But Americans are stuck abroad in a number of other countries, including Guatemala. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned. “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO. The U.S. government hasn’t been much help either. In her first attempts to reach the embassy there, Marlin said she repeatedly got an emailed form response which offered no actionable help. When she called an emergency number, it simply played a recording with the same information. It wasn’t until she had a friend get in touch with the office of her member of Congress, Jim Cooper, that she was able to speak to a human at the embassy. But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Marlin, a retired Spanish teacher, said she has a place to stay and is in good health, but is feeling extreme strain amid an uncertain pathway back home. “Here I am in a pretty decent and safe situation, and I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. I can’t sleep, I’m so stressed out,” she said. “It’s the not knowing if and when I’m ever going to get out.” “Our government, all they seem to care about is the economy. And they are saying ‘don’t count on us to help you,'"" Marlin said. “It just seems like if Trump gave a damn, he’d be pressuring these governments to let us out.” A State Department spokesperson told POLITICO the agency is “considering all options to assist U.S. citizens” stuck in countries which have restricted air travel. But Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the agency says citizens stranded abroad shouldn't rely on the U.S. government to help them get home. ""While the department has evacuated hundreds of Americans, mostly from China, U.S. citizens shouldn’t rely on that as a way to get back instead of finding commercial flights,"" was State's message, according to Bloomberg. In Europe, the Trump administration’s travel ban left an opening for U.S. citizens to return home, but it and other constraints have pushed airlines there to the brink and led to thousands of cancelations. Jeffrey Ouellette, an IT worker from Austin, Texas, was stranded for a few days in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was visiting for a technical meeting with other software engineers. His flight from Vilnius to Helsinki, Finland, the first of four legs, was canceled by Finnair. He bought an expensive replacement through Lufthansa, which itself was canceled hours later. His frustration was boiling over this week, as airlines around the world continue to ask for financial assistance from governments. He said communication was spotty and he was repeatedly assured by airline representatives that his itinerary would be fine, only to see it crumble hours later. ""The whole system is broken,"" Ouellette said in an email to POLITICO. ""They don't deserve any bailout money if they can't fix this kind of stuff or have contingency plans in place to handle it."" Ouellette on Wednesday had made it to Frankfort, and is booked on a flight Thursday back to the states. He, too, said that the State Department had been “useless.” “The embassy was not helpful in any way,” he said. Some stranded travelers around the world banding together to strategize in a WhatsApp group called ""We're stuck (Americans),"" which Marlin said she's trying to join. The federal government’s response has led lawmakers to press for answers about what it's doing to help those Americans stuck overseas. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from nine Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help Americans stuck abroad. And, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home. He said he commends the State Department's efforts so far, but that ""Americans need greater support"" from the agency. ""I urge you to implement a response effort that is comprehensive, nimble, and timely and gets these Americans home as soon as possible,” Warner said. His spokesperson Nelly Decker said that the Virginia Democrat’s office is assisting upwards of 20 Virginians around the world “with the number growing almost hourly.” And lawmakers from New Jersey and Connecticut also reached out to State to say they're concerned that the agency isn't doing enough. ""It appears the United States is lagging behind our allies in terms of providing guidance and assistance,"" wrote Connecticut Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal. ""We urge you to exercise decisive leadership to provide immediate support for all Americans abroad to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of U.S. citizens and members of the global community.""","Stranded by canceled flights and travel bans, Americans abroad plead for help ",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/stranded-by-canceled-flights-and-travel-bans-americans-abroad-plead-for-help-137329,politico
"The head of the Federal Aviation Administration will self-quarantine for a week after shaking hands with Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart days before the Florida Republican developed coronaviruslike symptoms, the agency confirmed this morning. Steve Dickson and Diaz-Balart shook hands before an appropriations hearing on March 11. Diaz-Balart has said he developed a headache and fever the night of March 14. He and Rep. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) are the first members of Congress to test positive for the coronavirus. When asked Wednesday night about Dickson's interaction with Diaz-Balart, FAA spokesperson Brianna Manzelli said Dickson was ""feeling fine.""

"The State Department is set to announce a Level 4 travel advisory applying to all international travel, its most severe warning, three individuals with knowledge of the pending announcement said.  The advisory, which appears to be unprecedented, would instruct all Americans abroad to either return to the United States or prepare to shelter in place, given the global threat of the coronavirus outbreak. Americans also would be instructed not to travel abroad. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has approved the advisory, the individuals said. The move would represent a step beyond the department's current Level 3 travel warning, which merely encourages Americans to reconsider travel abroad. Thousands of U.S. citizens are already stuck in limbo abroad, and the new guidance threatens to create further anxiety and confusion among travelers.  Two State Department officials confirmed the pending advisory. The State Department press office did not respond to requests to comment, but announced on Thursday that U.S. passport agencies will only accept applications from customers with life-or-death emergencies who plan to travel within 72 hours. Several current and former U.S. diplomats, some of them with several decades of experience, said they do not recall such a travel advisory ever being issued in the past. The highly unusual guidance is set to come after seven weeks of steadily increasing restrictions on U.S. travel, following President Donald Trump's move to limit travel from China at the end of January. Other countries have closed their borders and imposed further travel restrictions as the virus has spread beyond Asia to Europe and the Western Hemisphere. There are more than 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The World Health Organization on Thursday said that there are more than 191,000 confirmed cases across more than 150 countries; an unofficial tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University pegs that number still higher. A State Department official based overseas expressed concern about the pending advisory, saying he worried it would cause panic among Americans. The official pointed out the difficulties of finding flights under the current conditions. Hundreds or maybe thousands of Americans remain stranded abroad, caught between travel bans and massive airline flight cancellations. Some Americans are stranded in countries like Guatemala, which has issued a ban on any flights coming or going, and others are having to pay dearly for what flights are left, often transiting through several countries before finding a way back home.  And the State Department has largely been absent, according to interviews with several Americans stranded abroad, who reported receiving no help from U.S. embassies. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned.  “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO.

"A plunging stock market. Restaurants, gyms and movie theaters shutting their doors. Workers losing more income each day. It’s an unprecedented public crisis, and it’s also billions of dollars in state tax revenue that’s evaporating quickly — and scrambling the economic equation for governors and mayors across the nation. The cascading impacts of the novel coronavirus come just as governors, state lawmakers, mayors and city councils would normally be hammering out their budget plans for the coming year. But with no telling how long the coronavirus pandemic will shut down everyday life, a crystal ball may prove as effective as economic formulas for the fiscal year ahead. Governors of both parties are now calling on President Donald Trump and Congress to step in with billions in federal aid and reductions in red tape. They'd also be wise to dust off their playbooks from more than a decade ago when the Great Recession last caused revenues to nose-dive with little notice. Starting in the fall of 2008, California wrote and rewrote its budget three times in less than a year because projections quickly went into the dustbin within months of printing a new spending plan. Leaders in states across the nation are bracing for a similar year of drafting their documents in pencil, knowing that the situation will be hard to pin down until the world emerges from hibernation. Unlike the federal government, states and cities must balance their budgets each year. Some states, like California, may be better prepared to weather the storm, sitting on a surplus and $20 billion reserve fund built after lessons learned from the previous downturn. But others will have to figure out which programs to cut for the first time in years. Illinois, for instance, doesn’t even have a rainy day fund. That was on Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s wish list for this year’s legislative session — which has now been put on hold. States such as New York are already talking about building contingencies into their spending plan. Trigger cuts — a well-worn tool during the last recession — are already entering the conversation. Washington, of course, can use its borrowing powers where states can't, as it did during the 2008-09 recession with a massive public works package intended to create jobs and buoy local economies. Congress and the Trump administration are now discussing a package of more than $1 trillion in stimulus, and state and local leaders have begun to press for emergency federal aid to support sectors from transportation to dining. “We’re going to need the federal government with us in a big way,” said New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who expects states will ultimately need collective federal aid of $3 trillion to $4 trillion. “And I think everybody recognizes that — and I don’t mean just New Jersey. We’re going to need help. This is beyond any one state.” But Democrats in particular wonder if the Trump administration will be eager to increase funding to areas it previously slated for cuts, such as Medicaid and social service programs that would serve as a safety net for those hit hardest by coronavirus economic damage. POLITICO’s reporters in state capitals and major cities throughout the country are watching the budget and economic impact of the pandemic closely — here’s a look at what’s happening in several major states. Florida’s leaders are used to planning their budgets around hurricane-induced disasters and even oil spills. Coronavirus is different: Economists in the Republican-led Sunshine State say it’s difficult to forecast how hard the virus will hit the state’s tourism-dependent economy — the fourth biggest in the country — with theme parks and beaches now shuttered. The pandemic played a big-money role as the Legislature wrapped up its two-month legislative session last weekend — lawmakers scaled back planned tax cuts and boosted the state’s $3.9 billion cash reserves by $300 million to prepare for the coronavirus response. The state has set aside $50 million for bridge loans, and laid-off employees can apply for unemployment assistance. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who came to power as a close Trump ally, delivered a rebuke to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on March 17 after the secretary said the federal stimulus package should include rules to keep money from going to millionaires who don’t need it. DeSantis said federal red tape could delay aid for months. An early version of a House stimulus bill now scheduled to go before the Senate sought to distribute funds through the Social Security Administration. DeSantis said he told has told Florida Sen. Marco Rubio that the first federal stimulus bill should be packed with assistance for people who will be left jobless. It also should include more bridge loan money for small businesses facing closure, he said. The full picture of the coronavirus impact in Florida might not come into focus for some time. Lawmakers decided on $300 million in added reserves before Walt Disney Co. and NBCUniversal closed theme parks in Orlando and cities including Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach closed beaches that were packed with spring break revelers. (For context, $3 billion of the state’s forecasted $36.5 billion in general revenue this year was expected to come from tourism sales tax revenue.) Gov. Gavin Newsom insists his state is better prepared than most to deal with a downturn. California is working with a $222.2 billion budget and a record surplus and reserves. But the nation’s most populous state, which has the fifth largest economy in the world, is heavily dependent on tax revenue from wealthy earners and hence capital gains — making it particularly vulnerable to stock market swings. So expect a wild ride. Last week, the UCLA Anderson Forecast lowered its expectations for GDP growth and trade but stopped short of predicting a recession. By Monday, UCLA economists had changed their minds. Monday’s revised report said the U.S. economy has entered a recession expected to last until September, and that California will suffer more than most. California is expected to lose more than 280,000 payroll jobs by the first quarter of 2021, with more than a third of those in the leisure, hospitality, transportation and warehousing sectors, according to the report. State Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek, an influential voice on the state budget, said that “while the impact on state revenues is not yet clear, the extreme market volatility and rapidly weakening economic situation obviously have negative implications.” He issued a memo Wednesday projecting ""several billion dollars"" less in capital gains through mid-2021 and said the state would likely have to pass a stopgap budget before approving a full spending plan after its June 15 deadline. Still, Petek pointed to California's robust reserve fund as a buffer against potential budget cuts. Christopher Thornberg, founder of Beacon Economics in Los Angeles, is taking an optimistic approach. While this is unprecedented at a national level, he said, regions have bounced back from such natural disasters fairly quickly. It’s not necessarily like the 2008 financial crisis, which had a long-term impact on the economy and permanent loss of jobs, he said. “It’s business delayed, not business canceled. It’s spending delayed, not spending canceled,” Thornberg said. “If we’re looking at four weeks, it’s a hurricane. But to be clear, if this goes 40 weeks, California is not in a good position. … Our revenue system in the state is so hypersensitive to shifts in capital gains that if the stock market really did stay down where it is right now, we’re going to take a massive hit.” New York’s economy faces a massive hit: In a best-case scenario, tax revenues will likely be $4 billion lower than projected for the coming fiscal year, the state comptroller says, and New York City alone faces at least a $3.2 billion hit to its bottom line as travel dwindles and restaurants, bars and theaters close indefinitely, a steep loss in tax revenue that will extend for six months. Financing the massive coronavirus response, meanwhile, is going to upend Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s previously planned efforts to fill a major Medicaid budget hole. State leaders are scrambling to finish their state budget this week, but Cuomo said the original forecast is practically moot now with an expected economic downturn in weeks and months to come. The state was already staring down a roughly $6 billion budget gap, primarily due to a $4 billion Medicaid shortfall. Cuomo’s plan to address that relied on limiting the amount of local spending on Medicaid that is picked up by the state. But the second federal coronavirus bill — which would give the state billions of dollars — would make that strategy ""impossible,"" the governor complained over the weekend, because it contains language prohibiting any changes to localities' reimbursement rates. Sources close to the legislation say Cuomo is working with the New York delegation for language in additional federal coronavirus bills to allow him flexibility to move forward with his Medicaid savings plan. The state’s comptroller, Tom DiNapoli, has long suggested New York's reserves are not built up to withstand disaster or severe economic downturn. The budget Cuomo proposed would get the two largest statutory reserve funds to under $2.5 billion, about 3.1 percent of General Fund expenditures, and far below other large states such as California, Texas and Michigan. In the City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has enjoyed an unprecedented economic boom since taking office in 2014; he’s expanded the city budget from $75 billion six years ago to a proposed $95.3 billion for the upcoming fiscal year. That streak has now ended this month, with a city economy dependent on tourism and entertainment grinding to a halt. As bad as the picture is now for the city, it still has room to get worse. De Blasio and Cuomo are looking at plans to potentially shut down roads, bridges, tunnels and trains to halt travel in and out of the city. That would drain city coffers further and could have ripple effects for national and global markets. Texas is used to booms and busts in the oil and gas sector blowing a hole in the state’s $110 billion annual budget. It’s got a rainy day fund that has more than $11 billion. “The ups and downs are nothing new for us,” said Jerry Mouton, mayor of Deer Park, which has a Shell manufacturing site. “It’s a normal part of the budgeting process. I’m not overly concerned.” But the oil and gas downturn is coming at the same time as the outbreak — meaning that state budget writers will have to make some tough decisions when they gather in Austin for the next session in January. An oil production tax provides 6.1 percent of the state’s revenue and natural gas production tax generates 2.7 percent. That, combined with an expected plunge in sales tax from shuttered restaurants, hotels and businesses and a lack of income tax, means Texas will have a tough time cushioning the blow. Typically, state budget writers have blunted oil price busts by drastically cutting services like education. But the state, which has the highest uninsured rate in the country, is lagging in its response to the outbreak, meaning that the virus spread could stretch thin hospitals and other services. Lawmakers will have to figure out where to get the money to help hospitals and providers while boosting health services. If Democrats take the majority in the state House this year, they will insist on not balancing the budget on the backs of low-income residents. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said that he expects the federal government to throw the state a financial lifeline — as it did after Hurricane Harvey. Illinois is particularly vulnerable budget-wise. Not only is its rainy day fund depleted, but the state a few years ago also passed a constitutional amendment that restricts the use of motor fuel fees and taxes for road construction and repair only. So Illinois has much less flexibility than other states in funneling money to a fund to respond to the impacts of the coronavirus. Meanwhile, the city of Chicago, which is grappling with a $30 billion unfunded pension debt, relies on tax revenues from conventions, tourism and hotel and restaurant activities. The city has already lost at least 20 conventions, with a combined 200,000 visitors, as a result of the 30-day ban on gatherings of 1,000 or more. (The governor has since put the ban at no more than 50 people.) “This is putting a severe dent in those industries. With Chicago being the economic engine of the state of Illinois, putting that engine in neutral while we’re navigating the social isolation necessary to combat the coronavirus puts state and local finances in a very precarious position,” said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government watchdog that is often called to testify and provide independent opinions about state and city finances. Msall said the situation is reminiscent of the economic impacts of the attacks of 9/11. “The difference is in 9/11, we knew we needed to secure against additional attacks and rebuild. Here, we don’t know when the virus will stop attacking or when it will be effectively limited — and when people can socialize again and when businesses can conduct normal operations, when entertainment, colleges, universities and schools can reopen.” In New Jersey, the economic fallout could quickly eat through the state’s $1.5 billion projected surplus, which amounts to just 3.8 percent of the state’s current $39.9 billion budget. The revenue estimates used to project the surplus made no assumptions about any economic downturn, let alone the coronavirus, and state officials don’t immediately plan to announce an updated forecast. Murphy, who has fought with fellow Democrats in the Legislature over his proposal to raise taxes on millionaires, suggested that some sort of revenue raise could be needed. Still, he said, the damage could be far more than New Jersey could handle on its own. Extending the state’s top tax rate to those earning from $1 million to $5 million would raise less than $500 million a year, based on those now-outdated projections. Murphy is working with the state's congressional delegation to lobby for federal aid in the form of block grants. In the short term, the Wall Street selloff could temper income tax losses when tax season rolls around in 2021, but a drop in dividends and, more importantly, mass layoffs are sure to suck hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars out of the state’s coffers. The state collects sales tax on all online sales, potentially stabilizing that major revenue source. State Senate President Steve Sweeney proposed on Saturday a two-month holiday from the state sales and payroll taxes and deferral of other taxes, including property taxes — a potential short-term hit to local governments. Murphy said the state may not be able to afford it. The Boston marathon may be postponed, but Massachusetts lawmakers maneuvered around questions of how coronavirus will impact the state budget early this week, calling the situation ""fluid."" Officials said instead they are focused on legislation to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, and closed the State House to visitors other than elected officials and staffers. Massachusetts hammers out its budget details over the course of the spring, but the state is used to having its budget come late into the summer. ""For right now, we are focusing on legislation related to Covid-19. That is our priority,"" Senate President Karen Spilka told reporters. ""This is a very fluid situation."" In the meantime, Gov. Charlie Baker signed into law a $15 million fund to help the state combat coronavirus; on Monday, he proposed a $10 million small business recovery loan fund for businesses affected by the outbreak. House Speaker Robert DeLeo echoed Spilka's comments about the budget, saying the virus is ""taking precedence over other issues."" Massachusetts has around $3 billion in its so-called rainy day fund, according to the independent Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.

"Donald Trump’s cease-fire with the press was short lived. Days after calling news media coverage of the coronavirus pandemic “very fair” at a White House news briefing, the president on Thursday went back on the offensive, agreeing with a reporter from the right-wing outlet One America News Network that outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal were siding with Chinese government propaganda and joking that he wanted to remove 75 percent to 80 percent of the journalists in the briefing room in the name of social distancing.  The president lashed out in particular at one reporter who asked why the White House was so unprepared to implement widespread testing for the respiratory illness given Trump’s assertion earlier this week that he’d known all along the outbreak would morph into a pandemic. Trump replied that his administration was, in fact, prepared for the virus that he spent weeks dismissing as a minimal threat to Americans. “We were very prepared. The only thing we weren’t prepared for was the media. The media has not treated it fairly,” Trump told NBC News’ Kristen Welker.  “I’ll tell you how prepared I was — I called for a ban from people coming in from China long before anybody thought it was,"" he continued, pointing to the single step he has pointed to almost exclusively as evidence that his administration has adequately addressed coronavirus. ""In fact, it was your network — I believe they called me a racist because I did that. It was many of the people in the room, they called me racist and other words because I did that.”  And he used a question about whether Congress should implement some kind of social distancing measures to joke about such measures imposed on journalists in the White House briefing room. The White House recently said it would pool cameras and let fewer reporters into the room to allow an empty seat between individuals in the typically jam-packed space. “I know all of them. I don’t know if they’re sitting like you people are sitting,” Trump said about the several members of Congress who have now tested positive for coronavirus.  But pointing at the reporters in the room, Trump continued: “You’re actually sitting too close. We should probably get rid of another 75, 80 percent of you. I’ll have just two or three that I like in this room. I think that’s a great way of doing it. We figured a new way of doing it.”  “But you’re actually much too close. You two,” Trump said, circling the air in the direction of the briefing room's front row, “should leave immediately.” White House news briefings, once a daily occurrence, had gone all but extinct in the Trump administration until the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic. Briefings under past Trump press secretaries Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders were particular points of contention as the president's spokespeople struggled at times to answer questions about the factual inaccuracies or odd rhetoric emanating from their boss. But daily briefings, lately anchored by the president, have returned in recent days amid the coronavirus outbreak. And until Thursday, the president had remained mostly cordial with the press as he and others at the briefing work to disseminate the administration's messaging on its coronavirus response. But during his extensive media criticisms on Friday, Trump claimed that he’d been tested for coronavirus only after a deluge of questions from the media, which followed Trump’s appearance in pictures with an aide to the Brazilian president who tested positive for the virus.  “I didn't have any symptoms and I got a test, but I got a test because you people were driving everybody crazy,” Trump told reporters Thursday, when asked about his conflicting messaging over whether people with no symptoms should seek out a test, which have been in short supply across the country. “My doctor told me don't get it, you don't need it,” Trump continued. “Everybody said you don't need it, but I had to do it because the press was going crazy. And then after I got it, they said you shouldn't have gotten it, you had no symptoms.”  Toward the end of the briefing, a correspondent for the Trump-friendly cable news outlet OAN gave the president a wider opening to go after the press, which he seized. ""It amazes me when I read the things I read,"" he began, rapping several newspapers for ""phony"" reporting on his handling of the crisis. When the reporter posited that ""major left wing news media"" had been ""siding with state propaganda"" emanating from China by criticizing his use of the term ""Chinese virus,"" Trump went on an extended riff about the ""corrupt media.""  ""I think they do — I mean, they're siding with China. They're doing things they shouldn't be doing. They're siding with many others. China is the least of it,"" Trump asserted. ""So why they're doing this, you'll have to ask them. But if we had an honest media in this country, our country would be an even greater place.""  Ironically, Trump singled out only The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal — three papers whose journalists China announced it would expel from the country earlier this week, a move that Trump's administration condemned.",Trump drops his coronavirus media detente,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-media-coronavirus-137692,politico
"AUSTIN, Texas — Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order limiting public gatherings to 10 people, shutting schools, prohibiting visitors to nursing homes and retirement communities and limiting bars and restaurants to take-out through April 3 in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. He also recommended that non-essential state employees telework.  The virus's quick spread is sparking a dramatic response from Republican state leaders, who until now had been letting local officials issue guidance on closures. About 140 Texans have tested positive for COVID-19 and three people have died since the first case on March 4.  “The traditional model that we have employed in the state of Texas for such a long time so effectively does not apply to an invisible disease that knows no geographic or jurisdictional boundaries,” Abbott, said at a press conference. The state issued a public health disaster order, the first such order since 1901, according Abbott. Abbott said he expects testing capacity to reach 15,000 to 20,000 tests per week. So far, about 2,000 people have been tested in the state. And he said that hospitals are prepared for a potential surge in critically-ill patients, but didn't say whether the state is requesting military hospitals from the federal government.

"Pressure is building on the Trump administration to delay this year’s tax filing deadline, with Democratic and Republican lawmakers joining business groups in demanding that step in response to the coronavirus. House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) wrote to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Thursday urging him to push the deadline to July 15. And a trio of senators introduced legislation that would do the same. The move would harmonize the filing deadline with the three-month grace period for tax payments that Mnuchin announced Tuesday. In his letter to Mnuchin, Neal said that having separate deadlines for filing and paying “will potentially create a great deal of confusion for taxpayers accustomed to having only one deadline.” He also cited the closure of some IRS assistance centers across the country. In introducing their legislation, Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Angus King (I-Maine) said a filing extension also would ensure that taxpayers don’t have to violate CDC social distancing guidelines, since they may have to meet with an accountant or need to physically retrieve documents to file by April 15. People could still file their taxes before July 15 if they choose to, so their refunds wouldn't be delayed, the senators said in a news release. “Treasury’s decision to extend the tax payment deadline from April 15 to July 15 was an important first step, but it only makes sense to also extend the tax filing deadline itself,” Thune, who is Senate majority whip, said. “There’s enough confusion amid this outbreak as it is, so I believe it’s incumbent upon Congress to provide as much clarity and relief as possible to American families."" In recent days, numerous business groups and organizations representing tax preparers have called on the administration to push back the filing deadline. Businesses have also sought an array of other measures to ease their tax burden during the health crisis. Neal also asked Mnuchin to delay payment of estimated taxes for the second quarter of 2020, noting they would otherwise be due June 15.",Lawmakers want delay in tax filing deadline amid coronavirus outbreak,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/tax-filing-deadline-delay-coronavirus-137696,politico
"The Senate is inching closer to negotiating a third, trillion-dollar stimulus package to confront the coronavirus pandemic.  Senate Republicans are expected to unveil their proposal Thursday to deal with the crisis, after days of preliminary discussion. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has vowed the Senate will stay in until a bipartisan deal is reached.  McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor Thursday, outlined the Republican proposal to assist small businesses by providing federally guaranteed loans; direct cash payments, as well as lending to industries such as the airlines that are hit hard by the coronavirus. In addition, Republicans are looking to get more resources for the health care system, which could be overloaded as the virus continues to spread throughout the U.S. “Our proposal will immediately help American workers, families, and businesses,” McConnell said of the plan, known as “Phase 3.” “Yes, it will help position our economy to thrive once again after this public health menace is behind us … Fundamentally, we have to beat back this virus.” Senate Republicans are expected to discuss the stimulus package at their lunch Thursday. But the package will need support from at least seven Senate Democrats if all Republicans back it. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) emphasized Thursday that Democrats, who have outlined their own vision, will pursue a “workers first” proposal and called for a “Marshall Plan” for the health care system. He also called for a new form of unemployment insurance.  Schumer has stayed in close touch with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is leading negotiations for the Trump administration, about the third stimulus package, as well as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).  In his floor remarks, Schumer also expressed skepticism about the administration’s proposal to provide $1,000 checks to workers to mitigate the economic consequences of the crisis, saying that “it cannot be a substitute” for other provisions like paid sick leave. He added that if Congress moves ahead with cash payments, the payments should be more substantial and frequent.  The Treasury Department floated a plan this week to lawmakers to provide direct payments to Americans starting in April, and then another round of payments in May.  “As we Democrats seek input into the joint bipartisan package that will be put together, our goal is to make sure that no one, no worker, no family, no one loses a paycheck or goes into financial ruin as a result of the coronavirus,” Schumer said. “That will take strong, bold, immediate action.” The minority leader also called for “four corner” negotiations between party leaders in the Senate and the House, but McConnell has shown no interest in involving the House. In preparing the “Phase 3” package, McConnell has directed task forces to come up with proposals. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) are suggesting giving small businesses forgivable loans, which would be administered by a bank, credit union or some other type of lender.  According to a draft discussion of the small business proposal, obtained by POLITICO, the maximum small business loan the government could back would double to 10 million from 5 million through the end of the year. In addition, Republicans have discussed providing direct cash payments for individuals below a certain income level and the deferment of student loans, potentially for up to three months.  McConnell emphasized Thursday that the proposals are not “bailouts.”  “From small businesses to key sectors, we are not talking about so-called ‘bailouts’ for firms that made reckless decisions,” McConnell said. “Nobody is alleging a moral hazard here. None of these firms — not corner stores, not pizza parlors, not airlines — brought this on themselves.” Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have outlined their ideas for expanded paid sick leave and unemployment insurance as part of a $750 billion proposal.  The third stimulus package comes after the Senate passed Wednesday a multibillion dollar House-passed emergency aid package. While some Republicans had expressed reservations about the package's paid sick leave provisions, the final vote tally was 90-8.",Senate to begin negotiating third massive coronavirus package,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/senate-negotiates-third-coronavirus-package-137607,politico
"President Donald Trump on Thursday put the onus on governors to obtain the critical equipment their states need to fight the coronavirus pandemic, telling reporters that the federal government is “not a shipping clerk” for the potentially life-saving supplies. Appearing at the daily press briefing of the White House coronavirus task force, the president defended his decision to invoke the Defense Production Act — which would allow the administration to direct U.S. industry to ramp up production of emergency medical provisions — without actually triggering the statute. “Governors are supposed to be doing a lot of this work, and they are doing a lot of this work,” Trump said. “The Federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping. You know, we're not a shipping clerk.” The president’s remarks amounted to a rebuke of governors’ recent pleas for more robust federal intervention amid the rapidly spreading outbreak, which they warn will soon overwhelm local health care systems if hospital beds, face masks and other necessities are not soon furnished in significantly greater numbers. Trump said Thursday the administration will “help out wherever we can,” but added that the acquisition of urgent supplies “is really for the local governments, governors and people in the state, depending on the way they divide it up. And they'll do that, and they're doing a very good job of it.” But earlier Thursday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, the current epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., exhorted the administration to help meet the demand for equipment. Cuomo has specifically sounded the alarm over the lack of ventilators in states across the nation, warning that New York would require five or six times its current supply of the respiratory machines to treat the projected number of coronavirus patients.  “Every state is shopping for ventilators. We‘re shopping for ventilators. We literally have people in China shopping for ventilators, which is one of the largest manufacturers. So this is a major problem,” Cuomo said at his daily news conference, adding that the administration “can actually play a very constructive role“ under the DPA. “We're going to need protective equipment in hospitals,” Cuomo said. “We‘re going to need ventilators. And that is something that a state can‘t do but the federal government can do.” Trump announced on Wednesday that he would dispatch one of the Navy’s two hospital ships to New York Harbor, while the other prepared to deploy to a location on the West Coast. The vessels are equipped with 1,000 hospital beds each and are intended to relieve civilian hospitals struggling with capacity in the face of the public health crisis. The Pentagon has also took a variety of actions this week, including putting on alert 1,000 “deployable” beds from a variety of different medical units, making available up to 5 million respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from its own reserves, and distributing up to 2,000 ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday called for construction companies to donate their inventories of N95 protective masks to local hospitals and halt new mask orders, and said on Thursday that the administration had “literally identified tens of thousands of ventilators that can be converted to treat patients.“ He did not say where the ventilators were found.  Despite those measures, the Trump administration has not completed a comprehensive assessment to determine the full scope of supplies that will need to be ordered, according to current and former administration officials, and his invoking the DPA does not do anything to increase production of those items. Public health experts, meanwhile, have encouraged increased coordinaton between the administration and manufacturers assembling medical equipment for health care providers. “They need to receive assurances from the federal government that they will be compensated, even if health care institutions don‘t end up needing the equipment,“ Tom Inglesby and Anita Cicero, both of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, wrote in an op-ed earlier this month. Following the White House briefing, the president traveled to FEMA headquarters in Washington to participate in a video teleconference with governors on COVID-19 response efforts. In a memo from the National Governors Association delivered to Trump and Pence ahead of the call, the states‘ chief executives outlined their “top needs and priorities to be shared“ with the administration. Among their list of major concerns, the governors requested that the federal government “increase access to [personal protective equipment], masks, test kits, [and] extraction kits,“ and demanded “accelerating the production of life-saving equipment, such as ventilators.“ They also asked for the administration to “provide guidance on [the] implementation of“ the DPA.

"The number of National Guardsmen called up to deal with the coronavirus response may double by the weekend, and a top general says they may help with local law enforcement. More than 2,000 Guardsmen have already been deployed in 27 states to respond to the pandemic, Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel told reporters Thursday. After possibly doubling in days, the number could rise to tens of thousands as the crisis deepens, he said. “When there is a hurricane you can see it on a map, you have a sense of how hard the storm will hit and how long the storm will last,"" said Lengyel, who is chief of the National Guard Bureau. ""With Covid-19, it's like we have 54 separate hurricanes in every state, territory and the District of Columbia.” In their current state-level Title 32 status, the country's 450,000 Guardsmen can be deployed by their governor to transport medical supplies, help with drive-through testing, and assist local law enforcement with enforcing curfews and other tasks, Lengyel said. He advised against federalizing the National Guard under Title 10 — one of the options the administration had been considering — because doing so means the states would lose some of those authorities. Under the Posse Comitatus Act, the federal government is prohibited from using U.S. troops for domestic law enforcement. This limitation does not apply to the National Guard when activated by a state's governor and operating under Title 32. Louisiana state officials deployed Guardsmen in this capacity in response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. When under state control, Guardsmen have ""additional authorities that can assist law enforcement and they maintain their direct command and control links within their states,"" Lengyel said. This ""makes it a faster, more rapid, more efficient response for the government and the state emergency response network to use them."" Hours after Lengyel spoke, Pentagon spokesperson Alyssa Farah announced that the administration plans to keep Guard troops under state control. ""The @DeptOfDefense is not considering federalization of the @USNationalGuard,"" she tweeted. ""The #COVID19 response is dynamic, but at this time Governors remain in control of their states’ National Guard forces & can request additional assistance from federal Title 10 forces through@FEMAgov."" The primary reason to federalize the National Guard would be in a ""World War III"" scenario where additional forces are needed rapidly to go to war ""with a major peer competitor,"" Lengyel explained. But in the case of the coronavirus, no such action is needed, which he said would cost ""billions and billions of dollars.""  ""I think you can get everything you need more efficiently and more effectively if you leave them in a state status,"" Lengyel said. ""There is no need right now to have 450,000 Guardsmen on duty in any given state.""","National Guard call-ups may double by the weekend, chief says",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/national-guard-call-ups-coronavirus-137578,politico
"As Congress drafts one of the biggest pieces of legislation in a generation, leaders in the House and Senate face mounting questions about how to keep members safe from the highly infectious coronavirus — including whether to vote away from the U.S. Capitol.  With two lawmakers now testing positive for the virus, Democratic and Republican leaders are eager to reassure their own members who warn that the situation could drastically worsen if roughly 435 of them are forced to be in a single room.  But congressional leaders also acknowledge that allowing members to vote remotely would be one of the biggest procedural changes to Congress in history — not to mention a massive and complicated undertaking that would take time to develop.   So far, the Senate has remained in Washington, even as the nation inches closer to a national lockdown, as GOP leaders scramble to complete a $1 trillion stimulus package in the coming days. The House, which has already recessed for the week, won’t return until that bill is ready for a vote, Democratic leaders announced Thursday.  But the rapidly worsening outbreak has heightened anxieties in both parties, with a growing number of lawmakers urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take drastic measures, including electronic voting outside the Capitol for the first time in history in a bid to halt the spread and shield themselves, their staffs and their families.  It’s an unlikely idea that past leaders have also entertained during times of national crises, including after the Sept. 11 attacks, only to dismiss it out of concern that it could erode the institution or signal a lack of confidence in the nation’s governing body.   “Boy, if we did, I would want it very, very limited,” Sen. Patrick Leahy, the Senate’s longest-serving Democrat, said Wednesday. The Vermont Democrat added that the idea came up in the Senate Democrats’ conference call earlier that day.  The issue is also expected to come up in conversations among House Democrats and Republicans on Thursday, as the two hold separate conference calls to update their members on the state of the Senate’s legislation and their own voting practices. House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern told members during a conference call on Thursday that he would review options on remote voting, according to people familiar with the conversation.  House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said during the call that the House could clear the massive stimulus package with unanimous consent — which would prevent lawmakers from needing to be in the building — but said it was ""unlikely.""  “I share the concerns of many members regarding the number of members on the House Floor at any one time,” Hoyer said in a letter to House Democrats on Thursday, announcing that they wouldn’t need to return to Washington until it was time to vote on the next tranche of emergency aid.  Hoyer told members that he will be “adjusting” the House schedule to require less time at the Capitol and halt the virus’ spread among lawmakers. But the Maryland Democrat did not address the possibility of allowing members to vote remotely from their districts, an idea that has steadily gained traction, particularly among West Coast lawmakers, amid the rapidly intensifying outbreak.  “No decisions have been made on exactly what these changes will be, but we will be discussing all options,” Hoyer said.   Hoyer confirmed that the House would “adjust our voting procedures” to comply with guidance from federal health agencies, which have strongly warned against all gatherings of more than 50 people. Democrats have considered ideas like holding the vote open longer to limit the number of lawmakers on the floor at one point.  Pelosi has privately rejected the idea of voting outside of the Capitol in past meetings, as have House GOP leaders, though lawmakers and aides have acknowledged that the situation is fluid. There are both security and logistical concerns about enacting a remote voting plan, which would fundamentally alter the institution.  The thinking among GOP leadership is that the House would also need to come up with legislation specifically on remote voting, which would redirect energy that lawmakers want to spend on the stimulus bill, according to a GOP aide.  Democratic leaders are expected to discuss the idea with their caucus on a conference call Thursday afternoon. And House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) directed his GOP committee leaders to take the temperature of their members on the issue, among other things, and will also host a conference-wide call Thursday to discuss it further.  The push to allow remote voting has amplified in the last 12 hours, with two lawmakers — Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Ben McAdams (D-Utah) — each testing positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  And it’s created a domino effect in the halls of Congress: Nearly two dozen members have decided to self-quarantine after potential exposure to the virus, including several who had close contact with Diaz-Balart and McAdams on the floor or in various gatherings on Friday before the House left for recess. Even the head of the Federal Aviation Administration had to go on lockdown after interacting with Diaz-Balart. The House physician’s office had been aggressive in tracking down potential contacts, compiling a list of people who were in close proximity and asking questions like whether they shook hands. From that list, the physician’s office then called each person individually to ask more questions, and further trace any interactions.   Lawmakers and staff were told to isolate themselves if they’d been in close quarters with either McAdams or Diaz-Balart, and any relevant offices were disinfected immediately.  For McAdams, who developed symptoms on Saturday night, all contacts were traced back to Thursday night. The Utah Democrat had been in contact with more than a dozen lawmakers and staff members on Friday night, socializing in one member’s office as the chamber awaited a vote in the House that wasn’t called until after midnight.  Diaz-Balart, meanwhile, was one of several deputy whips who participated in a 90-minute meeting in House Minority Whip Steve Scalise’s office on Friday, where they joined in on a Republican conference call and then watched Trump’s press conference on TV. Now, the core of the GOP whip’s team – including Scalise — will be sidelined in self-isolation until March 27.  But the hope among leadership is that the next stimulus package will be so bipartisan that their vote-counting operation — and even the House Rules Committee — won’t be as necessary as it would under normal circumstances. There’s also been discussions about “pre-whipping” legislation, according to Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.), one of the deputy whips who has been forced to self-quarantine.  “I very much want to vote on the next bill, but if they have to move ahead because it’s an emergency, I understand,” said Cole, who is also the top Republican on the House Rules Committee.   “So far, we haven’t lost many members [on coronavirus bills] and votes haven’t been so close,” he added, before acknowledging: “but they could be.”  One scenario floated by GOP lawmakers and aides: if they can pass legislation by unanimous consent — or if quarantined members have to miss the roll call vote — they can just formally enter into the record how they would have voted on the bill.  Even before the two lawmakers were diagnosed, there was growing anxiety among House members and staff about the inevitability of the virus spreading on Capitol Hill. Several staffers had already tested positive in both chambers. And while congressional leaders are taking steps to limit physical interactions during votes and meetings, the very nature of the job makes it nearly impossible for members to socially distance themselves. Everything from elevator buttons to the Capitol’s underground trains could become a hotbed for the virus.  The stress about potential infections in the Capitol complex has been compounded by the gravity of the legislative challenge ahead: a $1 trillion package being drafted in mere days with the entire economy hinging on the result.  “The mood is very very somber,” one senior Democratic aide said. “I think we realize we’re staring down one of the worst public health crises we’ve ever faced, and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.”  Reps. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and Van Taylor (R-Texas) led a bipartisan letter on Wednesday night calling for remote voting, with signatures from more than 50 members.  “When it comes to social distancing and public health best practices, Congress should be an example, not an exception,” Porter wrote on Twitter.  The idea of remote voting has also drawn attention in the Senate, despite McConnell dismissing the suggestion earlier in the week. As concerns grow across the Capitol about the rapid spread of the deadly virus — which is especially harmful to the elderly — more senators raised the possibility Thursday.   “I think it's important if we're talking about weeks or months,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said when asked about the possibility of the Senate working remotely. “We probably cannot keep operating all in one location.""  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), was looking at the possibility of allowing senators to vote via telephone in the case of a national emergency.   “Don't want to make the Senate telephonic, where you call in your vote. That would not be what the Senate's all about,” Schumer told NPR. “But during this emergency, we would allow that. We're looking at allowing that to happen. We think it's constitutionally allowed.""  Separately, Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) introduced a bill Thursday that would allow Senate leaders to institute remote voting for up to 30 days during a national crisis.   Some more senior senators, however, have dismissed the idea. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters on Wednesday: ""It is my understanding that there will not be remote voting.""  Senate Democrats, meanwhile, have opted for conference calls. And at least one member, Sen. Sherrod Brown, has decided to drive himself to Washington, instead of taking a plane. Senate Republicans are continuing to ignore advice from the CDC — and even Trump — and met in person for lunch Thursday.  McConnell is moving swiftly to pass a third phase of Congress’ response to the coronavirus — a trillion-dollar stimulus package with billions of dollars directed toward massive industries and small businesses and direct cash payments for Americans impacted by the virus.   “We’re not talking about so-called bailouts for firms that made reckless decisions...none of these firms — not corner stores, not pizza parlors, not airlines — brought this on themselves,” McConnell said Thursday. “We’re talking about loans which must be repaid.”  The Kentucky Republican is expected to introduce text of the GOP proposal later Thursday and then begin negotiations with Schumer.   House Democrats, meanwhile, are working on a counter-proposal, hoping to use that as a bargaining chip in discussions with the Senate. Schumer and Pelosi have repeatedly called for “four corner” negotiations between them, McConnell and McCarthy on the third stimulus package, an idea McConnell has dismissed.   McConnell has said the Senate would not leave until it passes the “Phase 3” legislation. But on the floor Thursday, the GOP leader said that wouldn’t be the last action Congress takes to address the coronavirus pandemic.   The administration has already asked for another $48 billion in emergency supplemental funding to address the crisis — a request McConnell said his chamber would immediately begin work on after moving the “phase 3” bill.   “Immediately after we pass this legislation, Congress must begin a bipartisan, bicameral appropriations process to address the administration’s new supplemental funding request,” McConnell said on the floor.   “We have to beat back this virus.”",Anxiety grows in Capitol as lawmakers weigh remote voting,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/congress-coronavirus-pandemic-137414,politico
"Last weekend, several major U.S. airports were crowded with travelers returning home from abroad, dealing with new enhanced health screenings due to the coronavirus pandemic and waiting in long lines which themselves raised public health risks. In some ways, they were the lucky ones. As airlines have canceled flights and countries have closed borders, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of Americans are stranded overseas, plotting how to get back and worrying about their families. And with the State Department having declared that Americans abroad should not expect repatriation flights, their options, beyond waiting out the pandemic, are few. On Thursday, State is expected to issue a level four travel advisory — its highest warning — telling Americans they should not travel internationally, and those abroad should come home or shelter in place. President Donald Trump also said on Thursday that the military is trying to help a large group of Americans stranded in Peru. ""We have a group of young people in Peru, and we're working on taking care of that with the military,"" he said, though he said the efforts shouldn't be considered an ""evacuation."" But Americans are stuck abroad in a number of other countries, including Guatemala. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville. She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned. “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO. The U.S. government hasn’t been much help either. In her first attempts to reach the embassy there, Marlin said she repeatedly got an emailed form response which offered no actionable help. When she called an emergency number, it simply played a recording with the same information. It wasn’t until she had a friend get in touch with the office of her member of Congress, Jim Cooper, that she was able to speak to a human at the embassy. But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Marlin, a retired Spanish teacher, said she has a place to stay and is in good health, but is feeling extreme strain amid an uncertain pathway back home. “Here I am in a pretty decent and safe situation, and I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. I can’t sleep, I’m so stressed out,” she said. “It’s the not knowing if and when I’m ever going to get out.” “Our government, all they seem to care about is the economy. And they are saying ‘don’t count on us to help you,'"" Marlin said. “It just seems like if Trump gave a damn, he’d be pressuring these governments to let us out.” Another woman stranded in Guatemala who said she is pregnant and in need of medical attention got an email from the embassy earlier on Thursday asking for more information, including medical proof and length of her pregnancy. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said that she was sold a plane ticket by Colombian airline Avianca, went to the airport and found it was closed. Avianca is now not answering her calls. A State Department spokesperson told POLITICO the agency is “considering all options to assist U.S. citizens” stuck in countries which have restricted air travel. But Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the agency says citizens stranded abroad shouldn't rely on the U.S. government to help them get home. ""While the department has evacuated hundreds of Americans, mostly from China, U.S. citizens shouldn’t rely on that as a way to get back instead of finding commercial flights,"" was State's message, according to Bloomberg. In Europe, the Trump administration’s travel ban left an opening for U.S. citizens to return home, but it and other constraints have pushed airlines there to the brink and led to thousands of cancelations. Jeffrey Ouellette, an IT worker from Austin, Texas, was stranded for a few days in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was visiting for a technical meeting with other software engineers. His flight from Vilnius to Helsinki, Finland, the first of four legs, was canceled by Finnair. He bought an expensive replacement through Lufthansa, which itself was canceled hours later. His frustration was boiling over this week, as airlines around the world continue to ask for financial assistance from governments. He said communication was spotty and he was repeatedly assured by airline representatives that his itinerary would be fine, only to see it crumble hours later. ""The whole system is broken,"" Ouellette said in an email to POLITICO. ""They don't deserve any bailout money if they can't fix this kind of stuff or have contingency plans in place to handle it."" Ouellette on Wednesday had made it to Frankfort, and is booked on a flight Thursday back to the states. He, too, said that the State Department had been “useless.” “The embassy was not helpful in any way,” he said. Some stranded travelers around the world banding together to strategize in a WhatsApp group called ""We're stuck (Americans),"" which Marlin said she's trying to join. The federal government’s response has led lawmakers to press for answers about what it's doing to help those Americans stuck overseas. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from nine Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help Americans stuck abroad. And, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home. He said he commends the State Department's efforts so far, but that ""Americans need greater support"" from the agency. ""I urge you to implement a response effort that is comprehensive, nimble, and timely and gets these Americans home as soon as possible,” Warner said. His spokesperson Nelly Decker said that the Virginia Democrat’s office is assisting upwards of 20 Virginians around the world “with the number growing almost hourly.” And lawmakers from New Jersey and Connecticut also reached out to State to say they're concerned that the agency isn't doing enough. ""It appears the United States is lagging behind our allies in terms of providing guidance and assistance,"" wrote Connecticut Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal. ""We urge you to exercise decisive leadership to provide immediate support for all Americans abroad to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of U.S. citizens and members of the global community.""","Stranded by canceled flights and travel bans, Americans abroad plead for help ",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/stranded-by-canceled-flights-and-travel-bans-americans-abroad-plead-for-help-137329,politico
"When America is at war, voters prefer not to swap presidents in the middle of battle. James Madison sailed to reelection after launching the War of 1812. Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the Civil War effectively ended at Appomattox, Va. In the shadow of World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt notched a third term. And the year after deploying troops to Iraq, George W. Bush defeated a war veteran, Democrat John Kerry. What if the enemy is invisible? Not a foreign country or the perpetrators of a brazen terrorist attack but a lethal disease that forces Americans to shelter in place indefinitely as their health, jobs and wages hang in the balance?  President Donald Trump is about to find out.  After fumbling his administration’s initial response to the devastating spread of COVID-19, and dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus for months as it spread from China, Trump has turned to the one concept that seems to work politically to overcome monumental challenges. Days after he declared a national emergency to help combat the pandemic, the New York businessman — who famously avoided the Vietnam draft multiple times — informed Americans on Wednesday that he is now “a wartime president” and said the country should prepare to fight. “Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,” Trump said at a White House briefing featuring Defense Secretary Mark Esper, U.S. Veterans Affairs chief Robert Wilkie and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force.  “Now it’s our time,” Trump continued, recalling the bravery America showed during World War II. “We must sacrifice together,because we are all in this together, and we will come through together.”  The wartime posture Trump has adopted in his tone and actions — he invoked the Defense Production Act on Wednesday, giving him the authority to influence private industries for emergency response purposes — marks an extraordinary new phase in his attempt to reclaim public support for his handling of the outbreak, and it raises questions about the potential measures Trump could take if the crisis spirals even further out of control.  “He is trying to create a sense of command and control and authority now that it’s obvious this is going to be a big challenge for the country,” said Tony Fratto, a White House aide to President George W. Bush.  Trump already has announced plans to dispatch two Navy hospital ships to New York Harbor and the West Coast to assist medical workers as they grapple with an influx of patients who have contracted COVID-19 and require treatment for the virus. The idea to deploy the two ships — the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort — gained steam after Trump last Friday issued his emergency declaration, which served as a green light for the Pentagon to begin taking more aggressive measures, according to a well-placed Defense Department official. Earlier on, there had been disagreements between Pentagon officials who wanted the administration to take “prudent measures,” such as travel restrictions, and other administration officials who wished to avoid rash decisions that could exacerbate political consequences and the economic downturn, the official said. Some White House officials were hesitant to enlist the Navy ships prematurely because the Comfort is undergoing maintenance that could take weeks. The Mercy, homeported in San Diego, could deploy within days.) The administration is also weighing the deployment of National Guard and Reserve troops at the federal level if conditions worsen in the coming weeks. While Pentagon officials have been meeting regularly on the virus pandemic for six weeks, major contingency planning began Tuesday at the Pentagon for enlisting guardsmen to deliver food and medical supplies to vulnerable populations, build temporary hospitals and retrofit facilities that could be used as hospitals, and work with police to enforce curfews like they have in coastal areas facing hurricanes. Nearly 20 governors have already activated National Guardsmen as they work to contain the rapidly spreading virus within their own states, and some have encouraged the president to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers in a further step to address the outbreak. “We believe the use of active duty Army Corps personnel would not violate federal law because this is a national disaster,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Sunday.  For now, the president’s greatest tool has been his rhetoric — particularly the ways in which he is using the war metaphor to boost public morale, reach supporters who remain dismissive of the worldwide pandemic and preemptively position himself as a president who rose to the occasion when voters weigh their options this November.  “President Trump has figured out that he has to put aside that proudly reckless style of governance that has been a staple of his presidency to date and adopt a posture that’s more typical of what presidents have done in crises,” said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University history professor. “At the same time, it’s not so much about calling himself a wartime president as it is about whether he matches the rhetoric with actions that make us safer,” Greenberg added.  To that end, Trump has enlisted the help of nearly everyone in his usual orbit — and beyond. According to two people familiar with the discussions, Trump has privately encouraged White House aides, friends and corporate executives to brainstorm creative steps they can take to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, keep health care professionals equipped to manage patients, and prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded and doctors overwhelmed.  Officials involved with the White House Office of American Innovation, for example, have spent the past several days conferring with major tech companies about how they can help distribute public service announcements related to COVID-19 and prevent severe supply shortages as consumers prepare for weeks of minimal social contact outside their homes and hospitals worry about the availability of protective personal equipment — including surgical masks, goggles and gloves — and office supplies.  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law who has spearheaded much of the outreach to Big Tech and other industries, is trying to marshal the private sector behind the president. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are pressuring GOP lawmakers to quickly pass a massive aid package of more than $1 trillion to stabilize the economy and soften a coronavirus-induced recession. And on Wednesday, Trump announced a mutual agreement with Canada to close the United States’ northern border to all nonessential traffic — a step that came as the president simultaneously weighs new restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump’s push to portray himself as a wartime leader has gained broad attention not because of his efforts to get the military, the government and private industries involved in responding to the coronavirus outbreak but because of the manner in which his entire administration and 2020 campaign appeared to adopt the same message overnight.  By Wednesday morning, the president, his allies and top administration officials were nearly all employing the rhetoric of war: encouraging sacrifice, promising better days ahead while acknowledging difficulties now, promoting patriotism and praising “bold” actions that might quickly return the country to normalcy. In the opinion pages of USA Today, Pence asked young and healthy Americans — some of whom spent last weekend going about their normal lives — to commit to making small sacrifices to keep others safe, writing, “There is no substitute for the action of the American people.” In an email blast Wednesday afternoon, the Republican National Committee praised Trump’s “wartime footing” and “whole of America” approach.  Senior Pentagon officials even advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former Defense Department official.  Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who is close to securing his spot as Trump’s Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, described the coronavirus outbreak in warlike terms. Speaking to supporters from his Delaware home after a series of primary victories Tuesday, Biden said, “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war.” “This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak,” Biden said. An outside adviser to the Trump campaign said the president’s 2020 team is hoping to capitalize on Trump’s new messaging strategy by launching a series of digital ads as soon as next week that highlight the president’s efforts to battle the “invisible enemy” — a phrase Trump has recently used to describe the respiratory syndrome, which can be deadly. A Trump campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.  “I wouldn’t mind seeing the Trump campaign expend some resources to communicate to his supporters that this is important,” Fratto said. “And if he has to use wartime language to do it, it’s in all of our interests to let him.”  If the president’s strategy works, he could have a shot at finding himself back on the speaker’s balcony for his second swearing-in ceremony next January, having won reelection because voters either cut him slack — something his predecessors who became wartime leaders appeared to benefit from even as economic turmoil persisted — or because the country recovered from a war their commander in chief led them through.  But there’s no guarantee Trump will meet the same fate as Madison, Lincoln, Roosevelt or Bush even if Americans agree that this is war.  Damaged by his handling of the war in Vietnam, President Lyndon Johnson stunned the country in 1968 when he announced he would not run for reelection.  And a quarter century later, President George H.W. Bush lost his bid for a second term to an Arkansan named Bill Clinton a year after the 1991 Gulf War.",Trump team’s new mission: Defend the ‘wartime president’,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-wartime-president-coronavirus-136892,politico
"Senate Republicans raced this week to introduce a trillion-dollar coronavirus stimulus package. Lobbyists for industries left reeling by the pandemic were hustling just as hard to shape it. The bill’s unveiling on Thursday capped an extraordinary week on K Street in which trade group after trade group asked Congress for sums that would have been unfathomable just a few weeks ago: $1.4 trillion to shore up the manufacturing sector, $4 billion for museums, $100 billion for doctors, nurses and hospitals. The Senate’s breakneck work to craft relief legislation this week has driven a frantic effort from industries crippled by measures taken to slow the spread of the virus as well those who have suffered less harm.  Not everyone got what they wanted in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s bill. But it wasn’t for lack of trying. “The Hill appears to be overwhelmed with people advocating for why they’re uniquely affected by the coronavirus epidemic,” said Sean Kennedy, the top lobbyist for the National Restaurant Association, which asked Congress for more than $300 million in relief this week. The restaurant association has mobilized its members to make tens of thousands of phone calls to their lawmakers. With many restaurants shuttered to slow the virus’ spread, their proprietors have had plenty of free time to become armchair lobbyists, Kennedy said. Other lobbyists have pleaded their clients’ cases to a handful of aides to top Republican senators, such as Erica Suares in McConnell’s office and Nick Rossi, who’s chief of staff to Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican. Some lobbyists for industries hit hard by the restrictions imposed by coronavirus were underwhelmed by what they got in McConnell’s bill: $58 billion in loans and loan guarantees for the airlines and another $150 billion for other “severely distressed sectors” of the economy, as well as nearly $300 billion in loans for small businesses. “We think it will be insufficient to stem the tide of job loss and closing of hotels that we’re seeing, candidly,” said Brian Crawford, the top lobbyist for the American Hotel & Lodging Association. “We’re hoping this is an opening salvo.” “It needs to be bigger,” said Tori Barnes, the top lobbyist for the U.S. Travel Association, even though she praised of the measures it includes. The hotel and travel industries personally pleaded their cases to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in a meeting at the White House on Tuesday, warning that the industry could shed millions of jobs in the coming weeks without significant help. The hotels asked for $150 billion in grants, along another $100 billion for the broader travel industry. McConnell’s bill would force hotels and the travel industry to compete with restaurants, casinos, distillers, moving companies and manufacturers — all of which have asked for aid this week — for $150 billion in loans. The legislation will need the support of Senate Democrats to pass, giving lobbyists for industries that feel they’ve gotten short shrift another chance to shape the bill before senators leave town in the coming days. Not every industry lost out in McConnell’s bill. The airlines, which asked for $59 billion in cash, loans and loan guarantees, got $58 billion in loans. Nick Calio, the head of Airlines for America, the industry’s trade group, said the money will keep the airlines going for five to six more months. “We have been hit the hardest of anyone by this,” he said in an interview. The National Retail Federation, meanwhile, secured a tweak to the Republican tax law that it had been pressing for since shortly after its passage in 2017. The fix would return an estimated $15 to $30 billion to hotels, restaurants and retailers that have upgraded their properties over the past two years but haven’t gotten a tax break for it, according to the trade group. David French, the National Retail Federation’s top lobbyist, said it was harder to lobby for the provision because he couldn’t meet with senators or their staffers in person, with the Hill mostly closed to visitors.  “It’s working, but it’s certainly not like in the old days,” he said. Lobbyists’ inability to meet with lawmakers and administration officials face to face hasn’t stopped them from trying to cash in on their connections. “Have you adjusted your consultant strategy and team lineup in light of the new Corona virus realities?” the lobbyist Terry Allen wrote in an email to potential clients on Thursday morning. “Fidelis Government Relations now has best in class reach into both VP Mike Pence and incoming White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.” The lobbying shop boasts the services of Pence’s former chief of staff, Bill Smith, as well as Wayne King, a former aide to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), whom Trump tapped earlier this month to become his next White House chief of staff, Allen wrote in the email, which was obtained by POLITICO. Pence is “quarterbacking the government's response to the Corona virus,” he added. In an interview, Allen said he’d already gotten a call from a potential client in response to the email. While the pitch emphasized the government’s coronavirus response, Allen said the pandemic wasn’t the focus of the firm’s lobbying efforts. “Regardless of whether the coronavirus is prominent, our lineup is strong,” he said.",Lobbyists make a mad dash to shape coronavirus stimulus package,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/lobbyists-coronavirus-stimulus-package-138519,politico
"The Department of Veterans Affairs is preparing to deploy 3,000 doctors, nurses and other emergency personnel — along with mobile hospitals and pharmacies — to bolster the nationwide effort to combat the coronavirus, Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie told POLITICO on Thursday. The VA, which runs 170 veterans hospitals and 135 community living centers around the country, is designated as the backup health system to the military in the event of war. But it is also authorized to assist in natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or in this case, a pandemic. The VA is ""preparing for a national call on this matter,"" Wilkie said in a telephone interview, likening the personnel to military reservists who can be called up by the president at any time. ""They know that they can be deployed anywhere in the country. Just like the reserves, their physicals are up to date, their shots are up to date. That prepares them to launch when called upon."" Asked if he has any timeline on when they might be needed, Wilkie said, ""we haven't come to that point yet."" But he said the agency is gaming out where they might be most needed. For example, ""city X has this happen, what is the request from the governor, and how do you respond to that governor's request that comes through,"" Wilkie said. One of the main purposes of the National Disaster Medical System, as it is known, is ""to assist state and local authorities in responding to medical and public health effects of major disasters and emergencies,"" according to the VA. This crisis poses numerous challenges, including the fact that some of the VA's emergency medical personnel are likely already treating patients with the virus — and the number of cases on veterans hospitals are expected to grow. That is a double-edged sword because it means some already have experience with the outbreak but they also might be needed where they are. ""They've been responding to natural disasters, so that's their forte,"" Wilkie said. ""But they're also working in hospitals now where they're dealing with this virus."" The emergency cadre includes ""doctors, nurses, psychologists, engineers, nutritionists, police,"" Wilkie said. ""In addition to that, we are able to provide a mobile hospital. We're able to provide command posts. We're able to provide nutrition centers, medical vans, mobile pharmacies to support those needs."" Beyond providing additional medical personnel, if necessary the VA health system could also make available extra hospital capacity. ""If the president so chooses,"" Wilkie said, ""we would augment civilian capabilities when it comes to medical space available."" In the meantime, the VA is trying to minimize the spread of the virus in its own medical facilities, including barring family visits, reducing routine appointments, and delaying dental and elective surgeries. The steps are all designed to cut down on social interaction but also free up resources for what is expected to be an increase of the virus among veterans. ""We were the first system in the country to start triaging people before they even entered,"" Wilkie said. Barring visitors for elderly veterans ""is a terrible thing because the majority of those 7,800 who are in those living centers come from World War II and Korea. And we had to make the painful choice in order to protect them,"" Wilkie said. So far, Wilkie reports that 85 veterans ""we know of"" have the virus. Of those, 50 are recuperating at home. ""They didn't need to be admitted to our hospitals,"" he said. But he said ""we expect a lot more"" veterans suffering from the coronavirus. ""We'll see a jump in the next few days, as the rest of the country.""","VA secretary: VA preparing to deploy 3,000 medical personnel for virus response",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/veterans-affairs-coronavirus-138513,politico

"The $1 trillion proposal Senate Republicans unveiled Thursday night represents one of the most dramatic bailouts in American history, picking winners and losers during one of the worst economic crises in decades. Airlines, financial markets, small businesses and hospitals would all get a boost under the nearly 250-page bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rolled out less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump signed a second multibillion-dollar coronavirus response measure. Individual taxpayers and families would get checks of up to $1,200 or $2,400, depending on income. Senate Democrats have introduced their own $750 billion proposal, and House Democrats are working to craft their version of a massive measure to shore up the economy, stressing that the package should include tens of billions of dollars in additional emergency money for federal agencies, as well as state and local governments. Here's who would benefit from the Senate GOP plan: The bill would provide the battered industry with $58 billion in loans and loan guarantees, plus a holiday from paying fuel tax. Passenger air carriers could borrow up to a total of $50 billion, and cargo air carriers would get up to $8 billion. Those loans would come with some strings, including limits on compensation for executives. But Democrats had sought additional restrictions, like rules against stock buybacks. While the total should satisfy airlines, the industry had wanted half to be grants, rather than loans. A pot of $300 billion would be devoted to pumping cash to small businesses in the form of “loans” employers wouldn’t have to pay back as long as they maintain their payrolls during the emergency. Those rules would be retroactive to March 1, to entice employers to rehire workers who have already been laid off this month. While no business could receive more than $10 million, the size of each loan would be calculated based on a business’ average expenses from last year, including payroll, mortgage payments and debt obligations. Small businesses would also be allowed to use existing SBA loans for costs that aren’t usually covered, like paid sick leave, salaries, mortgage payments and supply chain disruptions. The maximum amount a business could get in so-called “express loans” would increase from $350,000 to $1 million. Hospitals bracing for a wave of coronavirus cases in the coming weeks would get some temporary relief from Medicare cuts that have shrunk payments by 2 percent under the safety net program that covers health care costs for older Americans. Providers would also get a 15 percent Medicare payment bump for coronavirus patients. The provisions would likely send billions of dollars to hospitals, although they fall far short of the $100 billion the industry is demanding. Besides a boost for hospitals, the measure Republicans have pitched would help prop up the rest of the U.S. health care system as the virus rages, including sending more than $1.3 billion to community health centers, allowing labs to develop emergency tests and forcing insurers to cover vaccines. The measure would fix a mistake in the 2017 tax law that keeps restaurants, hotels and stores from immediately writing off certain renovation costs. The National Retail Federation estimates the change would return up to $15 billion a year to the three industries, which are among the hardest hit as people stay home because of the coronavirus and officials curtail or shutter those businesses altogether. Most American adults would get checks of up to $1,200, plus $500 for every child. But people who made more than $99,000 in 2018 would get zilch, as well as couples who file joint tax returns and make a total of more than $198,000 a year. As businesses clamor for liquidity amid mounting layoffs and decreased demand for services, the Senate bill would free up cash through a host of tax relief provisions. Social Security taxes would be on pause for employers for the rest of the year, but they would have to pay back that money in 2021 and 2022. Employers could apply recent operating losses to previous tax years, get quicker refunds and deduct more from the interest paid on their debt. Faster reimbursements would go out to business owners forced to give workers paid time off during the outbreak. Instead of making employers wait to receive tax credits, they would be able to deduct anticipated credits from their normal filings or get a direct credit in advance. The bill provides some relief for students receiving financial aid. Students would not have to repay their student loans or Pell Grants if they drop out in the middle of the semester because of the coronavirus. Colleges would also be allowed to continue to pay students under the Federal Work-Study program if they are unable to work because their employer closed due to the outbreak. Federal student loan payments, including interest, would automatically be suspended for at least three months. The bill would also give Education Secretary Betsy DeVos the power to defer payments for an additional three months beyond that. The suspended payments would still count as payments for borrowers on track for loan forgiveness under federal programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Companies that were required to pay a one-time tax on profits they brought home under the 2017 tax overhaul will be able to recover tax over-payments. Allowing companies to recover that money will help them deal with one of the biggest problems of the crisis: Maintaining liquidity. The Treasury Department would be temporarily allowed to guarantee money market mutual funds, which are critical instruments for short-term financing. The measure would revive an authority Treasury last used during the 2008 Wall Street meltdown to stop runs on the funds. Toby Eckert, Michael Stratford, Kathryn A. Wolfe, Bernie Becker, Tanya Snyder, Zachary Warmbrodt and Susannah Luthi contributed to this report.

"Hospitals bracing for a flood of coronavirus cases are demanding a federal bailout.  They want $100 billion in the next relief package along with targeted changes to tax laws they say are needed to free up the money before the first surge of cases sweeps in. Senate Republicans' draft trillion dollar stimulus proposal didn't deliver on the request but did give the industry two important wins: temporarily freezing a 2 perent reduction in Medicare payments that was mandated under budget sequestration and boosting Medicare payments 15 percent for coronavirus-diagnosed cases. But with supplies tightening and beds already at a premium in some regions, investor-owned and nonprofit hospitals are lining up for more, along with airlines, hotels, retailers and other industries. The 1.5 trillion-dollar hospital industry drives one-third of the nation's health care spending, and typically collects much higher pay from private insurers than from Medicaid and Medicare. Elective procedures, like colonoscopies and cataract surgery, which the Trump administration wants suspended, make up some of their most profitable lines of business. Now, with a flood of coronavirus cases threatening to swamp emergency departments and intensive care units, hospitals want help as they transition to fighting the pandemic. It's a moment of solidarity for massive national for-profit and tax-exempt chains whose some executives rake in multi-million dollar salaries and small independent community and rural hospitals. The $100 billion ask from the American Hospital Association — joined by the American Medical Association and American Nurses Association — is built around the argument that it's better to get federal assistance before the full force of the pandemic hits, to fortify a health system that lacks the beds, necessary equipment and the workforce to deal with a pandemic. Hospital lobbyists want a massive infusion of cash for specialized gear to protect workers, child care for doctors and nurses and to offset revenue lost from the suspension of elective surgeries and other new costs. As prominent employers in many congressional districts, hospitals are used to being heard, and lawmakers are signaling that they’re ready to step in. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is closely aligned with New York’s hospital lobbies, vowed he’d fight for a “Marshall Plan for hospitals” Schumer’s calling for $400 billion to purchase equipment and deal with the expected swell in patients. The money would also address cash-flow issues for facilities that will take a major financial hit postponing lucrative elective procedures like joint replacements. The hospitals' lobbying push rapidly intensified this week as government officials presented sobering forecasts of staggering caseloads and reports out of virus-ravaged Italy showed overwhelmed hospitals rationing care — a harbinger of what could happen to the more unwieldy, patchwork U.S. system. Millions of Americans remain uninsured and some of the most impoverished states don’t have coverage for some low-income residents because they haven’t expanded Medicaid. But even in states that did, projections show the health system could be overwhelmed in a matter of weeks. Colorado, Kentucky, Massachusetts and Ohio have suspended elective surgeries to try and keep beds open.  The cancellation of these procedures began, for some, even before Surgeon General Jerome Adams urged them to do so over the weekend. Many patients simply heeded public officials' advice to stay home. Now, many hospitals are in limbo, waiting for a potential surge of Covid-19 patients. What this means for their financial situation varies. Small, rural hospitals, in particular, were already close to going broke before the virus hit, but they’re also used to operating on small margins. After years of consolidation, some big health systems in urban areas have built up huge overhead as their hospitals and specialty centers see a massive drop-off in referrals and appointments for pricey procedures. Meanwhile, hospitals in some hard-hit areas are grappling with more infected patients, coupled with a lack of personalized equipment to keep frontline nurses, doctors and other staff safe. “We’ve had a dramatic shift in our area in the last three to four days,” Cassie Sauer, president and CEO of the Washington State Hospital Association, said earlier this week. “The number of patients has grown exponentially.” Those hospitals that haven’t seen cases yet are ramping up for the pandemic. The waiting game raises questions about how long some hospitals can they keep paying their staff while turning away paying business at an ever-accelerating pace. Jose Sanchez, CEO of the Chicago safety net Norwegian American Hospital, said he’s got enough cash to make the next two payrolls. For now, he’s trying to make sure all expected billings come in on time — especially from private Medicaid plans where he’s seen a delay as insurers have their staff working from home. “If you were in a different business, you’d be laying people off, but that’s just the opposite of the situation we’re in,” said Charlie Shields, CEO of Truman Medical Centers in Kansas City, Mo., who’s canceled elective surgeries and seen a sharp drop in admissions. He hasn’t run out of cash yet and said they can run a while -- but he wants a federal funding boost in the meantime. And with the supply shortage of protective gear intensifying, Shields said he's seizing any chance to stock up on inventory, further driving up costs. Scott Christensen, CEO of Delta Regional Medical Center in Mississippi’s impoverished Delta region, said he expects the coronavirus to arrive at his doorstep any minute. Cases have been confirmed in neighboring counties and he’s setting up a drive-through testing site — mostly for free, since Mississippi didn’t expand Medicaid and imposes some of the strictest limits on who gets covered through the program. Christensen shuttered the hospital’s cardiac rehabilitation center and sleep center, and patients generally have stopped showing up. But he hasn't furloughed any workers — yet. “It’s been a really bad month financially,” he said. “But we’ll have to get through it.” Still, the situation isn’t equally dire for all, and some hospitals are used to empty beds. A study from Congress’ Medicare advisers found that most rural hospitals only have about 40 percent of their acute care beds occupied on a given day. Since coronavirus hospitalizations so far skew elderly, some may see a financial boost — especially if Congress goes through with the Medicare sequester freeze. Wall Street is sparking some of the financial concern. A J.P. Morgan analysis first reported by Bloomberg painted a grim picture for two major for-profit hospital chains — Community Health Systems and Tenet Healthcare Corp. — that also hold major debt and need to keep up their planned revenue from scheduled procedures. Chip Kahn, CEO of Federation of American Hospitals, which represents for-profit systems, said essentially the pandemic could upend some hospitals’ entire business models, by replacing expensive inpatient procedures with intensive coronavirus treatment. He warned, some big-name chains “could really be in trouble.” The average surgical hospital stay brings in nearly $44,000, compared to under $20,000 for a non-surgical stay. And the demographics will change, as coronavirus brings in more Medicaid and uninsured patients. He noted that for the seriously ill, hospitalizations rack up costs quickly, and as coronavirus spreads the cases may not all be covered with commercial insurance. That said, analysis from J.P. Morgan this week found 87 percent of responding hospitals said they hadn’t yet racked up extra staffing or supply costs due to coronavirus. The respondents said they also had not yet seen “measurable” deferments of scheduled procedures due to coronavirus fears, although that could be changing rapidly. Fitch, a ratings agency, said not-for-profit hospitals and health systems should have “sufficient financial cushion to absorb an increase in operating costs"" but warned, that some smaller facilities are at heightened risk, and the coming economic disruption will increase pressure on all providers.",Hospitals bid for $100 billion in next coronavirus package,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/hospitals-coronavirus-funding-138383,politico
"President Donald Trump has replaced a scheduled in-person gathering of G-7 world leaders at Camp David with a videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic, the White House announced on Thursday. “In order for each country to focus all of its resources on responding to the health and economic challenges of COVID-19 and at President Trump’s direction,” White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said in a statement, “National Economic Council Director and U.S. Sherpa for the 2020 G7 Larry Kudlow has informed his Sherpa colleagues that the G7 Leaders’ Summit the U.S. was set to host in June at Camp David will now be done by video-teleconference.” Trump spoke with leaders from the seven nations this week via videoconference in what Deere said was the first time the group has met virtually. “The White House also informed the other G7 members that in order to continue close coordination, the President will convene the Leaders’ via video teleconference in April and May just as he did this week,” Deere added. The White House said the decision to hold the meeting via videoconference was made so that member nations could devote the resources it would have used to attend the June meeting to help their own countries. The decision comes as a number of G-7 nations, including Italy and Germany, have closed their borders. Others, like Canada and the U.S., have tightened travel restrictions for their residents. Trump originally decided in October to host this year’s conference at his Trump National Doral Miami resort, but hastily scrapped the plans after drawing criticism from allies and members of his own party who said he was using his office to promote his personal properties.",G-7 meeting replaced with teleconference due to coronavirus,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/g7-meeting-replaced-with-teleconference-due-to-coronavirus-138338,politico
"Doctors and nurses across the U.S. say shortages of masks and other safety gear are putting them and their coworkers at risk, despite White House assurances that the supply gaps from the coronavirus pandemic are being addressed by policy fixes and donations from good Samaritans. As health providers take to social media to plead with the federal government to make more gear available, and state officials hold press conferences begging other industries to donate masks to their local hospitals, President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence insisted from the White House podium Thursday that plenty of masks are available now. “We put a priority at the president's direction on making sure health care services through America have the protection to keep themselves and their family safe,” Pence said, saying that the bill Congress approved this week lifting legal liability for masks not previously approved for hospital use will allow tens of millions produced by the company 3M and others to be sold for the treatment of coronavirus patients. “We vastly increased the supply of medical masks and we'll continue to put a priority on making sure we are calling on industry at every level, calling on major suppliers that the president met with this week to make sure those equipment are there,” he said. Guidance from the CDC released Monday that bluntly acknowledged the shortages tells another story. That advice, which health care workers tell POLITICO they consider dangerous, includes reusing respirator masks between different patient visits, using masks that have passed their expiration date, and even constructing “homemade” masks out of a bandana or scarf. With medical workers already getting sick and dying from the disease in Washington state and other coronavirus hot spots, health care workers tell POLITICO they’re terrified for themselves and their patients. “It’s the scariest thing about going to work every day,” said Sean Petty, a pediatric ER nurse and member of the New York State Nurses Association. Petty told POLITICO that his public sector hospital in the Bronx implemented what he described as “extreme rationing” of masks this week. Petty also noted the shortage has forced his hospital to only provide masks to patients who have severe enough symptoms to qualify to be tested for coronavirus — which could be risky because the transmission of the virus from asymptomatic patients is not fully understood. Despite the ramped-up domestic production the Trump administration touted Thursday, those on the ground say it's unclear when those supplies will make it into medical providers’ hands. The 500 million masks the federal government ordered this week, for example, may not be delivered for another 18 months. Jamie Lucas, executive director of the Wisconsin Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, said Thursday that none of his members have heard from their employers that more masks are on the way. “They're preparing as if what they have is what they’ll have,"" he said, including rationing and reusing masks in potentially unsafe ways. A 2006 report by the National Academies of Sciences’ Institute of medicine both predicted the current shortage and warned against the repeated use of a single mask. “These devices will be in short supply if a pandemic strikes,” the report found. “And there is currently no simple, reliable way to decontaminate these devices that would enable people to safely use them more than once.” A registered nurse at a large nonprofit hospital in Manhattan, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing her job, told POLITICO she was given an online training last week about the protective gear she needed to wear when caring for potential coronavirus patients and that the training stressed the use of an n-95 respirator mask. But when she was called in this week to assist with a patient showing flu-like symptoms, she was told by management that a regular surgical mask was adequate protection — echoing the recent shift in the CDC's guidelines. Despite deep misgivings, she spent hours in the room with the patient. “I’m worried about myself and my colleagues being put at risk, and I’m also worried that we’re not doing nearly enough to prevent transmission from infected patient to staff to other patients who may be immunocompromised,” she said. Nurses and doctors are not the only ones at risk. Lucas told POLITICO that hospital cleaning staff have been directed to clean rooms that held coronavirus patients without a mask in order to conserve them for medical providers. Even with new data showing the virus can survive on surfaces for hours, the unprotected cleaners are expected to turn over the rooms for new patients much more quickly. As of Thursday afternoon, hundreds of thousands of health care workers had signed an online petition demanding the government do more to ensure an adequate supply of masks and other protective equipment. Yet federal aid has been slow to arrive. On Wednesday, the Trump administration invoked the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of desperately needed hospital equipment. Though the White House had discussed taking this step for weeks, it has not yet done the required assessment of what supplies are most in need, meaning those items may take months to actually make it to the front lines. Trump also indicated he was in no hurry to move forward, tweeting this week that he only signed the act “should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future.” Many states say that “worst case scenario” has arrived. On Thursday, Massachusetts lawmakers wrote to the Trump administration saying they had only received 10 percent of the 750,000 masks and other equipment they requested weeks ago, and warned that the state's hospitals are ""facing or are imminently anticipating shortages."" The office of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, whose state has more than 900 confirmed cases, said Thursday there are still ""substantial shortages"" of protective gear despite two shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile. Inslee's office said the federal government hasn't filled the state's most recent request for tens of thousands of additional N-95 respirators, surgical masks and face shields. The stockpile of medical equipment, originally designed for use during a nuclear disaster or biological attack, was never intended to last during a prolonged pandemic. Officials in Ohio say what they‘ve received from the stockpile falls far short of hospitals' needs.  “Ohio has received our full allocation from the national strategic stockpile,” Tamara McBride, the chief of the Bureau of Health Preparedness at the Ohio Department of Health, told reporters earlier this week. “If we do not take conservation steps now, we will not have health care workers that are protected to care for the most sick.” Like other states, Ohio’s leaders have asked veterinarians and dentists to donate masks and other materials to hospitals. They have also asked food service workers to donate latex gloves. A hospital in Atlanta has even had to rely on a donation of masks, gloves, and gowns from a TV medical drama being filmed nearby.  Pence lavished praise Thursday on the construction industry for responding to the federal government's call to donate masks, but did not say how many have been obtained that way. And as recently as Tuesday, the Association of General Contractors said the administration had not consulted with it about this request, and the group worried that the loss of masks would put their own workers at risk. ""Without those masks, they would be immediately out of work, because they can‘t work without masks,"" said Vice President of Public Affairs Brian Turmail. AGC added Thursday that HHS had asked the group to send an inventory of all their members' available safety equipment, including masks and protective suits, but no donations have yet been made. ""We are going to ask our chapters tomorrow morning to collect this information and share it with HHS,” Turmail said. In the meantime, all sectors of the medical community are doing whatever they can to conserve masks. Medical students, for example, have halted their clinical rotations, and hospitals have suspended elective procedures. Janis Orlowski, chief health care officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, told reporters on a call Thursday that the lack of masks and other personal protective equipment remains the “number one issue” she’s hearing from teaching hospitals battling coronavirus. “Are we worried about this? Yes, we are,” she said. “We are really going to have to push to get more PPE into the hands of our health care workers.” Gavin Bade contributed reporting.",Medical staff describe shortages and rationing of masks as White House assures they’re available ’now’,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-medical-supplies-138290,politico
"For many Americans right now, the scale of the coronavirus crisis calls to mind 9/11 or the 2008 financial crisis—events that reshaped society in lasting ways, from how we travel and buy homes, to the level of security and surveillance we’re accustomed to, and even to the language we use. Politico Magazine surveyed more than thirty smart, macro thinkers this week, and they have some news for you: Buckle in. This could be bigger. A global, novel virus that keeps us contained in our homes—maybe for months—is already reorienting our relationship to government, to the outside world, even to each other. Some changes these experts expect to see in the coming months or years might feel unfamiliar or unsettling: Will nations stay closed? Will touch become taboo? What will become of restaurants? But crisis moments also present opportunity: more sophisticated and flexible use of technology, less polarization, a revived appreciation for the outdoors and life’s other simple pleasures.

"National security staffers are fretting that confusing telework guidance has left an overabundance of employees showing up to the office amid a global pandemic.  While health officials have encouraged Americans to work from home if possible as the coronavirus spreads through the United States, Pentagon and intelligence community officials have sent mixed signals about what their own staffers should do, according to three national security officials and a top senator who oversees the intelligence community. As a result, these staffers said, some Defense Department civilian employees who don’t need to be at work are still coming in every day, raising the risk that the virus will spread through the Pentagon’s ranks. “You go outside the building and every other workplace is saying go home, but there are quite a few people in the building that are not mission-essential,” said one defense official. At issue is the question of how national security and intelligence officials who feel they need to self-quarantine but can’t work from home are supposed to get time off. Agency spokespeople said there are various options for employees in such scenarios, but several officials said these offerings have been insufficient and poorly messaged. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, picked up on these complaints and recently wrote Defense Secretary Mark Esper, expressing concern. “These personnel should not face uncertainty or obstacles in their efforts to preserve our individual or collective health,” he wrote in a letter obtained by POLITICO. Warner said the instructions “have ambiguity that is creating confusion and anxiety,” calling the issue a “matter of urgent priority.” The Pentagon defended its approach, pointing out that its guidelines are consistent with government-wide instructions issued by the Office of Personnel Management. Pentagon spokesperson Alyssa Farah said employees can use paid “weather and safety leave” — paid time off when employees can't safely get to work — if they want to self-quarantine yet are not eligible to telework. Another Pentagon spokesperson added that OPM guidance lets agencies give advanced sick leave to employees who run out of it, noting that employees can also request an advance on their annual paid time off allotment. But several staffers said such instructions have been inconsistent and incomplete. Another U.S. official said some workers at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency — which analyzes images captured by America’s spy satellites — have been directed to use sick leave if they need to quarantine themselves and can’t work from home. NGA employees have a finite amount of sick leave, and the official feared the directions would discourage people from staying away from the office even if they felt they could expose others to the coronavirus.  The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter on the record, called the instructions “dangerous and unfair.” A spokesperson for the agency said officials had approved weather and safety leave for employees who can’t telework. Teleworking is a challenge for many defense and intelligence officials, since many have to handle secret material or work on secure networks. It’s a particular problem for lower-level staffers who do not have the equipment to work remotely, or who must physically be in the building to check classified emails and access secret servers. “It’s just very difficult to do our job without being in the building,” a third government official told POLITICO. But because close contact with others can spread the virus, national security agencies are working to dramatically reduce how many people are in the building at any moment. The Pentagon is urging all of its 23,000 employees who can work from home to do so if possible, and looking to acquire additional devices to enable remote access to the Pentagon’s secret and classified networks. Many offices will “voluntarily go to minimal staffing,” including staggering shifts in the building “to limit cross-interaction.” At the NGA, for instance, a spokesperson said the agency is aiming to have half as many people in its offices as would be there normally. And many staffers at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence are also doing their work from home, according to two people close to the agency. An ODNI spokesperson said the agency is also using staggered shifts to limit how many people are present at any specific time. Still, coronavirus cases have been creeping up throughout the Defense Department community in recent days. As of March 18, 51 service-members had tested positive for the virus, along with nine civilians, 10 military family members and 11 contractors. Several National Security Agency employees have also put themselves in quarantine after returning home from countries with large coronavirus outbreaks, according to the U.S. government official. An intelligence official said that none of those employees have tested positive for the virus. At the Pentagon, some civilians are choosing to come to work instead of taking leave because they can’t afford to lose a paycheck, defense officials said. While the Pentagon has urged its employees to telework and restricted Pentagon visitors, it still hasn’t imposed its most severe limitations on in-person work. Right now, Esper has only increased the Health Protection Condition level to BRAVO, or “moderate,” meaning at-risk civilians who do not have telework agreements must take sick leave rather than administrative leave in order to work from home, defense officials said. In the Navy, for example, civilian employees can take an advance on their annual paid leave, according to a spokesperson. Employees without symptoms can also use “weather and safety” leave to telework, the spokesperson added. That arrangement might change if Esper raised the Health Protection Condition level to CHARLIE, or “substantial.” Individual telework agreements are also subject to the approval of direct supervisors, defense officials said, creating another potential complication. “If someone wants to get a telework agreement, they can ask their supervisor. If the supervisor denies it because he/she needs the worker at the office, then they will have to take sick leave if they don’t want to come to work,” said another defense official. Before the crisis, many supervisors at the Pentagon looked unfavorably on telework agreements because they were frequently abused, the defense official said, adding that some may have been reluctant to grant them “as a threshold matter.” The result is that civilians are still coming to work every day who are not “mission essential,” said the first defense official, noting that the situation is causing “frustration.”  “Is this a national emergency or not? Clearly, it’s not,” the official said.", ‘Confusion and anxiety’ at Pentagon over telework guidance,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/pentagon-telework-coronavirus-137731,politico
"It would cost the U.S. up to $2 billion to adjust the country's voting processes in ways that would allow November's election to go on, even if the coronavirus pandemic persists, according to a new think tank study. The cost would come from implementing nationwide changes like universal voting by mail, expanded online voter registration and increased public health safeguards at polling places, the authors at the Brennan Center for Justice estimate. The analysis comes as the pandemic wreaks havoc on the primary election calendar, with several states opting to postpone their contests weeks, if not months, to slow the spread of the disease. ""There is no question that the Covid-19 pandemic presents a difficult and, in many ways, unprecedented challenge to America’s elections,"" the analysis says. The costs include up to $1.4 billion for every state to ensure universal voting by mail, according to the preliminary estimate. Of that, as much as $593 million would be spent on additional postage costs, while $240 million would go toward bolstering absentee ballot processing. In addition, the study says it would cost almost $272 million to maintain existing in-person voting systems, including for people without access to mail or the internet. The bulk of that figure, an estimated $140 million, would hire more poll workers and boost their pay. The study estimates that another nearly $86 million would need to be funneled to states to ""adopt and bolster online voter registration systems,"" while $252 million would be spent on raising public awareness.",Think tank estimates $2 billion cost to carry out November election during pandemic,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/2020-election-cost-coronavirus-138232,politico
"The coronavirus outbreak could close down many U.S. classrooms for the rest of the school year, blowing a hole in kids' math and reading skills, tanking test scores for years to come and making it a scramble for some to even finish high school. Kansas schools that have shuttered through the end of the school year likely are just the first in line, with governors in California, New Jersey and Ohio signaling the same is possible for their states. Many schools initially announced closures for a short period, but with warnings from the White House growing more dire, shutdowns are extending — even though the CDC says it's not certain that will halt the spread of the virus. The CDC has said in its updated guidance for schools that closures of eight weeks or more may affect community spread, but hand-washing and home isolation have had more impact. Testing is being postponed or scrapped entirely as schools rush instead to gear up for remote learning and figure out how to distribute school meals. As of Thursday morning, an estimated 43.9 million school students were enrolled in at least 95,000 public or private schools that are closed now, are scheduled to close or were closed and reopened, according to Education Week. The closures could mean students who are struggling to read at their grade level are promoted anyway and could struggle for years to come. Plans for college could be upended for high school seniors counting on their final semester to rack up credits and take one more stab at the SAT. For students from low-income families, who could have trouble getting to the free or subsidized food many of them rely on, the gap between them and their wealthier counterparts is all but sure to grow. But all students will suffer. Schools in other countries have smoothly moved to remote learning, but the U.S. faces barriers not only in computer access but getting those services to students quickly and equitably. “We know kids in low socioeconomic communities lose two to three months in reading and math skills over a normal summer. With schools letting out now and potentially not returning before the end of the school year, learning loss may be profound,” said Betsy Zorio, vice president of U.S. programs and advocacy at Save the Children. “Summer programs to mitigate further loss and after-school programs in the fall will be critical to help them catch up — and reach those critical milestones of third grade reading and math proficiency.” The disruptions are happening just ahead of testing time, adding to the turmoil. The Education Department last week announced it would consider one-year waivers of school test requirements, but there is some interest in a national testing waiver. The Council of Chief State School Officers has been advocating for speeding up the process for states to obtain waivers, and says it looks like it will happen. Carissa Moffat Miller, the group’s executive director, told reporters Wednesday that such a decision would allow school officials faced with an unprecedented crisis to focus on “more critical education, health and nutrition concerns.” In Louisiana, Gov. Bel Edwards announced he would shelve standardized tests for students. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called off state testing at all grade levels on Tuesday. And New York halted preparations for this year’s standardized assessments for grades 3-8, suspended shipments of paper-based English language arts exams and postponed the opening of its computer-based testing portal that had been scheduled for March 23. Test scores will drop and it’s “only a question of how much,” said Douglas Harris, a Tulane economics professor and founding director of the Education Research Alliance for New Orleans who studied the effects of school reforms after Katrina in 2005. “There's no way in which this is going to be helpful to students academically.” Harris found that test scores for fourth grade students, who were in New Orleans before Katrina in 2005 and returned in the spring of 2006, dipped in every subject except social studies, and the dip continued in 2007. He attributes the outcomes mostly to the disruption and trauma. This situation should be more manageable academically because many schools are still operating, even if virtually, so there will be less trauma and the disruption may be shorter. But he still sees similarities between the two events: Both forced students from their schools, and while today’s students aren’t fleeing their homes, the coronavirus is shoving students into social isolation — and it’s still scary. “Schools will do the best they can under the circumstances, but they don't have practice in this,” Harris said. “So teachers are going to be winging it and students will almost certainly not learn as much as they were in the past. And that's what we saw with Katrina.” The virus has cascading consequences in store for the education system, Moffat Miller said, consequences that won’t vanish if and when the virus stops circulating. Some students are better equipped to learn outside of the classroom than other students. States and school systems face enormous costs. Testing and other systems designed to make schools accountable will need to be modified. “And there will inevitably be questions that we haven't even thought of yet that we're going to need to address,” Moffat Miller said. For high school students headed to college, it's meant trying to stay on top of shifting and confusing college testing plans. Earlier this week, the College Board announced it was exploring options to have students take much-anticipated AP exams at home ""depending on the situation in May,"" with more information to come. The exams are the end point for a year's study of college-level material and high scores can be used in some instances for college credits. ACT on Monday announced that its test scheduled for April 4 will now take place on June 13 instead. The College Board announced it was canceling the SAT scheduled for May 2. In Kansas, where schools are expected to be out through June, the Department of Education’s continuous learning task force, comprised of educators, has worked on guidance to help schools. They are working to move education online, assist students without access to online tools, provide for at-risk students and those with individual education plans and distribute meals for students who need them. “We're looking at special ed students and what requirements we have for them and to get their best learning in place. We're looking at seniors who are trying to graduate and are in panic mode because they don't know how they will. We're looking at all of those things so that learning will continue,” said Marcus Baltzell, spokesperson for the Kansas National Education Association. He added, “We're essentially redesigning education in Kansas and we're doing it in three days.” Washington state recently started working on potential criteria for a streamlined process to ensure that students who are on track to graduate this year can actually do so. Student closures, even from vacations, always have high costs for learning, said Andreas Schleicher, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s education director and head of the Programme for International Student Assessment, which measures high school students' performance internationally. But he said the U.S. can look to other countries, such as China, where students were quickly moved to an organized learning environment online. Some teachers in France, he said, have been working with their students on Zoom, which gives them a way to connect even if it’s not an education platform. “I think the U.S. can really learn from those countries that have been able to manage this in a matter of weeks or days to bridge that kind of school-closure gap,” he said. “So I think this is not an insurmountable kind of challenge.” The U.S. is different from other parts of the world, however, in that its systems are decentralized, with no national standards or curriculum, said Ary Amerikaner, vice president for P-12 policy, practice and research at The Education Trust. “While each state has common standards, individual educators may be using different instructional materials and a variety of electronic resources at their disposal,” she wrote in an email. The other issue is digital equity. “Many of our schools were not set up for remote learning, and, where it does exist, there are concerns about how equitable access and opportunities are for our most vulnerable students,” she wrote. Millions of students in the U.S. already struggle with what’s known as the “homework gap” because they don’t have broadband internet at home, and school closures will worsen the digital divide for these students, typically from low-income and minority households. Senate Democrats are pushing to address this issue as part of a legislative response to the pandemic, and the Federal Communications Commission is working with Congress to secure funds for programs to support in-home equipment for affected students. Extra support from states and the federal government is “essential” now, said Keith Krueger, CEO of CoSN, the Consortium for School Networking. The FCC should also strengthen and offer more flexibility from its educational technology program, E-Rate, and provide mobile hotspots and broadband connections to rural and other unconnected students and teachers, he said in a statement. Meanwhile, the Education Department, states and districts should invest in training on teaching strategies for this emergency, he said. ""Utilizing e-learning is quickly becoming a requirement of school districts across the country and not just a choice, he said in a statement. Harris, meanwhile, wrote in a blog for Brookings that while technology could be used to help students in the short term, more funding should be devoted to summer school. “Sometimes it’s best to fight the old-fashioned way,” he said.

"The Pentagon and the White House, in the weeks leading up to the president’s national emergency declaration on Friday, quarreled over the response to the coronavirus outbreak that was sweeping the country. Defense Department leaders urged measures such as restricting troop travel in order to contain the virus. But other administration officials pushed back, arguing against any “rash” steps that could have political ramifications and economic impact, defense officials told POLITICO. It wasn't until President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13 that leaders began to coalesce around a strategy. Trump’s comments served as a “green light” for DoD leaders to take more aggressive steps such as providing medical equipment, putting field hospitals on alert and making preparations to dispatch the military’s twin hospital ships to virus hotspots, said one defense official. “We’re muddling through,” the official said. From the start of the crisis, Defense Secretary Mark Esper has given his deputies — the service chiefs, combatant commanders and civilian leaders — flexibility to issue guidance to a mammoth force of almost 3 million people, including 1.3 million active-duty military and their families. And in recent days, senior Pentagon officials advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former administration official. Esper obliged, making appearances on Fox News, CNN and in the White House briefing room to lay out a number of steps the department is taking to support the coronavirus response. “I want to assure all of your viewers that the United States military remains ready and capable of defending the American people, protecting the nation and safeguarding our interests abroad,” Esper said on Fox News on Tuesday. But absent clear direction from the White House, the Pentagon’s initial internal response to the crisis, was ad hoc. In recent days, officials have scrambled to prepare the Navy's hospital ships, USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy, to help relieve pressure on civilian hospitals, defense officials said. Despite Trump’s assertion that the ships are “in tip-top shape,” the Comfort, homeported in Norfolk, Va., has been in pierside maintenance since December after returning from a five-month deployment and will not get underway until April 2. Meanwhile the Mercy, based out of San Diego, will be able to launch to its West Coast destination, either in California or Washington State, on Monday. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. In its efforts to get the Comfort underway as soon as possible, the Navy’s Military Sealift Command, which is responsible for the hospital ships, has been forced to defer ""a small amount"" of scheduled work on the vessels until a later date, a Navy spokesperson said. Guidance on domestic and international travel for troops also trickled out in a disjointed fashion over the past few weeks. U.S. Central Command, which oversees the Middle East and Afghanistan, canceled all leave and liberty travel for U.S. troops serving in the region on Feb. 27. On the same day, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command postponed a major exercise with South Korea, and the Navy ordered all ships that have visited countries in the Pacific region to remain at sea for 14 days in order to monitor sailors for any symptoms. But DoD-wide travel restrictions did not go into effect until March 11, when Esper banned movement of DoD civilians and families traveling to, from or through “Level 3” locations — such as South Korea, Iran and Italy — for 60 days. In some ways the Department of Defense has been ahead of the curve on the coronavirus crisis. Even before the first cases were reported in South Korea on Feb. 2, the commander of U.S. Forces Korea began enforcing strict measures in January, including testing, self-isolation and social distancing. Pentagon leaders began contingency planning for the crisis six weeks ago, said another defense official. The Defense Department has also been conducting regular, sometimes twice-daily, press briefings on the crisis in recent days, sending senior officials such as Esper, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, National Guard Bureau Chief Gen. Joseph Lengyel and others to the podium to talk about the department’s response. This is a sharp contrast to the State Department, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been criticized for a lack of transparency. But until this week, department leaders were not always on the same page. While Esper believes commanders and service leaders are in the best position to make major decisions for their forces, he has given explicit instructions to those officials that any major decision needs to be communicated up the chain of command, officials say. After being blindsided on multiple occasions over the past few weeks, Esper has had to intervene at lower levels to ensure the department presents a unified front, three current and former defense officials tell POLITICO. “It comes back to: we shouldn’t learn about these through media channels or them becoming public,” said one defense official. “But the last thing we want to do is hamstring those commanders.” After the Army on March 8 preempted DoD in ordering a halt to the movement of troops and their families into and out of Italy and South Korea, Esper was forced to step in, two defense officials said. The secretary stressed to Army leadership the need to keep him and the Joint Chiefs informed of any new guidance, according to the officials. The Pentagon on Monday banned all domestic and international travel through at least May 11. Esper intervened once more over the weekend after the Army considered freezing basic training for new recruits amid concern about virus spread, according to three defense officials. The Washington Post first reported the Army's move. Esper met with the leaders of the armed services on Monday to discuss the issue, ultimately deciding to continue basic training while taking precautionary measures, one of the defense officials said. Since Monday, Esper and the rest of the department have spent a good bit of time in front of cameras. Speaking alongside Trump on Wednesday, Esper said that in addition to preparing the hospital ships, which are equipped with 1,000 beds each, he has alerted field and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as needed to support the response. These capabilities are designed for trauma and other combat injuries, Esper stressed, and will be used to relieve pressure on civilian hospitals treating coronavirus victims. Separately, the Pentagon has opened its 16 certified coronavirus testing labs to test non-DoD personnel; will make available up to 5 million respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from its own reserves; and will distribute up to 2,000 deployable ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services, Esper said. “We have plans in place. We've been implementing them now for several weeks. And we're also wanting to lean forward and support again, the whole government approach to assist the American people,” Esper said on Fox.",Trump’s wobbly coronavirus response leaves Pentagon playing catchup,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-pentagon-coronavirus-defense-138095,politico

"Even by Washington standards, a trillion dollars is a lot of money. It could fund the Environmental Protection Agency for 120 years, or the Securities and Exchange Commission for 550 years, or 20 end-to-end border walls with Mexico. It could buy every American adult four new iPhone 11 Pros. The last time the U.S. economy imploded, after the 2008 financial crisis, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned then-President-Elect Barack Obama’s team that if he wanted to pass a stimulus bill, he shouldn’t even bother proposing anything that required the T-word. But President Donald Trump is about to do just that, and suddenly a 13-digit ask no longer seems so controversial. With the coronavirus slamming U.S. commerce to a halt, Trump’s administration has released the outlines of a $1 trillion stimulus proposal, half to send checks to individuals, half to backstop ailing businesses. [Update: Senate Republicans have now released their own trillion-dollar package.] And barely a decade after the vicious partisan war over Obama’s merely $800 billion The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Republicans and Democrats generally seem to agree that a $1 trillion stimulus package makes perfect sense—on top of two bipartisan pandemic response bills with a combined $100 billion-plus price tag that have already flown through Congress—and may well need to be followed up with even more stimulus. Their disagreements will be about what’s in it. The two-page memo summarizing Trump’s proposal that the Treasury Department released Wednesday is as short on details as it is long on dollars, but as a starter document, it gives a sense of what the president wants. “We’re going big,” Trump declared at a White House press conference. “We don’t want airlines going out of business or people losing their jobs and not having money to live.” People are already losing their jobs, and money is already getting tight, but this time, it seems like Washington might send help in a hurry. Here are some of the questions raised by the five main elements of Trump’s plan—and also by what’s left out of it. The $500 billion centerpiece of the Trump stimulus is a meme-maker’s dream, a straightforward proposal to give American taxpayers money. Obama’s economists, 11 years ago, described the ideal short-term stimulus as “timely, temporary, and targeted,” and sending people checks is certainly timely—the memo proposed one round in April and a second in May—as well as temporary. But it’s not yet clear whether the Trump version will be targeted at the poorer Americans who are most desperate for help and most likely to help the economy by spending it quickly to pay bills or buy essentials. The memo did say the payments would be “tiered based on income level and family size,” but did not specify whether the “individual taxpayers” who receive them would include the 75 million Americans who don’t earn enough to pay federal income tax, who presumably need the money the most, or, for that matter, millionaires and billionaires who don’t need the help. Congressional Republicans suggested Thursday that the payments could be “phased in,” so poorer families would actually get less. Nevertheless, there’s wide agreement that sending people money can be good stimulus—and it can be even better politics, which is why nobody in Washington wants to try to stop the cash train. Like the Danny DeVito character said in Heist: Everyone likes money. That’s why they call it money. Republicans would have screamed bloody murder if Obama had written $500 billion worth of checks and simply added the cost to the federal deficit, but under Trump, they’ve stopped warning about debt crises or national bankruptcy or runs on the dollar. So what’s not to like? Direct government payments are hard to steal, hard to screw up and easy to understand. Forget timely, temporary and targeted. Dumping cash on the American people is like those Xfinity ads: simple, easy, awesome. Trump recently suggested that when it came to industry rescues, “airlines would be Number One,” and the memo includes a $50 billion secured lending program designed to keep American passenger and cargo carriers in the air. There does seem to be broad agreement that the airlines, unlike cruise lines or restaurants or other businesses devastated by the pandemic, are vital to the functioning of the economy and the country. And even though the airlines asked for an aid package evenly divided between grants and loans, the Treasury plan would limit aid to collateralized loans that would presumably be paid back with interest after the crisis subsides, much like the 2008 bank bailouts that turned a profit for taxpayers. The memo even floated the idea of limits on increases in executive compensation until the loans are repaid, a nod to populist anger that is also reminiscent of restrictions on bank compensation in the 2008 bailout. But Democrats are already pushing to attach much tougher conditions on the airlines, which have spent the vast majority of their cash in recent years on stock buybacks that enriched their investors and executives. They want to attach harsh limits on buybacks and dividends as well as executive bonuses in exchange for Uncle Sam’s largesse. A group of eight senators has even called for attaching restrictions on the industry’s carbon emissions, which is clearly not a concern of Trump’s. The Treasury memo actually suggests that airlines should face “continuation of service requirements,” which could amount to a perverse requirement to fly empty planes when most Americans are no longer traveling. The memo also suggests $150 billion in aid to “Other Severely Distressed Sectors of the U.S. Economy,” which will probably include just about all of them by the end of the month. This one-sentence placeholder is likely to inspire the most pushback, in part because in addition to secured loans, it floats “loan guarantees,” which means the government would be on the hook if they aren't repaid. But the real question would be who qualifies for a bailout, and what would make them deserving. Trump recently pointed out that cruise lines are not at fault for their ongoing plunge in bookings, but one prominent Republican told me in an email: “No aid to cruise lines. Not essential. Owned by foreigners who don’t pay taxes or billionaires.” Climate-conscious Democrats are likely to be even less enthusiastic about bailouts for oil and gas interests that have been battered by the virus and an overseas price war. And bailouts for the tourism and hospitality industries could be even more controversial, partly because it’s even less clear how they’re essential to national survival, partly because Democrats will not want to bail out the international hotelier who currently lives in the White House. The industry lobbyists begging for bailouts argue that they need help in order to help their workers, but a more reliable way for the government to help workers is just to help the workers directly. The cruise lines say they need help to avoid layoffs, but it’s hard to imagine that they’ll avoid layoffs when they’re not offering cruises—so where will the money go? One of Trump’s proposals should not cost taxpayers a dime, but may be his most frightening ask: a federal guarantee for the $2.6 trillion money market fund industry. Treasury did this on its own during the 2008 financial crisis after one fund collapsed, and it instantly reassured panicked depositors who were pulling their cash out of other funds, as well as panicked companies that relied on the funds to buy “corporate paper” to finance their operations. But after the backlash against bailouts, Congress stripped Treasury’s power to do it again. So Trump would need a vote to do it this time. It makes sense to reassure the markets that money market funds will be safe, although it does raise the question of whether the funds should pay the government for insurance if they’re going to get backstopped whenever times get tough. It also feels a bit like a backdoor bank bailout, since one effect will be to reassure skittish companies that have been drawing down lines of credit from banks that they can rely on corporate paper instead. But the most pressing question it raises is: Are these funds in more trouble than we realize? The last time Treasury did this was at the height of the worst panic since the Depression. Slipping this financial provision into an economic stimulus bill may be a far-sighted move to give Treasury the tools it would need to deal with a potential banking panic, but it could also send a message that Treasury is worried about a banking panic, and those kinds of messages can panic bankers. The final piece of the Trump proposal is a $300 billion loan guarantee program to help small businesses keep their entire workforce on their payroll for eight weeks. This idea seems both unimaginably large—it’s seven times the annual budget for the State Department—and absurdly small, since there are 28 million small businesses in America, and it’s hard to see how restaurants or gyms or stores that don’t have customers are going to be able to pay back the loans after they pay their workers not to work for eight weeks. It feels like a program that could work if the business interruptions are very short, in which case it might not even get started in time to help, but it feels likely to get swamped by demand if the pandemic keeps the country on lockdown for long. The goal is to reduce disruption to people’s lives and careers—everyone prefers a paycheck to a government check—but this will be an extraordinarily disruptive crisis, and again, airlifting money to businesses is not always the most efficient way to help their employees, especially if the businesses end up failing anyway. The Obama stimulus included nearly $100 billion targeted directly at the most vulnerable victims of the Great Recession, particularly the poor and the unemployed. That aid turned out to be extremely effective not only in reducing poverty and easing pain but in reviving the economy; this Dartmouth study estimated that every dollar spent on the poor created from $1.96 to $2.31 in economic activity. The Trump proposal makes no effort to target the poor, although the bipartisan emergency response bill does include a modest boost in unemployment benefits and food aid. Similarly, Obama’s stimulus sent about $250 billion directly to cash-strapped state and local governments, many run by Obama’s political enemies, so they wouldn’t have to slash services, raise taxes or lay off workers; studies found that aid to states also helped the U.S. avoid a second Great Depression, helping governors and mayors avoid “anti-stimulus” at the worst possible time. The Trump proposal did not include state aid, either, although Democrats did get a boost in the federal share of Medicaid payments in that bipartisan emergency bill. In general, the Trump approach favors aid to businesses over aid to governments or the needy. And at least for now, it opts for just a few massive programs rather than a litany of small programs, an approach that will be sorely tested on Capitol Hill. Congress larded up the Obama stimulus with all kinds of quirky add-ons, from fire stations to military hospitals to cemetery maintenance to emergency farm loans; Senate Appropriations Chairman Daniel Inouye inserted $198 million for Filipino veterans who had been denied benefits they were promised after fighting alongside Americans in World War II, an honorable but not particularly stimulative provision. The Trump approach has different vulnerabilities—strip clubs and porn studios may apply for business interruption loans, too—but its omissions could make it easier to pass and potentially easier to defend. The trillion-dollar question is what Democrats will demand as their price for bailing out the sinking Trump economy. Pelosi has already warned that she wants to target the spending to the families that need it most. Democratic Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have proposed to make vote-by-mail available to every American, a provision that could ease fears that coronavirus could disrupt the 2020 election, while Patty Murray of Washington and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have said they won’t accept a stimulus without a dramatic expansion of paid sick leave for workers. The Obama stimulus included a powerful independent oversight board that scrutinized every dime, and perhaps as a result, it produced remarkably low levels of fraud and abuse; Democrats would like to see the same kind of oversight for Trump. It’s also tempting to look beyond the current crisis. Democratic economists have floated the possibility of including permanent “countercyclical stabilizers,” which would automatically provide stimulus for a faltering economy even if a Democrat were in the White House and Republicans rediscovered their allergy to deficit spending. And after the Obama stimulus helped jump-start the clean-energy economy with massive investments in solar, wind and electric vehicle batteries, some Democrats are interested in using the Trump stimulus to advance long-term priorities like transit, green infrastructure, or at least virus-related public health initiatives. Of course, time is of the essence, and the president is sure to demand immediate action on his proposals, while accusing House Democrats of leaving Americans to suffer if they don’t pass them right away. If they complain that the package doesn’t include funding for additional hospital beds, or for manufacturing ventilators, or for feeding the hungry, well, Trump and the Republicans seem perfectly willing to pass another stimulus bill after this one goes out the door. In Washington, a trillion dollars doesn’t seem to go as far as it used to.","What Trump’s Trillion-Dollar Bailout Gets Right, and Wrong",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/19/trump-coronavirus-bailout-economy-plan-137680,politico
"OTTAWA — Justin Trudeau’s week will one day fill the pages of Canadian history books — he’s sealed off the U.S. frontier to non-essential travelers, unleashed a huge economic aid package and moved closer to invoking a law that can empower the government to limit civil liberties. And the G-7 leader has done it all from home, with his three young kids underfoot. In fact, for more than a week, the prime minister has looked after the children solo — 24/7 — as the only able adult in the house. He and his kids entered 14 days of self-isolation together after his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, tested positive for Covid-19 last Thursday. He insists he’s fine and says Sophie, who is quarantined in one part of their house, is feeling better despite mild flu-like symptoms. There are no caregivers or political staff at the Trudeau home, just the five members of his immediate family, a government official told POLITICO. Like so many parents now working from home, he's encountered some challenges. Trudeau was late for an evening phone meeting with political staff this week after getting delayed by six-year-old Hadrien’s bathtime, said the official who was on the call. From the homefront, the prime minister has also been in the thick of domestic and international coordination on coronavirus, fielding calls from U.S. President Donald Trump, other world leaders, provincial premiers and his cabinet ministers. He even participated in a video conference call with fellow G-7 leaders about a joint Covid-19 response while he sat in his home office, where his kids’ artwork can be seen tacked on the wall. Trudeau tweeted a photo taken by his daughter Ella-Grace, 11, of the moment. The image showed the prime minister all by himself while some of his peers, like Trump, were seated at boardroom tables flanked by officials. Trudeau has about a week left in self-isolation and, the official said, it could mean he will be absent from the House of Commons next week when Parliament reviews his multibillion-dollar rescue plan. Elements of the package must be approved by a quorum of MPs, who will be recalled to Ottawa. Trudeau has said his cabinet is also mulling whether to invoke the Emergencies Act, which would give the federal government extraordinary powers to, among other things, restrict the mobility of Canadians. Such an unprecedented step would also need parliamentary approval and, if cabinet decides to move forward with the law, Trudeau may not be present for the debate. All of these major steps have been discussed by phone from inside Rideau Cottage, a red-bricked house on the property of the Governor-General’s much larger residence Rideau Hall. But despite the situation, Trudeau has increased his public appearances. He’s been slipping outdoors to hold almost-daily news conferences a few steps from his front stoop. In his first media availability outside the home after Sophie’s positive test, Trudeau called his situation “an inconvenience and somewhat frustrating,” but he noted his family was doing the right thing by following the advice of medical professionals. Inside Rideau Cottage, domestic duties have kept the prime minister busy. Trudeau, the official said, has been preparing meals for Hadrien, Ella-Grace and Xavier, 12, using supplies left outside the door. The drop-offs have also included a box of Star Wars Legos to help preoccupy the kids. The sounds of children yelling or laughing have at times been overheard during phone discussions about “pretty serious stuff,” the official said. All meetings with staff, they added, have been conducted by phone because installing secure video links in the home where people are self-isolated was seen as a big obstacle. The phone calls have created new challenges as ministers and other officials try to follow along with charts and graphs. Key discussions have grown more complex due to the lack of body language. “You don’t see the nuance of the raised eyebrow,” they said. The official said the prime minister’s example of working from home could serve as an opportunity to “normalize” the fact that many more people may have to do the same. There are small silver linings. The proximity of Trudeau’s news conference Wednesday to his front closet came in handy. He made his major economic announcement and then he paused the live outdoor news conference, which was held on a cold late winter day. “Just before I take questions, I’m supposed to model healthy behavior, I’m going to go grab my coat and I’ll be right back,” he said before dashing into the house and returning a few seconds later. Trudeau has used his news events to urge others to work from home as much as possible. “Don’t go out unless you absolutely have to,” he said this week. “Work remotely if you can. Let the kids run around a bit in the house. Things will get better.”",Justin Trudeau: Working from home just like the rest of us,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/justin-trudeau-works-from-home-coronavirus-137898,politico
"Telehealth may be about to boom as federal officials push doctors to video chat with patients, hoping to reduce stress on hospitals preparing for a flood of coronavirus cases. The Trump administration has used the president's national emergency declaration and an emergency funding package to lift key barriers to virtual care, including rules that limited payments for telehealth visits and blocked the use of popular video messaging platforms like FaceTime over privacy concerns. Many private insurers appear to be quickly following suit, raising the prospect that remote consultation could become the new normal long after the crisis subsides. ""This will be the inflection point for telemedicine that we've never had,"" said Andrew Watson, a vice president at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Watson, a former president of the American Telemedicine Association, said the current outbreak will help prove face-to-face interactions aren't as essential as many in the medical community believe. ""Health care has always thought that was the key part of providing care, but this pandemic has shown us that we can take care of our patients remotely and we certainly have the technology to do it,"" he said. President Donald Trump, whose administration has sought to expand digital health, this week boasted telehealth had never been used ""on a scale like we're going to use."" In quick succession this week, his administration lifted restrictions that telehealth boosters have long fought against, arguing they held back much wider deployment of a technology that's been in physician rooms and hospitals for over a decade. During the coronavirus crisis, the goal is to leverage telehealth to prevent further transmission of the illness by keeping patients out of hospitals and exam rooms who don't have the virus or have much milder cases. At least temporarily, Medicare will now cover at least part of every telehealth visit, waiving a policy that barred the health care program for seniors from paying for the technology outside of rural areas and for new patients. Medicare also will allow doctors to see patients across state lines virtually to help ease demand on providers swamped by the coronavirus. Separately, federal regulators said providers can prescribe an opioid addiction treatment to new patients through the technology, temporarily green-lighting a policy the administration had been reviewing for some time. The coronavirus emergency has ""removed a lot of the red tape"" for telehealth, said Jeff Wessler, CEO of cardiology technology company Heartbeat Health. Wessler and other technologists hope the coronavirus outbreak could prove the value of virtual care to skeptics. But telehealth companies have already been slammed by a surge in demand, largely from patients worried they have coronavirus. Teladoc, one of the leading U.S. firms, said it's handled 100,000 medical visits in the past week — a 50 percent jump from its typical demand in previous weeks. Zipnosis, a software platform enabling patients and clinicians to exchange text and video messages, said daily visits jumped from 650 to more than 16,000, and it's seen over 62,000 people experiencing coronavirus symptoms in the past two weeks. There are also questions about how quickly providers, as well as patients, can scale up use of the technology. According to Medicare's most recent data, just about a quarter of 1 percent of Medicare beneficiaries — less than 90,000 patients — used telehealth services in 2016. Some in recent years have urged caution about the technology, questioning whether its convenience could encourage people to use more care, driving up costs. Some researchers suggest clinicians might behave differently in virtual visits, such as inappropriately prescribing more antibiotics. Health care's use of consumer video chat platforms built by the likes of Apple and Facebook has also been hampered by privacy rules governing health information, which the Trump administration temporarily waived this week. Privacy advocates have questioned the ability of tech giants to protect sensitive health information — and those questions may become even more pressing as the health system comes to rely more on telehealth. There's bipartisan support in Congress for making many of the new federal allowances for telehealth permanent. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said he hoped the administration's short-term measures would make the case for his legislation permanently expanding Medicare's telehealth benefits. Advocates in the private sector and on Capitol Hill have also called for broader coverage of not just video visits, but also greater remote monitoring of patients through digital devices like heart-rate trackers and glucose monitors. Expanding telehealth isn't as easy as flipping on a switch. A viable telehealth program needs a reliable video chat service, webcams and training for clinicians on not just how to use the technology, but also how to make patients feel comfortable with it, said John Scott, medical director of the University of Washington's telehealth program. Telehealth providers also need to stay current on evolving federal guidelines for screening and treating coronavirus. That health system, among those hit hardest by the virus, is planning a massive expansion of telepathy capacity, aiming to conduct about 80 percent of visits virtually. Scott hopes to get each of the system's 400 primary care doctors trained on telehealth as soon as possible. Watson, the UPMC executive, said his health system's colorectal surgery clinic is now conducting all pre- and post-operational visits virtually. He plans to keep that to at least 60 percent after the coronavirus crisis because patients and staff will be used to it. For Mount Sinai Beth Israel in New York City, which has seen an explosion in cases this past week, the biggest challenge to building out its telehealth program is just finding time for virtual visits. The same pool of doctors slammed with emergency room duty are also taking virtual calls, said Michelle Lin, the health system's director of performance improvement. It's also not clear to what extent commercial players are covering virtual screening, she added. There's also concern that some of the highest-risk patients, who tend to be older and have underlying health conditions, won't know how to use or access these new digital tools. Medicare chief Seema Verma at a White House briefing this week urged family members to help and for seniors to contact their doctors or the Medicare hotline.",Coronavirus response could give long-awaited jolt to telehealth,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-response-telehealth-137884,politico
"Donald Trump’s cease-fire with the press was short-lived. Days after calling news media coverage of the coronavirus pandemic “very fair” at a White House news briefing, the president on Thursday went back on the offensive, agreeing with a reporter from the right-wing outlet One America News Network that outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal were siding with Chinese government propaganda and joking that he wanted to remove 75 percent to 80 percent of the journalists in the briefing room in the name of social distancing.  The president lashed out in particular at one reporter who asked why the White House was so unprepared to implement widespread testing for the respiratory illness given Trump’s assertion earlier this week that he’d known all along the outbreak would morph into a pandemic. Trump replied that his administration was, in fact, prepared for the virus that he spent weeks dismissing as a minimal threat to Americans. “We were very prepared. The only thing we weren’t prepared for was the media. The media has not treated it fairly,” Trump told NBC News’ Kristen Welker.  “I’ll tell you how prepared I was — I called for a ban from people coming in from China long before anybody thought it was,"" he continued, pointing to the single step he has pointed to almost exclusively as evidence that his administration has adequately addressed coronavirus. ""In fact, it was your network — I believe they called me a racist because I did that. It was many of the people in the room, they called me racist and other words because I did that.”  And he used a question about whether Congress should implement some kind of social distancing measures to joke about such measures imposed on journalists in the White House briefing room. The White House recently said it would pool cameras and let fewer reporters into the room to allow an empty seat between individuals in the typically jam-packed space. “I know all of them. I don’t know if they’re sitting like you people are sitting,” Trump said about the several members of Congress who have now tested positive for coronavirus.  But pointing at the reporters in the room, Trump continued: “You’re actually sitting too close. We should probably get rid of another 75, 80 percent of you. I’ll have just two or three that I like in this room. I think that’s a great way of doing it. We figured a new way of doing it.”  “But you’re actually much too close. You two,” Trump said, circling the air in the direction of the briefing room's front row, “should leave immediately.” White House news briefings, once a daily occurrence, had gone all but extinct in the Trump administration until the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic. Briefings under past Trump press secretaries Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders were particular points of contention as the president's spokespeople struggled at times to answer questions about the factual inaccuracies or odd rhetoric emanating from their boss. But daily briefings, lately anchored by the president, have returned in recent days amid the coronavirus outbreak. And until Thursday, the president had remained mostly cordial with the press as he and others at the briefing work to disseminate the administration's messaging on its coronavirus response. But during his extensive media criticisms on Friday, Trump claimed that he’d been tested for coronavirus only after a deluge of questions from the media, which followed Trump’s appearance in pictures with an aide to the Brazilian president who tested positive for the virus.  “I didn't have any symptoms and I got a test, but I got a test because you people were driving everybody crazy,” Trump told reporters Thursday, when asked about his conflicting messaging over whether people with no symptoms should seek out a test, which have been in short supply across the country. “My doctor told me don't get it, you don't need it,” Trump continued. “Everybody said you don't need it, but I had to do it because the press was going crazy. And then after I got it, they said you shouldn't have gotten it, you had no symptoms.”  Toward the end of the briefing, a correspondent for the Trump-friendly cable news outlet OAN gave the president a wider opening to go after the press, which he seized. ""It amazes me when I read the things I read,"" he began, rapping several newspapers for ""phony"" reporting on his handling of the crisis. When the reporter posited that ""major left wing news media"" had been ""siding with state propaganda"" emanating from China by criticizing his use of the term ""Chinese virus,"" Trump went on an extended riff about the ""corrupt media.""  ""I think they do — I mean, they're siding with China. They're doing things they shouldn't be doing. They're siding with many others. China is the least of it,"" Trump asserted. ""So why they're doing this, you'll have to ask them. But if we had an honest media in this country, our country would be an even greater place.""  Ironically, Trump singled out only The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal — three papers whose journalists China announced it would expel from the country earlier this week, a move that Trump's administration condemned.",Trump drops his coronavirus media detente,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-media-coronavirus-137692,politico
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced the text of the Republicans’ trillion-dollar proposal for the so-called “Phase 3” coronavirus stimulus package, paving the way for negotiations with Democrats to formally begin.   The centerpiece of the Senate Republican proposal — crafted with support from the White House — is a direct payment to qualified Americans of up to $1,200. Married couples could get $2,400. Taxpayers who earn more than $75,000 annually will begin to see that payment reduced by $5 for every $100 they earn over the $75,000 threshold, with those who make more than $99,000 getting nothing. Families with children would get $500 per child.  While a Treasury Department outline circulated earlier in the week had called for two payments from the IRS — one each in April and May — the Senate GOP proposal only calls for one check at this time.  The GOP plan also outlines provisions to give small businesses $300 billion in federally guaranteed loans, moves back the income tax-filing deadline from April 15 to July 15, provides numerous tax cuts for corporations, and authorizes more than $200 billion in financial support for hard-hit industries such as airlines.   McConnell said he would direct a number of Senate GOP chairmen and senior Republicans to hold talks with their Democratic counterparts, including Finance Committee Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Small Business Committee Chairman Marco Rubio of Florida and Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, and White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland will also be part of the talks.  McConnell said the bipartisan discussions would begin Friday morning, and he vowed they would continue until a deal is reached.  ""These are urgent discussions and they need to happen at the member level, starting now,"" McConnell said on the floor as he introduced the 247-page proposal. ""This legislation is a significant next step. And the Senate is not going anywhere until we take action.""  Senate Democrats have outlined their own $750 billion emergency plan that would expand paid family leave, pick sick leave and unemployment insurance.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) immediately complained Democrats ""had virtually no impact"" in drafting the proposal. Schumer further faulted Republicans for giving a ""bailout for a number of industries.  ""We don't want these industries to go under, but we don't want the dollars that are put there to go to corporate executives or shareholders,"" Schumer said. ""Again, they mus go to workers first."" Schumer doesn't want companies that lay off employees to receive government aid, and he wants restrictions on stock buybacks.  Schumer noted that McConnell has refused to engage Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Democrats as well, which will make it more difficult to achieve a bicameral compromise.  Schumer and Pelosi issued a statement following release of the GOP proposal: “To earn Democratic support in the Congress, any economic stimulus proposal must include new, strong and strict provisions that prioritize and protect workers, such as banning the recipient companies from buying back stock, rewarding executives and laying off workers.""   McConnell has faced some opposition from Senate Republicans over the direct payments plan, although White House officials tried to dismiss those complaints as not substantial.   Yet for once, McConnell isn't controlling each aspect of crafting a major piece of legislation put together on the fly, an unusual position for him. McConnell — as good a vote counter as the Senate has ever seen — usually figures out what the goal is first, and then he steers his colleagues toward that goal. Not in this case, though.  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has been the most vocal opponent, despite support for the effort - so far - from President Donald Trump, Mnuchin and other senior administration officials. Graham told Senate Republicans on Thursday that he had called Trump to lobby against the plan, adding that Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) — soon to take over as White House chief of staff — agreed with him.  ""Direct payments make sense when the economy is beginning to restart. It makes no sense now cause it's just money,"" Graham told reporters. ""What I want is income, just not one check. I want you to get a check every week, not just one week.""  Graham, like some other Republicans, wants to beef up the unemployment insurance system instead, as well as boosting loans for small businesses..  ""I personally think if we're going help people we ought to direct the cash payments maybe as a supplement to unemployment, not to the people that are still working everyday,"" said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.). ""Just a blanket cash check to everyone in America who is making $75,000... I don't know the logic of that. I could see tying it to unemployment, maybe boosting it for people who are going be laid off for a while.""  Shelby, however, cautioned that he wasn't saying he'd vote against the proposal, just that he didn't like it.  Jim Lankford (R-Okla.) said he had a ""lot of questions of how this works, who gets and who doesn't."" Other Republicans raised similar concerns, although they were cautious in their opposition.""  But White House officials privately believe that Senate Republicans will fall in line with Trump if he pushes the cash payments proposal. A senior administration official noted Graham has already expressed his opposition to direct payments.  ""We're all going to have to vote for something that in another environment we wouldn't support,"" said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.).  McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor Thursday afternoon, outlined the Republican proposal to assist small businesses by providing federally guaranteed loans; direct cash payments, as well as lending to industries such as the airlines that are hit hard by the coronavirus. In addition, Republicans are looking to get more resources for the health care system, which could be overloaded as the virus continues to spread throughout the U.S.  “Our proposal will immediately help American workers, families, and businesses,” McConnell said of the plan, known as “Phase 3.” “Yes, it will help position our economy to thrive once again after this public health menace is behind us … Fundamentally, we have to beat back this virus.”  But the package will need support from at least seven Senate Democrats if all Republicans back it. Schumer emphasized Thursday that Democrats, who have outlined their own vision, will pursue a “workers first” proposal and called for a “Marshall Plan” for the health care system. He also called for a new form of unemployment insurance.  Schumer has stayed in close touch with Mnuchin, who is leading negotiations for the Trump administration, about the third stimulus package, as well as Pelosi.  The minority leader also called for “four corner” negotiations between party leaders in the Senate and the House, but McConnell has shown no interest in involving the House.  In preparing the “Phase 3” package, McConnell has directed task forces to come up with proposals. Rubio and Susan Collins (R-Maine) are suggesting giving small businesses forgivable loans, which would be administered by a bank, credit union or some other type of lender.  According to a draft discussion of the small business proposal, obtained by POLITICO, the maximum small business loan the government could back would double to $10 million from $5 million through the end of the year.  McConnell emphasized earlier Thursday that the proposals are not “bailouts.”   “From small businesses to key sectors, we are not talking about so-called ‘bailouts’ for firms that made reckless decisions,” McConnell said. “Nobody is alleging a moral hazard here. None of these firms — not corner stores, not pizza parlors, not airlines — brought this on themselves.”  The third stimulus package comes after the Senate passed Wednesday a multi-billion dollar House-passed emergency aid package. While some Republicans had expressed reservations about the package's paid sick leave provisions, the final vote tally was 90-8.  House Democrats are drafting their own stimulus package with extensive financial protections — including direct monthly payments of as much as $2,000 for adults; grants and debt relief for small businesses; and measures to halt evictions and foreclosures.  Democrats would also enforce strict rules on businesses that receive federal cash, such as maintaining payroll, upholding collective bargaining rights and no stock buybacks.  Pelosi and committee leaders laid out the details of the plan — which is still taking shape — on a more than two-hour conference call on Thursday.  Separately from the economic relief measures, House Democrats are also pushing for between $120 billion and $150 billion in cash for federal agencies. Much of that would trickle down to state and local authorities, which have been struggling to meet public health and economic demands amid the outbreak.  Democrats say Congress may have no choice but to dole out the funds on the third package, instead of waiting for a fourth, because it’s unclear how much longer both chambers will be able to meet in person.

"President Donald Trump on Thursday put the onus on governors to obtain the critical equipment their states need to fight the coronavirus pandemic, telling reporters that the federal government is “not a shipping clerk” for the potentially life-saving supplies. Appearing at the daily press briefing of the White House coronavirus task force, the president defended his decision to invoke the Defense Production Act — which would allow the administration to direct U.S. industry to ramp up production of emergency medical provisions — without actually triggering the statute. “Governors are supposed to be doing a lot of this work, and they are doing a lot of this work,” Trump said. “The Federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping. You know, we’re not a shipping clerk.” The president’s remarks amounted to a rebuke of governors’ recent pleas for more robust federal intervention amid the rapidly spreading outbreak, which they warn will soon overwhelm local health care systems if hospital beds, face masks and other necessities are not soon furnished in significantly greater numbers. Trump said Thursday the administration will “help out wherever we can,” but added that the acquisition of urgent supplies “is really for the local governments, governors and people in the state, depending on the way they divide it up. And they’ll do that, and they’re doing a very good job of it.” But earlier Thursday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, the current epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., exhorted the administration to help meet the demand for equipment. Cuomo has specifically sounded the alarm over the lack of ventilators in states across the nation, warning that New York would require five or six times its current supply of the respiratory machines to treat the projected number of coronavirus patients.  “Every state is shopping for ventilators. We’re shopping for ventilators. We literally have people in China shopping for ventilators, which is one of the largest manufacturers. So this is a major problem,” Cuomo said at his daily news conference, adding that the administration “can actually play a very constructive role” under the DPA. “We’re going to need protective equipment in hospitals,” Cuomo said. “We’re going to need ventilators. And that is something that a state can’t do, but the federal government can do.” Trump announced Wednesday that he would dispatch one of the Navy’s two hospital ships to New York Harbor, while the other prepared to deploy to a location on the West Coast. The vessels are equipped with 1,000 hospital beds each and are intended to relieve civilian hospitals struggling with capacity in the face of the public health crisis. The Pentagon also took several actions this week, including putting on alert 1,000 “deployable” beds from a variety of different medical units, making available up to 5 million respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from its own reserves, and distributing up to 2,000 ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday called for construction companies to donate their inventories of N95 protective masks to local hospitals and halt new mask orders, and said Thursday that the administration had “literally identified tens of thousands of ventilators that can be converted to treat patients.” He did not say where the ventilators were found.  Despite those measures, the Trump administration has not completed a comprehensive assessment to determine the full scope of supplies that will need to be ordered, according to current and former administration officials, and his invoking the DPA does not do anything to increase production of those items. Public health experts, meanwhile, have encouraged increased coordinaton between the administration and manufacturers assembling medical equipment for health care providers. “They need to receive assurances from the federal government that they will be compensated, even if health care institutions don’t end up needing the equipment,” wrote Tom Inglesby and Anita Cicero, both of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in an op-ed earlier this month. Following the White House briefing, the president traveled to FEMA headquarters in Washington to participate in a video teleconference with governors on COVID-19 response efforts. In a memo from the National Governors Association delivered to Trump and Pence ahead of the call, the states’ chief executives outlined their “top needs and priorities to be shared” with the administration. Among their list of major concerns, the governors requested that the federal government “increase access to [personal protective equipment], masks, test kits, [and] extraction kits,” and demanded “accelerating the production of life-saving equipment, such as ventilators.” They also asked for the administration to “provide guidance on [the] implementation of” the DPA.

"The number of National Guardsmen called up to deal with the coronavirus response may double by the weekend, and a top general says they may help with local law enforcement. The Pentagon, meanwhile, announced on Thursday that the administration has no plans to put Guardsmen under federal control. More than 2,000 Guardsmen have already been deployed in 27 states to respond to the pandemic, Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel told reporters Thursday. After possibly doubling in days, the number could rise to tens of thousands as the crisis deepens, he said. “When there is a hurricane you can see it on a map, you have a sense of how hard the storm will hit and how long the storm will last,"" said Lengyel, who is chief of the National Guard Bureau. ""With Covid-19, it's like we have 54 separate hurricanes in every state, territory and the District of Columbia.” Hours after Lengyel spoke, Pentagon spokesperson Alyssa Farah announced that the administration plans to keep Guard troops under state control. ""The @DeptOfDefense is not considering federalization of the @USNationalGuard,"" she tweeted. ""The #COVID19 response is dynamic, but at this time Governors remain in control of their states’ National Guard forces & can request additional assistance from federal Title 10 forces through @FEMAgov."" During his briefing with reporters, Lengyel made the case for keeping the Guard units under state control. In their current state-level Title 32 status, the country's 450,000 Guardsmen can be deployed by their governor to transport medical supplies, help with drive-through testing, and assist local law enforcement with enforcing curfews and other tasks, Lengyel said. He advised against federalizing the National Guard under Title 10 — one of the options the administration had been considering — because doing so means the states would lose some of those authorities. Under the Posse Comitatus Act, the federal government is prohibited from using U.S. troops for domestic law enforcement. This limitation does not apply to the National Guard when activated by a state's governor and operating under Title 32. Louisiana state officials deployed Guardsmen in this capacity in response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. When under state control, Guardsmen have ""additional authorities that can assist law enforcement and they maintain their direct command and control links within their states,"" Lengyel said. This ""makes it a faster, more rapid, more efficient response for the government and the state emergency response network to use them."" The primary reason to federalize the National Guard would be in a ""World War III"" scenario where additional forces are needed rapidly to go to war ""with a major peer competitor,"" Lengyel explained. But in the case of the coronavirus, no such action is needed, which he said would cost ""billions and billions of dollars."" ""I think you can get everything you need more efficiently and more effectively if you leave them in a state status,"" Lengyel said. ""There is no need right now to have 450,000 Guardsmen on duty in any given state.""","National Guard call-ups may double by the weekend, chief says",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/national-guard-call-ups-coronavirus-137578,politico
"President Donald Trump said he will ""slash red tape like nobody has even done it before"" in a bid to get unapproved coronavirus treatments to patients faster and identify effective drugs. The president said Thursday he directed the Food and Drug Administration to ""eliminate out-of-date rules and bureaucracy so this can go forward fast"" — but he did not offer any details. Instead, Trump and top health officials highlighted steps the government has taken in recent weeks to launch clinical trials of potential coronavirus treatments. Trump's remarks came one day after he teased that an ""exciting FDA announcement"" was on the way — news that reportedly caught some in the health agency by surprise as they scrambled to finalize details, said three HHS officials. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn appeared to downplay the president's optimism about speeding up access to three drugs in particular. ""What's important is not to provide falsehood but provide hope,"" Hahn said. “We need to make sure the sea of new treatments will get the right drug to the right patients, at the right dosage, at the right time,” he added. “That's why it is important we have our professionals looking at these therapeutics in development.” Trump suggested certain programs that the administration could use to get experimental drugs to people quickly outside of clinical trials. One such route, known as ""Right to Try,"" was established by a 2018 law that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence supported to help people who are seriously ill and have no other treatment options. ""What we're talking about today is beyond Right to Try,"" Trump said, adding that the law ""has been a tremendous success."" But outside researchers were quick to sound the alarm. ""Wow, that is bad advice from President Trump,"" said Diana Zuckerman, a drug safety expert at the National Center for Health Research. ""Lives can be saved if red tape is cut in terms of making tests, respirators, and hospital beds more available. Making untested antivirals available is not a good strategy."" The Right to Try program allows patients to appeal directly to drugmakers to use medicines that are still being developed and tested. Bioethicists and drug policy experts argue there are other ways to help people access experimental medicine — like the FDA’s compassionate use route, also name checked by the president — and that Right to Try fuels false hope, while making it difficult to collect data on how well the drugs work. The drugmaker Gilead has provided its experimental antiviral drug remdesivir to patients with coronavirus under compassionate use rules first established in 1987. The National Institutes of Health has also started a clinical trial of the drug in coronavirus patients. There is limited data available on remdesivir's effectiveness against coronavirus, Gilead spokesperson Ryan McKeel said. ""It is not approved anywhere globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use,"" he added. McKeel said that Gilead is in discussions with the FDA about how to move forward if clinical trial data suggest the drug helps patients with coronavirus. Trump name-checked remdesivir at Thursday's briefing, along with two drugs that have been used for decades to treat malaria. He suggested that the malaria drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, could be effective against coronavirus. But the data on that is still sparse. Some scientists say that even if the malaria drugs work against the virus, they will need to be given during the early stages of infection to have the greatest effect. And that could prove difficult because many people are without symptoms in the first days of infection, and even those who feel ill may have trouble getting tested.  ""Any benefit without doing harm is better than nothing,"" said Barry Bloom, a global health researcher at Harvard and a former White House consultant. ""Something that prevents people from being severely ill is wonderful but unlikely to affect the epidemic unless it could be used very early on.” It is unclear how many people have been treated under the federal Right to Try law for any condition. There are at least nine publicly reported cases. The libertarian Goldwater Institute, which spearheaded efforts to pass the legislation, says at least six of those involved people who received experimental brain cancer vaccine. Goldwater this week pushed for Right to Try to be used amid the coronavirus outbreak. Others are more skeptical about the program's usefulness during the current crisis. ""A lot of these [drug] products are already being deployed through clinical trials as well as compassionate use or emergency use authorities,"" Steve Ubl, CEO of the drug lobby PhRMA, said Wednesday when asked about the Right to Try push. ""I'll leave it at that."" Bioethicists were quick to sound the alarm when Goldwater floated the idea, arguing it would fuel false claims and panic around the outbreak. “Right now, to push the Right to Try pathway seems really irresponsible and dangerous,” said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a bioethicist at University of Pennsylvania. “This is the type of thing that's critically important to preserve clinical trials for or we’re not going to be able to figure out whether this stuff works.” Trump has urged manufacturers to get treatments and vaccines to patients quickly even as other officials have warned that creating an effective vaccine, in particular, will take at least a year. The FDA this week also let researchers alter clinical trials to keep subjects safe during the outbreak and allow for scientists to assess patients remotely. Hahn instead appeared to lean on compassionate use rather than the newer Right to Try law. ""The important thing about compassionate use — and that's what the president meant [with] this is beyond Right to Try — is that we get to collect the information,"" he said. “At this point, the issues that we have been raising with the administration have been focused more on logistics and ensuring that we online to have the free flow of goods to make sure that we can meet patient needs,” PhRMA’s Ubl told reporters Wednesday when asked about the lobby’s goals amid the government’s response.

"Weeks before President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, Sen. Richard Burr privately offered a grim prognosis for the outbreak while previewing some of the massive disruptions soon to come, according to a previously unreported recording obtained by NPR.  In the recording, which NPR reports came from the North Carolina Republican's remarks at a private luncheon late last month, Burr said that the COVID-19 outbreak ""is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic,"" which killed an estimated 50 million worldwide.  ""There's one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history,"" said Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Burr also authored the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, the 2006 law that formulated the federal response to outbreaks. In his comments to the Tar Heel Circle in North Carolina on Feb. 27, Burr gave attendees a chilling warning about the severity of the coronavirus at a time when there were only a little over a dozen reported confirmed cases in the U.S. and President Donald Trump was suggesting that number would drop down to zero in short order. Burr, too, had publicly declared confidence in the U.S. preparations for coronavirus, despite his darker assessment to the Tar Heel Circle. Those public declarations of confidence were featured in a separate ProPublica report on Thursday indicating that Burr — who has access to regular intelligence briefings — sold between $580,000 and $1.6 million in stock in the weeks before the market began to collapse under the strain of coronavirus. That decision probably spared Burr severe financial pain. Progressive groups quickly called for an investigation and even demanded that Burr step down. “As Intel chairman, @SenatorBurr got private briefings about Coronavirus weeks ago,” said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). “Burr knew how bad it would be. He told the truth to his wealthy donors, while assuring the public that we were fine. THEN he sold off $1.6 million in stock before the fall. He needs to resign.“ A spokesperson for the senator quickly rebutted the notion that anything improper had happened, noting that Burr‘s stock sale came before the market began to show signs of strain. “Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak,“ the aide said. “As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy. He supported Congress’ immediate efforts to provide $7.8 billion for response efforts and this week’s bipartisan bill to provide relief for American business and small families.” Burr also responded sharply to the NPR report about his private remarks, calling it a “tabloid-style hit piece.“ He said the story left the impression that Americans weren‘t properly warned of the dire potential effects of coronavirus, and he said that impression was incorrect. But Burr‘s backup for that was a Feb. 26 news conference in which Trump, alongside public health officials, sharply downplayed the risk of coronavirus, saying numbers in the U.S. were going “down, not up,“ and suggesting schools take precautions for a scenario that he considered unlikely to unfold. That was in sharp contrast to Burr‘s message to the North Carolina group a day later.  Burr instructed attendees to reconsider traveling to Europe, a suggestion that came about two weeks before the president announced a travel ban for foreigners coming to the U.S. from most of Europe. ""You may have to look at your employees and judge whether the trip they're making to Europe is essential or whether it can be done on video conference. Why risk it?"" he asked the group. The senator also said that the virus could prompt the shuttering of schools, something that happened in his home state a couple of weeks later.  “There will be, I'm sure, times that communities, probably some in North Carolina, have a transmission rate where they say, let's close schools for two weeks, everybody stay home,” he says in the recording. Burr even forecast the mobilization of the military, something that has only begun to happen in recent days on a wider scale. ""We're going to send a military hospital there, it's going to be in tents and going to be set up on the ground somewhere,"" he predicted, noting that ""It's going to be a decision the president and DoD make. And we're going to have medical professionals supplemented by local staff to treat the people that need treatment.”  Burr's tone in private went well beyond an op-ed he co-authored with Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), reassuring Americans that although they were rightfully concerned about the outbreak, it was being properly handled by the authorities. ""Thankfully, the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus, in large part due to the work of the Senate Health Committee, Congress, and the Trump administration,"" the two senators wrote. ""The work of Congress and the administration has allowed U.S. public health officials to move swiftly and decisively in the last few weeks."" The Trump administration has faced fierce criticism for not taking the outbreak seriously enough at its outset and for fumbling the early testing process — issues the White House is still scrambling to address.  There are now more than 9,000 reported cases in the U.S., and Americans have been advised to ""hunker down"" in an attempt to contain the spread of more infections.",Recording shows Senate intel chair warned of coronavirus disruption in private weeks ahead of time,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/senate-intel-chair-warned-of-coronavirus-disruption-in-private-137407,politico
"Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard announced Thursday that she would end her presidential campaign, formally winnowing the 2020 Democratic field to a two-man race between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. “Today, I’m suspending my presidential campaign and offering my full support to Vice President Joe Biden in his quest to bring our country together,” Gabbard said in a video statement posted online. In endorsing Biden, Gabbard said that “although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know that he has a good heart, and he’s motivated by his love for our country and the American people.” “I’m confident that he will lead our country guided by the spirit of aloha, respect and compassion, and thus help heal the divisiveness that has been tearing our country apart,” she added. Gabbard closely tied the reasons for her withdrawal from the race to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, saying that “the best way that I can be of service at this time is to continue to work for the health and well-being of the people of Hawaii and our country in Congress, and to stand ready to serve in uniform should the Hawaii National Guard be activated.”  Gabbard previously served two tours in the Middle East with the Hawaii Army National Guard — in Iraq from 2004-2005 and in Kuwait from 2008-2009 — and stepped away from her campaign in August to report for active duty, participating in a two-week joint training exercise in Indonesia. Apart from Biden and Sanders, Gabbard outlasted all of her Democratic rivals to become the third remaining White House hopeful in what began as a historically diverse and crowded pack of candidates.  The Hawaii lawmaker faced significant criticism for her seemingly quixotic decision to stay in the race beyond the early nominating contests, and now finishes her campaign with only two pledged delegates — less than several of her former rivals who dropped out weeks ago. But Gabbard, long a controversial figure within the Democratic field, had little to lose after declaring in October that she would not seek reelection to a fifth term in Congress, a prospect complicated by a formidable primary challenger and thorny relationships with other Hawaii politicians. She had also become the subject of widespread skepticism among national Democrats, often rebuked for her past anti-LGBT rhetoric, isolationist brand of diplomacy and 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad, whom she declined to label a war criminal despite the dictator’s use of chemical weapons to attack his own people. Gabbard typically polled better with independents than self-identified Democrats, and acquired some support from fringe conservatives. She was frequently referenced in Russian media and propaganda, prompting a high-profile clash with Hillary Clinton after the 2016 Democratic nominee claimed the congresswoman was the “favorite” of Moscow. Although Gabbard’s last appearance in a primary debate was in November, before the Democratic National Committee raised its bar to participate, she emerged as a fiery on-stage presence — blasting other candidates for their records and proposals on foreign policy, criminal justice and the impeachment of President Donald Trump, among other issues.  Her exit from the race Thursday after weeks of defying political pressure to drop out reflects the new nature of the Democratic primary, which has become frozen in place amid the COVID-19 outbreak and seen Biden mount a nearly insurmountable delegate lead over Sanders. The senator’s campaign manager announced Wednesday he would “assess” the state of his White House bid in the days ahead.","Tulsi Gabbard ends White House bid, endorses Biden",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/tulsi-gabbard-ends-white-house-bid-137242,politico
"The State Department on Thursday issued an extraordinary advisory urging Americans not to travel overseas and to return to the United States if they can, a move that comes amid concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The Level 4 travel advisory for all international travel appears to be unprecedented and is the most severe such warning issued by the department. It urges American citizens who live abroad or otherwise cannot reach the U.S. to essentially stay where they are and avoid crossing international boundaries. POLITICO first reported the plans for the advisory earlier Thursday. Numerous U.S. citizens are already in limbo abroad, and the new guidance threatens to stir further anxiety among travelers. U.S. lawmakers have raised questions about the State Department’s ability to aid Americans overseas, but in the new guidance, the department makes clear that U.S. citizens shouldn’t count on it to help. “Have a travel plan that does not rely on the U.S. government for assistance,” the travel advisory tells Americans who decide to go overseas or are already there. According to several people familiar with the situation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo approved raising the advisory from its previous status of Level 3. That earlier advisory merely encouraged Americans to reconsider travel abroad.  The State Department press office did not respond to requests for comment, but announced on Thursday that U.S. passport agencies will only accept applications from customers with life-or-death emergencies who plan to travel within 72 hours. Current and former U.S. State Department officials, some of them with several decades of experience, said they did not recall such a travel advisory ever being issued in the past. The highly unusual guidance came after seven weeks of steadily increasing restrictions on U.S. travel, following President Donald Trump's move to limit travel from China at the end of January.  Other countries have closed their borders and imposed further travel restrictions as the virus has spread beyond Asia to Europe and the Western Hemisphere. There are more than 10,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, across all 50 states and Washington, D.C.  The World Health Organization on Thursday said that there are more than 191,000 confirmed cases across more than 150 countries; an unofficial tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University pegs that number still higher. A State Department official based overseas expressed concern about the pending advisory, saying he worried it would cause panic among Americans. The official pointed out the difficulties of finding flights under the current conditions. The advisory acknowledged the difficult conditions, noting, for instance: “Many countries are experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice.“  Some Americans are stranded in countries such as  Guatemala, which has issued a ban on any flights coming or going, and others are having to pay dearly for what flights are left, often transiting through several countries before finding a way back home.  And the State Department has largely been absent, according to interviews with several Americans stranded abroad, who reported receiving no help from U.S. embassies. Stephanie Marlin was in Guatemala City visiting a friend when the Guatemalan government closed down its borders, a day before her flight was scheduled to take her back to Nashville.  She said she had communicated multiple times with Delta Air Lines about her flight, which was supposed to leave on Tuesday. Delta assured her that she was “gold” and that her flight would leave as planned.  “I really blame the airlines because I could have left earlier and would have left earlier,” Marlin told POLITICO.  The U.S. government hasn’t been much help either. In her first attempts to reach the embassy there, Marlin said she repeatedly got an emailed form response which offered no actionable help. When she called an emergency number, it simply played a recording with the same information. It wasn’t until she had a friend get in touch with the office of her member of Congress, Jim Cooper, that she was able to speak to a human at the embassy. But even then, the embassy employee said they were powerless to do anything given Guatemala’s border shut down. Members of Congress said they’re trying to handle pleas for help from constituents and have been pushing the State Department to figure out how to get Americans home. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a letter from 9 Democrats on Wednesday asking the State Department to step up its efforts to help those stuck abroad. “We seek an immediate clarification regarding your current efforts to facilitate the return of Americans to the United States, whether by commercial airline flights, charter flights, or other means,” the letter reads. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner also reached out to Pompeo on Wednesday, saying he's heard from ""an alarming number of Virginians"" unable to return home. His spokesperson, Nelly Decker, said that the Virginia Democrat’s office was assisting upwards of 20 Virginians around the world “with the number growing almost hourly.""","State Department warns Americans: Don’t travel abroad, come home if overseas",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-travel-advisory-level-four-137227,politico
"The Democratic National Committee raised $12.8 million in February through its main account and a joint fundraising committee with state parties, according to numbers shared first with POLITICO. The total shows an improvement for the DNC as the committee gears up for the high-stakes 2020 election. In 2019, the committee and the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, which can take in six-figure checks from donors and divide them between the DNC and numerous state parties, regularly raised less than $10 million per month. The DNC finished February with $14 million cash on hand, it said. But the committee has a challenging road ahead: Democrats are slowly emerging from a long primary — and Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee, will need to quickly build a large campaign machine if he wants to catch up with President Donald Trump, who has had months to prepare his reelection effort. Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee has been raking in money for years under Trump, and the DNC’s total is likely much less than the RNC’s February haul. Though the RNC hasn't yet disclosed its individual fundraising total, it raised $27.1 million in January, and it said earlier this month that the RNC and Trump’s campaign raised a combined $86 million in February. The coronavirus outbreak creates even greater fundraising challenges for the DNC and campaigns across the board.

"It’s been nearly a month since governors first called on the federal government to help provide testing so states could monitor the spread of the novel coronavirus. They’re still waiting. And without knowing who's ill and where, they can't realistically slow the pandemic. While President Donald Trump is touting a dramatic uptick in testing across the country, governors and public health officials say they are still being forced to dramatically ration the tests, while labs are confronting daunting backlogs that delay the results. “I watch a news conference and they tell us we have testing capacity, but I am telling you we don’t have testing capacity. It is not out there yet,” said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during a Wednesday news conference. His state has a current backlog of 1,700 samples waiting to be processed. Walz blames the Trump administration’s decision to prioritize 14 of the nation’s hardest-hit areas, supplying them with needed material and leaving the rest of the nation to scramble. “The minute they made that decision … our supply chain of reagents for our testing were dried up,” he said. Even as President Donald Trump calls on states to do more and says the federal government is not “a shipping clerk,” governors have been on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence and other federal officials, begging for additional supplies, testing kits, swabs, reagents and protective equipment. “I think it’s critical the feds move a lot faster on this stuff,” Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said on Wednesday. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said his state is “critically low” on test kits and that he has been pushing the federal government for help. The shortage of tests means that in many states people who believe they might have contracted the virus can’t know for sure and are told to stay home for weeks. It means health care workers don’t know whether they've contracted the illness even as they treat infected patients and tend to members of high-risk groups, such as the elderly, who might be in the hospital for other reasons. And it means public health officials are left guessing where they should direct resources because they can’t be certain whether there are clusters of cases. Trump on Thursday insisted that governors have all they need, telling reporters he was hearing “very good things on the ground.” “I can tell you what we’re doing is working with local governors to get them what they want,” Trump said. But the president’s words don’t match reality, state and local officials say. “We’re the boots on the ground. We know what's available,” said Kris Ehresmann, infectious disease division director for the Minnesota Health Department. “Some of the commercial labs do not have the materials they need.” That’s left states to impose strict criteria on who can be tested, frustrating people across the country who are showing symptoms, worried but were told to wait and see if their cases worsen. In several states, only those who are hospitalized or at high risk, including those with underlying conditions, can be tested. “Most individuals with mild symptoms do not need to be tested even with expanded testing options,” Indiana State Health Commissioner Kristina Box said during a news conference on Thursday. She added even though commercial labs were scaling up testing capacity in the state, they will still have to limit who is getting the tests. “We still have a shortage of supplies and we need to be mindful of that.” Shortages and testing backlogs continue to be reported across the country. In Eagle County, Colo., where state officials have reported a cluster of cases, the local hospital, Vail Health, confirmed at least 400 people are waiting to be tested. White House officials have sent mixed messages, telling states and Congress that supplies were on their way while acknowledging those supplies still might fall short. Last week, NIH infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci lamented to lawmakers that the testing effort to date was “a failing,” and CDC Director Robert Redfield told POLITICO he was not confident the U.S. has sufficient supplies of materials needed to prepare samples for testing. Still, Trump repeatedly assured governors that supplies were on the way. Meanwhile, the days have turned to weeks, and the shortages persist. “I feel a little like Charlie Brown and Lucy with the football with the federal government,” said Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The Trump administration on Sunday announced it was teaming with Walmart to provide drive-thru testing in the giant chain’s parking lots, though it is unclear when those testing sites will be ready. Some state officials said they hadn’t received guidance from the administration on those plans and were unclear how they would fit into their broader testing work. They also had concerns about exhausting already limited supplies. “There hasn't been specific messaging to state public health folks about this,” said Minnesota’s Ehresmann, adding that her department found out about the announcement during the White House news conference. “It remains to be seen how that will impact things.” The American Clinical Laboratory Association, which represents commercial labs, reported Wednesday night that its members had completed approximately 43,000 tests to date. That number is up from 27,000 tests on Tuesday — indicating private testing is starting to ramp up, in part due to diagnostic companies like Hologic and Thermo Fisher gaining emergency use authorization from FDA. But private labs are still not meeting demand. ACLA President Julie Khani pressed congressional leaders in a Wednesday letter to establish an “emergency laboratory surge capacity fund of $5 billion” to help labs cover coronavirus testing costs like child care for lab workers and products in short supply, such as swabs and personal protective equipment. States looking to lean on private labs for quick testing results might be disappointed. Quest Diagnostics, which is conducting testing in Marlborough, Mass.; Chantilly, Va.; and San Juan Capistrano, Calif., says it expects patients and providers to get testing results within three to four days of specimen pickup. But a company spokesperson told POLITICO that the timing could slip due to high demand. States that are waiting on reagents or other supplies from the CDC are trying to use workarounds to keep up testing capacity in their public health labs, but it is increasingly challenging. “We're getting reagents wherever we can get them,” Ehresmann said. “The bottom line is our lab has been using several different testing methodologies in an attempt to maximize the testing we can do, and if the supplies for that are running out, we move to the next methodology. We’re constantly trying to keep things moving.” Rob Davidson, an emergency room physician in Michigan and the executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare, said the lack of testing combined with a critical need for manpower leaves patients at risk. Doctors are being told to keep working until they have a fever, even if they are exposed to a patient with the virus. They are being told to use one mask per shift unless it becomes soiled. But because of the lack of testing, there is no way to know whether a doctor contracts the virus until it’s too late. “For God’s sake, just get us more tests,” he said.",States still waiting on coronavirus tests as Trump tells them to do more,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-tests-states-138426,politico
"The coronavirus is exposing potential flaws in America’s financial regulatory system, a decade after a massive overhaul was designed to prevent the next crisis. While U.S. banks have much stronger balance sheets than they did during the 2008 financial crisis, some of the reforms in the so-called Dodd-Frank law passed in 2010 did not anticipate that a devastating pandemic would virtually shut down the global economy. Here’s just one example of the limits of the law: The Federal Reserve is no longer allowed to bail out individual companies, which some argue may hamper the central bank’s power to help mission-critical institutions. On top of that, in recent years the Trump administration and Congress have relaxed regulations, including rules establishing financial cushions that banks must have to support their business and quickly turn assets into cash in a crisis. Many of those decisions from the past decade may make the U.S. more vulnerable than anyone realized. The key things to watch will be whether the nation's banks can follow through on a pledge to keep lending during the meltdown and if risky financial activities that escaped Dodd-Frank's hammer will turn out to have been worthy of greater oversight after all. ""It could all catch up to us,"" said Amanda Fischer, a former aide to the top Democrats on the House Financial Services and Senate Banking committees who now directs policy at a think tank. ""The Coronavirus will expose whether our financial system is resilient or fragile in the face of a severe shock."" Much of the Dodd-Frank law was built around bank solvency, because the lenders were at the center of the 2008 financial crisis. But any coronavirus financial crash threatens to extend to all corners of the economy, including essential services like transportation and medical supplies, and the U.S. government may not have the tools to creatively solve a 2020 problem using a law designed to prevent the 2008 crisis. As the coronavirus panic unfolded, the Trump administration was among the first to second-guess lawmakers' post-crisis restrictions on regulators' bailout authority. While the 2008 meltdown spurred Congress to give agencies many new ways to intervene in the financial system, a political backlash — from Republicans as well as many Democrats — over the rescue of Wall Street banks spurred lawmakers to impose new hurdles if regulators were compelled again to save firms from collapse. Congress limited the Federal Reserve's authority to provide emergency lending to individual companies outside the banking industry, as it had done with the giant insurer American International Group in 2008. Lawmakers also restricted Treasury's ability to guarantee money market mutual funds as it did during the crisis. Dodd-Frank called for the Fed's emergency lending power to be used on a broad basis for several firms at once, not to bail out a single insolvent company. And the central bank would have to seek the Treasury secretary's approval for emergency lending going forward. The restrictions have come to the fore as the Trump administration scrambles for ways to prop up ailing companies, including airlines. ""I am in daily conversations with [Fed Chairman] Jay Powell,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a Fox News interview Sunday. ""We are looking at the tools we have, and they are looking at the tools they have. Certain tools were taken away from both of us after the financial crisis with Dodd-Frank. If we need more tools, we will go back to Congress and get bipartisan support to get that."" Mnuchin's not alone. Hal Scott, who has advocated for financial industry deregulation as director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, argued in The Wall Street Journal that Congress should restore all the powers it took away from the Fed, as well as the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ""Bold action can prevent a panic before it starts,"" he said. Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh called on the Fed to invoke its emergency powers to create a new credit facility to ensure businesses and households have access to cash, a move that could benefit airlines, retailers and energy companies hit by the economic shutdown — not just banks and financial institutions. But if congressional authority is needed to arm the Fed with new bailout powers to rescue failing corporations, expect resistance from lawmakers and howls from Wall Street watchdogs. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and progressive advocates are already warning that any bailouts of big business should be accompanied by higher wages for workers and restrictions on payouts to investors. ""Let me be clear: We're not doing no-strings-attached bailouts that enrich shareholders or pay CEO bonuses,"" Warren said Tuesday. ""Period."" Powell himself said Sunday that the Fed had not made the decision to request further authority from Congress. Fischer, who is policy director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, said the Fed's emergency lending power isn't that constrained. ""The Fed will do what it takes in a downturn to stabilize the financial sector,"" she said. ""Who has standing to sue them to undo it? No one would sue them, no one would challenge them."" Unlike 2008, the banking industry does not appear to be in dire need of a government rescue. How long the industry remains on solid footing will depend on how effectively lawmakers and regulators shored up the banking system over the past decade. Bank CEOs, including Brian Moynihan of Bank of America and Michael Corbat of Citigroup, visited President Donald Trump at the White House on March 11 and repeatedly stressed that their banks are well-capitalized and ready to make loans to businesses and help struggling consumers. But an economy veering toward a recession will test whether the banks' buffers will be enough to help them follow through on those promises. The banks are facing major pressure on their margins from rock-bottom interest rates and will have to deal with borrowers unable to pay back loans. The implementation of the past decade's banking safeguards was a constant lobbying fight, with regulators, banks and consumer groups battling over what constituted adequate capital and liquidity. In 2018, Republicans and moderate Democrats enacted legislation that further eased some of those rules. ""We may have to find out there's well-capitalized for regulatory purposes and then there's well-capitalized in practice — for lending purposes and market purposes,"" said Graham Steele, director of the Corporations and Society Initiative at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a former aide to Senate Banking Committee ranking member Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). ""That's the one tension I'm worried about."" In addition to shoring up the internal operations of the banks themselves, regulators have spent the past several years implementing new powers to oversee a broader set of potential risks in the financial system. One of Dodd-Frank's biggest changes to Wall Street oversight was to regulate derivatives contracts known as swaps that financial firms and nonfinancial firms enter into to hedge risk and place speculative bets. Lawmakers imposed new regulations on the market after uncertainty about derivatives positions led to the near-failure and subsequent bailout of AIG in 2008. The weeks and months to come will pose a major test for the market's primary regulator — the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — and its ability to keep tabs on potential risks that might be building. It has struggled since taking on the new derivatives mandate because of budget cuts imposed by Congress. The CFTC now receives trading data on the swaps market but the agency still doesn't have complete awareness of everything going on, said Justin Slaughter, a former commission official and ex-Senate aide who's now a consultant at Mercury Strategies. ""We’re no longer flying blind, but I wouldn’t say the CFTC has got a truly clear window into what’s going on in real time,"" he said. ""It might be more accurate to say we’re flying with one eye open."" One of the most powerful entities Congress created in 2010 was the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The council, tasked with identifying systemic risks, includes the heads of the Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, FDIC and CFTC. It was empowered not only as a convening body, but also with the power to place ""systemically important"" financial firms under the Fed's oversight and to pressure individual regulatory agencies to implement new rules. Trump's appointees have signaled that they have no intention of using the power to subject new financial institutions to Fed oversight. Coronavirus is the biggest crisis the group has faced yet. Since the pandemic exploded, the council has been quiet. It's scheduled to meet March 23, and lawmakers are now pressing the council to act. ""FSOC does not inspire a lot of confidence,"" Fischer said. ""It's interesting to me the president has taken such a market-centered approach to the pandemic. He's met with Wall Street CEOs. That's clearly the focus of his attention. But there's not been similar attention paid by regulators to market stability.""",The 2008 financial crisis did not prepare us for the 2020 coronavirus crisis,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/2008-financial-crisis-coronavirus-138263,politico

"Coronavirus is starting to drain money from the expensive world of political campaigning.  Campaigns across the country have canceled face-to-face fundraisers for the foreseeable future and are scrambling to figure out how to raise enough money to stay solvent. Big donors' stock portfolios are tanking. And small-dollar, online contributors — who have never been more important to campaigns — are facing sudden financial uncertainty and the real possibility of unemployment.  The severe economic shock from coronavirus could upend the 2020 election. And Democrats see themselves as having more to lose: President Donald Trump bungled the early days of the coronavirus crisis, they say, and while that could cost him politically, the tanking economy will hurt Democrats’ ability to raise the money challengers need to campaign for the White House and other offices in 2020. Trump’s well-stocked reelection campaign has less to lose amid the current financial uncertainty than does Joe Biden, who is emerging from a costly primary, they argue. Major donors from both parties already are beginning to scale back after years of riding high off of a booming stock market, donors and fundraisers told POLITICO.  ""I’m personally postponing anything where more than two people need to get together until we have an understanding of what the dangers are. And in terms of spending money, I’m trying to cut back as much as possible,"" said Democratic megadonor and philanthropist Bernard Schwartz, who has given at least $2.8 million to Democratic causes this cycle, including helping a pro-Biden super PAC.  Biden and Trump are starting to work donors via the phone and video meetups, while anxiety rattles through congressional campaigns and some organizations grow nervous about whether they will be able to stay in the black.  It won't take long until campaigns feel the sting, said Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, which supports down-ballot candidates.  ""I think the thing people don’t realize is that campaigns and organizations — both political and nonprofits — don’t keep that much cash on hand,"" Litman said. ""You’re running month to month. One bad month, you can make it through. Two or three, and it can be catastrophic."" Run for Something has canceled events through mid-June, which Litman estimated will cost the group $450,000, approximately 25 percent of its budget for the year. Both Trump and Biden, who is just beginning to gear up for a general election as the coronavirus rocks the United States, are trying to keep growing their campaigns. And the committees and campaigns associated with House and Senate candidates have canceled almost all upcoming events, they told POLITICO. “Safety is more important than fundraisers or negative ads,” Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. “In-person fundraisers have been canceled and that will affect our bottom line. And we couldn't care less.” “This decision will cost us money,” Scott Fairchild, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, wrote in an email to online donors explaining the committee was canceling all events. “A large chunk of our fundraising is going to dry up. And to compensate for this shortfall, our Democratic Senate campaigns will need the support of this online community more than ever.” Trump’s campaign has canceled a slew of events, including a pair of highly anticipated fundraisers featuring Melania Trump — her first for the reelection campaign — this week in Beverly Hills and next week at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump also last week canceled a trip to Las Vegas for a fundraiser hosted by casino mogul and Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson. “Trump’s fundraising juggernaut is certainly going to slow a bit as the country focuses on survival,” said Republican donor Dan Eberhart. “It may not be evident today, but campaign fundraising is certain to take a hit like every other sector of the economy. There is too much uncertainty for large and small donors alike.” Both Trump and Biden will keep raising money online and via “virtual fundraisers,” held most often through video conferences with donors. Biden has one such virtual event scheduled for Friday. (The transition hasn’t always been easy: The Biden campaign postponed one such event scheduled for this week in New York City amid technical difficulties, CNBC reported.) Earlier this week, the Biden campaign distributed a fresh list of incentives to its top fundraisers to try to keep money flowing in: perks for bundlers who raise $25,000 to $500,000 for the campaign. A fundraiser who raises $25,000 for Biden, known as an “Advocate,” gets “direct contact with Regional Finance Director” and “Inclusion in national leadership councils.” People who raise more money for the campaign — including the $250,000 “Scranton Circle” and the $500,000 “Philly Founder” — receive more perks, including “bi-weekly update calls with campaign leadership” and invitations to quarterly and annual finance committee events. “It may become more 'social distancing' or more draconian down the road, then eventually people will realize we need to move forward with the campaigns as well. Some of that means resources,” said John Atkinson, a Chicago-based bundler for Biden. Meanwhile, some big-name Democrats expected to spend huge sums on 2020, including Silicon Valley investor Ron Conway and businessman Mike Bloomberg, have turned their attention to combating coronavirus. Neither Conway, nor Bloomberg has announced plans to scale back on politics, but to some, the 2020 election suddenly seems like a more distant priority than a few months ago. Todd Schulte, president of the Mark Zuckerberg-backed FWD.us, implored lawmakers to use their small-dollar donor lists for advocacy instead of fundraising in an email to supporters about helping with coronavirus, obtained by POLITICO.  “Use your email lists,” Schulte wrote. “I don’t think I got a single email saying call X member and demand ‘more kits everywhere, mass investment in medical capacity, $1000 to every American, mandatory sick leave, and more.’ No one is going to give much online -- to you or your opponent,” Schulte wrote. Some candidates are letting their small-dollar donors off the hook. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn) included a note to donors about the financial toll the emergency is taking in fundraising emails. “It’s okay not to donate right now,” one email from Smith read. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is now running for Senate, and MJ Hegar, a Democratic Senate candidate in Texas, gave donors the ability to temporarily opt out of fundraising emails during the emergency. Not every candidate, though, has abandoned raising money in person.  GOP fundraiser Alexandra Kendrick said that while the vast majority of her clients have canceled fundraisers — including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who was slated to host a weekend donor retreat in Napa next weekend — two candidate clients are currently planning on going forward with their events. “If it’s me and them sitting at a table with a chicken sandwich, so be it,” Kendrick said. “It’s not about the money, I think. It’s about the routine for them.” Alex Isenstadt contributed to this report.",Coronavirus shock slams campaign fundraising,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-campaign-fundraising-138381,politico
"The coronavirus pandemic has thrown America’s electoral system into shock, prompting officials in six states so far to move presidential primaries as the federal government urges people not to gather in large groups. Connecticut became the latest state to push back its vote on Thursday, and even more states are considering delays. Meanwhile, election officials are also gaming out the changes they can make to voting systems to allow Americans to participate in elections while keeping themselves safe and preventing the spread of the virus. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has urged states not to postpone their primaries and instead embrace expanded voting by mail. But Perez has little authority over how individual states conduct their elections. 23 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and other territories have yet to vote in the presidential contest, and we are tracking developments in every one as the calendar shifts and states puzzle through when — and how — people can vote. Here’s what has happened so far in all the states that were scheduled to vote from mid-March through the end of April. Connecticut (moved from April 28 to June 2) Gov. Ned Lamont announced on March 19 that the state’s primary would be moved to June 2. “In coordination with other states and our Secretary of the State, and in an effort to carry out Democracy while keeping public health a top priority, I have decided to move our presidential primary to June 2nd,” Lamont tweeted. Connecticut law only allows voters to cast ballots by mail with a valid excuse, but Secretary of the State Denise Merrill also said avoiding coronavirus is now a valid excuse for absentee voting in the state. “Secretary Merrill has determined that for reasons of public health, absentee ballots that are requested to avoid public gatherings at polling places are requested because of illness, and should be validly issued,” a statement from her office on March 13 read. Georgia (moved from March 24 to May 19) Georgia was one of the first states to postpone its primary, moving it to May 19. “Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement on March 14. The presidential primary in the state will now be held on the same day as primaries in the state for local, state and congressional offices. Louisiana (moved from April 4 to June 20) Louisiana also postponed its presidential primary, delaying its election until June 20. Notably, Louisiana's new date moves the primary outside of the nominating contest window set by the Democratic National Committee, meaning the state could have its number of delegates cut unless the DNC changes or waives its current rules. ""We will continue to work with every state party as they adjust their delegate selection plans around coronavirus,” a Democratic National Committee spokesperson said in a statement on March 13. “This change would violate our rule on timing which provides that all states hold their contests by June 9. Any violation of our rules could result in a penalty that would include a state losing at least half of its delegates. This change will be reviewed by the Rules and Bylaws Committee."" Kentucky (moved from May 19 to June 23) Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced that he and Gov. Andy Beshear jointly agreed to delay the state's May primary until June 23. ""There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy us time,"" Adams said in his announcement.  Maryland (moved from April 28 to June 2) Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan postponed the state’s primaries to June 2 in response to the coronavirus. “It would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble … and it would put Marylanders at risk,” Hogan said at a March 17 press conference. “I am directing the state board of elections to develop a comprehensive plan by April 3 to conduct the primary election in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process in our state.” One election will still be held on April 28 in the state: The special election in Maryland’s 7th District to fill the seat of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. That election will be mail-in only, and it could be an important test: Activists and some politicians are pushing for mail-in elections to be more widely adopted nationwide as part of the response to the coronavirus outbreak. Ohio (delayed from March 17 to June 2) Ohio was supposed to hold its primary on March 17. But Gov. Mike DeWine’s administration backed a court case to delay the election for public health reasons the day prior, and after a judge ruled the primary should go on, DeWine and his public health director shut down polling places due to a “health emergency.” Following the closure, Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a directive saying the primary was postponed until June 2 and prohibiting county election authorities “from tabulating and reporting any results"" until then. But that doesn’t mean June 2 is set in stone. Ohio’s state legislature is set to meet starting on March 24 to take action on the primary, The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported, with leaders noting that they have the power to set election details. ""The legal authority to change the date rests with the Ohio General Assembly,"" House Speaker Larry Householder wrote in a memo. ""No Ohio voter should ever wonder when they will have the opportunity to exercise their constitutional right to vote."" Meanwhile, the Ohio Democratic Party filed a lawsuit over the move, looking for clarity for the new primary: “Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election. So authority for a new election must come from the legislature or from a court,” party chair David Pepper said. The party’s lawsuit, effectively, asks for a mail-in primary through April 28. Wyoming (April 4) The Wyoming Democratic Party canceled the in-person portion of their caucuses in response to coronavirus. “Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe. Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy, so this is the responsible course of action,"" the state party wrote in a statement. “Voters are highly encouraged to vote by mail; as of now, voters may still vote via ballot pickup and drop off on March 28 and April 4. We will continue to work with public health officials, and assess local conditions, to ensure voters’ health and safety.” Alaska (April 4) Alaska Democrats have not made changes to their party-run primary, which already had a significant mail-in component already. Alaska voters who were registered as Democrats by Feb. 18 had ballots mailed to them that need to be postmarked by March 24, with in-person voting scheduled for April 4. A spokesperson for the state party told POLITICO that the party was “currently in the process of reaccessing” the procedure and said changes were coming soon. Delaware (April 28) Delaware is, for now, continuing on as planned with its election.  “Governor [John] Carney's team is working closely with Elections Commissioner [Anthony] Albence, and we are continuing to move forward with planning, for now,” Carney spokesperson Jon Starkey wrote in an email to POLITICO. “We will continue to move forward — with plans to take additional health precautions to keep Delawareans healthy — until guidance from our public health experts makes clear we cannot safely hold the election on April 28.” Hawaii (April 4) A statement on Hawaii’s office of elections’ website8 says there are “no changes to the 2020 [e]lection schedule at this time.” However, Hawaii conducts its elections largely by mail already, so it may be able to continue as usual without significant disruption. New York (April 28) Discussions about moving New York’s primary have begun, but there is nothing definitive yet. Douglas A. Kellner, co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections, told The New York Times on March 15 that the presidential primary could move to June 23 (the date of other primaries in the state), but that decision would have to be made by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state legislature. But Cuomo said he has not given any thought to the idea yet. “I have virtually no political thoughts at this time and no thought about postponing an election,” he said at a March 17 press conference. However, Cuomo has already delayed all village elections in New York until April 28. “Public health officials have been clear that reducing density is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread, and delaying village elections will help ensure poll workers and voters are not potentially exposed to the virus and at the same time maintain integrity in our election system,” he said in a statement on March 16. Pennsylvania (April 28) Gov. Tom Wolf said the state is considering moving its primary. “I’m not sure what impact it’s going to have on the primary,"" Wolf said at a press conference on March 16. “Obviously, we want to keep people safe, so to the extent that the state needs to move the April 28 date to another date, other states have already done this, Pennsylvania is certainly taking that into consideration.” However, it is not entirely clear if Wolf has the authority to do so on his own. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the clearest way to move the primary would be for the state legislature to do that — but there’s no consensus among lawmakers. Wolf may be able to use his emergency powers to move the primary. Puerto Rico (March 29) Puerto Rico is on the verge of rescheduling its primary. At the request of the island’s Democratic Party, the Puerto Rico Senate passed a resolution on March 16 pushing the primary until April 26, with the potential to further postpone the primary at a later date if the emergency persists. A statement from the party on March 16 said the Puerto Rico House of Representatives is expected to also pass the bill, and Gov. Wanda Vazquez has indicated she will sign the bill. Rhode Island (April 28) Election officials in the state are split on what to do. The state board of elections voted on March 17 to ask Gov. Gina Raimondo to postpone the presidential primary from April 28 to June 2 — but Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea’s office is recommending the April 28 primary stay in place as a “predominantly mail-ballot” election. The governor’s office told the Associated Press that Raimondo was “open to the idea” of moving the primary following the board’s vote. Wisconsin (April 7) Wisconsin is in a tougher situation than other states: Not only is the presidential primary scheduled for April 7, but so are general elections for state and local offices, including state Supreme Court and mayor of Milwaukee. Gov. Tony Evers has beaten back calls to postpone the election. ""How long do we potentially leave offices unfilled because we’re into July or August and we haven’t held a general election?"" he asked reporters on a conference call on March 17, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Evers has urged voters to vote absentee. Meanwhile, the Wisconsin Democratic Party and the DNC have filed a lawsuit to expand voting access. The suit seeks to extend electronic and mail registration to April 3, axe photo ID and residency document requirements for absentee ballot and registration requests, and extend the mail-in deadline to count votes postmarked by Election Day and received within 10 days of the election. Mark Jefferson, the chair of the state GOP, put out a statement: “The best course of action during elections in times of crisis is to ensure equal access to the polls, not to suspend all common-sense regulations that ensure fair elections in a democracy,” he said. “We call on local election officials to make early-voting available immediately and we are exploring what legal options may be available. Suspending rules that ensure fair elections is simply not an acceptable solution.” Alice Miranda Ollstein and Elena Schneider contributed reporting.",Everything to know about states moving and changing their primaries over coronavirus,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/state-elections-primaries-changes-coronavirus-138393,politico
"Washington is poised to blast more than $1 trillion into the U.S. economy to help offset the devastating effects of the coronavirus, which has locked down much of the nation and rocked businesses large and small. It might not be nearly enough. As forecasts darken with estimates for huge spikes in unemployment and sharp drops in economic growth, economists and Wall Street analysts are warning that even the huge stimulus package now under consideration on Capitol Hill may only make a small dent. Some suggest the number needs to be at least $2 trillion or perhaps far more. “They should be doing much more than they are thinking about and doing it much quicker, at least $2 trillion with the promise of more to come,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “We have whole industries like the restaurant industry that have been obliterated already. Jobless claims next week could be two or three million.” Shepherdson added that “we could see a drop of 5 million jobs in April. We are going to see numbers we never thought possible. This will be the biggest economic hit that any developed economy has ever seen outside wartime.” Calls for much bigger stimulus are coming from across the partisan spectrum. Former Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Narayana Kocherlakota has suggested a package of at least $2.5 trillion. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has proposed at least $2 trillion. Former White House adviser Anthony Scaramucci, who has broken with the administration, suggested the current package was far too small. He’s calling for more than $3 trillion. “This is literally like a combo of 9/11, the global financial crisis and an invasion of every nation’s homeland,” he said Thursday on CNN. “$1 trillion is six weeks’ worth of firepower. We need six months’ worth of firepower.” The reason so many want to see bigger numbers is mostly just simple math. “$1.2 trillion in pure terms is going to cover about two to three weeks of economic activity,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. “So if this were going to last just that long, $1 trillion might be enough. But really it’s only a down payment.” Slok added that “we need to flatten both the virus curve and the recession curve. So this would be a good start. But if the virus persists we may need far more stimulus.” Concern among those who say the current package is too small is driven mainly by fear that mass layoffs and business closings are already happening but have yet to show up in national economic data. That means if and when the virus crisis abates and Americans are able to go back to their regular lives, many will have no jobs and no income. And the rapid economic snap-back the White House is promising will be impossible to achieve. Most Americans work for the kind of small and mid-size employers that are most at risk of failing before they receive any federal assistance. “We don’t have time here. We need the business sector to be there when we need them again in June or July or heaven forbid September,” said Shepherdson. “So I’d like to see a package where businesses can just keep people on and pay them for two months even if they don’t do anything so they are still there when this is over.” White House officials continue to say that while the second quarter of this year will be bad, economic activity will quickly revive. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he thought the economy could emerge “stronger than ever before.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also promised a quick recovery in an appearance on Fox Business Network, forecasting a “gigantic fourth quarter” as Americans release “pent-up demand” and return to “a normal world.” But economists are increasingly worried the recovery could be much slower following mass layoffs and a wave of bankruptcies expected from small businesses like restaurants and bars that cannot survive the current lockdown of the American public. Wall Street is counting on Washington to quickly pass the next rescue package, warning that failure would cause massive sell-offs across financial markets. But some are also warning that Washington will have to come back and inject more money into the economy to avoid a long and deep recession. “How do you go to some people and say, ‘Sorry it’s a pandemic, tough luck,'” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities. “It’s almost like you have to bail out everyone. You can’t pick out winners and losers. Because this is nobody’s fault. That’s where that $1.2 trillion gets in trouble in my mind, because there is more damage than that out there.” The current figures being discussed, including proposals of around $1.2 trillion, are not without their defenders as at least a first step in trying to avoid a total economic collapse. “I do think the spread will be less bad because of what we’ve all done in the last week and the recovery a bit faster because of what is in process,” said Jason Furman, former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. “Over the last week I have not upgraded my assessment of the virus — I expected it to spread and be devastating. But I have upgraded my assessment of the government’s response. And that makes me feel just a little bit better about all of it.” But many analysts believe the current stimulus figure is based on an unrealistic assumption that normal life will resume in a matter of weeks when it actually may take months to flatten the virus curve and develop treatments and then even longer for a vaccine. “My rule of thumb with a stimulus package is you don’t match the economic damage. That’s not enough,” said Jim Caron of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “You need to do something on the order of twice that. So something like $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion could be the right number.” But more than the raw number, Caron said any stimulus package must immediately address the needs of small and midsize businesses that are seeing their revenues vanish — in some cases to zero. “Small and midsize businesses create 65 percent of employment. And consumption is 70 percent of the economy,” he said. “You’ve got to make sure those businesses are still there and people have jobs to go back to. And that means loans and other facilities that make money available to keep these businesses afloat. And that’s at least being discussed and that’s critical.” Defenders of the current plan note that the stimulus being considered by Congress is not the only firepower being deployed. The U.S. Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates to essentially zero and opened up programs last deployed during the 2008 financial crisis to shore up financial markets and make loans more available to credit-worthy businesses. Still, some public policy groups say even with the Fed’s actions, Congress should err on the side of doing much more than it’s currently considering. “Given the sharp rise in unemployment we will likely see in coming weeks, there is an enormous risk that our fiscal policy response will be too small to cushion the blow to individuals and families or to significantly affect the downward trajectory of the economy,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in a report. “The risk of an inadequate response — resulting in significant hardship to families that can’t make ends meet and a considerably deeper and longer recession — vastly exceeds the risk of doing ‘too much.’”",‘It’s only a down payment’: Why a $1 trillion stimulus may not be enough ,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/why-coronavirus-stimulus-may-not-be-enough-138368,politico
"After being sidelined for much of the Trump administration, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams has suddenly emerged as a key player in its messaging about the coronavirus outbreak, often echoing the president’s arguments and winning his favor. Now a regular on Fox News and other programs, Adams routinely flanks President Donald Trump at news briefings and has amplified the White House’s line as it shifted from reassuring to more severe. “We’ve created a number of new stars, including the gentleman right behind me,” Trump said on March 14 at a White House news conference, turning to Adams. “I watched him the other day. It was such a fantastic job you did, and I really appreciate it.” Until this month, Health and Human Services leaders had worked to limit Adams’ portfolio, worried that the voluble doctor would go off-script and fail to coordinate his messaging, said four officials in the health department who spoke on condition of anonymity. Adams also had been one of several officials who had fallen out of favor with HHS Secretary Alex Azar, who instead leaned on Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health and Adams’ boss, to carry out some responsibilities that might have otherwise gone to the surgeon general. Meanwhile, the nation’s top doctor wasn’t added to the White House coronavirus task force until Vice President Mike Pence — Adams’ former boss as Indiana governor — took over the response from Azar three weeks ago. The high-profile, high-pressure job has placed a spotlight on an anesthesiologist who has long vowed that “health is apolitical and so am I.” But part of his success has come by paralleling Trump’s own questionable claims about coronavirus and break from other public health officials. Appearing on the March 2 edition of “Fox and Friends,” the surgeon general said he remained “convinced that more people are going to die by far from the flu than from coronavirus — not only in our country, but across the planet.” At the time, public health officials were urging Americans to stop comparing the new outbreak to the flu, noting that it minimized the risk of the far more deadly coronavirus, but Trump had used the comparison to allay concerns.  A spokesperson for Adams defended the comparison, telling POLITICO it “is not a case of either-or — both diseases can be deadly if we aren’t vigilant.” Adams on March 8 also said on CNN that he and other Trump officials “actually feel pretty good that some parts of the country have contained [coronavirus], just like when you look at the flu.” The interview came after Trump and other advisers on March 6 claimed the virus was contained — which it is not, as the president has since conceded. “That’s not under control for any place in the world,” Trump said on Monday.  In that same CNN interview, the 40-something Adams said that the 73-year-old Trump is “healthier than what I am” — a comment that drew snickers, given the roughly 30-year age gap. Adams’ allies said he was just responding to a question about the president’s relative risk for coronavirus and that the disease’s severity can be affected by pre-existing conditions, like Adams’ asthma. Adams last weekend delivered another controversial message: He scolded the media and appeared to encourage journalists to change their focus.  “No more bickering, no more partisanship, no more criticism or finger-pointing,” the surgeon general told reporters assembled at the White House. “There will be plenty of time for that.” A spokesperson for Adams said that he was attempting to encourage the media “to help share the facts and basic precautions” about the outbreak. Meanwhile, some of Adams’ warnings seem prescient, like a tweet last weekend urging hospitals to cancel all nonessential procedures to focus on coronavirus. While industry leaders privately called Adams alarmist and publicly wrote a letter of complaint, their thinking shifted amid the fast-moving outbreak, and on Wednesday, hospital groups agreed that they would scale back their services.  Adams also has used his platform to call for blood donations, enlist social media influencers, offer instructions on handwashing and hammer home the need for extensive social distancing — even beyond the 15-day time period previously announced by the White House. ""Fifteen days is likely not going to be enough to get us all the way through,” Adams said on Wednesday in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" show. “But we really need to lean into it now so that we can bend the curve in the next 15 days, and at that point we'll reassess.” The White House praised Adams’ work on coronavirus. ""President Trump has built an incredible team that is helping coordinate our whole-of-government response and that includes the Surgeon General,"" a spokesperson said in a statement to POLITICO, adding that Adams has also been leading on other priorities like fighting vaping, opioids and HIV. Spokespeople for Azar and Adams said the two men have a good working relationship.  “Secretary Azar agrees the surgeon general has an important role in communicating with the American people, educating them on appropriate measures to protect against viral infections, and calming fears,” an HHS spokesperson said. “Surgeon General Adams has been involved with the secretary’s briefings for weeks, and the secretary has always been supportive of the surgeon general’s advisories and initiatives.”  The surgeon general also has fans across the aisle. Adams is, indeed, “one of the stars of the Trump administration,” said Rebekah Gee, a Democrat who worked with Adams before she stepped down as Louisiana health secretary in January. Gee also praised Adams’ apolitical approach, including in the current coronavirus crisis. “He is doing a good job.” Adams first came to national prominence when then-Indiana Gov. Pence tapped him in 2014 to be the state’s health commissioner. The two men soon worked closely together to tackle Indiana’s 2014-2015 HIV outbreak, which was among the nation’s worst in years — and was compounded by Pence’s decision not to take swift action.  The issue was further complicated because the HIV outbreak was most severe among people who injected drugs, and Adams had to overcome opposition, including from Pence, to begin a needle-exchange program that has since been credited with helping contain the disease. “It's not always possible to get people to do what you think needs to be done by telling them what you think needs to be done,” said Joan Duwve, who served as Indiana’s chief medical officer and worked under Adams during the HIV outbreak. “I think that's probably where we were in the state of Indiana. … Jerome facilitated the necessary dialogue.” Adams ended up spending much of 2015 in the field, several former colleagues said, demonstrating skills that could be useful to navigate the current coronavirus outbreak. “Jerome took the time to understand everyone’s perspectives so he could then bring consensus around an issue — which was based on science and best practice,” Duwve added. Five years later, a similar needle-exchange program is now part of the Trump administration's goal to end the nation’s HIV epidemic by 2030 — despite long-standing conservative opposition. ""The fact that these evidence-based interventions are now part of a major national response to reduce HIV transmissions is probably a lesson learned from the Indiana outbreak,"" said Greg Millett of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. Adams joined the Trump administration in 2017, where he’s tried to straddle politically sensitive issues like gun violence — an issue that bogged down his predecessor, Vivek Murthy — and kept a relatively low national profile. Adams also had little interaction with the president until the current outbreak. But his high-profile remarks during Trump’s coronavirus response have raised eyebrows from media critics like Brian Stelter. The CNN host on Sunday devoted a segment to rebutting Adams’ call that reporters hold off on “criticism” during the coronavirus outbreak. “I need him to do his job, focus on keeping the country as healthy as possible, and do not lecture the media on how to handle this,” Stelter said during the show. A former staffer said that Adams’ remarks were likely misconstrued. “I think that was his frustration as a public health official coming out,” said Joey Fox, an Indiana consultant who worked closely with Adams in that state’s health department. “I’m sure he wants the news 24-7 to be blaring, ‘stay the hell home.’” But Adams’ remarks were amplified by pro-Trump media, including Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro. “I was cheering you on,” Pirro told Adams last weekend. “I think that the finger-pointing that's been going on against this administration — when we are dealing with something new, something we've never dealt with before, something we're not actually built to deal with — you came out and said, ‘Enough. Let's just do it.’""",Trump’s new public health 'star',2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/surgeon-general-jerome-adams-coronavirus-138397,politico

"The Department of Veterans Affairs is preparing to deploy 3,000 doctors, nurses and other emergency personnel — along with mobile hospitals and pharmacies — to bolster the nationwide effort to combat the coronavirus, Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie told POLITICO on Thursday. The VA, which runs 170 veterans hospitals and 135 community living centers around the country, is designated as the backup health system to the military in the event of war. But it is also authorized to assist in natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or in this case, a pandemic. The VA is ""preparing for a national call on this matter,"" Wilkie said in a telephone interview, likening the personnel to military reservists who can be called up by the president at any time. ""They know that they can be deployed anywhere in the country. Just like the reserves, their physicals are up to date, their shots are up to date. That prepares them to launch when called upon."" Asked if he has any timeline on when they might be needed, Wilkie said, ""we haven't come to that point yet."" But he said the agency is gaming out where they might be most needed. For example, ""city X has this happen, what is the request from the governor, and how do you respond to that governor's request that comes through,"" Wilkie said. One of the main purposes of the National Disaster Medical System, as it is known, is ""to assist state and local authorities in responding to medical and public health effects of major disasters and emergencies,"" according to the VA. This crisis poses numerous challenges, including the fact that some of the VA's emergency medical personnel are likely already treating patients with the virus — and the number of cases in veterans hospitals are expected to grow. That is a double-edged sword because it means some already have experience with the outbreak but they also might be needed where they are. ""They've been responding to natural disasters, so that's their forte,"" Wilkie said. ""But they're also working in hospitals now where they're dealing with this virus."" The emergency cadre includes ""doctors, nurses, psychologists, engineers, nutritionists, police,"" Wilkie said. ""In addition to that, we are able to provide a mobile hospital. We're able to provide command posts. We're able to provide nutrition centers, medical vans, mobile pharmacies to support those needs."" Beyond providing additional medical personnel, if necessary the VA health system could also make available extra hospital capacity. ""If the president so chooses,"" Wilkie said, ""we would augment civilian capabilities when it comes to medical space available."" In the meantime, the VA is trying to minimize the spread of the virus in its own medical facilities, including barring family visits, reducing routine appointments, and delaying dental and elective surgeries. The steps are all designed to cut down on social interaction but also free up resources for what is expected to be an increase of the virus among veterans. ""We were the first system in the country to start triaging people before they even entered,"" Wilkie said. Barring visitors for elderly veterans ""is a terrible thing because the majority of those 7,800 who are in those living centers come from World War II and Korea. And we had to make the painful choice in order to protect them,"" Wilkie said. So far, Wilkie reports that 85 veterans ""we know of"" have the virus. Of those, 50 are recuperating at home. ""They didn't need to be admitted to our hospitals,"" he said. But he said ""we expect a lot more"" veterans suffering from the coronavirus. ""We'll see a jump in the next few days, as the rest of the country.""","VA secretary: VA preparing to deploy 3,000 medical personnel for virus response",2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/veterans-affairs-coronavirus-138513,politico

"A majority of Americans now approve of President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, as the administration has issued stricter federal guidelines in recent days and the president has adopted a more public-facing role in combating the disease. An ABC News/Ipsos poll released Friday reports that 55 percent of respondents approve of Trump's management of the public health crisis, while 43 percent disapprove. The latest figures represent a boost in the president's rating from the previous iteration of the survey, published one week ago, which showed only 43 percent approval for Trump and 54 percent disapproval. The uptick in public sentiment comes in the wake of a variety of measures the president has taken since last Friday to combat the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States. Trump has been widely criticized for his initial response to the pandemic as well as his adminitration's inability to quickly ramp up testing in the U.S. Trump has declared a national emergency, expanded the European travel ban, urged people to avoid group gatherings of more than 10 people, signaled his support for dispensing checks to affected Americans, and invoked the Defense Production Act — although he has stopped short of actually triggering the statute. The president has also often led the daily press briefings of the White House coronavirus task force, announcing new federal actions, taking questions from reporters and generally appearing more solemn regarding the nature of the threat facing the country.  Governors on the front lines of the outbreak have praised the administration's increased engagement, while still demanding a more robust, all-encompassing federal response and the delivery of sorely needed medical equipment in anticipation of the coronavirus' overrunning of local health care systems.  But Trump has largely placed the onus back on governors to acquire those potentially life-saving supplies, telling reporters Thursday that the federal government is ""not a shipping clerk.""",Poll: Majority of Americans now approve of Trump's coronavirus management,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/poll-majority-of-americans-now-approve-of-trumps-coronavirus-management-138570,politico

"Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Friday that ""more needs to be done"" to make coronavirus testing widely available across the U.S. even as the Trump administration ramps up its efforts to check Americans for exposure to the illness. ""Clearly, more needs to be done, but we are rapidly getting to the point where we will have many, many tests out there available for virtually everyone,"" Fauci said in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" show. The remarks from the nation's top infectious disease expert represent an improvement in his assessment of the administration's testing system, which he characterized during congressional testimony last week as a ""failing."" While President Donald Trump's initial management of the pandemic has been widely condemned by state leaders and public health experts, the most criticized aspect of the administration's early response was its inability to quickly mount a large-scale testing operation and track tests that had migrated to local health care providers. But Trump and members of the White House coronavirus task force over the past week have touted increased levels of cooperation with the private sector that they say will make screening more accessible, while cautioning that the new wave of tests will result in an explosion of new cases. ""Early on, as I've said, it wasn't the way it should've been. But we're really now very much in the right direction, flooding the system with it,"" Fauci said Friday. ""There are going to be people, for sure, who will call in and say they can't get tested. It's not a perfect system yet, but we're getting there very rapidly."" The president has largely attributed the testing deficiencies to his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, arguing that the federal agency was unprepared to tackle an outbreak of this magnitude. He has also claimed without evidence that former President Barack Obama's administration shares blame for the shortfall, remarking last week that ""I don't take responsibility at all.""","Fauci: 'Clearly, more needs to be done' on coronavirus testing",2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/fauci-clearly-more-needs-to-be-done-on-coronavirus-testing-138636,politico
"The Sustainability Spotlight is an extension of the Global Translations newsletter. Each week we track major issues facing the globe. Sign up here. The coronavirus pandemic is about to show us the truth behind the ESG — Environment, Social and Governance — commitment of many companies.  Despite facing massive economic turbulence, airlines cleared the way for the world’s civil aviation authority (ICAO) to adopt its carbon offset scheme, known as CORSIA, as planned last weekend. But Alexis Crow, head of PwC’s geopolitical investing practice, warns that for some companies, “their power to deliver” on climate change commitments “may be eroded” by coronavirus. To retain overall ESG credibility, Crow said it’s crucial for companies to consider how the social aspect of ESG is implemented if they are putting their environmental work on hold.  The U.S. private sector has so far led the way globally — for better and worse. American companies are helping more staff work from home than anywhere else, but they're also firing workers and refusing them sick leave in massive numbers. Some of the world’s richest companies (including Amazon) don’t offer sick leave to some staff, while billionaires who burnish their progressive image are asking staff to go on unpaid leave (Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic).  Companies and governments struggling to ensure an effective social contribution can turn to organizations like the Social Progress Index (SPI), a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit that sucks in data from all over the world to present open source quality of life indicators. Organizations from the European Commission to the Indian prime minister’s think-tank and local authorities around Silicon Valley are using SPI’s data to redirect their resources. While SPI focuses purely on social data, CEO Michael Green says there are economic lessons to draw from the data. “Long-term economic success is built on strong social foundations,” he said, adding that “we can also point to a lot of supply chain risk” through social data.  With coronavirus now slamming into the American economy, and potentially trillions in bailout support about to become available, SPI has good timing with its next target: getting U.S. states and local authorities to see and address widely diverging levels of social progress. SPI gives Massachusetts scores of 64 in its index, and Mississippi just 27. HOW GREEN IS YOUR BAILOUT? By the end of next week, we will likely have more than $3 trillion in financial commitments on the table from governments around the world aimed at stabilizing the global economy.  While South Korea’s ruling party this week upped its existing plans for a Korean Green Deal in its platform ahead of an April 15 election, and a group of Democratic senators in the United States wants to place green conditions on airline bailouts, few have rushed to make green projects a feature of emerging stimulus and bailout plans. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has made green noises in the stimulus debate — ”we must keep our promises for people and planet” — but has no power.  Green skeptics on both sides of the Atlantic have wasted no time pushing for delays or cuts to climate initiatives. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš wants Europe to “forget about the Green Deal'' and Poland requested the bloc’s carbon trading scheme be paused. Some U.S. oil refiners are preparing to ask the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone a government-mandated shift requiring retail fuel stations to sell only cleaner-burning gasoline to minimize air pollution in the warmer months, starting on June 1.  Wherever the economic stimulus money goes, it will dwarf the resources that have been on offer to stabilize the planet. Even at the height of global generosity, Ed King of the Global Strategic Communications Council (GSCC), a climate network, points out that rich nations pledged $100 billion a year in climate finance to poorer nations. They never delivered the cash. “After years of saying there was no cash, it turns out there is lots,” King said in an emailed statement. CORONAVIRUS MEETS CLIMATE CHANGE MAILBOX Zack Colman asked two frontline players — Bill McKibben, activist and co-founder of 350.org, and Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) — what the pandemic tells us about the climate challenge.  “It means that we should always remember the physical world is, in a word, real — you can't spin or negotiate or compromise with the physics of climate change any more than you can with the biology of Covid-19 ... If we'd started 30 years ago we could have easily 'flattened the curve' of temperature rise. If you want to bail out oil companies, banks, and airlines, make damned sure that they're forced to commit to meeting the Paris targets. It means listen to scientists.” — Bill McKibben “It means that the need to get our citizenry focused on the urgency and seriousness of the climate issue takes a backseat to the pandemic. The global pandemic demonstrates in very understandable terms that a problem on one continent will find its way to other continents, with serious economic and public health consequences.” — Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) BIODIVERSITY IS DOWN WHILE DISEASE OUTBREAKS ARE UP: Hundreds of disease outbreaks occur each year. While the intense connections generated by globalization explain some of that disease spread, so do environmental shifts: namely loss of biodiversity and climate change. Deforestation has been linked to three out of every ten recent disease outbreaks.

"BEIJING — China has exonerated a doctor who was officially reprimanded for warning about the coronavirus outbreak and later died of the disease, a startling admission of error by the ruling Communist Party that generally bodes no challenges to its authority. The party’s top disciplinary body said the police force in Wuhan had revoked its admonishment of Dr. Li Wenliang that had included a threat of arrest. It also said a “solemn apology” had been issued to Li’s family and that two police officers, identified only by their surnames, had been issued “disciplinary punishments” for the original handling of the matter. In death, Li became the face of simmering anger at the ruling Communist Party’s controls over information and complaints that officials lie about or hide disease outbreaks, industrial accidents, natural disasters and financial frauds, while punishing whistleblowers and independent journalists. After seeing thousands of new cases daily at the peak of the city’s outbreak a month ago, Wuhan on Friday had its second consecutive day with no new confirmed or suspected cases. The National Health Commission said all of the 39 new cases recorded Friday in China were brought from overseas, showing that rigid travel restrictions and social distancing requirements appear to have had their desired effect. China has loosened some travel restrictions in Hubei, the province surrounding Wuhan, although its provincial border remains closed and Wuhan itself remains under lockdown. Officials say they will only lift the quarantine after Wuhan goes 14 consecutive days with no new cases. Police in December had reprimanded eight doctors including Li for warning friends on social media about the emerging threat. China’s supreme court later criticized the police, but the ruling party continued to tighten its grip on information about the outbreak. The party has faced similar accusations of bungling or thuggish behavior following previous disasters. They include the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a 2005 chemical spill that disrupted water supplies to millions of people in China’s northeast, sales of tainted milk that sickened thousands of children and the failure of private finance companies after the global economic crisis. In each case, officials were accused of trying to conceal or delay information people said they needed to protect themselves. The party often responds by allowing the public to vent temporarily, then uses its control of media and the internet to stifle criticism. Critics who persist can be jailed on vague charges of spreading rumors or making trouble. The treatment of Li’s case may reflect concerns among the leadership about public anger over the failure to properly honor the sacrifices of front-line health workers while praising the party and its head, Xi Jinping, who has tightened controls on society since taking power in 2012. The most powerful Chinese leader since at least the 1980s, Xi gave himself the option of remaining president for life by changing the Chinese constitution in 2018 to remove a two-term limit. In Wuhan, local leaders were accused of telling doctors in December not to publicize the spreading virus in order to avoid casting a shadow over the annual meeting of a local legislative body. As the virus spread, doctors were ordered to delete posts on social media that appealed for donations of medical supplies. That prompted complaints authorities were more worried about image than public safety. Li was detained by police after warning about the virus on a social media group for his former classmates.",China exonerates doctor reprimanded for warning of virus,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/china-exonerates-doctor-reprimanded-for-warning-of-virus-138637,politico

"Washington is poised to blast more than $1 trillion into the U.S. economy to help offset the devastating effects of the coronavirus, which has locked down much of the nation and rocked businesses large and small. It might not be nearly enough. As forecasts darken with estimates for huge spikes in unemployment and sharp drops in economic growth, economists and Wall Street analysts are warning that even the huge stimulus package now under consideration on Capitol Hill may only make a small dent. Some suggest the number needs to be at least $2 trillion or perhaps far more. “They should be doing much more than they are thinking about and doing it much quicker, at least $2 trillion with the promise of more to come,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “We have whole industries like the restaurant industry that have been obliterated already. Jobless claims next week could be two or three million.” Shepherdson added that “we could see a drop of 5 million jobs in April. We are going to see numbers we never thought possible. This will be the biggest economic hit that any developed economy has ever seen outside wartime.” Calls for much bigger stimulus are coming from across the partisan spectrum. Former Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Narayana Kocherlakota has suggested a package of at least $2.5 trillion. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has proposed at least $2 trillion. Former White House adviser Anthony Scaramucci, who has broken with the administration, suggested the current package was far too small. He’s calling for more than $3 trillion. “This is literally like a combo of 9/11, the global financial crisis and an invasion of every nation’s homeland,” he said Thursday on CNN. “$1 trillion is six weeks’ worth of firepower. We need six months’ worth of firepower.” The reason so many want to see bigger numbers is mostly just simple math. “$1.2 trillion in pure terms is going to cover about two to three weeks of economic activity,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. “So if this were going to last just that long, $1 trillion might be enough. But really it’s only a down payment.” Slok added that “we need to flatten both the virus curve and the recession curve. So this would be a good start. But if the virus persists we may need far more stimulus.” Concern among those who say the current package is too small is driven mainly by fear that mass layoffs and business closings are already happening but have yet to show up in national economic data. That means if and when the virus crisis abates and Americans are able to go back to their regular lives, many will have no jobs and no income. And the rapid economic snap-back the White House is promising will be impossible to achieve. Most Americans work for the kind of small and mid-size employers that are most at risk of failing before they receive any federal assistance. “We don’t have time here. We need the business sector to be there when we need them again in June or July or heaven forbid September,” said Shepherdson. “So I’d like to see a package where businesses can just keep people on and pay them for two months even if they don’t do anything so they are still there when this is over.” White House officials continue to say that while the second quarter of this year will be bad, economic activity will quickly revive. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he thought the economy could emerge “stronger than ever before.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also promised a quick recovery in an appearance on Fox Business Network, forecasting a “gigantic fourth quarter” as Americans release “pent-up demand” and return to “a normal world.” But economists are increasingly worried the recovery could be much slower following mass layoffs and a wave of bankruptcies expected from small businesses like restaurants and bars that cannot survive the current lockdown of the American public. Wall Street is counting on Washington to quickly pass the next rescue package, warning that failure would cause massive sell-offs across financial markets. But some are also warning that Washington will have to come back and inject more money into the economy to avoid a long and deep recession. “How do you go to some people and say, ‘Sorry it’s a pandemic, tough luck,'” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities. “It’s almost like you have to bail out everyone. You can’t pick out winners and losers. Because this is nobody’s fault. That’s where that $1.2 trillion gets in trouble in my mind, because there is more damage than that out there.” The current figures being discussed, including proposals of around $1.2 trillion, are not without their defenders as at least a first step in trying to avoid a total economic collapse. “I do think the spread will be less bad because of what we’ve all done in the last week and the recovery a bit faster because of what is in process,” said Jason Furman, former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. “Over the last week I have not upgraded my assessment of the virus — I expected it to spread and be devastating. But I have upgraded my assessment of the government’s response. And that makes me feel just a little bit better about all of it.” But many analysts believe the current stimulus figure is based on an unrealistic assumption that normal life will resume in a matter of weeks when it actually may take months to flatten the virus curve and develop treatments and then even longer for a vaccine. “My rule of thumb with a stimulus package is you don’t match the economic damage. That’s not enough,” said Jim Caron of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “You need to do something on the order of twice that. So something like $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion could be the right number.” But more than the raw number, Caron said any stimulus package must immediately address the needs of small and midsize businesses that are seeing their revenues vanish — in some cases to zero. “Small and midsize businesses create 65 percent of employment. And consumption is 70 percent of the economy,” he said. “You’ve got to make sure those businesses are still there and people have jobs to go back to. And that means loans and other facilities that make money available to keep these businesses afloat. And that’s at least being discussed and that’s critical.” Defenders of the current plan note that the stimulus being considered by Congress is not the only firepower being deployed. The U.S. Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates to essentially zero and opened up programs last deployed during the 2008 financial crisis to shore up financial markets and make loans more available to credit-worthy businesses. Still, some public policy groups say even with the Fed’s actions, Congress should err on the side of doing much more than it’s currently considering. “Given the sharp rise in unemployment we will likely see in coming weeks, there is an enormous risk that our fiscal policy response will be too small to cushion the blow to individuals and families or to significantly affect the downward trajectory of the economy,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in a report. “The risk of an inadequate response — resulting in significant hardship to families that can’t make ends meet and a considerably deeper and longer recession — vastly exceeds the risk of doing ‘too much.’”",The government’s multitrillion-dollar problem,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/why-coronavirus-stimulus-may-not-be-enough-138368,politico
"The Pentagon and the White House, in the weeks leading up to the president’s national emergency declaration on Friday, quarreled over the response to the coronavirus outbreak that was sweeping the country. Defense Department leaders urged measures such as restricting troop travel in order to contain the virus. But other administration officials pushed back, arguing against any “rash” steps that could have political ramifications and economic impact, defense officials told POLITICO. It wasn't until President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13 that leaders began to coalesce around a strategy. Trump’s comments served as a “green light” for DoD leaders to take more aggressive steps such as providing medical equipment, putting field hospitals on alert and making preparations to dispatch the military’s twin hospital ships to virus hotspots, said the defense official. “We’re muddling through,” one defense official said.  This story is based on interviews with half a dozen current and former defense and administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the last few weeks of sensitive discussions. From the start of the crisis, Defense Secretary Mark Esper has given his deputies — the service chiefs, combatant commanders and civilian leaders — flexibility to issue guidance to a mammoth force of almost 3 million people, including 1.3 million active-duty military and their families. And in recent days, senior Pentagon officials advised Esper to talk more about the Pentagon’s efforts to protect all Americans — not just military personnel — in his public comments, according to a former administration official.  Esper obliged, making appearances on Fox News, CNN and in the White House briefing room to lay out a number of steps the department is taking to support the coronavirus response. “I want to assure all of your viewers that the United States military remains ready and capable of defending the American people, protecting the nation and safeguarding our interests abroad,” Esper said on Fox News on Tuesday. But absent clear direction from the White House, the Pentagon’s initial internal response to the crisis, was ad hoc. In recent days, officials have scrambled to prepare the Navy's hospital ships, USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy, to help relieve pressure on civilian hospitals, defense officials said. Despite Trump’s assertion that the ships are “in tip-top shape,” the Comfort, homeported in Norfolk, Va., has been in pierside maintenance since December after returning from a five-month deployment and will not get underway until April 2. Meanwhile the Mercy, based out of San Diego, will be able to launch to its West Coast destination, either in California or Washington State, on Monday. Defense Department spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman pushed back on the notion that the Pentagon’s initial response wasn't carefully planned. ""The Department has been planning and executing against the Coronavirus since the first cases were reported in January,” Hoffman said. “What is inaccurately characterized as an 'ad hoc' approach is instead a deliberate effort to balance mitigation and prevention with the need to defend our nation.""  The White House did not respond to requests for comment. In its efforts to get the Comfort underway as soon as possible, the Navy’s Military Sealift Command, which is responsible for the hospital ships, has been forced to defer ""a small amount"" of scheduled work on the vessels until a later date, a Navy spokesperson said. Guidance on domestic and international travel for troops also trickled out in a disjointed fashion over the past few weeks. U.S. Central Command, which oversees the Middle East and Afghanistan, canceled all leave and liberty travel for U.S. troops serving in the region on Feb. 27. On the same day, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command postponed a major exercise with South Korea, and the Navy ordered all ships that have visited countries in the Pacific region to remain at sea for 14 days in order to monitor sailors for any symptoms.  But DoD-wide travel restrictions did not go into effect until March 11, when Esper banned movement of DoD civilians and families traveling to, from or through “Level 3” locations — such as South Korea, Iran and Italy — for 60 days. In some ways the Department of Defense has been ahead of the curve on the coronavirus crisis. Even before the first cases were reported in South Korea on Feb. 2, the commander of U.S. Forces Korea began enforcing strict measures in January, including testing, self-isolation and social distancing. The Defense Department has also been conducting regular, sometimes twice-daily, press briefings on the crisis in recent days, sending senior officials such as Esper, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, National Guard Bureau Chief Gen. Joseph Lengyel and others to the podium to talk about the department’s response. This is a sharp contrast to the State Department, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been criticized for a lack of transparency. But until this week, department leaders were not always on the same page. While Esper believes commanders and service leaders are in the best position to make major decisions for their forces, he has given explicit instructions to those officials that any major decision needs to be communicated up the chain of command, officials say.  After being blindsided on multiple occasions over the past few weeks, Esper has had to intervene at lower levels to ensure the department presents a unified front, three current and former defense officials tell POLITICO. “It comes back to: we shouldn’t learn about these through media channels or them becoming public,” said one defense official.“But the last thing we want to do is hamstring those commanders.” After the Army on March 8 preempted DoD in ordering a halt to the movement of troops and their families into and out of Italy and South Korea, Esper was forced to step in, two defense officials said. The secretary stressed to Army leadership the need to keep him and the Joint Chiefs informed of any new guidance, according to the officials. The Pentagon on Monday banned all domestic and international travel through at least May 11. Esper intervened once more over the weekend after the Army considered freezing basic training for new recruits amid concern about virus spread, according to three defense officials. The Washington Post first reported the Army's move. Esper met with the leaders of the armed services on Monday to discuss the issue, ultimately deciding to continue basic training while taking precautionary measures, one of the defense officials said. Hoffman noted the complexity of the issue, saying “the Coronavirus situations in the more than 150 countries DoD has forces around the world are different, have progressed at different paces and require different solutions."" ""That is exactly why Secretary Esper has delegated the authority to issue enhanced force protection guidance to local commanders,"" he said. Since Monday, Esper and the rest of the department have spent a good bit of time in front of cameras. Speaking alongside Trump on Wednesday, Esper said that in addition to preparing the hospital ships, which are equipped with 1,000 beds each, he has alerted field and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as needed to support the response. These capabilities are designed for trauma and other combat injuries, Esper stressed, and will be used to relieve pressure on civilian hospitals treating coronavirus victims.  Separately, the Pentagon has opened its 16 certified coronavirus testing labs to test non-DoD personnel; will make available up to 5 million respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from its own reserves; and will distribute up to 2,000 deployable ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services, Esper said. “We have plans in place. We've been implementing them now for several weeks. And we're also wanting to lean forward and support again, the whole government approach to assist the American people,” Esper said on Fox.",Trump’s wobbly coronavirus response leaves Pentagon playing catch-up,2020-03-19,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/19/trump-pentagon-coronavirus-defense-138095,politico

"The State Department is beginning to put together charter flights for Americans stranded overseas during the coronavirus pandemic, with Morocco and Peru scheduled soon — even as others stuck in Guatemala took matters into their own hands. The rush to bring Americans home comes after the State Department announced a level four travel advisory Thursday, and amid reports of potentially thousands of Americans stuck in multiple countries without commercial flights or that had shut their borders. The first flights out of Morocco, which closed its borders on March 14, started Friday morning, according to the U.S. embassy there. U.S. citizens are able to hop a flight from Marrakesh for $1,485. The flights will stop in London before landing in 10 different U.S. cities. Stranded Americans — citizens and legal permanent residents only — must sign up by emailing [email protected] Congressional offices were alerted of the flights Thursday night, according to one aide who received details via a State Department email. Congressional staff also received an email saying that Avianca Airlines, a Colombian air carrier, has created an online page where the hundreds of Americans stranded in Peru can sign up for flights home. Others, tired of waiting for the U.S. government to act, took matters into their own hands, in some cases crossing over the border from Guatemala into Mexico to catch flights that are still operating. Two people stuck in Guatemala, which has also closed its borders to flights, told POLITICO that they had purchased tickets from Avianca this week which were canceled, and that the airline had ignored their calls afterward. Avianca did not respond to a request for comment. President Donald Trump also said Thursday that the U.S. military is working on getting people out of Peru, but didn't mention any other countries specifically.

"Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Friday that “more needs to be done” to make coronavirus testing widely available across the United States, even as the Trump administration ramps up its efforts to check Americans for exposure to the illness. “Clearly, more needs to be done, but we are rapidly getting to the point where we will have many, many tests out there available for virtually everyone,” Fauci said in an interview on NBC's “Today” show. The remarks from the nation’s top infectious disease expert represent an improvement in his assessment of the administration’s testing system, which he characterized during congressional testimony last week as a “failing.” While President Donald Trump’s initial management of the pandemic has been widely condemned by state leaders and public health experts, the most criticized aspect of the administration’s early response was its inability to quickly mount a large-scale testing operation and track tests that had migrated to local health care providers. But Trump and members of the White House coronavirus task force over the past week have touted increased levels of cooperation with the private sector that they say will make screening more accessible, while cautioning that the new wave of tests will result in an explosion of cases. “Early on, as I’ve said, it wasn’t the way it should’ve been. But we’re really now very much in the right direction, flooding the system with it,” Fauci said Friday. “There are going to be people, for sure, who will call in and say they can’t get tested. It’s not a perfect system yet, but we’re getting there very rapidly.” The president has largely attributed the testing deficiencies to his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, arguing that the federal agency was unprepared to tackle an outbreak of this magnitude. He has also claimed without evidence that former President Barack Obama’s administration shares blame for the shortfall, remarking last week that “I don’t take responsibility at all.”","Fauci: ‘Clearly, more needs to be done’ on coronavirus testing",2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/fauci-clearly-more-needs-to-be-done-on-coronavirus-testing-138636,politico
"A majority of Americans now approve of President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, as the administration has issued stricter federal guidelines in recent days and the president has adopted a more public-facing role in combating the disease. An ABC News/Ipsos poll released Friday reports that 55 percent of respondents approve of Trump’s management of the public health crisis, while 43 percent disapprove. The latest figures represent a boost in the president’s rating from the previous iteration of the survey, published one week ago, which showed only 43 percent approval for Trump and 54 percent disapproval. The uptick in public sentiment comes in the wake of a variety of measures the president has taken to combat the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States. Trump has been widely criticized for his initial response to the pandemic, as well as his adminitration’s inability to quickly ramp up testing across the country. Since last Friday, Trump has declared a national emergency, expanded the European travel ban, urged against group gatherings of more than 10 people, signaled his support for dispensing checks to affected Americans, and invoked the Defense Production Act — although he has stopped short of actually triggering the statute. The president has also often led the daily press briefings of the White House coronavirus task force, announcing new federal actions, taking questions from reporters and generally appearing more solemn regarding the nature of the threat facing the U.S.  Governors on the front lines of the outbreak have praised the administration’s increased engagement, while still demanding a more robust, all-encompassing federal response and the delivery of sorely needed medical equipment in anticipation of the coronavirus’ overrunning of local health care systems.  But Trump has largely placed the onus back on governors to acquire those potentially life-saving supplies, telling reporters Thursday that the federal government is “not a shipping clerk.”  He has also denied responsibility for the administration’s testing failures in the early stages of the outbreak, instead blaming without evidence former President Barack Obama and attributing the shortfall to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey published Tuesday showed that more Americans disapprove of the way Trump is handling the coronavirus than those who approve, 49 percent to 44 percent, and few trust in the information they hear from the president about COVID-19. The ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted March 18-19, surveying 512 adults. Its margin of sampling error is plus or minus 5 percentage points.",Poll: Majority of Americans now approve of Trump’s coronavirus management,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/poll-majority-of-americans-now-approve-of-trumps-coronavirus-management-138570,politico
"The scarcity of surgical face masks and other protective equipment for health workers has quickly become the most urgent problem facing those on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. Manufacturers are ramping up production of masks, gowns and gloves, but there will be a lag before the new supplies can reach hospitals already struggling to care for infected patients. Earlier this week, Vice President Mike Pence called on construction companies to donate their dust masks – which are identical to the ones used by doctors and nurses -- to their local hospitals. But there’s another source of protective medical equipment that hasn’t yet been discussed: Dentists and veterinarians. With the right financial incentives, dentists and vets can help bridge this critical gap. Dentists and veterinarians use the exact same personal protective equipment as other medical workers, and they adhere to rigorous OSHA guidelines for surgical masks, gloves, and various sanitization materials. With an estimated 200,419 dentists and 71,060 veterinarians in the U.S. workforce primarily in private practice, there exists an inventory of readily available medical equipment in dental and veterinary offices that could reinforce the strained supply chain. But here’s the problem: Most dental and veterinary offices are small businesses. Despite recommendations from the American Dental Association, many dental offices are staying open during the crisis; they share the concerns of fellow small business owners in staying financially solvent and keeping employees on the payroll. Many are holding off as they await details of the small business loans included in the Senate’s COVID relief legislation, to see if they can afford to close. Meanwhile, their valuable medical supplies—such as face masks—have not been redirected towards hospitals.  Rather than hope for good will, federal and state governments should quickly implement policies to incentivize dentists and veterinarians to contribute their medical supplies to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Here are two ideas for doing that:  A direct buy-back program. Federal, state and local governments could offer to purchase personal protective equipment from dental and veterinary clinics and directly cut a check to the businesses. This would provide dentists and vets quick revenue at a time that they may be strapped for cash; this would allow them to close while redistributing their inventory to hospitals. While the ideal buy-back program would be at market rate or cost-plus pricing, the costs of such a plan may be less politically palatable given the already high level of estimated federal spending on COVID relief and economic stimulus. An alternative would be for governments to offer to purchase the protective equipment at a percentage of Medicare rates instead. (A similar policy could also be implemented for individual hoarders of protective equipment, but at a lower rate to discourage their practice.) A “war bonds” style bond exchange. Historically, war bonds were federally-backed patriotic debt securities purchased by citizens to finance the war efforts of World Wars I and II. Citizens purchased bonds to generate federal monetary supply in exchange for a guaranteed return on their security with interest at a lower rate. In echoing a war time call to combat disease, modeling a similar initiative for protective equipment could incentivize donations faster and at lower cost to the government than a direct buyback. Here’s how a bond program could work: the government could set the value of a “COVID bond” at a discounted Medicare rate for the protective equipment and guarantee a set rate of interest. For example, if you donated $100 worth of masks, the government would issue you a bond currently valued at $80 with a guaranteed rate of 2.5% interest a year. At the end of a 15-year term, the bond would be valued at $115.86. Dentists and vets could either hold onto the bonds or, if they needed short-term capital, sell the bonds on a secondary market to other individuals for cash. These options would benefit both sides: Hospitals would receive a short-term influx of protective equipment , while private dental and veterinary offices could utilize the funds to cover fixed costs and offer employees leave. This way, dentists and vets could immediately contribute to addressing the public health emergency at a time when they are already seeing fewer patients already and benefit when demand and productivity resumes.  With hospital supplies nearing critical levels, the federal government must use creative policy tools to bolster dwindling supplies of protective equipment. Tapping existing inventory of masks, gowns and gloves in dental and veterinary offices can bridge the gap in the availability of personal protective equipment as we wait for supply chains to ramp up.

"The U.S. and Mexico on Friday agreed to temporarily close the border to nonessential travel in response to the coronavirus outbreak, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. U.S. and Mexican officials have been in talks this week over how to ensure that trade and essential travel is not disrupted at the border. It’s a similar move to the U.S. and Canada’s decision on Wednesday to impose travel restrictions at the northern U.S. border. “Both countries know the importance of working together to limit the spread of the virus and ensure the commerce that supports our economy continues to keep flowing,” Pompeo said in a White House press conference. “The United States is glad to have a friend that is working side-by-side with us in the fight.""  The U.S.' agreement with Mexico and Canada to restrict non-essential travel will go into effect on Saturday. Pompeo and Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard finalized details on the travel restrictions on Thursday night after frequent talks this week, sources familiar with the talks said. Ebrard, for his part, wrote on Twitter on Thursday night that he has pressed to ensure that measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus “don’t paralyze economic activity and that the border continues to be open to commerce and work.” Still, the coronavirus outbreak — and travel restrictions — could disrupt the $1.7 billion in U.S.-Mexico trade that takes place every day. “We’ve already seen it get more expensive for truckers to take loads of goods from the border up north,” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) told POLITICO. Cuellar explained that a lot of truck drivers typically fly into Laredo and pick up loads of goods from Mexico at the border to distribute to retailers across the country. Laredo is already seeing a significantly smaller number of truck drivers flying in, he said. But the Texas Democrat said he’s received assurances from the Trump administration that they are trying not to disrupt trade with any new travel restrictions. Trucks and trains will continue to cross the border to deliver goods between the two countries, he said. Cuellar said he’s been in touch with acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan to ensure the administration understands what constitutes essential travel at the border, given that there’s many Mexicans that “live in Nuevo Laredo and they come work here [in the U.S.] or people that come to buy medicine here that’s essential.” “It’s been a top priority to ensure that while, yes, we help stop transmission of the virus, we still keep balance of trade — especially given that we trade with Mexico a million dollars a minute,” Cuellar said. Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf said Friday that North American trade would not be affected by the U.S.' agreement with Canada and Mexico to partially close the border. ""Let me be clear that neither of these agreements with Canada or Mexico applies to lawful trade or commerce. Essential commerce activities will not be impacted. We will continue to maintain a strong and secure economic supply chain across our borders,"" Wolf said.  Meanwhile, Mexican officials have been working overtime to ensure that business goes on as usual between the two countries given that they are top trading partners. Mexican Undersecretary for North America Jesus Seade said he spoke with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Thursday to ensure any border measures don’t affect trade. Trump was also quick to emphasize on Friday that his administration is treating both Mexico and Canada the same in working together to combat the coronavirus. ""We are treating the borders equally, the northern border and the southern border. They're being treated equally. A lot of people say they are not being treated equally. They are,"" Trump said. Earlier this week, Trump said his administration plans to remove migrants and asylum seekers that cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally — a move that would be separate from the nonessential travel ban. He said he would invoke a law that allows the U.S. surgeon general to turn away people or goods to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.","U.S., Mexico to partially close border ",2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/us-mexico-ready-to-partially-close-border-138946,politico
"Top Senate Republican and Democratic negotiators — joined by senior Trump administration officials — kicked off talks Friday on a massive, third stimulus package to salvage the economy, as the coronavirus outbreak continues to ravage the country. The negotiators are meeting this morning in the historic Hart 216 room, where Supreme Court nominations and crucial hearings often are held. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said they aim to have an agreement in principle by the end of Friday.  “I tasked these bipartisan teams to reach agreement by the end of the day today, tonight,” McConnell said. “We’ll need Saturday to be drafting what we’ve agreed to … We’ll need tomorrow for Legislative Counsel to draft the agreement. And as [Mnuchin] has indicated, it is important for us to be on the Senate floor and pass the measure by Monday.” The talks come a day after Senate Republicans introduced their $1 trillion stimulus package to save the U.S. economy by assisting individuals, small businesses and industries that have been hit hard by the pandemic.  But Senate Democrats have already raised concerns with the GOP proposal, saying it benefits businesses and industries while not doing enough for working people.  “We need to work together quickly and do something big and bold that helps the American people,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), before the start of the meeting. “Sen. McConnell’s bill is not pro worker at all, it puts corporations ahead of people.” Schumer, who spoke to President Donald Trump Friday morning, asked the president to use the Defense Production Act for more medical equipment, including ventilators, according to Schumer’s spokesperson.  After speaking with Schumer, Trump said he had an “extremely good” conversation with the minority leader and expressed optimism about the “Phase 3” stimulus deal.  ""We were working on various elements of the deal, and the Democrats are very much wanting something to happen, and the Republicans likewise are very much wanting something to happen. And I think it will,” Trump said at a daily press briefing of the White House coronavirus task force. He didn’t address the Defense Production Act. He added that he also spoke at length with McConnell.  Among the key provisions of the GOP package is a plan to provide direct cash payments to individuals of up to $1,200 and families of up to $2,400, based on income. In addition to direct cash payments, the GOP stimulus plan gives small businesses $300 billion in federally guaranteed loans and $200 billion for loans for industries, including airlines.  The structure of the payments are a potential issue even for some Republican members. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has panned the idea of direct cash payments broadly, while Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) are calling for the package to be fixed, after expressing concern that its structure doesn’t sufficiently benefit lower income Americans.  “Americans urgently need cash to meet immediate needs, that’s been my goal from the start,” Romney said in a tweet Thursday night. “The current bill has promise but it shouldn’t give lower earners smaller checks — that’s directly contrary to my proposal. We need to fix this to ensure lower earners get equal payments.” Senate Republican aides are signaling they’re open to making changes during negotiations.  Meanwhile, Democrats are calling for expanded unemployment insurance and paid leave, as well as more assistance for hospitals. White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland reiterated that the administration wants to see lawmakers pass the package by Monday. “Hopefully we’ll be done in a relatively quick fashion,” Ueland told reporters Friday, adding the administration is “looking for swift action, swift conversation, swift resolution and hopefully swift accomplishment by Congress on behalf of the American people.” In addition to Ueland, Trump administration officials participating Friday include former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  The Republican senators attending the talks are McConnell, Senate Banking Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho.), Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Senate HELP Committee Chair Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Senate Aging Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine), Small Business Committee Chair Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Senate Commerce Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.).  Among the Democrats participating are Schumer, Senate Commerce Committee Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore), Senate Small Business Committee Ranking Member Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) , Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.). Senate HELP Committee Ranking Member Patty Murray is participating by phone.  Lawmakers are trying to move as quickly as they can and are expected to work through the weekend. McConnell has vowed the Senate will not leave Washington until a deal is reached.

"Larry Edgeworth, a longtime NBC News employee, died Thursday after being diagnosed with the coronavirus, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack told staff in a memo Friday morning. Edgeworth most recently worked in an equipment room at NBC News' 30 Rockefeller Plaza headquarters in New York, ""but prior to that he spent most of his 25 years at NBC News as a skilled audio technician, often traveling to the most remote locations,"" Lack wrote in his memo, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO.  ""Many of you were fortunate enough to work with Larry over the years, so you know that he was the guy you wanted by your side no matter where you were,"" Lack wrote. Employees were notified on Wednesday that Edgeworth had tested positive for COVID-19, but his identity was withheld at the time for privacy reasons. Edgeworth's wife said he ""suffered from other health issues that led him to succumb to the illness,"" Lack wrote. Edgeworth is survived by his wife, Crystal, and two sons. ""We are doing everything we can to support his family during this very difficult time,"" Lack wrote. The announcement of Edgeworth's death prompted fond remembrances Friday from NBC News reporters and colleagues. Andrea Mitchell, NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent, described Edgeworth as a ""gentle bear of a man"" and the ""heart and soul of our extended NBC family."" ""I was always cheered and reassured knowing he was on the team in the field. He always had my back whether here in the U.S. or in the most dangerous situations around the world,"" Mitchell said in a statement.

"Mike Bloomberg is sending $18 million from his defunct presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee, a dramatic investment from in the national party that appears to push the boundaries of campaign finance law. The money will support the DNC’s “Battleground Build-Up 2020” program, the DNC’s initiative in 12 swing states across the country. The money could fund potentially hundreds of organizers in those swing states. “This will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help Democrats win up and down the ballot,” DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement. The DNC has made early, historic investments in our battleground and general election programs, and the additional organizers we're putting on the ground will significantly bolster those efforts and help make sure Donald Trump is a one-term president.”  The massive transfer signals a change of plans for Bloomberg, who is nixing an earlier idea to form his own super PAC to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. ""While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the President accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution,' an unsigned memo circulated by the Bloomberg campaign read. ""The dynamics of the race have also fundamentally changed, and it is critically important that we all do everything we can to support our eventual nominee and scale the Democratic Party’s general election efforts."" A press release accompanying the memo said that staff in six battleground states will be ""employed and paid"" through the first week in April and have ""full benefits"" through the end of that month. Bloomberg would not be able to give the DNC such a massive sum of money as a regular donor. But presidential candidates are allowed to transfer unlimited amounts to their national party committee — though usually those candidates have raised the money from donors operating under campaign finance limits. Bloomberg self-funded his whole presidential campaign from his personal fortune. The memo from Bloomberg’s operation said that it would be transferring the money, and a Democratic official noted that federal candidates’ campaign committees can transfer an unlimited amount of money to a party committee. This, however, has rarely if ever been done with a candidate who exclusively self-funded their own campaign. “They put money into their campaign with the full intent of winning the nomination, and put it in before Super Tuesday,"" Graham Wilson, a lawyer for the DNC, said. He argued the transfer was not “not breaking new ground on the law.”  A Bloomberg spokesperson said that the transfer would appear on the campaign’s next FEC filing in April, meaning the money was transferred sometime this month. The Bloomberg campaign also announced that it would transfer “several” of its former field offices to state parties.",Bloomberg makes massive $18M transfer from campaign to DNC,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/mike-bloomberg-massive-18m-transfer-dnc-138771,politico
"Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) on Friday asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review stock sales he made weeks before the markets began to tank in response to the coronavirus pandemic — a move designed to limit the fallout from an intensifying political crisis. Burr, who chairs the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee, defended the sales, saying he “relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks"" and disputed the notion he used information that he was privy to during classified briefings on the novel coronavirus. Burr specifically name-checked CNBC’s daily health and science reporting from its Asia bureau. “Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, I spoke this morning with the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,” Burr said in a statement. Burr, who is retiring at the end of 2022, has faced calls to resign from across the ideological spectrum since ProPublica reported Thursday that he dumped between $628,000 and $1.72 million of his holdings on Feb. 13 in 33 different transactions — a week before the stock market began plummeting amid fears of the coronavirus spreading in the U.S.  The North Carolina Republican has also come under fire for a secret recording obtained by NPR from Feb. 27, in which he issued a much more dire warning to a group of attendees at a private luncheon about the potential outbreak than the prognosis he was offering publicly at the time. Both liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and conservative Fox News host Tucker Carlson have called on Burr to step down. Carlson said ""there is no greater moral crime than betraying your country in a time of crisis"" and said Burr should resign and face prosecution for insider trading, if the report is true. Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, said it was ""stomach-churning"" that someone would think to ""profit off this crisis."" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is up for reelection this year in the Tar Heel state, didn’t go so far as to ask for Burr’s resignation, but did say Burr owes an explanation — and the pending Ethics probe now gives Tillis, and others, some cover to call for the investigation to play out. “Given the circumstances, Senator Burr owes North Carolinians an explanation. His self-referral to the Ethics Committee for their review is appropriate, there needs to be a professional and bipartisan inquiry into this matter, which the Ethics Committee can provide,” Tillis tweeted. The Ethics Committee, which is chaired by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), is made up of three Republicans and three Democrats. The panel is notoriously slow and rarely takes punitive action against its peers, but with the Capitol focused on battling coronavirus — and some members limiting their interactions or being forced to go on self-quarantine — the probe could move at even more of a snail’s pace. Burr has acknowledged making at least one financial decision based on what he’s heard from federal officials: he said in 2009 that he encouraged his wife to withdraw cash from the ATM after hearing from Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson amid the 2008 financial crisis. If Burr traded stocks based on information that was not available to the public, it could not only be an ethics issue, but a criminal matter as well. The 2012 STOCK Act prohibits members of Congress from insider trading. Former Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) was sentenced to 26 months in prison for his role in an insider trading case. Collins was a major investor in Innate Immunotherapeutics and even pitched the stock to fellow members. But Collins allegedly told his son about the firm's failed drug trial months before it was public, allowing his family members to dump their shares before the stock collapsed. Burr's committee was receiving regular classified briefings on coronavirus at the time of the stock sales, according to Reuters, but Burr has insisted that he used public reports to make investment decisions. In an initial statement, a spokesperson for Burr confirmed the transactions but noted they took place before the market volatility. “Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak,"" his spokesperson said. ""As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy."" Burr also punched back at the NPR report on Twitter Thursday, calling it a ""tabloid-style hit piece"" and noting it was a publicized event that included ""many non-members, bipartisan congressional staff, and representatives from the governor’s office."" Burr is not the only one under scrutiny for their recent trading practices: Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) sold off more than $1 million in stocks in the days and weeks following a private coronavirus meeting — then bought shares in a company that offers teleworking software, according to the Daily Beast. Loeffler, who is on the ballot this fall, was a wealthy business executive before being appointed to Congress late last year and is married to the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. “This is a ridiculous and baseless attack,” Loeffler wrote on Twitter. “I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement.”",Burr moves to quell fallout from stock sales with request for Ethics probe,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/sen-richard-burr-requests-ethics-probe-into-his-stock-sales-138768,politico
"The deadline for filing tax returns will be postponed three months, to July 15 because of the coronavirus outbreak, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced today. The decision comes after complaints over the administration’s previous plan to give people who owe the IRS an additional 90 days to pay, without penalties or interest, yet still require them to file returns by April 15. Many called that plan confusing, with lawmakers on both sides urging the administration to synchronize the dates. Tax preparers, meanwhile, said social distancing guidelines related to the pandemic would make it hard for many to meet the April 15 deadline. People may not be able to gather needed documents or confer with accountants. And services like the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance clinics — which help low-income people file returns — have been curtailed or closed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Senate Republicans unveiled plans Thursday to postpone the filing deadline as part of their stimulus legislation now pending in Congress.  At President Donald Trump’s direction, Mnuchin tweeted, “We are moving Tax Day from April 15 to July 15. All taxpayers and businesses will have this additional time to file and make payments without interest or penalties.” He urged people expecting refunds to file ""now to get your money.""

"The Trump administration has held up $40 million in emergency aid Congress approved earlier this month to help American Indians combat the coronavirus — a delay that’s left tribal leaders across the nation frustrated and ill-equipped to respond to the fast-growing outbreak. The funding has languished in bureaucratic limbo for weeks, despite increasingly urgent pleas from tribal organizations desperate to stockpile essential supplies and keep health clinics operational. Federally run American Indian health facilities are well short on hospital beds and ventilators, some frontline clinics received fewer than a dozen coronavirus tests, and federal officials have already signaled there will be little in the way of reinforcements — telling tribal leaders that all they can send right now are expired respirators. That’s fueled alarm throughout American Indian country and on Capitol Hill, where advocates warn the administration has done comparatively little to protect American Indians as it plans drastic action elsewhere to protect vulnerable populations and slow the virus’ spread. “We’re already the poster child for the most vulnerable populations in this country,” said Stacy Bohlen, the CEO of the National Indian Health Board, which represents tribal governments. “This is not the place you want to skimp on resources if you want to hold the tide on this disease.” The funding holdup is the latest hiccup in the federal government’s response to an outbreak that is poised to overwhelm American health care. It’s also a setback for the Indian Health Service, the $6 billion health agency primarily responsible for serving roughly 2.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, more than a quarter of whom are uninsured. The IHS has come under fire over the last several years for poor medical care, untrained staff, leadership turnover and, more recently, an investigation over reports that it failed to prevent a pediatrician from sexually assaulting young patients despite repeated warnings. An IHS spokesperson told POLITICO that the agency is working with HHS and the CDC to determine how best to allocate the $40 million, but did not provide a timeline for distributing the funds. There are four confirmed coronavirus cases among American Indians so far, and on Thursday, a Cherokee Nation citizen became the first person in Oklahoma to die from the virus just a day after testing positive. “For months, we watched this virus from afar,“ said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. “We hope people understand this has now hit home and is a very real pandemic that can affect anyone of us.” But a widespread shortage of tests has largely prevented tribes from monitoring for the virus, which they worry could spread rapidly through their tight-knit communities. And most American Indians and Alaska Natives now live in urban areas, where American Indian health organizations are already running low on medical supplies and funding. In hard-hit Seattle for example, one health center anticipates losing $734,000 a month during the response effort — assuming it doesn't first run out of supplies and be forced to close. Other frontline urban American Indian facilities reported receiving fewer than a dozen coronavirus tests. The initial $8.3 billion coronavirus response package President Donald Trump signed into law March 6 allocated $40 million to help support American Indian care providers. Administration officials have since touted to tribal leaders the cash infusion as extraordinary for its inclusion of urban American Indian organizations and indicative of how serious Washington is approaching the outbreak. Yet the money remains hung up as officials at IHS and the CDC debate how to solve an obscure appropriations hurdle. Congress initially allocated the aid as grants through the CDC, despite warnings from tribal organizations and some House staffers that it could invite bureaucratic snafus, two people with knowledge of the process said. Congressional appropriators say they inserted specific language to avoid issues and ensure tribes were eligible for the funding.  “We checked with CDC when we were finalizing the language,” said Evan Hollander, a spokesperson for the House Appropriations Committee.  But the CDC has since told tribal organizations that it can’t distribute the funds because it doesn’t have the necessary funding relationship with the IHS hospitals, tribal-run health facilities and urban American Indian organizations that are supposed to receive it. Tribal leaders said the CDC has also balked at their idea to set up an inter-agency transfer that would deliver the money to IHS directly, questioning whether it has the authority for such a transfer A CDC spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the funding, saying only that the agency is working across the administration and with tribal organizations to “finalize a plan to allocate these funds and maximize public health impact and reach to tribal populations.” The IHS has also said there's another problem. Even if it received a direct funding transfer from the CDC, it could not simply hand over the money to tribes and urban American Indian organizations because the legislation structured the funds as grants, which requires a more complex process. Federal officials haven’t yet offered other alternatives for freeing up the money, and have remained vague about the funding’s status in conversations with tribes. “Health providers across Indian Country are risking their lives on the front lines of this crisis,” said Meredith Raimondi, a spokesperson for the National Council of Urban Indian Health, which supports health services for American Indians living in urban areas. “We don’t know what the delay is.” The delay comes as the Trump administration races to pour resources into the broader national response, promising a “whole-of-government” effort aimed at reinforcing frontline hospitals and ramping up production of ventilators and face masks. On a conference call last Friday, IHS officials, led by chief medical officer Michael Toedt, told House and Senate staffers that the agency’s health system had 625 hospital beds available nationwide, including just six ICU beds and 10 ventilators, according to three people with direct knowledge of the discussion. There are another 772 beds available across tribal-run health programs, he said, according to one person on the call. Tribes rely heavily on IHS facilities, which provide many health care services to American Indians and Alaska Natives for free. Over a quarter of the tribal population in the U.S. is uninsured, more than double the national rate. Toedt days later reportedly revised IHS’ capacity figures on a press call for media outlets that cover Native issues. But IHS also warned at least one Hill office that the agency doesn’t have accurate information readily available because reporting is optional for tribal programs, and IHS was still collecting data from its regional offices, according to a person briefed on the call. IHS has since told POLITICO that as of Thursday, the agency had 37 ICU beds and 1,257 hospital beds across both IHS facilities and ones run by tribal organizations themselves, as well as 81 ventilators. Pressed further on IHS’ readiness, one IHS official characterized the agency as a “shoestring operation.” At another point, Toedt downplayed the threat by telling staffers that “IHS believes this virus will be slower to reach Indian country,” according to a person on the call. “It was quite scary, to be very frank,” said the person, who left the discussion shaken. Another person on the call blamed chronic underfunding of the IHS for the agency’s dire assessment. “They’re working out of a hole that is so deep it’s really kind of unfathomable,” that person said. An IHS spokesperson noted that the agency’s annual budget is less than one-sixth what tribal leaders estimate is needed to fully fund the American Indian health system. When asked about Toedt’s comments on the virus’ spread, the spokesperson emphasized that IHS has “always been clear that this is a rapidly evolving situation.” The IHS has also made few promises to organizations running low on critical protective equipment and medical needs, just as the rest of the health care industry struggles to stock up ahead of an expected wave of patients. Unlike states, American Indian organizations cannot easily draw on the federal Strategic National Stockpile designed specifically to aid the response to a public health emergency. Instead, the IHS told tribal organizations in recent weeks that its National Supply Service Center, created in 1981 to aid tribal needs, will release two models of respirators to help bridge the gap. However, it warned, the respirators are already expired. IHS confirmed those details, telling POLITICO that the broader health department is “inundated” with supply requests from all over the country. “To address ongoing nationwide shortages IHS has offered, at no cost, N95 respirators that have exceeded their manufacturer-designated shelf life, in accordance with CDC guidelines,” the IHS spokesperson said. The CDC has said expired N95 respirators may offer more protection than surgical masks. In a survey published Tuesday by the National Indian Health Board, just 16 percent of its tribal leaders, providers and partners reported receiving federal resources of any form to aid the response. Even fewer — 4 percent — had received basic protective equipment. “We don't know what this really looks like,” Bohlen said of the virus’ impact on Indian country. “Because we don’t have the tools necessary — like the rest of America — to figure out what is going on here.”",Exclusive: Emergency coronavirus funds for American Indian health stalled,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-american-indian-health-138724,politico
"The 1.3-million member United Food and Commercial Workers union endorsed Joe Biden today, giving the former vice president another boost as he seeks to finish off the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The union’s endorsement came after Biden this week swept primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. In a written statement to POLITICO, UFCW President Marc Perrone said Biden is best equipped to help guide vulnerable service workers through the coronavirus crisis.  “At a time when UFCW members in healthcare, food retail, packing, and processing are on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak, the vice president has again stood by our side by calling for paid leave and designating these brave workers as first responders,” Perrone said. On Thursday Biden encouraged states to classify grocery store workers as emergency personnel, making them eligible for certain benefits like free child care. UFCW adds to a growing list of union endorsements for Biden, including the National Education Association, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and the International Association of Fire Fighters. Initially reluctant to endorse any candidate in the crowded primary, unions have lately been rallying around Biden as he gains a commanding delegate lead. “In good times, UFCW workers are critical to keeping our families well-fed and well-supplied,“ Biden said in a written statement. “Their employers and our entire country should rally around these workers and ensure they receive the benefits and protections they need.“  Biden was one of several candidates to show up at UFCW picket lines in Boston last year to support striking Stop & Shop workers.",Biden lands food workers' endorsement,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/biden-lands-food-workers-endorsement-138727,politico
"House minority leader Kevin McCarthy complained Thursday that the decision by his homestate governor to institute a statewide shelter-in-place order was premature and made without input from other state leaders. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Thursday ordered nearly 40 million residents to stay home, making it the first state to order the restrictive mandate as coronavirus cases surge across the U.S. The order is effective immediately and remains in place “until further notice,"" the governor said. ""We do think there was an ability to do this without shutting down the entire state,"" McCarthy told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday. ""I hope he consulted with a lot of experts before he just made this decision."" McCarthy, whose California district includes Bakersfield and the San Joaquin Valley, said his state produces ""essential things"" necessary for the national coronavirus response. And the state's massive population, he suggested, could have an outsize impact on the already struggling U.S. economy when it stays home en masse. ""You know how serious this virus is and how contagious it is. But California is 12 percent of the nation's population. There are essential things that are produced in California that when you think of the pharmaceutical industry and others based in San Francisco,"" McCarthy said. ""I would have thought the governor would have called a number of us to consult and talk to us why he would make this decision. I know I never did get a call from him. Maybe he feels there's a need behind it."" Under Newsom's order, Californians can leave home for essential purposes such as purchasing groceries, prescriptions, health care, and jobs deemed essential. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who issued the same order for his city hours before Newsom's statewide measure, saw the action as necessary for preventing overwhelmed hospitals in coming days.  ""We wanted to act quickly, and I'm so glad our governor acted for the entire state because the data showed us very clearly two days for some cities, maybe six to nine days for others, we are all about to be overwhelmed in our hospitals,"" Garcetti said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""But things we can do right now allow us all to be first responders and potentially take this fate of this virus in a different direction."" But Garcetti said residents are still encouraged to go outside, visit parks and go hiking while abiding by the order — a measure the mayor predicts will last for a couple of months.  ""You can go out, just don't go out with a group of your family to get things at the grocery store. Don't pack yourselves together in a car. Really abide by this,"" Garcetti said.  He continued: ""This won't just be a couple of weeks. In my opinion it will be at least a couple of months. I know that that's really jarring and tough for folks initially. But I do think people will come together in a way, remember those things that we love and those people we love in a way we haven't done for a long time.""",McCarthy complains he wasn't consulted ahead of California's shelter-in-place order,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/kevin-mccarthy-slams-gavin-newsoms-stay-at-home-order-for-californians-138690,politico

Big donors' stock portfolios are tanking. And small-dollar, online contributors — who have never been more important to campaigns — are facing sudden financial uncertainty and the real possibility of unemployment.  The severe economic shock from coronavirus could upend the 2020 election. And Democrats see themselves as having more to lose: President Donald Trump bungled the early days of the coronavirus crisis, they say, and while that could cost him politically, the tanking economy will hurt Democrats’ ability to raise the money challengers need to campaign for the White House and other offices in 2020. Trump’s well-stocked reelection campaign has less to lose amid the current financial uncertainty than does Joe Biden, who is emerging from a costly primary, they argue. Major donors from both parties already are beginning to scale back after years of riding high off of a booming stock market, donors and fundraisers told POLITICO.  ""I’m personally postponing anything where more than two people need to get together until we have an understanding of what the dangers are. And in terms of spending money, I’m trying to cut back as much as possible,"" said Democratic megadonor and philanthropist Bernard Schwartz, who has given at least $2.8 million to Democratic causes this cycle, including helping a pro-Biden super PAC.  Biden and Trump are starting to work donors via the phone and video meetups, while anxiety rattles through congressional campaigns and some organizations grow nervous about whether they will be able to stay in the black.  It won't take long until campaigns feel the sting, said Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, which supports down-ballot candidates.  ""I think the thing people don’t realize is that campaigns and organizations — both political and nonprofits — don’t keep that much cash on hand,"" Litman said. ""You’re running month to month. One bad month, you can make it through. Two or three, and it can be catastrophic."" Run for Something has canceled events through mid-June, which Litman estimated will cost the group $450,000, approximately 25 percent of its budget for the year. Both Trump and Biden, who is just beginning to gear up for a general election as the coronavirus rocks the United States, are trying to keep growing their campaigns. And the committees and campaigns associated with House and Senate candidates have canceled almost all upcoming events, they told POLITICO. “Safety is more important than fundraisers or negative ads,” Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. “In-person fundraisers have been canceled and that will affect our bottom line. And we couldn't care less.” “This decision will cost us money,” Scott Fairchild, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, wrote in an email to online donors explaining the committee was canceling all events. “A large chunk of our fundraising is going to dry up. And to compensate for this shortfall, our Democratic Senate campaigns will need the support of this online community more than ever.” Trump’s campaign has canceled a slew of events, including a pair of highly anticipated fundraisers featuring Melania Trump — her first for the reelection campaign — this week in Beverly Hills and next week at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump also last week canceled a trip to Las Vegas for a fundraiser hosted by casino mogul and Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson. “Trump’s fundraising juggernaut is certainly going to slow a bit as the country focuses on survival,” said Republican donor Dan Eberhart. “It may not be evident today, but campaign fundraising is certain to take a hit like every other sector of the economy. There is too much uncertainty for large and small donors alike.” Both Trump and Biden will keep raising money online and via “virtual fundraisers,” held most often through video conferences with donors. Biden has one such virtual event scheduled for Friday. (The transition hasn’t always been easy: The Biden campaign postponed one such event scheduled for this week in New York City amid technical difficulties, CNBC reported.) Earlier this week, the Biden campaign distributed a fresh list of incentives to its top fundraisers to try to keep money flowing in: perks for bundlers who raise $25,000 to $500,000 for the campaign. A fundraiser who raises $25,000 for Biden, known as an “Advocate,” gets “direct contact with Regional Finance Director” and “Inclusion in national leadership councils.” People who raise more money for the campaign — including the $250,000 “Scranton Circle” and the $500,000 “Philly Founder” — receive more perks, including “bi-weekly update calls with campaign leadership” and invitations to quarterly and annual finance committee events. “It may become more 'social distancing' or more draconian down the road, then eventually people will realize we need to move forward with the campaigns as well. Some of that means resources,” said John Atkinson, a Chicago-based bundler for Biden. Meanwhile, some big-name Democrats expected to spend huge sums on 2020, including Silicon Valley investor Ron Conway and businessman Mike Bloomberg, have turned their attention to combating coronavirus. Neither Conway, nor Bloomberg has announced plans to scale back on politics, but to some, the 2020 election suddenly seems like a more distant priority than a few months ago. Todd Schulte, president of the Mark Zuckerberg-backed FWD.us, implored lawmakers to use their small-dollar donor lists for advocacy instead of fundraising in an email to supporters about helping with coronavirus, obtained by POLITICO.  “Use your email lists,” Schulte wrote. “I don’t think I got a single email saying call X member and demand ‘more kits everywhere, mass investment in medical capacity, $1000 to every American, mandatory sick leave, and more.’ No one is going to give much online -- to you or your opponent,” Schulte wrote. Some candidates are letting their small-dollar donors off the hook. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn) included a note to donors about the financial toll the emergency is taking in fundraising emails. “It’s okay not to donate right now,” one email from Smith read. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is now running for Senate, and MJ Hegar, a Democratic Senate candidate in Texas, gave donors the ability to temporarily opt out of fundraising emails during the emergency. Not every candidate, though, has abandoned raising money in person.  GOP fundraiser Alexandra Kendrick said that while the vast majority of her clients have canceled fundraisers — including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who was slated to host a weekend donor retreat in Napa next weekend — two candidate clients are currently planning on going forward with their events. “If it’s me and them sitting at a table with a chicken sandwich, so be it,” Kendrick said. “It’s not about the money, I think. It’s about the routine for them.” Alex Isenstadt contributed to this report.",'It can be catastrophic': Coronavirus tanks campaign fundraising,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-campaign-fundraising-138381,politico
"The coronavirus pandemic has thrown America’s electoral system into shock, prompting officials in six states so far to move presidential primaries as the federal government urges people not to gather in large groups. Connecticut became the latest state to push back its vote on Thursday, and even more states are considering delays. Meanwhile, election officials are also gaming out the changes they can make to voting systems to allow Americans to participate in elections while keeping themselves safe and preventing the spread of the virus. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has urged states not to postpone their primaries and instead embrace expanded voting by mail. But Perez has little authority over how individual states conduct their elections. 23 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and other territories have yet to vote in the presidential contest, and we are tracking developments in every one as the calendar shifts and states puzzle through when — and how — people can vote. Here’s what has happened so far in all the states that were scheduled to vote from mid-March through the end of April. Connecticut (moved from April 28 to June 2) Gov. Ned Lamont announced on March 19 that the state’s primary would be moved to June 2. “In coordination with other states and our Secretary of the State, and in an effort to carry out Democracy while keeping public health a top priority, I have decided to move our presidential primary to June 2nd,” Lamont tweeted. Connecticut law only allows voters to cast ballots by mail with a valid excuse, but Secretary of the State Denise Merrill said avoiding coronavirus should be considered a valid excuse for absentee voting in the state. “Secretary Merrill has determined that for reasons of public health, absentee ballots that are requested to avoid public gatherings at polling places are requested because of illness, and should be validly issued,” a statement from her office on March 13 read. The statement said she is asking Lamont to issue an executive order allowing voters to request a ballot because of an ""illness"" during this emergency instead of ""his or her illness."" Georgia (moved from March 24 to May 19) Georgia was one of the first states to postpone its primary, moving it to May 19. “Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement on March 14. The presidential primary in the state will now be held on the same day as primaries in the state for local, state and congressional offices. Indiana (moved from May 5 to June 2) Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb announced that his state would postpone its May 5 primary until June 2. ""It needed to be pushed back in order to, again, ensure the safety of our county employees, our poll workers and the voters themselves,"" Holcomb said at a March 20 press conference. Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson also said she'd recommend to the state election commission that they suspend absentee balloting rules to allow all Indiana voters to vote absentee should they so choose, along with other recommendations that would make it easier for Hoosiers to vote. Indiana typically requires an excuse to vote via mail-in absentee ballots. Lawson said the recommendation would only apply to the June 2 elections. Lawson said the election commission would meet March 25 to discuss the proposals. Louisiana (moved from April 4 to June 20) Louisiana also postponed its presidential primary, delaying its election until June 20. Notably, Louisiana's new date moves the primary outside of the nominating contest window set by the Democratic National Committee, meaning the state could have its number of delegates cut unless the DNC changes or waives its current rules. ""We will continue to work with every state party as they adjust their delegate selection plans around coronavirus,” a Democratic National Committee spokesperson said in a statement on March 13. “This change would violate our rule on timing which provides that all states hold their contests by June 9. Any violation of our rules could result in a penalty that would include a state losing at least half of its delegates. This change will be reviewed by the Rules and Bylaws Committee."" Kentucky (moved from May 19 to June 23) Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced that he and Gov. Andy Beshear jointly agreed to delay the state's May primary until June 23. ""There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy us time,"" Adams said in his announcement.  Maryland (moved from April 28 to June 2) Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan postponed the state’s primaries to June 2 in response to the coronavirus. “It would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble … and it would put Marylanders at risk,” Hogan said at a March 17 press conference. “I am directing the state board of elections to develop a comprehensive plan by April 3 to conduct the primary election in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process in our state.” One election will still be held on April 28 in the state: The special election in Maryland’s 7th District to fill the seat of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. That election will be mail-in only, and it could be an important test: Activists and some politicians are pushing for mail-in elections to be more widely adopted nationwide as part of the response to the coronavirus outbreak. Ohio (delayed from March 17 to June 2) Ohio was supposed to hold its primary on March 17. But Gov. Mike DeWine’s administration backed a court case to delay the election for public health reasons the day prior, and after a judge ruled the primary should go on, DeWine and his public health director shut down polling places due to a “health emergency.” Following the closure, Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a directive saying the primary was postponed until June 2 and prohibiting county election authorities “from tabulating and reporting any results"" until then. But that doesn’t mean June 2 is set in stone. Ohio’s state legislature is set to meet starting on March 24 to take action on the primary, The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported, with leaders noting that they have the power to set election details. ""The legal authority to change the date rests with the Ohio General Assembly,"" House Speaker Larry Householder wrote in a memo. ""No Ohio voter should ever wonder when they will have the opportunity to exercise their constitutional right to vote."" Meanwhile, the Ohio Democratic Party filed a lawsuit over the move, looking for clarity for the new primary: “Yesterday’s actions did not create unchecked authority with the governor or secretary of state to run a new election. So authority for a new election must come from the legislature or from a court,” party chair David Pepper said. The party’s lawsuit, effectively, asks for a mail-in primary through April 28. Wyoming (April 4) The Wyoming Democratic Party canceled the in-person portion of their caucuses in response to coronavirus. “Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe. Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy, so this is the responsible course of action,"" the state party wrote in a statement. “Voters are highly encouraged to vote by mail; as of now, voters may still vote via ballot pickup and drop off on March 28 and April 4. We will continue to work with public health officials, and assess local conditions, to ensure voters’ health and safety.” Alaska (April 4) Alaska Democrats have not made changes to their party-run primary, which already had a significant mail-in component already. Alaska voters who were registered as Democrats by Feb. 18 had ballots mailed to them that need to be postmarked by March 24, with in-person voting scheduled for April 4. A spokesperson for the state party told POLITICO that the party was “currently in the process of reaccessing” the procedure and said changes were coming soon. Delaware (April 28) Delaware is, for now, continuing on as planned with its election.  “Governor [John] Carney's team is working closely with Elections Commissioner [Anthony] Albence, and we are continuing to move forward with planning, for now,” Carney spokesperson Jon Starkey wrote in an email to POLITICO. “We will continue to move forward — with plans to take additional health precautions to keep Delawareans healthy — until guidance from our public health experts makes clear we cannot safely hold the election on April 28.” Hawaii (April 4) Hawaii's party-run primary has not been postponed. However, the primary is conducted largely by mail (as are state-run elections), so it may be able to continue as usual without significant disruption. New York (April 28) Discussions about moving New York’s primary have begun, but there is nothing definitive yet. Douglas A. Kellner, co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections, told The New York Times on March 15 that the presidential primary could move to June 23 (the date of other primaries in the state), but that decision would have to be made by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state legislature. But Cuomo said he has not given any thought to the idea yet. “I have virtually no political thoughts at this time and no thought about postponing an election,” he said at a March 17 press conference. However, Cuomo has already delayed all village elections in New York until April 28. “Public health officials have been clear that reducing density is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread, and delaying village elections will help ensure poll workers and voters are not potentially exposed to the virus and at the same time maintain integrity in our election system,” he said in a statement on March 16. Pennsylvania (April 28) Gov. Tom Wolf said the state is considering moving its primary. “I’m not sure what impact it’s going to have on the primary,"" Wolf said at a press conference on March 16. “Obviously, we want to keep people safe, so to the extent that the state needs to move the April 28 date to another date, other states have already done this, Pennsylvania is certainly taking that into consideration.” However, it is not entirely clear if Wolf has the authority to do so on his own. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the clearest way to move the primary would be for the state legislature to do that — but there’s no consensus among lawmakers. Wolf may be able to use his emergency powers to move the primary. Puerto Rico (March 29) Puerto Rico is on the verge of rescheduling its primary. At the request of the island’s Democratic Party, the Puerto Rico Senate passed a resolution on March 16 pushing the primary until April 26, with the potential to further postpone the primary at a later date if the emergency persists. A statement from the party on March 16 said the Puerto Rico House of Representatives is expected to also pass the bill, and Gov. Wanda Vazquez has indicated she will sign the bill. Rhode Island (April 28) Election officials in the state are split on what to do. The state board of elections voted on March 17 to ask Gov. Gina Raimondo to postpone the presidential primary from April 28 to June 2 — but Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea’s office is recommending the April 28 primary stay in place as a “predominantly mail-ballot” election. The governor’s office told the Associated Press that Raimondo was “open to the idea” of moving the primary following the board’s vote. Wisconsin (April 7) Wisconsin is in a tougher situation than other states: Not only is the presidential primary scheduled for April 7, but so are general elections for state and local offices, including state Supreme Court and mayor of Milwaukee. Gov. Tony Evers has beaten back calls to postpone the election. ""How long do we potentially leave offices unfilled because we’re into July or August and we haven’t held a general election?"" he asked reporters on a conference call on March 17, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Evers has urged voters to vote absentee. Meanwhile, the Wisconsin Democratic Party and the DNC have filed a lawsuit to expand voting access. The suit seeks to extend electronic and mail registration to April 3, axe photo ID and residency document requirements for absentee ballot and registration requests, and extend the mail-in deadline to count votes postmarked by Election Day and received within 10 days of the election. Mark Jefferson, the chair of the state GOP, put out a statement: “The best course of action during elections in times of crisis is to ensure equal access to the polls, not to suspend all common-sense regulations that ensure fair elections in a democracy,” he said. “We call on local election officials to make early-voting available immediately and we are exploring what legal options may be available. Suspending rules that ensure fair elections is simply not an acceptable solution.” Alice Miranda Ollstein and Elena Schneider contributed reporting.",Everything to know about states moving and changing their primaries over coronavirus,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/state-elections-primaries-changes-coronavirus-138393,politico
"President Donald Trump called himself a ""big fan"" of an unproven coronavirus treatment Friday and repeatedly contradicted his own top health officials on how much is known about the drug's potential to help at least some patients affected by the pandemic. “It is very effective. It is a strong drug,” Trump declared at a long, sprawling televised briefing, referring to a malaria drug that is in the early stages of being tested against Covid-19. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci and other White House task force members appeared visibly uncomfortable as Trump repeatedly hailed the drug's promise. A day earlier, a similar scenario unfolded in the White House briefing room as FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn tried to tamp down Trump's confidence and explained the many steps that scientists have to go through before they know a treatment is safe and effective for a particular condition. ""We want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial — a large, pragmatic clinical trial — to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered,"" Hahn said of chloroquine's effectiveness. Chloroquine is one of several medications — some already on the market for other diseases, some still in the clinical pipeline — that are being tested to see if they can treat the novel virus, to make it less severe. Scientists in several countries around the world, some part of a multinational WHO effort, are undertaking studies of whether the drug, used for malaria and arthritis, can help save lives from this disease. But the existing research Trump was so enthused about is very preliminary, as Fauci painstakingly explained several times on Friday. Basically, the science done to date shows that it's worth investigating further — but it doesn't prove much on its own about its effect on Covid-19. The United States is obtaining ""millions"" of doses for further study and for ""compassionate use"" — letting doctors try the unproven drug on very sick people. Scientists can collect data if a drug is given under compassionate use rules — though not as fully as in a clinical trial. While the malaria drug has a fairly good safety profile; no medication is without some risks. And it's completely unknown whether it's safe for people who are dangerously ill with coronavirus. Researchers don't yet know when to administer it, or at what doses. It may work best right after someone is infected, or could be most effective only if someone is already critically ill. In the best case scenario, it will take months to know whether, as Fauci said Friday, it's “truly safe and truly effective” with this disease. That didn't stop the president. “Right now, in terms of malaria, if you wanted, you can have a prescription. You get a prescription. And by the way, it's very effective. It works,” he told reporters. Fauci, who has had to strike a delicate balance between providing accurate information and avoiding contradicting his boss, cut back in. “You have to be careful when you say ‘fairly effective,’” he pleaded. “It was never done in a clinical trial.” The tense back-and-forth in the White House briefing room echoed the FDA's Hahn's similar attempts earlier this week to downplay the president's optimistic claims of readily available drugs to treat the new virus. ""What's important is not to provide falsehood but provide hope,"" Hahn said. “We need to make sure the sea of new treatments will get the right drug to the right patients, at the right dosage, at the right time.""",Trump hypes unproven coronavirus drugs as top science officials manage expectations,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/trump-hypes-unproven-coronavirus-drugs-139525,politico
"Mike Bloomberg’s shuttered presidential campaign alerted staffers on Thursday night that two floors of its New York headquarters were exposed to the novel coronavirus. On Friday morning, the campaign then laid off hundreds of staffers across the country, including at least several dozen in the New York office who are potentially at risk and are now being asked to finish their employment working from home. While staffers in battleground states have health coverage until the end of April, the dismissed Bloomberg employees in the New York City headquarters will lose health insurance after March 31. In an email sent at 11:03 pm Thursday, with the mundane subject line “Building Update - 229 West 43rd Street,” the campaign’s human resources department wrote: “We’ve just become aware of a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the office at 229 West 43rd Street impacting the 5th and 8th floor.” The campaign wrote that the individual was last in the office on Monday, March 16.  The campaign recommended employees work from home for the next two weeks, spurring panic among some staffers given their health insurance will end in just 11 days.  “Think about the potential of someone getting hospitalized on April 1, without coverage, fighting for their life and now being strapped with massive medical debt,” said a staffer in headquarters who fears they were exposed and shared the email with POLITICO. “The campaign's refusal to extend health care benefits is unconscionable and putting people at grave risk. This is not how you treat people who sacrificed a lot to work for you.” The Bloomberg campaign declined to say whether the individual who tested positive was a campaign employee or someone outside the campaign who had access to the building. Bloomberg, whose estimated worth is more than $50 billion, rapidly assembled the largest campaign staff in the Democratic field after his late entry last fall. He offered large salaries along with promises those who signed on they would be paid through November regardless of whether Bloomberg became the nominee. But after his presidential campaign fizzled, Bloomberg signaled that many of those staffers would only be paid through March 31st but would also potentially be able to work for a well-funded Super PAC. But on Friday, Bloomberg announced that he was abandoning those plans as well and informed hundreds of employees that they would no longer have a job.  The moves infuriated Bloomberg staffers who felt cheated and afraid to be without a job as the economy likely heads toward a severe recession and the pandemic makes health care coverage essential. “I guess it’s cheaper to give the DNC $18 million than keep promises because @MikeBloomberg just fired his whole campaign staff — including those of us promised jobs though November on his IE,” Amol Jethwani, a former aide, wrote in a tweet. “Disappointed I don’t have a job. Not surprised that a billionaire is cheating scum.”",Laid-off Bloomberg staffers exposed to coronavirus,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/bloomberg-staffers-exposed-to-coronavirus-139466,politico
"President Donald Trump heaped scorn on several members of the White House press corps at a coronavirus briefing Friday, but made a point of responding to questions from a new reporter in the briefing room: His former press secretary. “Mr. President, two questions if you would indulge me,” Sean Spicer said when Trump pointed a finger to call on his former aide. Spicer, of course, is the former White House and Republican National Committee spokesman who vigorously defended Trump’s inauguration crowd size claims and regularly tangled with reporters during combative White House briefings before his ouster in a 2017 shakeup. He also took a spin on “Dancing With The Stars.”  Spicer now has his own political talk show for the conservative Newsmax TV outlet. By the time Trump entered the White House Briefing Room to address reporters Friday, Spicer was set to press his old boss for presidential reaction to small business anxieties and reports that senators unloaded stocks before a pandemic-sparked market downturn. The surreal scene played out moments after the president castigated NBC’s Peter Alexander for suggesting that Trump may be giving Americans “a false sense of hope” about coronavirus treatment, asking what he would say to Americans who are scared or sickened by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. “I say that you are a terrible reporter. That's what I say,” Trump told Alexander. “I think that's a very nasty question, and I think it's a very bad signal that you're putting out to the American people. The American people are looking for answers, and they are looking for hope. And you are doing sensationalism.” Trump’s attacks on the news media are a familiar tactic at his campaign rallies and press conferences. After a brief détente earlier this week, the president lashed out at the media again during Thursday’s briefing. Friday's spat with Alexander, juxtaposed with Spicer’s presence on the other side of the podium, further heightened the strains with the press corps.  Ultimately, Trump used Spicer's questions to praise his administration's response to small businesses hammered by the outbreak and defend senators who reportedly sold stock before markets tanked in response to the pandemic, though he made sure to call out only one of them — a California Democrat — by name. ""I saw some names. I know all of them. I know everyone mentioned,"" Trump replied to Spicer. ""Dianne Feinstein, I guess. And a couple of others. I don't know too much about what it's about, but I find them to all be very honorable people. That’s all I know. And they said they did nothing wrong. I find them — the whole group, very honorable people."" Friday's exchanges didn't sit well with some other reporters. ""What the president did to Peter Alexander is reprehensible,"" CNN anchor John King declared after Friday's press conference.  ""It was striking that this came, this, forgive me, bullshit attack on fake news came just moments after the secretary of State said the American people have to be careful about where they get their information and go to sources they can trust.""",Sean Spicer debuts as White House reporter during heated Trump coronavirus briefing,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/sean-spicer-coronavirus-white-house-briefing-139471,politico
"President Donald Trump on Friday shot down the prospect for any kind of nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus, resisting a step that California and New York have already taken. “I don't think so,” Trump told reporters Friday when asked whether California's strategy could be adopted nationwide.  Trump, who instead announced another series of mitigation efforts spanning the federal government, argued that California and New York were exceptions. “Essentially you've done that in California. You've done that in New York. Those are two hotbeds,” he said. But, he added, “you go out to the Midwest, you go out to other locations, and they're watching it on television, but they don't have the same problems. They don't have by any means the same problem.” While the president said he would continue to work with governors, “I don't think we'll ever find that necessary,” he said of a nationwide lockdown. Even as his administration has ramped up its coronavirus response, Trump has appeared hesitant at times to take steps that would further kneecap a U.S. economy that is already in an unprecedented freefall. Even without a nationwide lockdown, millions of Americans have already essentially self-quarantined, posing a mortal danger to the service and hospitality industries and threatening to thrust the entire U.S. economy into a recession. The dramatic economic slowdown has prompted talks between the White House and Congress not just on a massive bailout package for suffering industries but also of plans to cut checks to individual Americans. Taken together, costs for the government's economic response are expected to soar past $1 trillion dollars. What Trump did announce was that he had finally put the Defense Production Act, which would allow him to order private corporations to manufacture desperately supplies, “into high gear,” days after saying he would not yet trigger the Korean War-era statute. But aside from name-checking General Motors, the president declined to say what companies he had ordered into action and how many items he had ordered. He also announced the partial closure of the U.S.-Mexico border to nonessential travel, a move that mirrors the closure of the northern border with Canada earlier this week. Trump rolled out a number of new measures aimed at providing relief to American consumers as well, saying the Education Department would allow federal student loan borrowers to suspend payments for at least 60 days and that the IRS is pushing back its deadline to file taxes by three months. The president and his coronavirus task force were repeatedly questioned throughout the nearly 90-minute briefing on everything from their failures to produce widespread access to test kits for the respiratory illness to health care workers' unmet pleas for personal protective equipment or treatment machines like ventilators.  But a day after saying it was states’ responsibilities to procure supplies, and that the federal government was not a “shipping clerk,"" Trump signaled a move to nationalize the supply chain and improve the allocation of resources for health care providers. He announced that FEMA would take over emergency response, asking governors to coordinate with their regional FEMA administrators.  Experts had urged such an approach because the federal government has powers to boost production that states do not and a federal approach can allocate scarce goods to the places that need them most, not just the state that calls up manufacturers fastest. Trump alluded to that dynamic on Friday. “We need certain equipment that the states are unable to get by themselves,” he said. “So we're invoking [the Defense Production Act] to use the powers of the federal government to help the states get things that they need, like the masks, like the ventilators.”  Still, the new approach appeared to be uneven. Asked about concerns raised by Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker a day earlier that the federal government was outbidding states for critical supplies, Trump acknowledged such occurrences but contended that ""smart"" states call and tell the government to withdraw its bid. Trump insisted that there were “millions” of supplies, including masks and ventilators, heading to states. And while he did not offer many details on that front, manufacturing giant 3M announced during the briefing that it has doubled its global output of coveted N95 respirator masks since the outbreak began, increasing its output “to an annual rate of over 1.1 billion per year, or nearly 100 million per month.” But the president also wrongly suggested entities like shuttered car factories could be retrofitted instantaneously to accommodate the need for supplies, a reconfiguration that in reality could take almost a year.  “We're getting calls from automobile companies. We're getting calls from other companies saying they have plant capacity,” Trump said. “They want to make ventilators, they want to make other things. We are literally being besieged, in a beautiful way, by companies that want to do the work.”  The task force also continued to defend its coronavirus testing lags, with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announcing that FEMA would stand up “a laboratory task force to answer” questions about a lack of supplies for tests like cotton swabs.  “Usually it's the lab people do not understand there are actually alternative supplies in the marketplace, that they are perfectly free to use,” he said, saying that the government had just purchased 200,000 swabs on the open marketplace that they were sending to governors. “It's a complex system with 330 million Americans and all of these labs,” Azar explained. “So sometimes there's a lab that doesn't understand how much flexibility they have and how much supply there is out there. We're working through the new FEMA integration center to help correct that for folks.”",Trump on a nationwide lockdown: 'I don't think we'll ever find that necessary',2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/trump-coronavirus-nationwide-lockdown-139330,politico

"Mike Bloomberg’s defunct presidential campaign laid off hundreds more staffers Friday as he announced that that he’s folding his massive battleground operation into the Democratic National Committee. Many of the Bloomberg aides — including those purged in an initial round of dismissals—were holding out hope he would deliver on a promise to keep them on his payroll through November, particularly with the coronavirus baring down. But those hopes were also dashed Friday when the staffers were told in frank conference calls that Bloomberg would not move ahead with his planned super PAC, and instead would cede his state operation to the DNC, including an $18 million infusion to help presumptive nominee Joe Biden. The staffers, who said they were lured to the late-starting campaign with yearlong guarantees of competitive pay and health benefit packages, were invited to apply for jobs with the DNC as part of a “competitive process.”  “I guess it’s cheaper to give the DNC $18 million than keep promises because @MikeBloomberg just fired his whole campaign staff — including those of us promised jobs though November on his IE,” Amol Jethwani, a former aide, wrote in a tweet. “Disappointed I don’t have a job. Not surprised that a billionaire is cheating scum.” Several other former aides said in interviews that the news comes as a massive blow amid the tanking economy. They believe the campaign has repeatedly strung them along while misrepresenting future opportunities. “I am disgusted by Mike Bloomberg and his staff,"" one of the Bloomberg aides, who like several others spoke on the condition of anonymity, told POLITICO on Friday. ""He has left us with no health insurance during this pandemic. I have a family and do not know what we will do at the end of the month.""  The person added, ""If the DNC and Joe Biden choose to ignore us, they are complicit as well. How can the party claim to care about working Americans while taking money from a billionaire that does not fulfill his promises to his employees?” POLITICO previously reported that Bloomberg was laying off hundreds of staffers around the country and paying them through March 31, though they would be allowed to keep their Bloomberg-issued iPhones and MacBooks (which would be taxed as income). But the campaign indicated at the time that those staffers would be given priority to apply for jobs in six battleground states that were to be funded by the planned super PAC. Those already working for him in the battleground states had planned to stay on his payroll to work on the nominee’s behalf. A planned internal staff conference call with those employees Wednesday was kicked over to Friday, when they, too, were told that Bloomberg was pulling out and they’d lose their jobs.  Pennsylvania State Director Kevin Kinross, on a separate call with his staff in the state Friday, called the edict “disappointing and (an) abrupt end to everything.” Kinross said he suspected that it was a small group decision. “To have people sort of twisting in the wind for all this time when you literally have the resources to make up the rules however you want them to be,” Mustafa Rashed, the communications director in the state, added on the call. “I feel bad for the people who moved their lives, their selves, their family to come to Pennsylvania or any other state to work and then to be uprooted during the midst of a global pandemic, I don’t know, it’s not good.” Several aides who asked to remain anonymous because of non-disclosure agreements they signed with Bloomberg said the perk of being paid all year was what motivated them to join the campaign in the first place. Some said they had yet to receive promised relocation expenses.  Others pointed to the millions Bloomberg is separately sinking into coronavirus response efforts as tone deaf at a time when aides who worked long hours in call centers on his behalf will have to foot their own costs. A Bloomberg spokesperson said in a prepared statement that the DNC Coordinated Campaign is hiring in the six battleground states. “And we will assist the DNC as much as we are able to, including by providing names of staff and working to help them onboard and grow their program as expediently as possible,” the spokesperson said.  Additionally, they said staff in the six battleground states that were let go Friday would be employed and paid through the first week in April and have full benefits through the end of April.  “This is the largest contribution from a campaign to the DNC in recent history,” they said. “Although Mike suspended his campaign, he remains committed to defeating Trump and we hope all our staff submit their names for positions with the DNC Coordinated Campaign this transfer will help fund.”  The spokesperson did not immediately confirm how many staffers were let go Friday or in the previous round. But Bloomberg had more than 2,000 people spread out across the country and hundreds more at his New York headquarters.  Bloomberg dropped out after a disastrous showing on Super Tuesday and endorsed Biden. Bloomberg’s hiring materials from headquarters shared with POLITICO stated that regardless of what happened to his own campaign, field organizers could expect to have a job with “Team Bloomberg” through November, though it didn’t promise interviewees where they would be based. It outlined that organizers would be paid $6,000 a month, plus a $5,000 relocation stipend and full health, dental and vision benefits. In one staff email, an aide cited Campaign Manager Kevin Sheeky’s March 6 note in which he pasted a news report reiterating plans to keep field operations going in the half-dozen battleground states regardless of whether Bloomberg became the nominee. A spokesperson confirmed that was the plan after the first round of layoffs earlier this month. The pledge was so well established in some non-battleground states that it was used as a frequent motivator by supervisors to encourage sometimes exhausted staffers. It was also raised in at least two statewide training sessions where officials traveled from headquarters. On the Pennsylvania call, a woman asked Kinross whether the state campaign knew whether the DNC was going to try to keep people who have uprooted their entire lives to the state of Pennsylvania. “No, we don't, we don’t ...There’s no answer,” he replied. “All the decisions are going to be the DNC’s.”",Bloomberg lays off hundreds as coronavirus bears down,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/bloomberg-campaign-layoffs-coronavirus-139362,politico
"The Republican National Committee has rehired a prominent consulting firm it axed after it allowed a massive data breach in 2017. The committee paid $700,000 to Deep Root Analytics last month, according to a senior party official. The expenditure is expected to be reflected on the committee’s next finance report, to be released Friday. Following the 2016 election, the Northern Virginia-based media consulting firm took responsibility for accidentally exposing the personal information and political dispositions of nearly 200 million Americans, or around 60 percent of the country’s population. At the time, Deep Root Analytics served as a vendor for the RNC and, along with several other firms, helping to develop highly refined voter data. The data — which included names, birthdays, and personal addresses — was discovered in June 2017 on an Amazon web server by the cyber risk firm UpGuard. UpGuard described the mishap as “perhaps the largest known exposure of voter information in history.” The RNC moved swiftly to separate itself from Deep Root Analytics and the firm locked down the information to prevent further public access. Republican officials say the data was unsecured for around two weeks and that other than UpGuard no one gained access. RNC officials said the firm has taken aggressive steps to address the past failure, such as upping its investment in cybersecurity, bolstering employee training, and updating its security measures.  People familiar with the new arrangement say the firm's work for the committee is focused on data analytics and media-tracking projects. “The RNC has and will continue to take the security of voter information extremely seriously. Over the past three years, Deep Root has overhauled their security protocols and maintains a robust security posture,” said Mike Reed, an RNC spokesman. “We are confident that their system is safe and secure.” The move comes as President Donald Trump’s political operation beefs up its data infrastructure ahead of the general election. The Trump campaign has functioned largely as a digital-focused effort. Under campaign manager Brad Parscale, who served as digital director on Trump’s 2016 bid, the president’s political organization has undertaken projects such as gathering data on attendees at his rallies.  Alex Lundry, Deep Root’s co-founder, previously worked on Mitt Romney’s 2012 bid. He has specialized in the targeting of television advertising. The RNC was not the only organization Deep Root Analytics contracted with during the 2016 election cycle. The outfit worked for Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely aligned with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Right to Rise, an outside group that supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign.  While the RNC cut ties with the Deep Root Analytics during the 2018 midterms, the firm worked for a range of party groups including the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the House GOP-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund.  This cycle, the outfit’s clients include McConnell and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, both of whom are seeking reelection. “Since 2017, Deep Root has satisfied the security requirements of over 100 different organizations and has done work for every major center-right political entity. We have the best product in the business and are excited to be working with the RNC in this cycle,” Lundry said in a statement. Separately, the RNC has tapped Howler Insights, LLC, a subsidiary of Deep Root Analytics, which shares office space with the firm. Party officials say Howler is at work on a data project that will play a role in the 2020 election.  According to campaign finance records, the RNC paid $900,000 to Howler in September. The disbursement was first reported by ProPublica.",RNC rehires firm responsible for massive data breach,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/rnc-deep-root-analytics-hire-138889,politico
"The Trump administration is bringing back former chief economist Kevin Hassett, whose grim public comments about the potential economic toll of the coronavirus stand in sharp contrast with some of the rosier predictions floated by current White House advisers. Hassett, who will be working as a temporary unpaid adviser, left his post as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in June after nearly two years in the job. While at the White House, Hassett was a vocal promoter of the administration’s tax cuts and stood behind President Donald Trump’s assurances that the economy could achieve sustained 3 percent annual growth. But the once-upbeat economist has taken a darker view of the potential fallout from the pandemic, which has shuttered businesses across the country and ground much of the world to a halt. “The odds of a global recession are close to 100 percent,” Hassett told CNN this week, adding that GDP could shrink by 5 percent in the second quarter and the next employment report could show 1 million job losses — a single-month setback that would be unprecedented in the post-World War II era. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has struck a more optimistic tone, saying as recently as Thursday that the economic damage from the outbreak would be short-lived.  Hassett is currently the vice president and managing director of the Lindsey Group.",White House to bring Hassett back as economic adviser amid crisis,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/white-house-to-bring-hassett-back-as-economic-adviser-amid-crisis-139345,politico
"The federal judge hearing House Democrats’ suit to obtain President Donald Trump’s tax returns put the case on hold today. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden, in his order, cited uncertainties about how another court may act in a different case that raises issues similar to the ones in the suit for Trump’s returns. In that second case, House Judiciary Committee Democrats are appealing a ruling that former White House counsel Don McGahn can defy a congressional subpoena for his testimony. McFadden wrote that he “will await further proceedings in McGahn” before he acts on Democrat’s subpoena enforcement claims in the tax returns case or their argument that a federal law requires the Treasury secretary to turn over the returns to House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.).  In a filing last month, attorneys for Neal told McFadden they would continue to press their case despite the ruling in the McGahn case.  Trump’s lawyers said the tax returns case should be dismissed, but they’d be willing to see the case put on hold while the McGahn ruling is appealed.",Judge puts hold on Democrats' suit for Trump's tax returns,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/judge-puts-hold-on-democrats-suit-for-trumps-tax-returns-139325,politico

"Automakers are offering up their factories to help solve the shortage of ventilators needed to treat an expected crush of coronavirus patients, but production likely won't begin for months — too late to help ease the immediate need. Hours after Detroit’s big three automakers — General Motors, Ford Motor Company and Fiat Chrysler — announced Wednesday that they were shuttering their North American factories, at least two of them, Ford and GM, signaled that they might open them back up, but to make ventilators and protective medical equipment. The reason those factories shut down to begin with was partly due to pressure by the United Auto Workers, and local and state governments, to comply with social distancing guidelines to keep employees safe, and partly a product of plummeting demand for automobiles. “It’s all of the above,” said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. “Clearly, we want to have safe working environments. It’s also clear that retail sales and demand is falling off, and so the ability to be able to adjust production to current market realities is also important.” Both of those problems could be solved by reconfiguring the plants to manufacture ventilators and other items. “If you were to start a new production line making medical goods, from scratch, you could design [social distancing] into the line and for a lot of these, they’ll have to be made in medical clean rooms,” said Flavio Volpe, who heads the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association in Canada. “You’re addressing, by definition, a whole bunch of the concerns that employees have on the cleanliness and the spread in the workforce.” The push for automobile companies to begin helping the medical manufacturing industry comes as the country — facing a shortage of goods like ventilators, masks and other personal protective equipment for medical workers — shifts to a wartime footing to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Respirator manufacturing facilities in the United States are already at 100 percent production capacity and are looking to ramp up by another 15 or 20 percent, said Jim Jeffries, the senior vice president for public affairs for AdvaMed, which represents medical technology companies. He said in the medical industry, companies are adding third shifts and repurposing production lines, while also looking to other sectors — autos among them — to see if protective equipment can be “retrofitted” to help combat the crisis. “You’re seeing a really strong industry-wide mobilization to the fight,” Jeffries said. “They’re looking at literally every possibility to make sure that we can meet the demand.” But a spokesperson for General Motors underscored Thursday that there is no concrete plan yet to do anything. “This is very early,” said GM spokesperson Jeannine Ginivan. “Right now it’s just an internal feasibility study on whether it‘s possible for us to help out in the production of medical equipment.” She said the idea arose “in a conversation with the administration, when we were notifying them that we were going to be suspending production due to the virus.“ Questions about whether auto workers would be the ones making the devices, what facilities would be used or how they would comply with public health guidelines are still undetermined. Volpe said about a dozen Canadian auto parts manufacturers, many of which are currently idle because of the shutdowns of U.S. vehicle plants, are now running “due diligence” exercises to see what level of ventilator production is possible. “We’re trying to get something done in two or three days that might normally take a year,” he said. “We hope to be there by next week where we’re looking at engineering specs and hopefully within a month to two months, pumping out the critical goods at the volumes that the healthcare infrastructure needs.” Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, tweeted Wednesday: “We will make ventilators if there is a shortage,” despite widespread warnings that there was, indeed, a shortage. Tesla closed its factory in Fremont, Calif. the next day. President Donald Trump invoked a Korean War-era statute Wednesday, the Defense Production Act, that would allow him to order private corporations to manufacture desperately needed masks and ventilators to combat the coronavirus. However, though he has called up the statute, he has yet to trigger its use, saying he would ""if we were desperately in need of something."" He highlighted masks and ventilators in particular, and suggested he'd make a decision in the coming days. “We, frankly, will know about that very shortly,” he said at a White House press conference. “We’re going to know a lot over the next two or three days. We’ll know a lot.” Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Vice President Joe Biden, have urged Trump not to wait any longer and deploy the authorities now. Jennifer Dukarski, an attorney with Butzel Long, said the production of items like masks and respirators could ramp up quite quickly, while ventilator production would take longer given the need to alter supply chains and acquire the necessary physical equipment for manufacturing. “We are probably looking at a couple of weeks, maybe longer, depending on what we’re ramping up to manufacture,” Dukarski said of ventilator production times. Other experts thought the administration would likely lean on existing medical device manufacturers first to turbocharge their production. Converting automotive factories is possible but would likely take much longer to get up and running, they argued. “Medium-term they could do grants to mobilize automobile factories to manufacture ventilators. But that can’t happen in a week,” said Jerry McGinn, who led Defense Production Act programs for the Pentagon under several administrations, in an interview. “It’s something they could do in six months or a year.”",Detroit won’t save us from a ventilator shortage anytime soon,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/detroit-wont-save-us-from-a-ventilator-shortage-anytime-soon-139272,politico
"The Labor Department asked state labor offices not to release data on unemployment claims before the information is incorporated into its national weekly statistics. The letter to state labor agencies Wednesday, first reported by the New York Times, notes that the jobless claims data ""is monitored closely by policymakers and financial markets"" and said state offices, when talking to the press, should confine themselves to using ""generalities to describe claims levels (very high, large increase)."" After DOL releases its weekly report, ""states may share information for the given week at the level of granularity deemed appropriate within the confines of federal and state confidentiality guidelines,"" the letter said. The memo, sent by Gay Gilbert, administrator of the Office of Unemployment Insurance, included a long list of exceptions to state reporting requirements in light of the coronavirus crisis. It is not unusual for the Labor Department to bar states from reporting unemployment data before federal announcements, given the market-moving potential. But some state officials say the requirement should be suspended while they work to limit economic damage.  “Every single hour counts, never mind a day or a week in our response to this,” said Suzi LeVine, the commissioner of Washington state’s employment security department . “And so my [in]ability to share that information, to put it in the governor’s hands and not have to worry about ‘oh don’t tell anybody this’ — that’s unacceptable right now.” DOL was not immediately available for comment.",DOL to states: Don't leak unemployment claim numbers,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/department-of-labor-tells-states-dont-leak-unemployment-numbers-139268,politico
"The scarcity of surgical face masks and other protective equipment for health workers has quickly become the most urgent problem facing those on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. Manufacturers are ramping up production of masks, gowns and gloves, but there will be a lag before the new supplies can reach hospitals already struggling to care for infected patients. Earlier this week, Vice President Mike Pence called on construction companies to donate their dust masks — which are identical to the ones used by doctors and nurses — to their local hospitals. But there’s another source of protective medical equipment that hasn’t yet been discussed: Dentists and veterinarians. With the right financial incentives, dentists and vets can help bridge this critical gap. Dentists and veterinarians use the exact same personal protective equipment as other medical workers, and they adhere to rigorous OSHA guidelines for surgical masks, gloves, and various sanitization materials. With an estimated 200,419 dentists and 71,060 veterinarians in the U.S. workforce primarily in private practice, there exists an inventory of readily available medical equipment in dental and veterinary offices that could reinforce the strained supply chain. But here’s the problem: Most dental and veterinary offices are small businesses. Despite recommendations from the American Dental Association, many dental offices are staying open during the crisis; they share the concerns of fellow small-business owners in staying financially solvent and keeping employees on the payroll. Many are holding off as they await details of the small-business loans included in the Senate’s COVID relief legislation, to see if they can afford to close. Meanwhile, their valuable medical supplies—such as face masks—have not been redirected toward hospitals.  Rather than hope for goodwill, federal and state governments should quickly implement policies to incentivize dentists and veterinarians to contribute their medical supplies to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Here are two ideas for doing that:  A direct buyback program. Federal, state and local governments could offer to purchase personal protective equipment from dental and veterinary clinics and directly cut a check to the businesses. This would provide dentists and vets quick revenue at a time that they may be strapped for cash; this would allow them to close while redistributing their inventory to hospitals. While the ideal buyback program would be at market rate or cost-plus pricing, the costs of such a plan may be less politically palatable given the already high level of estimated federal spending on COVID relief and economic stimulus. An alternative would be for governments to offer to purchase the protective equipment at a percentage of Medicare rates instead. (A similar policy could also be implemented for individual hoarders of protective equipment, but at a lower rate to discourage their practice.) A “war bonds” style bond exchange. Historically, war bonds were federally backed patriotic debt securities purchased by citizens to finance the war efforts of World Wars I and II. Citizens purchased bonds to generate federal monetary supply in exchange for a guaranteed return on their security with interest at a lower rate. In echoing a war-time call to combat disease, modeling a similar initiative for protective equipment could incentivize donations faster and at lower cost to the government than a direct buyback. Here’s how a bond program could work: The government could set the value of a “COVID bond” at a discounted Medicare rate for the protective equipment and guarantee a set rate of interest. For example, if you donated $100 worth of masks, the government would issue you a bond currently valued at $80 with a guaranteed rate of 2.5% interest a year. At the end of a 15-year term, the bond would be valued at $115.86. Dentists and vets could either hold on to the bonds or, if they needed short-term capital, sell the bonds on a secondary market to other individuals for cash. These options would benefit both sides: Hospitals would receive a short-term influx of protective equipment, while private dental and veterinary offices could utilize the funds to cover fixed costs and offer employees leave. This way, dentists and vets could immediately contribute to addressing the public health emergency at a time when they are already seeing fewer patients already and benefit when demand and productivity resumes.  With hospital supplies nearing critical levels, the federal government must use creative policy tools to bolster dwindling supplies of protective equipment. Tapping existing inventory of masks, gowns and gloves in dental and veterinary offices can ease the shortage of personal protective equipment as we wait for supply chains to ramp up.

"President Donald Trump announced on Friday that he will allow the nation’s more than 42 million federal student loan borrowers to take a break from making their monthly payments, without incurring interest or penalties for at least the next two months. Trump also announced that he will let states waive federal testing requirements for elementary and high school students, both moves in response to the coronavirus pandemic. State leaders have been increasingly anxious about testing mandates as the coronavirus shutters schools across the nation. On student loans, in addition to suspending payments, the Education Department said it would set the interest rates on all federally held student loans to zero until at least May 12. That carries out Trump’s announcement last week that he was waiving the interest on student loans. Trump said student borrowers won't have to make loan payments “for at least the next 60 days and if we need more we’ll extend that period of time.” To obtain the 60-day reprieve, borrowers who have federally held loans will have to make a request of their loan servicers, such as Navient, Nelnet, FedLoan Servicing or Great Lakes, over the phone or online. But for borrowers who are already more than a month behind on their monthly loan payments, the Trump administration will automatically apply the 60-day suspension. More than 3.2 million federally-held student loans are more than 31 days delinquent and another 7.7 million are in default, according to the Education Department’s most recent quarterly data. “These are anxious times, particularly for students and families whose educations, careers, and lives have been disrupted,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement. “Right now, everyone should be focused on staying safe and healthy, not worrying about their student loan balance growing.” The Trump administration’s announcement comes as Congress is also debating student debt relief as part of negotiations over the massive coronavirus stimulus package, S. 3548 (116). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s plan, released on Thursday evening, would allow the Education Department to suspend student loan payments for as long as six months. But Senate Democrats have said that doesn’t go far enough. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for canceling student loan payments made by borrowers during the national emergency and wants to guarantee borrowers at least $10,000 each in total loan forgiveness. Trump, speaking during a news conference at the White House on Friday, also teased additional announcements on student loans from his administration. “We have more to come on student loans, more good news for the students but we’ll do that at a different time,” Trump said. He also said the state testing waivers might be greeted by some K-12 students. “Probably a lot of students will be extremely happy, some probably not,” Trump said. “The ones that work hard, maybe not, but it’s one of those things. Very unfortunate circumstances.”",Trump: Federal student loan borrowers can suspend payments for 60 days,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/trump-coronavirus-student-loan-payments-139056,politico
"President Donald Trump announced Friday that the U.S. and Mexico have agreed to temporarily close the border to nonessential travel to curb the spread of the coronavirus. U.S. and Mexican officials have been in talks this week over how to work together in responding to the global pandemic while ensuring that bilateral trade and essential travel are not disrupted at the border. It’s a similar move to the U.S. and Canada’s decision on Wednesday to impose travel restrictions at the northern U.S. border. “Both countries know the importance of working together to limit the spread of the virus and ensure the commerce that supports our economy continues to keep flowing,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a White House press conference. “The United States is glad to have a friend that is working side-by-side with us in the fight."" The U.S.' agreement with Mexico and Canada to restrict nonessential travel will go into effect on Saturday. Trump tied the partial border closure to his concern over the “thousands of unscreened and unvetted and unauthorized entries from dozens of countries” that border agents encounter on the job. “During a global pandemic, they threaten to create a perfect storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants and to the public at large. Left unchecked, this would … overwhelm our healthcare system and severely damage our national security. We are not going to let that happen,” Trump said.  However, there are about 15,000 known cases of the coronavirus in the United States, while Mexico has less than 200 reported cases so far. Canada is approaching 1,000 confirmed cases. Experts say much of the spread in the U.S. at this point is occurring within the country -- not due to foreigners or international travel. Trump was also quick to emphasize that his administration is treating both Mexico and Canada the same in working together to combat the coronavirus. ""We are treating the borders equally, the northern border and the southern border. They're being treated equally. A lot of people say they are not being treated equally. They are,"" Trump said. Earlier this week, Trump said his administration plans to remove migrants and asylum seekers that cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally — a move that would be separate from the nonessential travel ban. He said he would invoke a law that allows the U.S. surgeon general to turn away people or goods to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. Pompeo and Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard finalized details on the travel restrictions on Thursday night after frequent talks this week, sources familiar with the talks said. Ebrard, for his part, wrote on Twitter on Thursday night that he has pressed to ensure that measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus “don’t paralyze economic activity and that the border continues to be open to commerce and work.” Still, the coronavirus pandemic — and travel restrictions — could disrupt the more than $1.5 billion in U.S.-Mexico trade that takes place every day. “We’ve already seen it get more expensive for truckers to take loads of goods from the border up north,” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) told POLITICO. Cuellar explained that a lot of truck drivers typically fly into Laredo and pick up loads of goods from Mexico at the border to distribute to retailers across the country. Laredo is already seeing significantly fewer truck drivers flying in, he said. But the Texas Democrat said he’s been assured by the Trump administration that trucks and trains will continue to cross the border to deliver goods between the two countries. “It’s been a top priority to ensure that while, yes, we help stop transmission of the virus, we still keep balance of trade — especially given that we trade with Mexico a million dollars a minute,” Cuellar said. Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf assured that North American trade would not be affected by the U.S.' agreement with Canada and Mexico to partially close the border. ""Let me be clear that neither of these agreements with Canada or Mexico applies to lawful trade or commerce. Essential commerce activities will not be impacted. We will continue to maintain a strong and secure economic supply chain across our borders,"" Wolf said Friday. Meanwhile, Mexican officials have been working overtime to ensure that business goes on as usual between the two countries given that they are top trading partners.

"Top Senate Republican and Democratic negotiators — joined by senior Trump administration officials — kicked off talks Friday on a massive, third stimulus package to salvage the U.S. economy, with a goal by having a deal by the end of the day.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has vowed to pass the new stimulus though the chamber by Monday, an incredibly fast pace that Republicans and White House say is needed to address the growing public-health emergency. McConnell is already preparing to take the procedural moves needed to make that happen.  The negotiations began in the historic Hart 216 room, where Supreme Court nominations and crucial hearings often are held, and then spread out to the Finance Committee's offices as four ""task forces"" and sub-groups met.  “I tasked these bipartisan teams to reach agreement by the end of the day today, tonight,” McConnell said. “We’ll need Saturday to be drafting what we’ve agreed to … We’ll need tomorrow for Legislative Counsel to draft the agreement. And as [Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin] has indicated, it is important for us to be on the Senate floor and pass the measure by Monday.”  The four task forces — which covered distressed industries, small business, financial assistance to individual Americans and health care — took a ""pause"" in the middle of Friday afternoon while Republicans huddled for a policy lunch and Senate aides rushed to put the proposals into writing.   The high-level talks come a day after Senate Republicans introduced their $1 trillion stimulus package to save the U.S. economy by assisting individuals, small businesses and industries that have been hit hard by the pandemic.   But Senate Democrats have already raised concerns with the GOP proposal, saying it benefits businesses and industries while not doing enough for working people.   “We need to work together quickly and do something big and bold that helps the American people,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), before the start of the meeting. “Sen. McConnell’s bill is not pro worker at all, it puts corporations ahead of people.”  Senior Democratic aides, however, said privately that they believe that McConnell's Monday deadline is still feasible.  Schumer, who spoke to President Donald Trump Friday morning, asked the president to use the Defense Production Act for more medical equipment, including ventilators, according to Schumer’s spokesperson.   After speaking with Schumer, Trump said he had an “extremely good” conversation with the minority leader and expressed optimism about the “Phase 3” stimulus deal.   ""We were working on various elements of the deal, and the Democrats are very much wanting something to happen, and the Republicans likewise are very much wanting something to happen. And I think it will,” Trump said at a daily press briefing of the White House coronavirus task force. He didn’t address the Defense Production Act.  Trump added that he also spoke at length with McConnell as well. Abd Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke also by phone with Mnuchin on Friday afternoon to discuss the state of play on the “Phase 3” package.  Among the key provisions of the Senate GOP package is a plan to provide direct cash payments to individuals of up to $1,200 and families of up to $2,400, based on income. In addition to direct cash payments, the GOP stimulus plan gives small businesses $300 billion in federally guaranteed loans and $200 billion for loans for industries, including airlines.   The structure of the direct payments has emerged as a concern for some Republican members. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has panned the idea of direct cash payments broadly, while Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) are calling for the package to be fixed, after expressing concern that its structure doesn’t sufficiently benefit lower income Americans.   ""Our goal is to create an income stream not just a one-time payment,"" Graham said on Thursday. ""The problem with direct cash is you're giving it to the people who have got their salary, they don't need extra money. There are people without money that need money.""  Senate Republican aides and White House officials are signaling they’re open to making changes during negotiations.  But Republican leaders also brought in Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to counter that argument. Scalia has argued in the closed-door sessions that some states unemployment insurance systems aren't capable of handling both an expected tidal wave of new unemployment filings by Americans who just lost their jobs while at the same time gearing up to send out millions of checks.  ""The administration has expressed, based on some feedback their getting from states, that that would take a very long time,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.C.). ""Again, we're trying to do something that's quick and gets an infusion of cash out there in a hurry, and the direct payments do that.""  There are also objections being raised to some of the industry specific bailout, as well as numerous business-related tax cuts offered by Senate Republicans. Democrats are objecting that the GOP bill is not ""worker friendly."" And Trump himself said he wanted to make sure their was language in the package preventing corporations from using federal aid for stock buybacks.  ""We have some fundamental disagreements on some of the liquidity provisions,"" said a Republican senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity. We're trying to help not because we're interested in helping business ... as much as we’re just trying to help keep the economy moving and keep people employed.""  Meanwhile, Democrats are calling for expanded unemployment insurance and paid leave, as well as more assistance for hospitals.  White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland reiterated that the administration wants to see lawmakers pass the package by Monday.  “Hopefully we’ll be done in a relatively quick fashion,” Ueland told reporters Friday, adding the administration is “looking for swift action, swift conversation, swift resolution and hopefully swift accomplishment by Congress on behalf of the American people.” In addition to Mnuchin, Scalia, and Ueland, administration officials participating Friday include former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and Scalia.   ""Very good attitude, the children are playing well,"" Kudlow said when asked about the tenor of the discussions.   The Republican senators attending the talks are McConnell, Senate Banking Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho.), Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Senate HELP Committee Chair Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Senate Aging Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine), Small Business Committee Chair Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Senate Commerce Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Thune.   Among the Democrats participating are Schumer, Senate Commerce Committee Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore), Senate Small Business Committee Ranking Member Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) , Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.). Senate HELP Committee Ranking Member Patty Murray is participating by phone.   Lawmakers are trying to move as quickly as they can and are expected to work through the weekend. McConnell has vowed the Senate will not leave Washington until a deal is reached.  ""There's been some good constructive discussions about the issues,"" Thune said. ""We're trying to narrow the list of the Democrat asks and the things Republicans want. We want feedback from the bill that we put out there ... We have about 12 hours to do it.""  Durbin, for his part, said Democrats ""proposed a number of new issues that have not been raised by the Republican plan."" Democrats want hundreds of billions of dollars for hospital and health-care providers that the GOP proposal doesn't presently include.  Schumer is closely consulting with Pelosi throughout the Senate negotiations. While Schumer is unlikely to agree to any major provision that Pelosi opposes, that doesn't mean House Democrats can't include additional initiatives when that chamber takes up the bill.  McConnell, however, has refused to include Pelosi in the negotiations so far, despite pleas from both top Democrats to do so.

"Larry Edgeworth, a longtime NBC News employee, died Thursday after being diagnosed with the coronavirus, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack told staff in a memo Friday morning. Edgeworth most recently worked in an equipment room at NBC News’ 30 Rockefeller Plaza headquarters in New York, “but prior to that he spent most of his 25 years at NBC News as a skilled audio technician, often traveling to the most remote locations,” Lack wrote in his memo, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO.  “Many of you were fortunate enough to work with Larry over the years, so you know that he was the guy you wanted by your side no matter where you were,” Lack wrote. Employees were notified on Wednesday that Edgeworth had tested positive for COVID-19, but his identity was withheld at the time for privacy reasons. Edgeworth’s wife said he “suffered from other health issues that led him to succumb to the illness,” Lack wrote. Edgeworth is survived by his wife, Crystal, and two sons. “We are doing everything we can to support his family during this very difficult time,” Lack wrote. The announcement of Edgeworth’s death prompted fond remembrances Friday from NBC News reporters and colleagues. Andrea Mitchell, NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent, described Edgeworth as a “gentle bear of a man” and the “heart and soul of our extended NBC family.” “I was always cheered and reassured knowing he was on the team in the field. He always had my back whether here in the U.S. or in the most dangerous situations around the world,” Mitchell said in a statement. “His smile, his laugh, and his good humor were remarkable no matter how difficult the circumstances. He was a treasured colleague and I am terribly sorry for this unbelievable loss for his family.” “@NBCNews lost our gentle giant, our cheerleader, our sound man Larry Edgeworth to #coronavirus,” tweeted Anne Thompson, NBC News chief environmental affairs correspondent. “From Rome to the BP Oil Spill, he was the best colleague. We’d talk football and he loved the desserts I made, especially chocolate chip cookies. Love you Larry.” “I adored him,” tweeted Savannah Guthrie, co-host of NBC's “Today” show. “He was full of spirit and joy and humor. He was the pro of pros. We traveled in 2008 on a campaign plane for two months. He was a bright light every day. Larry, dear, we will miss u.” Kasie Hunt, NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent, tweeted that she “first met Larry back in 2012 before I worked at NBC, and [he] was just the most warm and welcoming colleague to work with in the years since.” “I met him as the sound tech on our team that covered the Romney campaign in 2012. He called me ‘slim,’ and helped me put together my first resume tape,” MSNBC correspondent Garrett Haake wrote on Twitter. “He was SO proud of his kids. He was hilarious.”  Bill Karins, a meteorologist for the network, tweeted that Edgeworth “left 30 Rock a week ago today saying he didn’t feel well and then tested positive for” COVID-19. “Rest In Peace Larry,” Karins wrote.

"Mike Bloomberg is sending $18 million from his defunct presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee, a dramatic investment in the national party that appears to push the boundaries of campaign finance law. The money will support the DNC’s “Battleground Build-Up 2020” program, the DNC’s initiative in 12 swing states across the country. The money could fund potentially hundreds of organizers in those swing states. “This will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help Democrats win up and down the ballot,” DNC chairman Tom Perez said in a statement. The DNC has made early, historic investments in our battleground and general election programs, and the additional organizers we're putting on the ground will significantly bolster those efforts and help make sure Donald Trump is a one-term president.”  The massive transfer signals a change of plans for Bloomberg, who is nixing an earlier idea to form his own super PAC to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. ""While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the President accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution,' an unsigned memo circulated by the Bloomberg campaign read. ""The dynamics of the race have also fundamentally changed, and it is critically important that we all do everything we can to support our eventual nominee and scale the Democratic Party’s general election efforts."" A press release accompanying the memo said that staff in six battleground states will be ""employed and paid"" through the first week in April and have ""full benefits"" through the end of that month. Bloomberg would not be able to give the DNC such a massive sum of money as a regular donor. But presidential candidates are allowed to transfer unlimited amounts to their national party committee — though usually those candidates have raised the money from donors operating under campaign finance limits. Bloomberg self-funded his whole presidential campaign from his personal fortune. The memo from Bloomberg’s operation said that it would be transferring the money, and a Democratic official noted that federal candidates’ campaign committees can transfer an unlimited amount of money to a party committee. This, however, has rarely if ever been done with a candidate who exclusively self-funded their own campaign. “They put money into their campaign with the full intent of winning the nomination, and put it in before Super Tuesday,"" Graham Wilson, a lawyer for the DNC, said. He argued the transfer was not “not breaking new ground on the law.”  A Bloomberg spokesperson said that the transfer would appear on the campaign’s next FEC filing in April, meaning the money was transferred sometime this month. The Bloomberg campaign also announced that it would transfer “several” of its former field offices to state parties.",Bloomberg makes massive $18M transfer from campaign to DNC,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/mike-bloomberg-massive-18m-transfer-dnc-138771,politico
"The Trump administration has held up $40 million in emergency aid Congress approved earlier this month to help American Indians combat the coronavirus — a delay that’s left tribal leaders across the nation frustrated and ill-equipped to respond to the fast-growing outbreak. The funding has languished in bureaucratic limbo for weeks, despite increasingly urgent pleas from tribal organizations desperate to stockpile essential supplies and keep health clinics operational. Federally run American Indian health facilities are well short on hospital beds and ventilators, some frontline clinics received fewer than a dozen coronavirus tests, and federal officials have already signaled there will be little in the way of reinforcements — telling tribal leaders that all they can send right now are expired respirators.  That’s fueled alarm throughout American Indian country and on Capitol Hill, where advocates warn the administration has done comparatively little to protect American Indians as it plans drastic action elsewhere to protect vulnerable populations and slow the virus’ spread. “We’re already the poster child for the most vulnerable populations in this country,” said Stacy Bohlen, the CEO of the National Indian Health Board, which represents tribal governments. “This is not the place you want to skimp on resources if you want to hold the tide on this disease.” The funding holdup is the latest hiccup in the federal government’s response to an outbreak that is poised to overwhelm American health care. It’s also a setback for the Indian Health Service, the $6 billion health agency primarily responsible for serving roughly 2.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, more than a quarter of whom are uninsured. The IHS has come under fire over the last several years for poor medical care, untrained staff, leadership turnover and, more recently, an investigation over reports that it failed to prevent a pediatrician from sexually assaulting young patients despite repeated warnings. An IHS spokesperson told POLITICO that the agency is working with HHS and the CDC to determine how best to allocate the $40 million, but did not provide a timeline for distributing the funds. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases among American Indians has risen in recent days, from four earlier this week to easily more than a dozen. The Navajo Nation has recorded cases 14 alone, and on Thursday, a Cherokee Nation citizen became the first person in Oklahoma to die from the virus just a day after testing positive. “For months, we watched this virus from afar,“ said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. “We hope people understand this has now hit home and is a very real pandemic that can affect anyone of us.” But a widespread shortage of tests has largely prevented tribes from monitoring for the virus, which they worry could spread rapidly through their tight-knit communities. And most American Indians and Alaska Natives now live in urban areas, where American Indian health organizations are already running low on medical supplies and funding. In hard-hit Seattle, for example, one health center anticipates losing $734,000 a month during the response effort — assuming it doesn't first run out of supplies and be forced to close. Other frontline urban American Indian facilities reported receiving fewer than a dozen coronavirus tests. The initial $8.3 billion coronavirus response package President Donald Trump signed into law March 6 allocated $40 million to help support American Indian care providers. Administration officials have since touted to tribal leaders the cash infusion as extraordinary for its inclusion of urban American Indian organizations and indicative of how serious Washington is approaching the outbreak. Yet the money remains hung up as officials at IHS and the CDC debate how to solve an obscure appropriations hurdle. Congress initially allocated the aid as grants through the CDC, despite warnings from tribal organizations and some House staffers that it could invite bureaucratic snafus, two people with knowledge of the process said. Congressional appropriators say they inserted specific language to avoid issues and ensure tribes were eligible for the funding.  “We checked with CDC when we were finalizing the language,” said Evan Hollander, a spokesperson for the House Appropriations Committee.  But the CDC has since told tribal organizations that it can’t distribute the funds because it doesn’t have the necessary funding relationship with the IHS hospitals, tribal-run health facilities and urban American Indian organizations that are supposed to receive it.  Tribal leaders said the CDC has also balked at their idea to set up an inter-agency transfer that would deliver the money to IHS directly, questioning whether it has the authority for such a transfer A CDC spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the funding, saying only that the agency is working across the administration and with tribal organizations to “finalize a plan to allocate these funds and maximize public health impact and reach to tribal populations.” The IHS has also said there's another problem. Even if it received a direct funding transfer from the CDC, it could not simply hand over the money to tribes and urban American Indian organizations because the legislation structured the funds as grants, which requires a more complex process.  Federal officials haven’t yet offered other alternatives for freeing up the money, and have remained vague about the funding’s status in conversations with tribes. “Health providers across Indian Country are risking their lives on the front lines of this crisis,” said Meredith Raimondi, a spokesperson for the National Council of Urban Indian Health, which supports health services for American Indians living in urban areas. “We don’t know what the delay is.” The delay comes as the Trump administration races to pour resources into the broader national response, promising a “whole-of-government” effort aimed at reinforcing frontline hospitals and ramping up production of ventilators and face masks. On a conference call last Friday, IHS officials, led by chief medical officer Michael Toedt, told House and Senate staffers that the agency’s health system had 625 hospital beds available nationwide, including just six ICU beds and 10 ventilators, according to three people with direct knowledge of the discussion. There are another 772 beds available across tribal-run health programs, he said, according to one person on the call.  Tribes rely heavily on IHS facilities, which provide many health care services to American Indians and Alaska Natives at no cost under the federal government’s long-held trust responsibility. Over a quarter of the tribal population in the U.S. is uninsured, more than double the national rate. Toedt days later reportedly revised IHS’ capacity figures on a press call for media outlets that cover Native issues. But IHS also warned at least one Hill office that the agency doesn’t have accurate information readily available because reporting is optional for tribal programs, and IHS was still collecting data from its regional offices, according to a person briefed on the call. IHS has since told POLITICO that as of Thursday, the agency had 37 ICU beds and 1,257 hospital beds across both IHS facilities and ones run by tribal organizations themselves, as well as 81 ventilators. Pressed further on IHS’ readiness, one IHS official characterized the agency as a “shoestring operation.” At another point, Toedt downplayed the threat by telling staffers that “IHS believes this virus will be slower to reach Indian country,” according to a person on the call.  “It was quite scary, to be very frank,” said the person, who left the discussion shaken. Another person on the call blamed chronic underfunding of the IHS for the agency’s dire assessment. “They’re working out of a hole that is so deep it’s really kind of unfathomable,” that person said. An IHS spokesperson noted that the agency’s annual budget is less than one-sixth what tribal leaders estimate is needed to fully fund the American Indian health system. When asked about Toedt’s comments on the virus’ spread, the spokesperson emphasized that IHS has “always been clear that this is a rapidly evolving situation.” The IHS has also made few promises to organizations running low on critical protective equipment and medical needs, just as the rest of the health care industry struggles to stock up ahead of an expected wave of patients. Unlike states, American Indian organizations cannot easily draw on the federal Strategic National Stockpile designed specifically to aid the response to a public health emergency. Instead, the IHS told tribal organizations in recent weeks that its National Supply Service Center, created in 1981 to aid tribal needs, will release two models of respirators to help bridge the gap. However, it warned, the respirators are already expired. IHS confirmed those details, telling POLITICO that the broader health department is “inundated” with supply requests from all over the country. “To address ongoing nationwide shortages IHS has offered, at no cost, N95 respirators that have exceeded their manufacturer-designated shelf life, in accordance with CDC guidelines,” the IHS spokesperson said. The CDC has said expired N95 respirators may offer more protection than surgical masks. In a survey published Tuesday by the National Indian Health Board, just 16 percent of its tribal leaders, providers and partners reported receiving federal resources of any form to aid the response. Even fewer — 4 percent — had received basic protective equipment. “We don't know what this really looks like,” Bohlen said of the virus’ impact on Indian country. “Because we don’t have the tools necessary — like the rest of America — to figure out what is going on here.”",Exclusive: Emergency coronavirus funds for American Indian health stalled,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-american-indian-health-138724,politico
"The State Department is beginning to put together charter flights for Americans stranded overseas during the coronavirus pandemic, with Morocco and Peru scheduled soon — even as others stuck in Guatemala took matters into their own hands. The rush to bring Americans home comes after the State Department announced a level four travel advisory Thursday, and amid reports of potentially thousands of Americans stuck in multiple countries without commercial flights or that had shut their borders. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a press briefing Friday that the agency is using ""all of the tools we can"" to bring Americans home, including a combination of commercial and private flights, and is talking to the Pentagon about using space on military aircraft.  He said State has put together a ""repatriation task force"" which is working on reports from individual citizens and members of Congress, and is urging stranded travelers to log in to the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. ""We'll track you and try to get everybody back,"" he said.  The first flights out of Morocco, which closed its borders on March 14, started Friday morning, according to the U.S. embassy there. U.S. citizens are able to hop a flight from Marrakesh for $1,485. The flights will stop in London before landing in 10 different U.S. cities. Stranded Americans — citizens and legal permanent residents only — must sign up by emailing [email protected]. Congressional offices were alerted of the flights Thursday night, according to one aide who received details via a State Department email. Congressional staff also received an email saying that Avianca Airlines, a Colombian air carrier, has created an online page where the hundreds of Americans stranded in Peru can sign up for flights home. Others, tired of waiting for the U.S. government to act, took matters into their own hands, in some cases crossing over the border from Guatemala into Mexico to catch flights that are still operating. Two people stuck in Guatemala, which has also closed its borders to flights, told POLITICO that they had purchased tickets from Avianca this week which were canceled, and that the airline had ignored their calls afterward. Avianca did not respond to a request for comment.  President Donald Trump also said Thursday that the U.S. military is working on getting people out of Peru, but didn't mention any other countries specifically. One group, who found each other online, had given up on the U.S. embassy and were discussing how to get rides to Tapachula Airport in southern Mexico, several told POLITICO. They asked for anonymity in order to discuss their situation openly. They've been sharing information in a group chat about where to cross the border, how to get a reliable ride, and how much the trip costs — including both paying a driver and the possibility of having to pay off Mexican customs officers.",U.S. starts some repatriation flights for stranded Americans ,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/us-starts-some-repatriation-flights-for-stranded-americans-138663,politico
"The vast majority of the super PAC millions backing Elizabeth Warren in the final days of her presidential campaign came from one person: Karla Jurvetson, a wealthy doctor based in the Bay Area who donated a massive $14.6 million to the main group that supported Warren.  In the last weeks of Warren’s struggling presidential bid, a super PAC called Persist PAC hastily formed and then swooped into Nevada, South Carolina and Super Tuesday states to run over $14 million in ads trying to resuscitate Warren’s campaign. Warren was in trouble after third and fourth place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. Jurvetson is one of the biggest donors in the Democratic Party and has spoken openly about what she feels is her obligation to support female candidates. ""I feel like it’s our moral duty, if we’re not going to run ourselves, to support the women who are brave enough to put their name on the ballot,” she told the Mercury News in 2018. Jurvetson also hosted a fundraising luncheon for Warren in 2018 — before the Massachusetts senator disavowed in-person fundraising events altogether during her presidential run.  Through a spokesperson, Jurvetson declined to comment on her involvement in Persist PAC, which only collected a half-million dollars from other sources in February, according to a new campaign finance filing. Warren did not respond to a request for comment.  After spending much of her campaign denouncing the corrupting influence of big money, Warren tried to justify the existence of the super PAC rather than demand that it take its ads off the air. Persist PAC was the biggest-spending outside group airing TV ads on Super Tuesday. “If all the candidates want to get rid of super PACs, count me in,” Warren said in Nevada, before she placed fourth in the caucuses there. “It can't be the case that a bunch of people keep them and only one or two don’t.” Warren’s message was noticeably different than just a few months earlier in the campaign, when a group affiliated with Jurvetson took out an ad in the Des Moines Register in Iowa. Warren spokesperson Chris Hayden told POLITICO in November that that the “campaign was not aware of this and asks that those involved immediately stop purchasing advertisements of any kind.”",Mystery Warren super PAC funder revealed,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/mystery-warren-super-pac-funder-revealed-140233,politico

"President Donald Trump is always keeping score. Sometimes it's a simple brag — boasting about the highest State of the Union TV ratings in history, trumpeting that he appointed more judges than George Washington, inflating the number of electoral college votes he won in 2016. But cherry-picked numbers are also central to how Trump comprehends a crisis and crafts a positive narrative. As the coronavirus raced around the globe and seized the world’s economy, he has cited numbers to suit his own story that the pandemic would quickly pass and that his administration was in control.  It’s a playbook that hasn’t always worked. In late February, Trump claimed there were only 15 coronavirus cases in the United States — a vast understatement — and promised “within a couple of days,” the number would be close to zero. That number has now soared past 14,000 and is climbing exponentially. He seized on figures about how many people the seasonal flu killed annually — 37,000 last year alone — without the country needing to shutter most businesses. His own health officials categorically rejected the comparison.  Then, Trump promised the administration would have 1.4 million coronavirus tests available by mid-March. But as of Thursday, only 100,000 people had been tested, causing one of the president’s top infectious disease experts to concede, “Clearly, more needs to be done.” Public health specialists say Trump’s use of misleading numbers to downplay the coronavirus outbreak — a challenge that could make-or-break his presidency — has had dangerous consequences, leading Americans to ignore official warnings about modifying behaviors to slow the disease’s spread.  “He's a man that hears what he wants to hears … and he puts it through the lens of a marketer. He is a marketer,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “His image is, ‘I’m on top of this, I’m tough,’ and anything he hears that supports that theory of the case, he grabs and utilizes.” Those around Trump disagree. They say his numbers-focused mindset is a crisis asset. Trump’s specific obsession with the number of coronavirus cases is the right approach, argued former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who made headlines when he insisted — wrongly — that Trump had drawn the largest ever inaugural crowd. “Having a metric-based business mentality is what you need during periods of crisis,” said Spicer, who visited the White House at least twice this week. “Either people are getting better and it’s being contained or it’s not. It’s the only judge of success.” Trump is obsessed with records, ratings and statistics, mentioning them constantly on seemingly every issue as he talks about what’s best — often inflating the numbers, often failing to acknowledge the human aspect, often overhyping his own role. There’s interest rates and unemployment rates, crowd sizes and polls, stock markets gains and immigrant apprehension numbers. Before running for office in 2016, Trump had spent his five decades in the real estate, marketing and reality TV businesses. He sold himself to voters on that background, touting his ability to strike deals with countries and companies alike.  Once in office, he talked about policy moves like one-off deals, often becoming preoccupied with certain figures. For example, he has constantly complained about trade deficits — when the value of what the country imports exceeds its exports — spouting off the amount with each country. $500 billion a year with China, $100 billion with Japan, $17 billion with Canada.  When Trump has struck new deals with China, Mexico and Canada and others, he’s always noted how much the agreement will reduce each trade deficit.  “When you’re in the real investment business, the performance is only based on numbers and that’s all that matters,” said a Republican who speaks to Trump. “He spent a lifetime on it. He’s not going to think differently now. That’s how you judge real estate. That’s all they have. It’s all about the money.” But Trump has been accused of forgetting the people behind the numbers. In August, Trump touted the crowd size of a rally — held at the same time as an event of then Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke —- while visiting medical staff who had treated victims of a mass shooting.  That criticism has resurfaced during the coronavirus pandemic. During the early stages of the outbreak, Trump mused about keeping coronavirus-infected passengers aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship in the waters off California to keep down the number of U.S. cases.  “I like the numbers being where they are,” he said. “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.” Michael Caputo, who has known Trump for three decades and served as a campaign adviser in 2016, acknowledged Trump can be accused of being unfeeling, but compared it to how a statistician or economist might be criticised for being too focused on numbers and not people. But Caputo argued Trump has changed his approach as president.  “That’s part of the learning curve,” he said. “He has embraced the human side.” Caputo said toying with numbers is how Trump processes his options and reveals his thinking. “When global society is melting around him, he leans back on what he knows. Data is what he knows,” he said. “He muses, thinking aloud. My experience with the president he verbalizes all the options on the table and discusses every piece of data.” Trump’s political fixation on favorable figures goes back to his campaign. While on the campaign trail, Trump often talked about having a statistician he frequently called to get numbers about whatever he wanted. “You know, I have a person. He's a statistician. He's so excited by his job. He loves it,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Albuquerque, N.M., in May. “I do like details and I do like statisticians,” he said at a Sacramento rally the following month. There was even a rally where he held up charts to illustrate what he said were the failures of President Barack Obama and his secretary of State, Hillary Clinton — Trump’s rival. There were charts on homeownership rates, the national debt, Syrian refugees entering the U.S., commuted prison sentences as well as hedge fund managers-turned Clinton campaign contributors and foreign donations to the Clinton family foundation. Trump’s rallies have continued during his presidency — until coronavirus, that is. And certain figures have become a recurring part of his stump speech.  He describes the African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates are the lowest rate in history, though they have risen again. He claims seven million people have joined the workforce since he’s been president, though the gains are lower than Obama’s final three years. He said his administration has built 100 miles of new wall along the southern border, though most of that was simply upgrading existing sections. And he always talks about his 2016 electoral college vote total — which was 304, not 306 — without noting that Clinton won the popular vote.  “We were not supposed to crack 220, you know that, right?” Trump told a crowd in February 2017. “There was no way to 221, but then they said there’s no way to 270.” Trump still talks about crowd sizes, boasting about the “record” numbers who have attended or watched from outdoor jumbo screens at the nearly 100 rallies he’s held as president. This less-consequential braggadocio has also surfaced during his near-daily coronavirus briefings.  On Sunday, Trump touted a stock market surge that occurred late Friday after he declared a national emergency to free up funds to combat the coronavirus.  “It went up 2,000 — almost 2,000 points,” he said. He wasn’t wrong, but by Monday the stock market plummeted again amid reports Trump had inflated the progress made fighting the virus — another fallout from his reliance on misleading figures during the coronavirus crisis.  An outside Trump adviser said Trump feels the need to offer up his record because he needs to justify himself against what he sees as the constant media attacks. “Numbers matter,” the person said. “That’s how you judge the status of things.

"President Donald Trump has pledged to “slash red tape like nobody has even done it before” to accelerate the development of a coronavirus vaccine. But his push could backfire if the government moves too fast, according to public health officials and scientists with decades of experience in the field. In some cases, a vaccine that hasn’t been properly tested could make people sicker. And if there are complications, the public relations problems could mount, spurring an anti-vaccination sentiment. “There’s a lot of hope for a [coronavirus] vaccine but there obviously has to be a lot of caution,” said Kathryn Edwards, a Vanderbilt University pediatrician who helped test vaccines against whooping cough, pneumonia, flu and other diseases. NIH infectious disease leader Anthony Fauci has said it could take 12 to 18 months to make a vaccine available, but even that timetable could be overly ambitious. The most promising technologies haven't been tested on massive groups of people. And public health officials typically take their time when vetting vaccines targeted at millions. There are several examples of how fast-tracking vaccines can backfire. A massive campaign to vaccinate against the 1976 swine flu flopped when the disease turned out to be mild, but hundreds of people suffered a rare nerve disorder after vaccination. And a vaccine used in some European countries against H1N1 flu in 2009 caused some people to develop the sleep disorder narcolepsy. The Trump administration has already allowed one vaccine maker to begin testing its coronavirus shot in people before completing standard safety testing in animals — normally the first step in the long process of determining a vaccine’s safety and efficacy. The president wants to show that he is activating the full power of the federal government in pushing for the health care system to react, treat and find a vaccine. But the infrastructure of vaccine development is not conducive to political pressure or a runaway pandemic. And while no one is saying the current candidate vaccines are dangerous, they warrant dutiful examination “because in contrast to drugs, vaccines are given only to healthy people,” said Barry Bloom, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. “We have to be enormously careful not to harm anyone.” If there are harms, he added, “the antivaxxers can set back not only this vaccine but all vaccines.” A growing anti-vaccine movement contributed to the U.S. measles epidemic last year — the worst since 1992. Anti-vaxxers are already spreading conspiracy stories about the virus and predicting massive injuries from any vaccine, said Renée DiResta, who monitors such groups at the Stanford Internet Observatory. Most people will be eager to get vaccinated if the coronavirus continues on its terrifying course. Experts say the vaccine types with the best chance of early approval seem safe, though none has been licensed for human use. If properly warned of possible side effects, people might accept them in exchange for a shot that keeps them from getting sick or spreading the disease. Some even suggest it would be unethical not to accelerate the approval process at a time when the virus is killing thousands worldwide. “The normal development of a vaccine is long and large and defensive because you’re developing something to be given to healthy people, most of whom will stay healthy and will never need the benefit of the vaccine,” said Michael Watson, who has developed vaccines for 25 years — including at Moderna, which is working on a vaccine with the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “If you’re developing a cancer treatment, you can take quite a bit of risk for saving someone’s life. And the situation also changes when you’re in a global pandemic.” Still, it’s unclear how fast is too fast. Some scientists worry the Moderna vaccine could cause “immune enhancement,” a complicated reaction that makes a vaccinated person sicker when they catch the virus than if they hadn’t gotten the shot. NIAID said in a statement it was looking carefully for signs of this phenomenon in the Moderna trial. But agency scientists see little risk the experimental vaccine will cause the problem, it said. The government may face its first big regulatory decision in about four months, when NIAID and Moderna turn over data on the safety and immunity of their vaccine, which they began testing on the first of 45 individuals in Seattle on Jan. 16. The FDA would have the legal authority to promise emergency authorization of the Moderna vaccine based on a subsequent Phase II trial of a few hundred additional people. But that would be unheard of for a vaccine designed for massive use. Typically, such vaccines are tested on thousands in an area where there’s lots of disease, in order to directly measure how well the vaccine compares with a placebo. That process can take years. The possibility that the FDA could preapprove widespread emergency use before the side effects are fully understood, along with Trump’s eagerness, worries some of the dozen vaccine experts interviewed by POLITICO. “We seem to be willing to rush a vaccine into clinical trials without extensive animal model or safety testing,” said Paul Offit, a University of Pennsylvania immunologist who co-developed the rotavirus vaccine. “People are so scared of coronavirus that even those who are young and healthy will be willing to take a relatively untested product — even though the wild-type virus is unlikely to kill them.” Offit’s vaccine, which eliminates thousands of infant deaths each year, took 26 years from design to licensure. Red tape and delay can sometimes pay dividends in drug and vaccine approvals. Industry officials laid into FDA official Frances Kelsey in 1961 for her reluctance to approve their morning sickness drug thalidomide, but her sloth turned into a blessing. While Kelsey pondered the submission, news of crippling birth defects in thousands of babies poured in from Europe, and the FDA never approved the drug. During the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, federal officials decided not to approve vaccines that contained a new substance designed to boost the vaccine’s effectiveness. As a result, the United States was spared a controversy over an unpredictable side effect — narcolepsy — that struck people in Finland who got the newer shots. Some of the officials who made that decision had the 1976 swine flu fiasco on their mind. That year, after a new strain of influenza virus swept Fort Dix, N.J., the CDC became worried about similarities to the 1918 pandemic flu and convinced President Gerald Ford to order vaccines for the whole country. But the flu strain turned out to be relatively mild, and 450 people who’d received the vaccine got Guillain-Barré, a rare form of paralysis. Although later studies showed the vaccine was responsible for a minority of those cases, the debacle damaged trust in the government — and vaccination. To be sure, this is not 1976. ""The first and most obvious difference is, in 1976 we never had a disease. We know this is a dangerous virus — that's a day and night difference,"" said Harvey Fineberg, chair of the National Academies' Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases. “There are two dangers of history: Failing to learn the lesson, and overlearning the lesson,” said Fineberg, who co-authored the definitive study of the swine flu affair. The best approach, he said, was to “think one step beyond the next step, and decide what you need to decide when you need to decide it.” At a World Health Organization meeting Friday, the agency offered help to standardize tests and procedures for about 20 other target vaccines, said a scientist who attended the meeting by phone. Chinese military scientists are already testing their own coronavirus vaccine. “The range of approaches on the table is amazing in a positive way,” said vaccine developer Stanley Plotkin, an emeritus professor at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. “I’m optimistic that probably more than one of those approaches will work.” Plotkin’s rubella vaccine, which has prevented hundreds of thousands of cases of serious birth defects, is part of the MMR shot. It took six years to develop.",Why the push for a quick coronavirus vaccine could backfire,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/why-the-push-for-a-quick-coronavirus-vaccine-could-backfire-139854,politico
"A staffer in Vice President Mike Pence’s office has tested positive for coronavirus, Pence’s spokeswoman announced on Friday. “This evening we were notified that a member of the Office of the Vice President tested positive for the Coronavirus,” Katie Miller, Pence’s press secretary, said in a statement. “Neither President Trump nor Vice President Pence had close contact with the individual. Further contact tracing is being conducted in accordance with CDC guidelines.” The staffer was not immediately identified on Friday evening. Pence has not been tested for the virus, and his office said there were no plans to test the vice president at this time. The staffer adds to the growing list of White House and congressional personnel who have tested positive for the virus since the global outbreak reached heightened levels in the United States. President Donald Trump tested negative for the virus, his physician announced last Friday. Pence said earlier this week that he had not been tested. Several members of Congress have closed their Washington offices or gone into self-quarantine following positive diagnoses of the virus among staff members. Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Ben McAdams (D-Utah) were the first two members to test positive, on Wednesday. Several members of the president’s immediate circle were potentially exposed to the virus last week at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, where the White House hosted a delegation from Brazil, including President Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro tested negative for the virus, but some of his aides have since tested positive — including one who was seated with Trump at a dinner at the resort. The White House has also been shifting more of its work online to limit person-to-person contact, and many staffers have opted to work from home. Temperature checks are now in place for all those coming in contact with Trump and Pence, and several programs and tours have been canceled. “In order to keep the entire White House complex safe and healthy, beginning Monday morning, temperature checks will be conducted on everyone who enters campus,” deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere said last week. “As was announced over the weekend, additional temperature checks will be conducted on individuals who are in close contact with the president and vice president throughout the day.” ",Pence staffer tests positive for coronavirus,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/pence-staffer-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-139791,politico
"The federal agency that serves as an international multimedia broadcaster for the U.S. informed all employees of its first known coronavirus case about an hour after it knew. But the agency responsible for regulating civil aviation in the U.S. didn’t immediately tell technical operations employees about a positive test result at a Las Vegas airport, allowing them to continue working in a potentially infected area. Those employees, including technicians who had just completed their shifts, found out after a tower was evacuated.  Dozens of employees who work across the nation’s federal agencies have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, adding to the surging count of well over 10,000 confirmed cases in the United States. Experts expect the number of cases to continue rising as more tests are made available — and the federal government’s millions of employees are just as exposed as the American public at large. Meanwhile, hundreds, if not thousands, of other government employees have quarantined themselves either out of precaution or because they are exhibiting symptoms of the disease. But if the Trump administration has a unified policy on how it is handling the grim march of the virus within its own ranks, it isn’t sharing it.  Just as cities and states across the country have developed their own responses to the outbreak — from closing schools, bars, restaurants, movie theaters and a mix of other venues to encouraging curfews and issuing shelter-in-place orders — agencies across the federal government are crafting their own policies on how to disclose cases of coronavirus. The result is a confusing jumble of messages that has angered federal workers and those who represent them. “We’ve been getting a lot of mixed information. The president has put out different information, then OMB puts out guidance, and then the DOT secretary puts out guidance and then the FAA administrator puts out guidance,” said Mike Perrone, national president of Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, AFL-CIO, a union that sounded the alarm on the FAA’s lack of transparency with the Las Vegas worker who was diagnosed with the virus. “Nobody said nothing for how many hours? And they knew about it?” Perrone added. “I’m frustrated — very frustrated — because literally people are gonna get sick and people could potentially die or spread it to their families.”  There are no clear directions for reporting disclosures of coronavirus throughout the federal government, leaving each individual agency to determine how to share information about known cases — who gets to know, how soon they should be informed and how often they require updates. The spectrum ranges from severe undersharing to daily reports. A spokesperson for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission told POLITICO the agency provides updates to staff each day, including when leadership was alerted to an employee who exhibited symptoms of the coronavirus at its headquarters. “Staff were alerted over the weekend through email, the agency’s alert system and a posting to the EEOC website,” said Kimberly Smith-Brown, an EEOC spokeswoman.  Voice of America reported its first case to employees on Thursday roughly an hour after the agency itself was notified, following through on its commitment to “give you information as soon as possible.” VOA Director Amanda Bennett pledged to “keep you informed if further cases are diagnosed in the coming weeks.” As anxiety mounts among their staff, agencies have been encouraged to “maximize” teleworking in recent days, in line with recent guidance from the Office of Personnel Management. That guidance, however, is a recommendation — not a rule. It encourages employees to refer to their specific agencies “for communications and guidance on telework or leave status.” But some agencies have gone a step further. The Department of Transportation, after confirming its first case on Thursday morning, told employees via email that “effective immediately and until further notice, we are mandating that all employees not report to duty at the DOT headquarters unless specifically notified by your manager.” Similarly, the Commerce Department mandated that all employees in the Herbert C. Hoover building begin teleworking until Monday after informing employees of its first case Wednesday night. And the Department of Agriculture told employees who worked in close proximity to an employee who tested positive Sunday that they should begin teleworking immediately. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette emailed staff Wednesday about a DOE employee at its Forrestal headquarters building who was diagnosed with coronavirus. The Education Department hasn’t had any cases, but a spokesperson said the department would “send a note to employees in the affected area” if one were diagnosed with the virus. The Department of Health and Human Services has asked all of its operating and staff divisions in the National Capital Region to “leverage maximum telework flexibilities,” a spokesperson said Thursday. Two HHS agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, confirmed their first case this week. The Food and Drug Administration has “a few” confirmed cases, according to FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo, who said she wasn’t able to share a more specific number. On Friday evening, Vice President Mike Pence’s office announced that a staffer had tested positive, though a spokeswoman said that neither Pence nor President Donald Trump had had close contact with the person. Pence has not been tested for the virus, and his office said there were no plans to do so at this time. Citing the growing number of reports of federal employees who have continued to go to work and contract the virus, Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called on Trump to do more.  “This is an urgent situation,” Van Hollen said in a clip posted to Twitter on Thursday. “Mr. President, you’ve got to issue an executive order to all agencies to maximize telework, and do it now.” Administration officials counter that guidance, rather than executive orders, are the nimblest approach to the evolving threat of the virus and that agency leaders should ultimately determine what’s best for them and their employees.  Drafting an executive order is a time-consuming process that may not be able to keep up with the pace of the outbreak, they note, and sending all government employees home could harm Americans: food shortages due to lack of inspections, for instance, and no air traffic controllers to direct aircraft. “By acting early and decisively, President Trump has ensured the government continues to be open and essential services are provided to the American public, including our most vulnerable,” an Office of Management and Budget spokesperson said in a statement. “Now is not the time to be distracted by those who use business-as-usual Washington tactics to distract from the urgent measures which all Americans are taking to respond in this emergency.” The White House issued guidelines this week recommending Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people and work from home as much as possible. To slow the spread of the virus, it also encouraged sick Americans, older people and those with underlying conditions to stay home. Inside the White House itself, staffers have started conducting temperature checks of anyone who may come in close contact with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, including reporters and anyone going in and out of the Oval Office. They also have reduced the number of reporters sitting in the rows of chairs in the briefing room, requiring an open seat between every reporter. Outgoing chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and incoming chief of staff Mark Meadows both self-quarantined, and press secretary Stephanie Grisham has been working from home. Trump tested negative for the virus, as did his daughter Ivanka, and Pence has told reporters that he hasn’t been tested. Some agencies, like the State Department, Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, have unique considerations that make mitigating the spread of the virus especially challenging.  State has more than 75,000 employees, with more than 9,000 Foreign Service and Civil Service officers scattered overseas. DHS employs more than 240,000 workers, many of whom interact with people daily for work, such as employees with Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration. And the Department of Defense has roughly 26,000 employees inside its Pentagon headquarters in Virginia, but employs nearly 3 million service members and civilians worldwide, with a presence in more than 160 countries and nearly 5,000 defense sites. There is growing frustration inside the State Department about the limited internal communications on the impact of the virus on its workforce. The department’s employees are flung across the world, including in many countries with poor health infrastructure. But even U.S. diplomats and other staffers based in Washington are worried about their exposure. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters Tuesday that only a “handful” of employees have tested positive. “You can count ‘em on one hand,” Pompeo said.  A State Department official familiar with the issue, however, said there are around 50 suspected coronavirus cases of people affiliated with the State Department worldwide, including some two dozen in the U.S. Several cases have been confirmed positive, the official said.  At least one State Department employee working in Washington has also tested positive, according to a notice from the Bureau of Consular Affairs obtained by POLITICO. Overall, the information available on State Department cases has come through patchwork messaging involving various embassies, bureaus and other divisions with no centralized, regular updates about the department as a whole. The department has suspended routine visa services in most countries due to the outbreak, a State Department spokesperson said, a move that limits the exposure of diplomats to potential carriers. But there’s no uniform guidance across embassies on when, for instance, staffers should cancel meetings or what other social distancing measures they should take, a State Department staffer monitoring the situation said, adding to confusion in the ranks. On Thursday, the U.S. Agency for International Development confirmed its first known case of an employee contracting the virus. The employee is affiliated with a USAID mission in sub-Saharan Africa, according to agency administrator Mark Green.  In an email to USAID employees, Green, who is leaving his post soon, promised that the agency “will continue to provide you with timely updates that include all available information and relevant guidance.” Nearly 500 DHS employees were quarantined as of Wednesday, and at least 13 were either confirmed of having coronavirus or presumed positive, according to documentation reviewed by POLITICO. A DHS spokesperson, however, wouldn’t comment on the documentation on the record.  At the Pentagon, officials are relying on individual offices to assess themselves and their colleagues for any signs of the virus. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Friday morning that 67 service members have tested positive, though the Pentagon later reported its first two cases inside the building, according to the Air Force. DOD has issued guidance encouraging employees to stay home if they or someone they work with show symptoms. “This really starts with the individual, and I think it is not about policy at this point,” said Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs, the Joint Chiefs surgeon, who personally sent home two staffers who may have been sick. “It’s about a shared commitment to minimize the impact of this outbreak, and each of us individually has a responsibility.”  Nahal Toosi, Lara Seligman, Myah Ward, Daniel Lippman, Sarah Owermohle, Betsy Woodruff Swan, Rebecca Rainey, Liz Crampton, Nicole Gaudiano, Eric Wolff, Brianna Gurciullo, Tanya Snyder and Meridith McGraw contributed to this report.",Trump administration confronts a growing coronavirus threat within,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/coronavirus-government-agencies-transparency-138711,politico
"The nation’s health care system and its economy are already reeling from the effects of the still spreading coronavirus. But the pandemic has had a profound, though less noted, impact on our legal system as well. I practice in courts across the country, and over the past week my inbox has been full of orders and notices from courts regarding changes in their practices due to the coronavirus. These orders give us a peek into how courts across the country are scrambling to ensure that justice is served and constitutional rights are protected while they make serious accommodations in the face of this public health threat. While these measures are a necessary response to a global crisis, if any of them stick after the threat has abated, they could permanently alter the legal system—and not necessarily for the better. Even temporary changes have a big impact. For example, federal and state courts around the country have rapidly issued orders that delay thousands of cases en masse. For example, the federal court in Manhattan postponed all civil and criminal jury trials scheduled to begin before April 27, and Chicago’s federal court extended all deadlines in civil cases by 21 days and struck all hearings and trials in civil cases through April 3. New York state courts have postponed all trials “until further notice.” While significant attention has been focused on the Supreme Court’s delay in oral arguments regarding President Donald Trump’s effort to shield his tax returns from New York prosecutors, which makes it even more likely that this issue will not be resolved until after the presidential election, a more immediate impact will be felt by the thousands of people who have filed civil suits and are waiting for the legal system to compensate them for their losses or injuries. Social distancing runs counter to the way our legal system works. The jury selection process requires dozens of people to congregate for hours in a room. Motions are argued in person by lawyers who sit in an often packed courtroom waiting for their case to be called. Depositions involve a witness, court reporter and multiple lawyers seated together for hours around a conference table. The criminal justice process involves even more in-person interaction. Law enforcement officers interact closely and personally with defendants, and criminal cases often involve defendants who are incarcerated and must be brought to the courtroom so they are physically present for proceedings. Charging a defendant with a felony involves convening a grand jury, which requires a dozen grand jurors to assemble in a small room with a prosecutor and witnesses. The constitutional requirement that felony cases must be charged by grand jury will greatly reduce criminal charges. For example, the federal court in San Francisco recently suspended all grand jury proceedings until May 1. Arrests can be made prior to that time, but the defendant’s rights to a speedy trial and to be charged by indictment would need to be put on hold until a grand jury is convened. And who knows whether that May 1 deadline might have to be extended? Given the risk of community spread imposed by arrest and incarceration, you can expect law enforcement to arrest fewer people in the weeks ahead, particularly for minor offenses. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez recently announced that his office “will immediately decline to prosecute low-level offenses that don’t jeopardize public safety.” His office also asked defense counsel to alert them to defendants who “are vulnerable to infection” and should be considered for release. More recently, Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) pushed for the release of low-risk federal prisoners after inmates in a California jail tested positive. But the criminal justice system can’t shut down completely, even during a pandemic in which the number of diagnosed cases is rising exponentially. Serious offenses cannot be ignored by police, so courts are turning to technology and changing their procedures in order to preserve defendants’ constitutional rights. For example, New Jersey state courts are conducting all hearings with incarcerated defendants as “video hearings, phone hearings, or will be adjourned as necessary.” Federal judges in Chicago are encouraged to review search warrant and wiretap requests via “reliable electronic means” rather than in person. Given the global pandemic we face, these accommodations may be necessary in the short term, although the specter of defendants pleading guilty after a brief video conversation with a lawyer they have never met calls into question the constitutional adequacy of procedures in some jurisdictions. In any event, everyone understands that accommodations must to be made in the short term in the face of a global crisis. But significant short-term changes can result in long-term shifts. A central feature of our criminal justice system is that defendants are physically present at all critical proceedings, which ensures that prosecutors and judges see the defendant in person while they make decisions about that person’s life, and enables the defendant to consult with his or her attorney in real time. The personal, face-to-face nature of our criminal justice system gives it humanity that a highly automated procedure would lack.  A streamlined process for investigating and prosecuting crimes can make law enforcement much more efficient. On its face, that may sound like a good thing, and it very well might be. But current penalties and legal standards are based upon a system that punishes only a fraction of people who commit crimes that can be difficult to detect and prosecute. If prosecutions are streamlined and our legal standards don’t change, incarceration could increase despite a widespread bipartisan consensus that criminal justice reform is needed. Our legal system needs to evolve in the short term to respond to the coronavirus, and it is doing so. Recent positive tests by U.S. Marshals and courthouse employees drive home how necessary that evolution is right now. But once this crisis passes, we need to be mindful before using this experience to make permanent changes to our system. The humanity and face-to-face nature of our legal system is important and can't be replicated by a video screen.","Stuck in an Overwhelmed Legal System: Civil Suits, Criminal Defendants and Trump’s Tax Returns",2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/20/stuck-in-an-overwhelmed-legal-system-civil-lawsuits-criminal-defendants-and-trumps-tax-returns-139579,politico
"The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday held its first teleconference arguments of the coronavirus era, mounting a remote set-up that proved a shaky but adequate substitute for the usual in-person repartee between judges and lawyers. With the courthouse near Capitol Hill largely shuttered due to concerns about the virus, a three-judge panel of the powerful D.C. appeals court heard nearly two hours of arguments in two cases: a challenge to the Trump administration’s expansion of Obamacare exemptions for short-term health insurance policies and a labor fight involving a union representing National Weather Service employees. At least one judge, Thomas Griffith, seemed to regard the arrangements — with judges and lawyers joining remotely by phone — as less than a swimming success. Griffith is typically an active questioner and was the first out of the gate to challenge Charles Rothfeld, the attorney representing groups opposing the administration’s effort to expand the use of less-regulated, short-term insurance policies. But after some spirited jousting with Rothfeld, Griffith fell silent — involuntarily, it turned out. “I was dropped from the call for about five or six minutes and I want to make clear that I’m back on it now,” said Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee. “I tried to get in and I was on a permanent mute. And, I don’t know, I’m not on the screen anymore. By the phone, it’s kind of a mess.” At the outset of the arguments — which the public and press could hear live via a YouTube link — a court clerk announced the lawyers wouldn’t have anything like the courtroom’s green, yellow and red timing lights that help pace arguments. Instead, a bell replaced those signals.  And that wasn’t the only extraneous sound on the call — there were random beeps, muddled voices, overtalking and some long pauses. One of those pauses involved an effort by Judge Judith Rogers to question Justice Department attorney Daniel Winik, who was defending the health-insurance policy changes. Rogers launched into a question about Congress’ intent, but she trailed off, becoming inaudible. “You’re honor, I apologize. I’m actually not able to hear your question. It tailed off,” Winik said. “I was able to hear the very beginning of the question and lost you about 10 seconds in. I’m sorry with the difficulties of this format.” After some more noises on the line, Winik added: “Your honor, I’m not hearing anything.” “Hello? And….?” Rogers replied. The arguments in that case eventually got back on track. The later one, involving the Weather Service forecasters, went more smoothly. However, there were still awkward pauses and some indistinct sounds. “Am I still on? I’m getting some weird noises,” Federal Labor Relations Authority Solicitor Noah Peters asked at one point. “You’re still on,” a couple of the judges reassured him. Peters told POLITICO after the session that it was a bit strange to be arguing into a phone at his Arlington, Va., home rather than from a courtroom lectern. However, he said his office also held a “virtual” moot court session in recent days rather than in person, an adjustment required by the federal government’s virus-related directive for employees to telework wherever possible. “The only thing I had trouble adjusting to [was] when the questions stopped at one point and I was wondering if I had logged off. I had to blurt out, ‘Hello?’ to see if the line had gone dead,” Peters said. “It can be tough to know when somebody is starting to speak and stopping. For the judges, there was a little overtalking of one another, which you don’t normally see at a live, in-person argument.” Rothfeld, the attorney in the insurance case, said in an interview that the arrangement is “not ideal,” but noted some advantages to arguing over the phone. One is you can spread out your papers and notes as you see fit. Also: courtroom attire isn’t required. Even shoes are optional. “It’s better in that you can set yourself up. You can even argue in your socks, if you want, which I never get to do at the D.C. Circuit,” he said. Asked if he had actually argued shoeless, Rothfeld said: “I probably shouldn’t have owned up to it, but yes.” While arguments by conference call are uncommon in most federal courts, they’re not unheard of. An argument at the 9th Circuit in 2017 on blocking President Donald Trump’s travel ban took place by phone with the audio streamed live on cable TV and YouTube. It was something of a sensation, drawing millions of viewers on TV and the web. Some appeals courts also use video conferencing or a speakerphone to beam in judges who can’t be at a particular session. The Supreme Court —which bars cameras and only rarely allows live audio — has not yet followed the trend of other courts to harness new technology for its public work in the rejiggered coronavirus age. The high court has postponed arguments that were set to take place in about a dozen cases next week and the week after, including a trio of cases about access to Trump’s financial records. Although arguments before three-judge panels at the D.C. Circuit are going forward for now by phone, that court appears reluctant to use that format for the larger, en banc sessions held in exceptional cases. On Tuesday, the court postponed an 11-judge argument that was set to take place next week about the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s power to delay action in cases it is considering. An order said that session is being put off until April 28, when most of the court’s judges are scheduled to be together for arguments in two much higher-profile disputes: a fight over the House’s effort to force testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn, and a separate battle over a House-filed lawsuit challenging Trump’s plan to re-allocate billions of dollars in funds for border wall construction. While those three cases are now set for argument that day, the court has also warned that changes are possible to the timing and format of arguments depending on how the pandemic progresses. Some parties are seeking to delay arguments so they can take place in the more traditional in-person fashion, but the court seems keen to keep to its current schedule where possible. Last week, an attorney representing Playboy’s White House reporter, Brian Karem, in a credentialing dispute with the White House joined with a Justice Department lawyer to ask that arguments the D.C. Circuit had set for Monday be put off until May. The motion was rejected, without explanation, meaning arguments will continue as scheduled on Monday — apparently by telephone. Based on the way things played out Friday, lawyers involved said they don’t expect the judges to opt for phone arguments as a matter of routine anytime soon. “It is better than postponing the argument. It is better than canceling the argument,” said Peters, the Federal Labor Relations Authority attorney. “I don’t think, obviously, that it will become a feature of the landscape, but in all honestly I think it went well — as an experiment.”",‘Kind of a mess’: D.C.

"Joe Biden is planning a regular shadow briefing on coronavirus to start as early as Monday to show how he would handle the crisis and address what he calls the lies and failures of President Trump. Biden gave a preview of what’s to come in a conference call with reporters Friday, where he listed a litany of false and misleading statements from Trump, who has been holding regular White House press conferences concerning coronavirus preparedness and response that have been broadcast live on all major networks. “President Trump stop saying false things, will ya?” Biden said. “People are worried they are really frightened, when these things don't come through. He just exacerbates their concern. Stop saying false things you think make you sound like a hero and start putting the full weight of the federal government behind finding fast, safe and effective treatments.” Biden made his comments from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he has been holed up for more than a week in adherence with Centers for Disease Control guidelines that urge people to practice social distancing.  Immediately after the initial onset of the crisis, Biden also held his fire against the president out of concern it would look too political — an accusation leveled at him anyway by Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, who said that “Biden will take attention from real updates Americans should know just to score political points.” Ever since his commanding victories Tuesday against Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, Biden has made no public appearances or statements. Instead, he said, he has been spending time privately talking to health officials, businesses, governors and members of Congress. Now, he said, his house is being outfitted with equipment that would enable him to livestream events, have interactive tele-press conferences and broadcast interviews with network television. “I would like to get in the position and we're trying to work out so that the headquarters ... to be able to accommodate my directly answering questions in front of a press that's assigned to me,” he said. “We've hired a professional team to do that now. And excuse the expression that's a little above my pay grade to know how to do that.” Most of Biden’s time was spent lighting up Trump.  Biden pointed out that the president said the U.S. is “very close” to making a coronavirus vaccine, but that could be a year away (and Trump confused the coronavirus with Ebola). Biden noted that Trump said two Navy ships are in “tip top shape” and on the way to help, but the Navy said one is in maintenance and the other lacks a medical crew and is being “spruced up,” according to NBC News. The 500 million respirator masks that Trump said the government ordered, Biden noted, could take 18 months to arrive. And he faulted Trump for doing too little to support state and local governments. Biden also twice pointed out that Trump on March 6 said anybody who wants a coronavirus test can get it. But there aren’t enough tests. “I’m sorry to say, that was simply a lie. And it’s still not true today,” Biden said. “The United States has been far behind the rest of the advanced world when it comes to testing.”",Biden plans shadow coronavirus briefings,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/biden-coronavirus-plannings-139629,politico
"CHICAGO — Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced plans Friday he will direct the state’s 13 million residents stay home to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, a move coming less than 24 hours after California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a similar edict. Effective 5 p.m. Saturday local time all Illinois residents in Illinois will be allowed to go to grocery stores, pharmacies, doctors’ appointments and to get gas for their cars but will otherwise be subject to a “stay at home order” through April 7. “I did not come to this decision lightly,” Pritzker told reporters during a daily briefing about the disease, announcing his decision.  Illinois reported its 5th death due to the illness on Friday. State Public Health chief Ngozi Ezike said there are 585 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across 25 counties. Non-essential businesses must shut down, Pritzker said, but the “fundamental building blocks” of society will not change. Similar to New York and Ohio, which have also shuttered a range of businesses to fight COVID-19, restaurants are barred from offering dine-in service but take-out and drive-through will continue.  ""We know this will be hard,"" Pritzker said. ""This will not last forever. But it will force us to change. We in Illinois have overcome obstacles before and we will again.” Pritzker’s new plan goes well beyond what Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot told city residents in a Thursday afternoon address from her ceremonial office in City Hall, mostly urging those who feel sick to stay home. By Friday afternoon, Lightfoot made the leap alongside the governor. “This is a make break or break moment for the city and the state,” Lightfoot said during Friday’s briefing. ""Now is not the time for half measures… We need to act swiftly. We have seen what happens when we don’t mobilize,” she said, pointing to other countries that have been hit hard by the virus. “We must be intentional about flattening the curve.”Essential employees will still be able to report to work, such as supply chain crews who keep grocery stores stocked and running. First responders, manufacturing workers, journalists and food delivery workers will also be able to continue. The rest of residents must stay home except for essential needs, the governor said.  Residents may still walk outside — including at Chicago parks, though the park facilities will be closed. Libraries will also close. Pritzker said child care services will be provided to first-responders and that evictions of those who are affected by the spiraling economy will be halted.  “I asked what action can I take to save the most lives…to avoid the loss of tens of thousands of lives,” Pritzker said of his conversations with scientists, mathematicians and health officials who monitor the virus. Illinois officials are focusing on increasing testing and hospital capacity. The state is working to reopen closed hospital. Officials are determining what it will take to open the hospitals and provide medical care to patients with COVID-19. There also are discussions about starting tele-health for people who have mild symptoms.",‘We know this will be hard’: Pritzker orders Illinois residents to hunker down amid coronavirus ,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/illinois-pritzker-coronavirus-139601,politico
"On Thursday, the president said during his White House coronavirus briefing that “nobody in their wildest dreams would have ever thought that we’d need tens of thousands of ventilators.” But this need has long been recognized. Those in the pandemic and hospital preparedness community, including us, have warned for years about the likelihood of a mismatch in demand and ability to care for critically ill people, should a pandemic the likes of the 1918 Spanish Flu take place again. Now that very situation is upon us, and it’s abundantly clear that the United States government needs to step in immediately. We are facing an impact from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, that is unlike anything we have seen in modern times. For the battle against it, the U.S. needs a wartime mobilization to make mass numbers of ventilators, and to ensure the oxygen supply will be sufficient around the country for all the patients who will need it. The federal government needs to do something far more ambitious than sounding the alarm or coordinating with manufacturers: It needs to become the primary buyer and central market of ventilators. And doing so is both within its stated reach and part of its duty. With the authority of the Defense Production Act, the U.S. government should approach, if it has not already done so, all ventilator manufacturers in the country and enter into very clear and binding contracts that commit the federal government to pay companies to move to maximum production for the indefinite future. The Defense Logistics Agency, with its massive capabilities and experience, could play a role in coordinating such an ambitious operation. The principal reason people die after coronavirus infection is that they get overwhelming pneumonia and their lungs fail. While a ventilator can’t save all people with respiratory failure, it could be the critical difference between life and death for many patients. The problem is, unless we “flatten the curve,” there are, and will continue to be, far more Americans who need ventilators than the number of ventilators in America. Recently completed research shows that in Wuhan, at its peak, there were more than 2,000 COVID-19 patients requiring critical care at the same time. For countries experiencing Wuhan-like outbreaks at once across many cities, including the United States, ventilator demand could be extraordinarily high and outstrip supply so that some people needing ventilators would not be able get them. We have seen this happen in Northern Italy, resulting in very high death rates. According to the New York Times, per estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 2 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, while the country has less than 1 million staffed hospital beds. In order to try to avert such a catastrophic failure of the health care system, governors are implementing unprecedented efforts to slow transmission of the virus in order to reduce the number of people in need of critical care all at the same time. And the recent guidelines issued by the White House for what individuals should do to slow the rate of spread of the virus were clear and appropriate. But policy expressed at the White House regarding ventilators is not nearly sufficient. The president advised governors on Monday that they should try to get essential equipment and supplies, including ventilators, on their own. The problem with that approach is that suppliers will have to simultaneously engage with 50 different states and countless hospitals that would in effect be competing for supply. Instead, the federal government should be the central buyer and partner with industry. It would bring immediate and substantial resources and clarity. And when manufacturers make new ventilators in a mass effort, the federal government could help organize their distribution around the country so as to do the most good. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump invoked the DPA, which enables the U.S. government to direct private industry to prioritize manufacture of needed equipment including ventilators. But it appears that, as of Thursday, Trump had not ordered the manufacture or purchase of ventilators. He also reiterated on Thursday that he did not view the mass purchase of ventilators to be an appropriate federal function. (The White House has been unclear as to whether this changed on Friday.) We disagree in the strongest terms. Beyond existing manufacturers, the federal government should be asking other U.S. industrial giants (outside the ventilator industry) to turn their production lines to making ventilators, as the United Kingdom did this week. The UK is asking Ford, Rolls-Royce and Honda to make ventilators. If the U.S. federal government were willing to pay for the effort, perhaps some American industries, like the auto manufacturers that have already offered, would find a way to contribute. A recent Forbes article gives a snapshot of the ventilator industry and a sense of what might be possible: One U.S. manufacturer says he could ramp up production five-fold, but he hadn’t been asked to do so yet. It also reports that Germany has ordered 10,000 ventilators. On a ventilator per capita level, the U.S. would need to buy 40,000 ventilators to match that kind of investment. In a Wall Street Journal article, some giant ventilator manufactures have said they are ramping up production, but it is not clear to what extent. No one can say with certainty how many more ventilators we need—much depends on how effective our social distancing efforts are. But middle of the road estimates indicate that we will easily need a further 50,000. At an average cost of approximately $20,000 (though they can range from $12,000 to $50,000 each) we are talking on the order of $1 billion. The U.S. has and is willing to spend huge sums of money on coronavirus response efforts. This one is paramount. Some will say that enough ventilators simply cannot be made in time to be useful to all of those who need them right now and in the coming weeks. Sadly, that may well be true, but this pandemic and the need for more ventilators will be with us for a long time. If we turn massive industrial attention and resources to making ventilators, we will be better prepared for the long run through this pandemic. A surplus of ventilators—a far-off possibility at the moment—would not be a bad thing. Beyond the U.S., all countries need ventilators to deal with this pandemic. If the U.S. can create a process for massive industrial capacity and output, we should aim to produce ventilators for other countries in the world that will also desperately need them. And stockpiling ventilators in the future could prevent having to scramble to supply them should another catastrophe strike.",It’s Time to Build Ventilators Like We’re at War and Our Lives Depend on It,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/03/20/ventilators-wartime-mobilization-139581,politico
"The VA should be perfectly positioned to treat patients from afar, keeping both veterans and department employees away from possible exposure to the coronavirus. But in these early days of the pandemic response, many in the department say it's not working out. VA employees are finding it difficult to use the department’s network. Essential services are being disrupted in some locations: In Las Vegas, a number of employees have been called back into the office, despite the risks of spreading the virus, after the surge in remote work strained the network. Uploads of radiological images are taking an hour. “The impact for that is huge because if a radiologist can’t see the film, they can’t treat the patient in an emergent/critical period,” said Linda Ward-Smith, the union president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Las Vegas local, in an email. The issues are critical for an agency that both cares for a large, medically complex population — veterans — and is also expected to serve as the backup for the health care system writ large — the VA's so-called fourth mission. Making sure hospital beds are available by treating less urgent patients from afar is essential to preventing the health system from becoming overwhelmed. The department has long touted its telehealth capabilities; in November, it announced that 900,000 veterans used its telehealth services in fiscal year 2019, a 17 percent increase over the year before. In a Thursday interview with POLITICO, VA Secretary Robert Wilkie called telehealth “the wave of the future,” particularly for mental health care, and said the department would be “increasing exponentially our capabilities in that field.” It’s unclear precisely how widespread the problems are as the pandemic grows. Multiple unions representing VA employees have reported issues, and some workers have contacted congressional offices as well. VA employees use the internet for telehealth services, treating patients by video and sharing images and other health information. They also serve an important administrative service: processing veterans’ claims to use care outside the VA system. In the POLITICO interview, Wilkie attributed some of the reported problems to a stress test of the system: The department, he said, had taken out some of its “lines of bandwidth” to see how it would do with a more limited network. Employees who were using the affected lines “went down for a few minutes,” Wilkie said, adding, “but that was just part of a nationwide test on the system.” He added that the department so far has “experienced no hiccups when it comes to getting benefits out.” Ideally, the department would be expanding its telehealth services in response to the pandemic, as seeing a patient by video, or monitoring vital signs remotely, can save labor. Telehealth would help the department in “minimizing exposure to patients who they don’t want to expose … and freeing up their assets to deal with expected workload,” said Kenneth Kizer, a former undersecretary for health in the VA during the Clinton administration. Beefing up the department’s internet infrastructure is a key task in the months ahead. The department this week requested $1.2 billion in supplemental funding to add bandwidth supporting more telehealth visits and telework capabilities. One House staffer said the department doesn’t know how many employees are currently teleworking, though it estimates 75,000. The department thinks it can support approximately double that, if not slightly more, and is hoping to eventually support 300,000 employees of its nearly 400,000-strong workforce working remotely. The VA didn't respond to requests for comment regarding the estimates provided by the staffer. Jon Bloom, a co-founder of Podimetrics, a telehealth startup using wireless mats to predict the onset of diabetic foot ulcers based on limb temperature, says the department is “way out ahead of anyone I’m aware of in terms of mobilizing telehealth.” Podimetrics, which has worked closely with the department on treating diabetic patients, could allow doctors to address their concerns without bringing them into the hospital — and exposing a high-risk population to the coronavirus. And Bloom said he’s been talking with VA officials to deploy telehealth further. Still, there are operational hiccups. Multiple employees and union groups are reporting turbulence. “[T]o have tons of providers switching to using an entirely new modality all at once has been chaotic,” said one clinician who requested anonymity to speak freely. “It is overwhelming the system, and the few people who actually know how it all works and can answer people's questions.” The clinician said the VA’s telehealth software is confusing and may slow things down, especially for older providers and patients who lack smartphones and Wi-Fi. And employees’ desire to work from afar might outweigh the department’s capabilities. In Las Vegas, AFGE’s Ward-Smith said the chief of mental health had asked to deliver all visits over video — only to be stymied by issues in the department’s video connect app. Many employees, such as those who process claims, would like to work from home to minimize their coronavirus risks, but can’t due to network issues. “People are afraid,” Ward-Smith said. It’s not just AFGE reporting problems. “There have been major delays with employees accessing the network, and some have even been kicked off,” said Lee Blackmon, director of the National Association of Government Employees’ federal division. “I was also informed that the VA is considering staggering employees' telework schedules to decrease the number of employees trying to access the network simultaneously.” Reports of problems have reached the congressional level, with multiple staffers confirming they’d heard issues about slow networks interfering with work. Congress has been trying to check in on the department’s response generally, asking Wilkie for updates on the number of coronavirus tests processed per day. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee raised the IT issue in a letter to Wilkie last Wednesday.

"President Donald Trump called himself a ""big fan"" of an unproven coronavirus treatment Friday and repeatedly contradicted his own top health officials on how much is known about the drug's potential to help at least some patients affected by the pandemic. “It is very effective. It is a strong drug,” Trump declared at a long, sprawling televised briefing, referring to a malaria drug that is in the early stages of being tested against Covid-19. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci and other White House task force members appeared visibly uncomfortable as Trump repeatedly hailed the drug's promise. A day earlier, a similar scenario unfolded in the White House briefing room as FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn tried to tamp down Trump's confidence and explained the many steps that scientists have to go through before they know a treatment is safe and effective for a particular condition. ""We want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial — a large, pragmatic clinical trial — to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered,"" Hahn said of chloroquine's effectiveness. Chloroquine is one of several medications — some already on the market for other diseases, some still in the clinical pipeline — that are being tested to see if they can treat the novel virus, to make it less severe. Scientists in several countries around the world, some part of a multinational WHO effort, are undertaking studies of whether the drug, used for malaria and arthritis, can help save lives from this disease. But the existing research Trump was so enthused about is very preliminary, as Fauci painstakingly explained several times on Friday. Basically, the science done to date shows that it's worth investigating further — but it doesn't prove much on its own about its effect on Covid-19. The United States is obtaining ""millions"" of doses for further study and for ""compassionate use"" — letting doctors try the unproven drug on very sick people. Scientists can collect data if a drug is given under compassionate use rules — though not as fully as in a clinical trial. While the malaria drug has a fairly good safety profile; no medication is without some risks. And it's completely unknown whether it's safe for people who are dangerously ill with coronavirus. Researchers don't yet know when to administer it, or at what doses. It may work best right after someone is infected, or could be most effective only if someone is already critically ill. Barry Bloom of Harvard School Public Health told reporters earlier this week that preliminary research shows chloroquine might have the greatest effect ""at earliest stage of disease"" — currently a challenge when the U.S. is only testing people who already have severe symptoms. ""Something that prevents people from being severely ill is wonderful, but unlikely to affect the epidemic unless it could be used very early on,” he warned. In the best case scenario, it will take months to know whether, as Fauci said Friday, it's “truly safe and truly effective” with this disease. That didn't stop the president. “Right now, in terms of malaria, if you wanted, you can have a prescription. You get a prescription. And by the way, it's very effective. It works,” he told reporters. Fauci, who has had to strike a delicate balance between providing accurate information and avoiding contradicting his boss, cut back in. “You have to be careful when you say ‘fairly effective,’” he pleaded. “It was never done in a clinical trial.” The tense back-and-forth in the White House briefing room echoed the FDA's Hahn's similar attempts earlier this week to downplay the president's optimistic claims of readily available drugs to treat the new virus. ""What's important is not to provide falsehood but provide hope,"" Hahn said. “We need to make sure the sea of new treatments will get the right drug to the right patients, at the right dosage, at the right time."" Sarah Owermohle contributed to this report.",Trump hypes unproven coronavirus drugs as top science officials manage expectations,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/trump-hypes-unproven-coronavirus-drugs-139525,politico
"President Donald Trump on Friday shot down the prospect for any kind of nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus, resisting a step that California, New York and now Illinois have already taken. “I don't think so,” Trump told reporters Friday when asked whether California‘s strategy could be adopted nationwide.  Trump, who instead announced another series of mitigation efforts spanning the federal government, maintained that California and New York were exceptions. “Essentially you've done that in California. You've done that in New York. Those are two hotbeds,” he said. But, he added, “you go out to the Midwest, you go out to other locations, and they're watching it on television, but they don't have the same problems. They don't have by any means the same problem.” While the president said he would continue to work with governors, “I don't think we'll ever find that necessary,” he said of a nationwide lockdown. Even as his administration has ramped up its coronavirus response, Trump has appeared hesitant at times to take steps that would further kneecap a U.S. economy that is already in an unprecedented free fall. Even without a nationwide lockdown, millions of Americans have already essentially self-quarantined, posing a mortal danger to the service and hospitality industries and threatening to thrust the entire U.S. economy into a recession. The dramatic economic slowdown has prompted talks between the White House and Congress not just on a massive bailout package for suffering industries but also of plans to cut checks to individual Americans. Taken together, costs for the government's economic response are expected to soar past $1 trillion. What Trump did announce was that he had finally put the Defense Production Act, which would allow him to order private corporations to manufacture desperately supplies, “into high gear,” days after saying he would not yet trigger the Korean War-era statute. But aside from name-checking General Motors, the president declined to say what companies he had ordered into action and how many items he had ordered. He also announced the partial closure of the U.S.-Mexico border to nonessential travel, a move that mirrors the closure of the northern border with Canada earlier this week. Trump rolled out a number of new measures aimed at providing relief to American consumers as well, saying the Education Department would allow federal student loan borrowers to suspend payments for at least 60 days and that the IRS is pushing back its deadline to file taxes by three months. The president and his coronavirus task force were repeatedly questioned throughout the nearly 90-minute briefing on everything from their failures to produce widespread access to test kits for the respiratory illness to health care workers' unmet pleas for personal protective equipment or treatment machines like ventilators.  But a day after saying that it was states’ responsibility to procure supplies, and that the federal government was not a “shipping clerk,"" Trump signaled a move to nationalize the supply chain and improve the allocation of resources for health care providers. He announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would take over emergency response, asking governors to coordinate with their regional FEMA administrators.  Experts had urged such an approach because the federal government has powers to boost production that states do not and a federal approach can allocate scarce goods to the places that need them most, not just the state that calls up manufacturers fastest. Trump alluded to that dynamic on Friday. “We need certain equipment that the states are unable to get by themselves,” he said. “So we're invoking [the Defense Production Act] to use the powers of the federal government to help the states get things that they need, like the masks, like the ventilators.”  Still, the new approach appeared to be uneven. Asked about concerns raised by Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican, a day earlier that the federal government was outbidding states for critical supplies, Trump acknowledged such occurrences but contended that ""smart"" states call and tell the government to withdraw its bid. Trump insisted that there were “millions” of supplies, including masks and ventilators, heading to states. And while he did not offer many details on that front, manufacturing giant 3M announced during the briefing that it has doubled its global output of coveted N95 respirator masks since the outbreak began, increasing its output “to an annual rate of over 1.1 billion per year, or nearly 100 million per month.” But the president also wrongly suggested entities like shuttered car factories could be retrofitted instantaneously to accommodate the need for supplies, a reconfiguration that in reality could take almost a year.  “We're getting calls from automobile companies. We're getting calls from other companies saying they have plant capacity,” Trump said. “They want to make ventilators, they want to make other things. We are literally being besieged, in a beautiful way, by companies that want to do the work.”  The task force also continued to defend its coronavirus testing lags, and despite Trump’s top expert on infectious diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, conceding earlier Friday that “clearly, more needs to be done” to expand the availability of testing kits, Trump denied that access to kits was an issue. “We’re hearing positive things about testing,” Trump asserted to reporters, despite anecdotes all over from those who say they are exhibiting symptoms of the disease and still cannot get tested. When pressed on the issue, Trump shot back with a dig at the reporter personally and telling her, “Yeah, well, OK, I’m not hearing it.” But even Fauci stepped up to the lectern to acknowledge that there were still flaws in the process, telling reporters that “we are not there yet” in terms of meeting the demand for tests.  “I get the same calls that many of you get. Someone goes into a place who has a symptom and wants to get tested for one reason or another and they can't get it,” he said. “That is the reality that's happening now.” But Fauci pointed to improvements that had been made in getting people tested. “Is it the same as a few weeks ago?” he said. “Absolutely not.” The exchange appeared to irritate the president, who then returned to repeat previous attacks on his predecessor, deflecting blame for the recent stumbles and criticizing what he claimed was a “broken system” he’d inherited. “We have, now, a great system. And it’s almost fully in gear but it is able to test millions of people. We inherited a broken, old, frankly a terrible system. We fixed it and we’ve done a great job.” Trump complained. “We haven’t been given the credit that we deserve, that I can tell you.”  Despite Trump's suggestion that tests are being carried out smoothly, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that FEMA would stand up “a laboratory task force to answer” questions about a lack of supplies for tests, like cotton swabs.  “Usually it's the lab people do not understand there are actually alternative supplies in the marketplace, that they are perfectly free to use,” he said, saying that the government had just purchased 200,000 swabs on the open marketplace that they were sending to governors. “It's a complex system with 330 million Americans and all of these labs,” Azar explained. “So sometimes there's a lab that doesn't understand how much flexibility they have and how much supply there is out there. We're working through the new FEMA integration center to help correct that for folks.”",Trump on a nationwide lockdown: 'I don't think we'll ever find that necessary',2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/trump-coronavirus-nationwide-lockdown-139330,politico
"Mike Bloomberg’s defunct presidential campaign laid off hundreds more staffers Friday as he announced that that he’s folding his massive battleground operation into the Democratic National Committee. Many of the Bloomberg aides — including those purged in an initial round of dismissals—were holding out hope he would deliver on a promise to keep them on his payroll through November, particularly with the coronavirus baring down. But those hopes were also dashed Friday when the staffers were told in frank conference calls that Bloomberg would not move ahead with his planned super PAC, and instead would cede his state operation to the DNC, including an $18 million infusion to help presumptive nominee Joe Biden. The staffers, who said they were lured to the late-starting campaign with yearlong guarantees of competitive pay and health benefit packages, were invited to apply for jobs with the DNC as part of a “competitive process.”  “I guess it’s cheaper to give the DNC $18 million than keep promises because @MikeBloomberg just fired his whole campaign staff — including those of us promised jobs though November on his IE,” Amol Jethwani, a former aide, wrote in a tweet. “Disappointed I don’t have a job. Not surprised that a billionaire is cheating scum.” Several other former aides said in interviews that the news comes as a massive blow amid the tanking economy. They believe the campaign has repeatedly strung them along while misrepresenting future opportunities. “I am disgusted by Mike Bloomberg and his staff,"" one of the Bloomberg aides, who like several others spoke on the condition of anonymity, told POLITICO on Friday. ""He has left us with no health insurance during this pandemic. I have a family and do not know what we will do at the end of the month.""  The person added, ""If the DNC and Joe Biden choose to ignore us, they are complicit as well. How can the party claim to care about working Americans while taking money from a billionaire that does not fulfill his promises to his employees?” POLITICO previously reported that Bloomberg was laying off hundreds of staffers around the country and paying them through March 31, though they would be allowed to keep their Bloomberg-issued iPhones and MacBooks (which would be taxed as income). But the campaign indicated at the time that those staffers would be given priority to apply for jobs in six battleground states that were to be funded by the planned super PAC. Those already working for him in the battleground states had planned to stay on his payroll to work on the nominee’s behalf. A planned internal staff conference call with those employees Wednesday was kicked over to Friday, when they, too, were told that Bloomberg was pulling out and they’d lose their jobs.  Pennsylvania State Director Kevin Kinross, on a separate call with his staff in the state Friday, called the edict “disappointing and (an) abrupt end to everything.” Kinross said he suspected that it was a small group decision. “To have people sort of twisting in the wind for all this time when you literally have the resources to make up the rules however you want them to be,” Mustafa Rashed, the communications director in the state, added on the call. “I feel bad for the people who moved their lives, their selves, their family to come to Pennsylvania or any other state to work and then to be uprooted during the midst of a global pandemic, I don’t know, it’s not good.” Several aides who asked to remain anonymous because of non-disclosure agreements they signed with Bloomberg said the perk of being paid all year was what motivated them to join the campaign in the first place. Some said they had yet to receive promised relocation expenses.  Others pointed to the millions Bloomberg is separately sinking into coronavirus response efforts as tone deaf at a time when aides who worked long hours in call centers on his behalf will have to foot their own costs. A Bloomberg spokesperson said in a prepared statement that the DNC Coordinated Campaign is hiring in the six battleground states. “And we will assist the DNC as much as we are able to, including by providing names of staff and working to help them onboard and grow their program as expediently as possible,” the spokesperson said.  Additionally, they said staff in the six battleground states that were let go Friday would be employed and paid through the first week in April and have full benefits through the end of April.  “This is the largest contribution from a campaign to the DNC in recent history,” they said. “Although Mike suspended his campaign, he remains committed to defeating Trump and we hope all our staff submit their names for positions with the DNC Coordinated Campaign this transfer will help fund.”  The spokesperson did not immediately confirm how many staffers were let go Friday or in the previous round. But Bloomberg had more than 2,000 people spread out across the country and hundreds more at his New York headquarters.  Bloomberg dropped out after a disastrous showing on Super Tuesday and endorsed Biden. Bloomberg’s hiring materials from headquarters shared with POLITICO stated that regardless of what happened to his own campaign, field organizers could expect to have a job with “Team Bloomberg” through November, though it didn’t promise interviewees where they would be based. It outlined that organizers would be paid $6,000 a month, plus a $5,000 relocation stipend and full health, dental and vision benefits. In one staff email, an aide cited Campaign Manager Kevin Sheekey’s March 6 note in which he pasted a news report reiterating plans to keep field operations going in the half-dozen battleground states regardless of whether Bloomberg became the nominee. A spokesperson confirmed that was the plan after the first round of layoffs earlier this month. The pledge was so well established in some non-battleground states that it was used as a frequent motivator by supervisors to encourage sometimes exhausted staffers. It was also raised in at least two statewide training sessions where officials traveled from headquarters. On the Pennsylvania call, a woman asked Kinross whether the state campaign knew whether the DNC was going to try to keep people who have uprooted their entire lives to the state of Pennsylvania. “No, we don't, we don’t ...There’s no answer,” he replied. “All the decisions are going to be the DNC’s.”",Bloomberg lays off hundreds as coronavirus bears down,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/bloomberg-campaign-layoffs-coronavirus-139362,politico
"After more than 12 hours of negotiations, top Senate Republican and Democratic negotiators — joined by senior Trump administration officials — were unable to reach an agreement Friday night on a massive $1 trillion-plus bill to rescue the U.S. economy from the growing coronavirus crisis.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) convened the bipartisan discussions on Friday morning, urging both sides to have a deal — or at least the framework of an agreement — in place by the end of the day so the Senate could vote on the package by Monday. But talks will now go into the weekend. And Republicans warned that they would begin drafting their own bills Saturday, even without a bipartisan accord.  ""There's still some significant outstanding issues, very significant to our side, that they haven't agreed to,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said.   Schumer said Friday evening that he was ""hopeful"" a deal can be reached but negotiators still had a long way to go.   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), whose panel oversees a big portion of the economic-relief package, said there are ""three or four [issues] that have to be worked out.""  Among the unresolved issues are increased unemployment insurance payments, significant financial assistance for hospitals and health-care providers to treat coronavirus victims, and a proposed ""State Stabilization Fund,” which is intended to address billions of dollars in looming revenue shortfalls suffered by state governments during the emergency.  But Republicans believe that Democrats won't block any rescue bill over fear of the potential political fallout.  ""As I said, there's been a lot of good conversations, a lot of substantial progress, but with the way the schedule is now accelerated in the Senate, the Senate needs to begin drafting legislative text, and they'll turn to that next,"" said White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland.  Ueland added that the White House and Senate Republicans ""are very hopeful"" that Democrats ""won't elect to grind it to a halt or gridlock it on the floor because a lot of improvements made in the legislation involve reflection of the concepts that they brought to Senate Republicans and us over the next several hours.""  McConnell's proposed timetable for finishing work on what is likely to turn out to be the most expensive economic rescue package in American history sets an incredibly ambitious pace. Republicans and White House say there is an urgent need to address the growing public-health emergency, and McConnell is already preparing to take the procedural moves needed to make that happen.  The negotiations began Friday morning in the historic Hart 216 room, where Supreme Court nominations and crucial hearings often are held, and then shifted to the Finance Committee's offices as four ""task forces"" and sub-groups met. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spent the day huddled with senators from both parties as they searched for an agreement. Mnuchin also had multiple phone conversations with Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to try to work through problems in the ""Phase 3"" package.   “I tasked these bipartisan teams to reach agreement by the end of the day today, tonight,” McConnell said. “We’ll need Saturday to be drafting what we’ve agreed to … We’ll need tomorrow for Legislative Counsel to draft the agreement. And as [Mnuchin] has indicated, it is important for us to be on the Senate floor and pass the measure by Monday.”  The four task forces — which covered distressed industries, small business, financial assistance to individual Americans and health care — took a ""pause"" in the middle of Friday afternoon while Republicans huddled for a policy lunch and Senate aides rushed to put the proposals into writing.   Yet it was clear by early evening that McConnell's midnight deadline was going to be missed. Both sides said they would begin again early Saturday morning.  The high-level talks come a day after Senate Republicans introduced their $1 trillion stimulus package to save the U.S. economy by assisting individuals, small businesses and industries that have been hit hard by the pandemic.   But Senate Democrats argue the GOP proposal overall benefits businesses and industries while not doing enough for average Americans.   Schumer, who also spoke to President Donald Trump Friday morning, asked the president to use the Defense Production Act for more medical equipment, including ventilators, according to Schumer’s spokesperson.   During a sometimes angry 90-minute press conference at the White House, Trump said he had an “extremely good” conversation with the minority leader and expressed optimism about the “Phase 3” stimulus deal.   ""We were working on various elements of the deal, and the Democrats are very much wanting something to happen, and the Republicans likewise are very much wanting something to happen. And I think it will,” Trump said at a daily press briefing of the White House coronavirus task force. He didn’t address the Defense Production Act.  Trump added that he also spoke at length with McConnell as well.  Among the key provisions of the Senate GOP plan is direct cash payments to individuals of up to $1,200 and families of up to $2,400, based on income. In addition to direct cash payments, the GOP stimulus plan gives small businesses $300 billion in federally guaranteed loans and $200 billion for loans for industries, including airlines.   The structure of the direct payments has emerged as a concern for some Republican members, in addition to Democrats. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has panned the idea of direct cash payments broadly, while Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) are calling for the package to be fixed, after expressing concern that its structure doesn’t sufficiently benefit lower income Americans. Hawley introduced an amendment Friday to help resolve the issue.  ""Our goal is to create an income stream not just a one-time payment,"" Graham said Friday. ""The problem with direct cash is you're giving it to the people who have got their salary, they don't need extra money. There are people without money that need money.""  Senate Republican aides and White House officials are signaling they’re open to making changes during negotiations.  But Republican leaders also brought in Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to counter the Democratic call for using the existing state-based unemployment insurance system to dole out money to those in need. Scalia argued in the closed-door sessions that some states' unemployment systems aren't capable of handling both an expected tidal wave of new unemployment filings by Americans who just lost their jobs while at the same time gearing up to send out millions of checks.  ""The administration has expressed, based on some feedback they’re getting from states, that that would take a very long time,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.C.). ""Again, we're trying to do something that's quick and gets an infusion of cash out there in a hurry, and the direct payments do that.""  There are also objections being raised to some of the industry specific bailout, as well as numerous business-related tax cuts offered by Senate Republicans. Democrats claim that the GOP bill is not ""worker friendly,"" and note that one of the provisions floated by Republicans would give a tax break to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. ""That is a complete non-starter on our side,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), top Democrat on the Finance Committee.  And Trump himself said he wanted to make sure there was language in the Senate package preventing corporations from using federal aid for stock buybacks.  ""We have some fundamental disagreements on some of the liquidity provisions,"" said a Republican senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity. We're trying to help not because we're interested in helping business ... as much as we’re just trying to help keep the economy moving and keep people employed.""  In addition to Mnuchin, Scalia, and Ueland, administration officials participating Friday include former Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow.   ""Very good attitude, the children are playing well,"" Kudlow said when asked about the tenor of the discussions.  The Republican senators attending the talks are McConnell, Banking Committee Chair Mike Crapo (Idaho), Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.), Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio), HELP Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Aging Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins (Maine), Small Business Committee Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (Miss.) and Thune.   Among the Senate Democrats participating are Schumer, Wyden, Commerce Committee Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (Wash.), Minority Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.), Small Business Committee Ranking Member Ben Cardin (Md.), Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Bob Menendez (N.J.), Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) , Sen. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.) and Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.). HELP Committee Ranking Member Patty Murray participated by phone.   Lawmakers are trying to move as quickly as they can and are expected to work through the weekend. McConnell has vowed the Senate will not leave Washington until a deal is reached.  ""There's been some good constructive discussions about the issues,"" Thune said. ""We're trying to narrow the list of the Democrat asks and the things Republicans want. We want feedback from the bill that we put out there ... We have about 12 hours to do it.""  Durbin, for his part, said Democrats ""proposed a number of new issues that have not been raised by the Republican plan."" Democrats want hundreds of billions of dollars for hospital and health-care providers that the GOP proposal doesn't presently include.  Schumer is closely consulting with Pelosi throughout the Senate negotiations. While Schumer is unlikely to agree to any major provision that Pelosi opposes, that doesn't mean House Democrats can't include additional initiatives when that chamber takes up the bill.  ""At the speaker's direction, House Majority committee staffs are working through Pelosi's policy operation to weigh in through Schumer staff on key provisions House Democrats want added to the McConnell proposal,"" said a senior Democratic aide.  McConnell, however, has refused to include Pelosi in the negotiations so far, despite pleas from both top Democrats to do so.

"Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) on Friday asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review stock sales he made weeks before the markets began to tank in response to the coronavirus pandemic — a move designed to limit the fallout from an intensifying political crisis. Burr, who chairs the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee, defended the sales, saying he “relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks"" and disputed the notion he used information that he was privy to during classified briefings on the novel coronavirus. Burr specifically name-checked CNBC’s daily health and science reporting from its Asia bureau. “Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, I spoke this morning with the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,” Burr said in a statement. Burr, who is retiring at the end of 2022, has faced calls to resign from across the ideological spectrum since ProPublica reported Thursday that he dumped between $628,000 and $1.72 million of his holdings on Feb. 13 in 33 different transactions — a week before the stock market began plummeting amid fears of the coronavirus spreading in the U.S.  The North Carolina Republican has also come under fire for a secret recording obtained by NPR from Feb. 27, in which he issued a much more dire warning to a group of attendees at a private luncheon about the potential outbreak than the prognosis he was offering publicly at the time. Both liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and conservative Fox News host Tucker Carlson have called on Burr to step down. Carlson said ""there is no greater moral crime than betraying your country in a time of crisis"" and said Burr should resign and face prosecution for insider trading, if the report is true. Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, said it was ""stomach-churning"" that someone would think to ""profit off this crisis."" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is up for reelection this year in the Tar Heel state, didn’t go so far as to ask for Burr’s resignation, but did say Burr owes an explanation — and the pending Ethics probe now gives Tillis, and others, some cover to call for the investigation to play out. “Given the circumstances, Senator Burr owes North Carolinians an explanation. His self-referral to the Ethics Committee for their review is appropriate, there needs to be a professional and bipartisan inquiry into this matter, which the Ethics Committee can provide,” Tillis tweeted. The Ethics Committee, which is chaired by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), is made up of three Republicans and three Democrats. The panel is notoriously slow and rarely takes punitive action against its peers, but with the Capitol focused on battling coronavirus — and some members limiting their interactions or being forced to go on self-quarantine — the probe could move at even more of a snail’s pace. ""Such a low-energy establishment Senate response,"" tweeted Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a firebrand conservative. ""'Self-referral' to 'Senate Ethics' is the safe space where Senators can judge their own w/o real culpability. You, Senator Tillis, referring Burr to the DOJ for prosecution would evidence a sincere concern for North Carolinians."" Burr infuriated Trump's conservative allies last year when he subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr., though they ended up working out the terms for an interview with his panel. Burr has acknowledged making at least one financial decision based on what he’s heard from federal officials: he said in 2009 that he encouraged his wife to withdraw cash from the ATM after hearing from Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson amid the 2008 financial crisis. If Burr traded stocks based on information that was not available to the public, it could not only be an ethics issue, but a criminal matter as well. The 2012 STOCK Act prohibits members of Congress from insider trading. Former Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) was sentenced to 26 months in prison for his role in an insider trading case. Collins was a major investor in Innate Immunotherapeutics and even pitched the stock to fellow members. But Collins allegedly told his son about the firm's failed drug trial months before it was public, allowing his family members to dump their shares before the stock collapsed. Burr's committee was receiving regular classified briefings on coronavirus at the time of the stock sales, according to Reuters, but Burr has insisted that he used public reports to make investment decisions. In an initial statement, a spokesperson for Burr confirmed the transactions but noted they took place before the market volatility. “Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak,"" his spokesperson said. ""As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy."" Burr also punched back at the NPR report on Twitter Thursday, calling it a ""tabloid-style hit piece"" and noting it was a publicized event that included ""many non-members, bipartisan congressional staff, and representatives from the governor’s office."" Burr is not the only one under scrutiny for their recent trading practices: Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) sold off more than $1 million in stocks in the days and weeks following a private coronavirus meeting — then bought shares in a company that offers teleworking software, according to the Daily Beast. Loeffler, who is on the ballot this fall, was a wealthy business executive before being appointed to Congress late last year and is married to the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. “This is a ridiculous and baseless attack,” Loeffler wrote on Twitter. “I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement.” In an interview with CNBC, Loeffler declined to call for an Ethics probe into herself but said she would ""submit to whatever review is needed."" Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) also sold significant stocks from their portfolios over the last several weeks, according to the New York Times, but Inhofe told reporters Friday that he did not attend a Jan. 24 briefing on the coronavirus. ""The answer is no, everybody knows I didn't do that,"" Inhofe said, when asked whether he made the sales to prevent coronavirus-related losses. ""I didn't even attend the meeting.""  Inhofe, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, added that he would cooperate with an Ethics investigation but said it's up to his colleagues to decide whether to open one. Common Cause, a Washington-based watchdog group, filed complaints against all four lawmakers — Burr, Loeffler, Inhofe and Feinstein — with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Senate Ethics Committee, citing the STOCK Act. “These potential violations of insider trading laws and the STOCK Act by these Senators ... show what appears to be contempt for the law and further a contempt for the American people these Senators have sworn to serve,"" Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, said in a statement. John Bresnahan and Marianne LeVine contributed to this report.",Burr moves to quell fallout from stock sales with request for Ethics probe,2020-03-20,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/sen-richard-burr-requests-ethics-probe-into-his-stock-sales-138768,politico
"Joe Biden reached a new and heady milestone when he shellacked Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois and Ohio to become the de facto Democratic nominee for president. But there was no soaring speech to acknowledge the moment. He never took the stage amid a sea of Biden signs or before an adoring crowd on national television. Biden was instead stuck in a makeshift studio in his Delaware home, webcasting his remarks with a low-quality personal computer camera against a straight-out-of-YouTube black backdrop and two American flags. He warned about the coronavirus contagion. He offered an olive branch to Bernie Sanders. Then, despite two consecutive weeks of smashing victories, he all but disappeared from the news cycle for days. The moment was a perfect distillation of Biden’s current predicament — in a state of suspended political animation, trapped between a rival who refuses to quit and the global pandemic that has all but shut down the Democratic primary campaign. Because Sanders won’t quit, Biden can’t fully pivot to the general election. He can’t truly unite the party’s warring factions. Nor can he begin stockpiling the vast amounts of money he’ll need for November. His momentum has effectively been stopped cold. A source familiar with the Democratic National Committee’s discussions says the party offered both the Biden and Sanders campaigns the opportunity to open joint-fundraising accounts. But since Sanders declined, the party is reluctant to enter into one with Biden because of the bad optics of seeming to help one candidate. “That’s going to eventually hurt Biden with financing if the DNC doesn’t go ahead with this,” the source said. Stuck at home because of coronavirus precautions, Biden also can’t meet with donors at fundraisers — which, in turn, may become less lucrative with an economy that’s sinking into recession or perhaps worse. “It’s a tough position,” said Matt Littman, who’s hosting a virtual fundraiser for Biden next month that the candidate and donors will attend through tele-conferencing software. “It’s harder to raise money when there’s no face-to-face meeting and personal contact,” Littman said. “And some of the normal people I have to raise money from I can’t count on. They have their own concerns. They have to keep their houses. The universe of people who will donate money will be smaller.” For the foreseeable future, all live campaign events are canceled, so he can’t hit the stump to try to capitalize on the excitement he had just stoked. His ability to criticize Trump on anything other than his performance on coronavirus response and preparedness is constrained by the emergency-like conditions. As new polling suggests that Trump’s approval for responding to the virus is improving, some of Biden’s fellow Democrats worry he’s paralyzed himself. “Biden is only in limbo if he keeps himself there. He’s only in a predicament to the degree he chooses to view himself in one,” said Jeff Hauser, a veteran of progressive politics who is head of the Revolving Door Project, which watchdogs executive branch appointees. “Joe Biden can either complain about the fact that he is not getting significant media coverage or he could do something to change that,” Hauser said. “He needs to offer an alternative and offer a running play-by-play critique of the failings of this administration.” Biden aides and allies, however, are projecting an aura of calm, saying Trump’s false claims and reinvented history about the virus will haunt him on their own as the economy craters. The former vice president pledged to call him out on it by Monday — but made the statement via conference call Friday with reporters instead of on camera. Meanwhile, his staff is scattered, communicating via teleconferencing, email and conference call. Some remain holed up in Philadelphia apartments near campaign headquarters but others went home to Washington. A few are near the candidate in Wilmington, Delaware. Another is in the mountains of Puerto Rico. The headquarters and campaign trail now run through Biden’s living room as his staff scrambles to increase his social media outreach to compensate for the social distancing. The first step: installing a better video camera in Biden’s house, which will soon have broadcast-ready capabilities and high-quality livestreaming software. To limit the risk of infecting the candidate, the number of staffers is limited within the house. The campaign also plans to flood social media with Biden to promote the brand of the former vice president who helped lead the nation’s Ebola virus response, has a vast knowledge of domestic and foreign policy and is known both as comforter-in-chief as well as the ice-cream-eating, aviator-shade-wearing everyman parodied in The Onion. “The thing that’s good about Joe Biden and the way the internet thinks about him is that there is a sense of brand, people know him as vice president, and they know ice cream and aviators. For us, we have to evolve from ice cream and aviators and being vice president to being commander-in-chief, while remaining relatable and true to his personality. That's the balance,” said Rob Flaherty, Biden’s digital director. “Our digital operation is putting out five-minute Iran crisis explainers and koozies that say, ‘keep it cool kid.’ It’s always been this tension,” Flaherty said. “And for us, the challenge and the opportunity is how we keep it between the buoys and present the best image of Joe Biden.” To increase voters’ sense of intimacy with Biden — who revels in one-on-one time with voters after public events — the campaign is discussing ways to find the technology and invent a “virtual rope-line” in which voters would wait in an electronic “queue” to speak with him briefly face-to-face, albeit via livestream. The campaign is also planning to hold more tele-town halls and is discussing a Biden podcast, in addition to pumping out more video clips of him. In some ways, the Biden campaign wants to give followers and viewers a sense of Biden as if he were a character in a reality show, building a loyal following online similar to the way former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke’s campaign did. Flaherty, who was O’Rourke’s digital director, said Biden’s social media presence will be unique to him. So unlike O’Rourke, Biden won’t be livestreaming from the dentist office chair or skateboarding in a Whataburger parking lot. Flaherty said the campaign always planned to have a heavy social-media focus. The only major difference now is the campaign is completely online and it has to ramp up faster and on a bigger scale. From the start, the campaign was designed to limit the news media’s interactions with Biden due to his reputation for gaffes and going off-script, which in some ways makes Biden’s social distancing a boon — his campaign can more tightly control his image. Rallies, after all, are only a small part of a campaign, said Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager. “The vast majority of voters don't interact with campaigns by attending rallies. They experience the campaign through TV coverage, social media, and advertising, and contact from volunteers, all of which will still continue,” Mook said. “This isn't the end of the campaign trail, but rather it's full transition into the digital space.” But the Biden campaign knows that time is precious. Trump’s campaign is preparing to unload on Biden to negatively define him before he’s the nominee and consolidates his base, which is harder now with Sanders still hanging around. Trump already has a far-bigger social media following, presence and reach than Biden. “With respect to the Trump camp — the entire right in general — they’re all rallying against one candidate: Biden. It’s so concentrated. But on the left, it’s still pretty fractured,” said Glenn Parham, founder of the Republican political intelligence firm Pundit Analytics. “The left is starting to funnel into Biden, but a lot of different advocacy groups are running attack ads against Joe and are supporting other candidates, even ones that have dropped out, which is kind of absurd.”  On the right, he said, the volume and concentrated fire “are orders of magnitude greater than on the left.” While Trump is more negatively affected on the campaign trail by coronavirus than Biden — the president’s campaign revolves around his big rallies — he has been able to occupy center stage by giving a daily White House press briefing. Joe Lockhart, former White House spokesman for the Clinton administration, said Biden needs to carefully calibrate his response to Trump. “It’s very tricky. When you’re in a crisis, there can only be one president. Just attacking him every day is a bad strategy,” said Lockhart, anticipating the Trump campaign’s response leveled Friday at Biden. “Where I think Biden is going is if he gives a series of strategic speeches that talk about the importance of preparing, the importance of government pulling together and the importance of being straight with the American public,” Lockhart said. Steve Schale, leader of the pro-Biden super PAC Unite The Country, said voters might still want an abeyance in the appearance of politicking in a time of crisis, at least in the short term. Schale said he was supposed to be on the road this week raising money from donors — a task made easier by Biden’s emergence as the all-but-certain nominee. But he’s stuck at home along with nearly everyone else. “This is affecting everyone’s lives in ways we didn’t imagine, not just Biden,” Schale said. “There’s no playbook for this.”",’There’s no playbook for this’: Biden trapped in campaign limbo,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/coranavirus-puts-biden-in-limbo-138726,politico
"The United Nations Security Council, a premier global forum, hasn’t yet held a session on the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe. The European Union is trying to limit exports of key medical supplies to nations beyond its borders — while its own members are barely helping one another.  Financial institutions worldwide have only recently started cooperating to mitigate the economic damage from the rapidly spreading illness, but investors are still spooked.  And, the United States, led by President Donald Trump and his America First vision, is focused more on the virus’ internal challenge than its global impact. Instead of rallying the world, as it has in the past on major challenges, the U.S. is brawling with other countries affected by the crisis.  If there’s one thing the coronavirus has shown, it’s that a crisis that affects all of humanity does not necessarily inspire international unity, coordination or leadership. Instead, borders are closing, competition for resources is up, politicians are insulting one another, and no country is taking charge.  “This is a challenge that’s hitting every country at the same time, and we’re all working in our own little silos instead of working together,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former Obama administration official who oversaw disaster response. “There’s no attempt at global leadership from anyone right now, and we’re not going to win if ultimately we’re not working together on this.”  The difference in reaction is particularly stark when compared to the Ebola virus crisis, which — while more limited in geographical scope — nonetheless inspired a global response spearheaded by the U.S. under then-President Barack Obama.  As of Friday, the coronavirus had been spotted in over 150 countries, with more than 255,000 confirmed cases and over 10,000 deaths, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.  That number has grown quickly in recent weeks as Western officials have struggled to absorb the hard-won lessons of their counterparts in Asia, where draconian measures — in the case of China, which shut down entire regions — and more innovative tactics in Singapore and South Korea have beaten back the disease.  As the outbreak's center of gravity shifts to Europe and North America, the deadly illness is straining health care systems, as well as supply lines for medicines, ventilators and other critical items. It is shocking economies as governments close their borders, order quarantines and enact severe “social distancing” measures that are devastating retail businesses and roiling markets.  Instead of uniting, world powers are squabbling. On Friday, the White House circulated a video of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accusing Russia, China, Iran and others of spreading disinformation about the virus. Perhaps most glaringly, there’s been no significant international gathering of political leaders tasked with devising a global strategy to tackle the disease.  The closest thing to it came earlier this week when the leaders of countries in the Group of Seven — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — held a conference call on the virus.  The discussion reportedly took place at the urging of France’s President Emmanuel Macron. It yielded notable commitments, including pledges to work together on research and a vague promise to “coordinate our efforts to delay the spread of the virus, including through appropriate border management measures.”  But Trump has barely mentioned the call since. His earlier, sudden decision to impose a travel ban on Europe due to the virus had already surprised and upset key G-7 members, who complained that they had not been consulted. And seeing as the G-7 does not include major affected countries, such as China, its commitments — if carried out — will arguably have limited effect. (The G-7’s foreign ministers are due to hold a virtual meeting next week.)  Saudi Arabia has called for an emergency virtual summit next week of the leaders of the Group of 20, which does include China. But as of Friday, it was unclear when — or if — that session would happen. Saudi Arabia currently holds the group’s presidency, but its recent precipitous moves to slash oil prices have not helped soothe financial markets.  During a White House news conference Friday, Pompeo, who has kept an unusually low profile throughout the crisis, praised “the global leadership that America has always delivered” and claimed it “has been great to see countries around the world rally behind what we are doing.”  Pressed for examples, a senior Trump administration official pointed to U.S. plans to spend more than $1 billion to help the international community fight the pandemic.  The official added that the administration “has conducted numerous conference calls with science ministers from around the world, leading to actions on data sharing, clinical trials, enhanced access to data and research publications, and unity among the international science community.”  China’s communist leaders have taken perhaps the most visible moves aimed at burnishing their global credentials during the crisis.  Scientists believe the infectious disease emerged in China’s Hubei province last year. For weeks, the Chinese downplayed the disease, muzzling doctors and resisting allowing in a team from the World Health Organization. Eventually, Beijing used extreme means to limit the spread of the illness, and the country claims to have brought it under control.  In recent days, China has sent supplies and experts to other countries fighting the illness. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has taken a high profile amid the sudden Chinese generosity, and his state-controlled media machine has promoted China’s authoritarian governance model as best suited for dealing with such an enemy. Still, there are signs that China is reluctant to take too bold a stance. For one thing, China currently holds the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council, and yet it has not convened a session on the coronavirus.  When asked why the Security Council hasn’t met to discuss the pandemic, a senior U.N. diplomat told POLITICO: “They just haven’t,” adding, “We’re able to support them either virtually or even if they want to meet in person.”  Chinese officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  While rare, holding a U.N. Security Council session on a health crisis is not without precedent; one was held on the Ebola crisis.  One possible reason no Security Council session has been called this time is the ongoing war of words over the virus between China and another permanent, veto-wielding member: the United States.  Chinese officials have been floating conspiracy theories alleging that the coronavirus may have originated outside their borders, possibly even at the hands of the U.S. military.  In response, Trump, Pompeo and some Republican lawmakers have been calling the illness the “Chinese virus” or similar terms, angering Beijing. U.S. officials also keep hammering China for its original lack of candor about the seriousness of the outbreak, though Trump has praised Xi personally for his handling of it.  At times, Trump has even appeared to welcome the pandemic’s rapidly mounting consequences for the world order, claiming he was happy to see Americans stay home and buy their goods from U.S. factories. There are few signs, however, that he is deeply engaged with cajoling or negotiating with other leaders to coordinate their plans for combating the virus.  At the United Nations, the main organization involved in a global response to the virus is the WHO. On other U.N. fronts, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs are trying to help relief groups navigate the viral terrain as they aid vulnerable populations such as refugees.  But these are largely technical bodies, not ones that can hammer out political agreements — or at least guidelines — on issues like medical supply lines, financial assistance and border policies.  When countries have come to agreements related to the virus, it’s often been bilateral — such as the Canada-U.S. decision to limit border crossings — or through regional blocs, such as the EU.  Those agreements, however, could have negative impacts elsewhere on Earth.  In Europe, countries have been hoarding medical supplies, with some putting up restrictions on exports of items such as face masks. The EU stepped in, announcing limits on exports of such materials outside the bloc in an effort to boost availability within.  Researchers are warning, however, that those new external limits could hurt other, poorer countries that need Europe to supply such equipment. Europe’s move could also prompt nations outside the bloc to restrict their exports of materials European nations will require.  G-7 finance ministers and central bankers pledged on March 3 to use “all appropriate policy tools” to keep their economies afloat. But stock markets continued to fall, and financial institutions across the world have begun stepping up their actions in recent days.  Several central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have taken what appear to be coordinated actions to stabilize the markets, such as buying bonds, cutting interest rates and re-opening emergency lending programs last used during the financial crisis of 2008.  The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank said earlier this month that they “stand ready to help our member countries address the human tragedy and economic challenge posed by the COVID-19 virus.”  But such financial promises also run into political realities, such as whether the IMF should lend funds to Venezuela, Iran and other countries whose regimes are opposed by the United States, a major global financial player.  Former U.S. officials and analysts who watch multilateral institutions note that the coronavirus is simply unprecedented in its geographical scope and the resulting implications. The virus, officially called COVID-19, is a new strain that scientists are still trying to understand, and it has even stricken some government officials who would be involved in planning a response.  “Who can muster an international response when no one can travel, when countries are in lockdown? Even within countries you can’t travel,” one former senior State Department official said.  They note, however, that there’s one past model that offers some lessons: The U.S.-led response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. That crisis began in the early months of 2014, with an outbreak in Guinea. Over the next several months, cases appeared in neighboring countries. The WHO stepped in to help, with assistance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In August, as global concern grew over the vicious illness, Obama used a gathering of African leaders in the United States to raise awareness of the crisis and pledge continued U.S. support. By mid-September, Obama announced that, among other measures, the U.S. would send 3,000 troops to West Africa to help build medical facilities and offer other aid to medical professionals. Obama seemed aware of criticism that he’d moved too slowly, saying, “We have to act fast — we can’t dawdle on this one” and adding that “this is a global threat, and it demands a truly global response.”  That same week, the U.N. Security Council passed a U.S.-drafted resolution declaring Ebola a threat to world peace and security. The meeting was led by the United States, which held the Security Council’s rotating presidency at the time. U.N. observers said it was a rare, possibly unprecedented council session due to its focus on a public health crisis.  Days later, during the annual gathering of the U.N. General Assembly, a special high-level meeting was held on the issue of the Ebola virus. Speaking to those gathered, Obama warned that the global community was “not doing enough.”  In the ensuing weeks and months, other countries joined or stepped up efforts to help West African states contain the illness. Although some Republicans insisted Obama fumbled the response (and Trump was a critic, too), the former Democratic president’s aides defend his approach.  With the coronavirus, “there’s been a complete absence of anything like that,” said Konyndyk, who helped lead the Ebola response under Obama. “Our diplomatic toolbox is more absent despite the fact that it’s more necessary.”  Among those arguing for a more united international front against the coronavirus is U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.  In what his office dubbed a “virtual press encounter” Thursday, Guterres called on world leaders to “come together and offer an urgent and coordinated response to this global crisis.”  “Current responses at the country level will not address the global scale and complexity of the crisis,” he warned.",World leaders are fighting the virus.

"Barren streets, vacant offices and empty gyms. A quarantined small California town of 2,600, guarded by military officials. Rationing medical care. Government turf wars and bureaucratic battles.  All of these scenes unfolded on the screen before me—not on cable news television—but in a generation’s worth of Hollywood blockbusters and a six-part miniseries about viral epidemics.  On the first weekend of our national emergency, I self-quarantined inside my apartment. I socially distanced from hundreds of St. Patrick’s Day revelers who crowded inside a white party tent and listened to a blaring Bon Jovi cover band outside the Irish pub across the street below. Then, I binge-watched nearly 10 hours of virus entertainment, from 1995’s “Outbreak” to 2019’s “The Hot Zone.”  While I didn’t emerge as a postdoc epidemiologist, the lessons I took away, hidden in plain sight all these years, would be valuable to any member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. It’s all there, from Contagion’s advocacy for social distancing to Outbreak’s and Hot Zone’s depictions of how interagency squabbling can slow responses. Even the epigraph of “Outbreak,” from the Nobel laureate and bacteriologist Joshua Lederberg, should have focused us on the gravity of a pandemic earlier: “The single biggest threat to man’s continued dominance on the planet is the virus.” But I also noticed something else: These films have perhaps numbed us to those very viruses that threaten us most—the viruses that do not have a giant fatality rate or change our physical appearance. In “Outbreak,” Dustin Hoffman’s Col. Sam Daniels, a virologist with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, contends with Motaba, a fever-inducing virus that kills 100 percent of its patients in two to three days. In “The Hot Zone,” Ebola leaves its patients with a rash and kills them quickly. In “Contagion,” MEV-1 has a mortality rate around 20 percent. If Motaba had hit the U.S. the government would have been faster to quarantine cities and issue shelter-in-place orders, shutting down schools and non-essential businesses. Had Ebola been spreading around Indianapolis, I bet those revelers across the street would have stayed at home. But my neighbors seemed blind to COVID-19, which is more insidious and subtly dangerous than the diseases from the movies. Its mortality rate is in the single digits —low enough so many think they have little to fear—but it is proving just as disabling to the economy and our way of life, if not more, than much more deadly outbreaks, which can be contained faster.  Earlier this week, I asked Dr. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiologist, why all of these movies hadn’t moved politicians and voters to take viral epidemics more seriously. “I don’t think movies change the way people feel about things,” he told me, adding that he was working with the writer of “Contagion,” Scott Z. Burns, on a public awareness campaign ad on the novel coronavirus.  “The fact that the United States has dodged the bullet with all of the latest infectious diseases, my perception of our government is that unless it’s screaming hot in the headlines, nothing will be done,” says Tracey McNamara, a technical consultant on “Contagion” and a veterinary medicine professor at Western University of Health Services, told me. “Contagion,” hints at our lackadaisical approach to any virus that isn’t produced in a Hollywood studio: There’s a scene in which a reporter asks Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Administrator Dr. Ellis Cheever, played by Laurence Fishburne, whether the government is overreacting to a virus that would claim 26 million lives in 29 days.  “Dr. Cheever, are you concerned that the CDC faces a credibility issue here, after the perceived overreaction to H1N1?” the reporter asks.  “I’d rather the news story be that we overreacted than that many people lost their lives because we didn’t do enough,” Cheever replies.  Set pieces and dramatic press conference scenes like this one seemed a critical part of any disaster movie. Now, we see them almost everyday when the coronavirus task force briefs the nation. For decades, these films have thrilled theatergoers with an invisible enemy, the stark reality of an apocalyptic human-versus-nature, us-versus-it conflict. But the actual conflict in all of these films is actually something different: It’s us versus the bureaucracy. These are not so much films about disasters as they are films about government.  “Contagion is such a compelling film—life is unfolding very much like the movie,” says McNamara, who discovered West Nile Virus in the summer of 1999 while working as the chief pathologist at the Bronx Zoo, when crows started falling from the sky and falling into our exhibits that August. “The speed with which it spread. How it spread.” Turns out, Hollywood has been offering Washington clues about how a pandemic might transpire for decades—and what the government should do to fight it. Here are just a few: Much of “Outbreak” revolves around the efforts of the protagonist (Col. Sam Daniels, played by Dustin Hoffman) to convince his boss, Brigadier General William Ford (played by Morgan Freeman) that the country faces a real threat from the fictional Motaba virus. Daniels spends much of the film battling with Army General Donald McClintock, played by Donald Sutherland, to get the word out about the dangers of the virus.  After Daniels’ ex-wife, CDC staffer Dr. Roberta “Robby” Keough—played by Rene Russo—treats a dying and infected patient, she laments not getting a CDC advisory out about the virus faster. The CDC staffers’ efforts were blocked by her superiors. “I should’ve forced the alert,” the doctor says, explaining Motaba’s deadly effects. “Christ, Sam. I opened this guy up,” she tells her ex. “Looked like a bomb went off inside. His pancreas, liver, kidney, spleen—all the organs were liquified. Christ, I should’ve forced the alert.” In “Contagion,” weeks into the outbreak of MEV-1, Dr. Sanjay Gupta (played by himself) asks CDC Administrator Cheever how many people have died from the disease during a cable television appearance. The answer, Cheever admits, was “very difficult” to know exact numbers because reporting varied by state. “There are 50 different states in this country, which means there are 50 different health departments. Followed by 50 different protocols.” And in the final episode of “The Hot Zone,” a dispute between an Ebola researcher and the head of the CDC almost derails efforts to get to the bottom of the Reston, Virginia, Ebola outbreak.  “The guy hates my guts,” Walter said of the CDC official Trevor Rhodes (James D’Arcy). “I’m never going to convince him to help.”  “You need to bury whatever happened between you two, Carter. You got no choice.” The messages of all these films—infighting and turf battles make things worse—felt apt for the ongoing feud between Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is a branch of HHS that operates independently. “A series of incidents over the past 120 days suggest basic communication and coordination between CMS and HHS is lacking, thereby jeopardizing HHS’ mission and undermining public trust,” HHS chief information officer Jose Arrieta wrote a recent memo. The latest incident? On February 23, HHS’ email system crashed, causing vital messages about the emergency coronavirus funding package to be delayed for up to 11 hours. The cause: Verma’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had failed to brief HHS leaders about a test that would send thousands of messages through the system. The outage slowed the administration’s response to the deadly outbreak.  In the six-part National Geographic mini-series “The Hot Zone,” based on the 1994 non-fiction book by Richard Preston, Wade Carter, a fictionalized reclusive Ebola expert who studied the virus in the field, is frustrated that more senior officials aren’t taking the threat of Ebola on American soil more seriously. Carter tells Army Col. Nancy Jaax (played by Julianna Margulies), a veterinarian who helped contain Ebola-infected monkeys from the Philippines: “Did I want this? Never. Now it’s here. Would it be good for the Oval Office to be pissing its pants about this now? You bet.”  But by the end of the series, after the scientists ultimately contained an Ebola outbreak in Reston, Virginia, there seems to be little appetite from public policymakers to take the threat of an epidemic seriously. We see a flyover shot of Capitol Hill. In a nameless committee room, the deputy secretary of the National Institutes of Health asks Jaax: “So no one died?”  “That’s correct, Mr. Chairman,” Jaax says. “But four people tested positive for the Ebola virus.  “And 172 people were tested and came up negative,” the deputy secretary responded, unperturbed.  The warning was clear: When scientists are worried, people should listen. And yet, not more than a week ago, President Donald Trump and some Republican members of Congress, along with conservative television hosts, were saying that journalists and Democrats were overplaying the threat of the coronavirus. Now some of those pols who thought it was no big deal are getting tested for COVID-19 themselves.  In “The Hot Zone,” Jaax’s husband, Noah Emmerich’s Lt. Col. Jerry Jaax, makes a plea: “It’s no secret the CDC needs more funding for research and development”—meaning that the CDC was caught somewhat flat-footed by the outbreak in Reston.  But back in real life, just last week, even as coronavirus was spreading in the United States, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought defended the Trump administration’s proposed $35 million cut to the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund, designed for use by the CDC.  Rep. Matt Cartwright, the Democratic member from Pennsylvania, bristled at the cuts in a hearing with Vought. “The question is today, as we sit here and we know about coronavirus and the impact it’s taking on the people of the world and the economies of the world and the stock market and everything, as you sit here today, are you ready to take that back?” In none of the virus movies I watched do we see the U.S. president. He or she is often one of the least important characters. In “Contagion,” he’s moved underground. In “Outbreak,” we only see the chief of staff, talking White House officials through the ethics of bombing a California town, executing all of its citizens in order to contain Mataba. Instead, the most important characters—the ones who do the talking—are the public health officials, virologists, researchers and frontline healthcare workers. In the movies, scientists always offer a clear explanation and as much information as they have to concerned citizens. Politicians would only get in the way. President Donald Trump didn’t get the memo. His statements about coronavirus have been perplexing and counterproductive. He said we have it “under control.” He compared it to the flu. He told people with the virus to go to work. He suggested the virus would “disappear.” Then he declared a national emergency. In contrast, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, a global health official at the State Department who is now White House coronavirus response coordinator, are lucid, calm presenters of information—perhaps the administration’s most credible spokespeople. If this were a Hollywood movie, those two would have been doing most of the talking from the beginning.  Bryan Cranston, who plays Rear Admiral Lyle Haggerty in “Contagion,” alludes to a congressman who is at risk of infecting his fellow members of Congress with MEV-1. “There’s a sick congressman from Illinois in D.C.,” Haggerty says. “He was in Chicago over the holiday. They are using the pod to fly him home, and then they are closing Midway and O’Hare. The governor there is calling out the national guard. They are setting up roadblocks. They are shutting down the board of trade, public transportation. Even the Teamsters are pulling their drivers off the road.”  Any policymaker who watched that scene and connected the dots wouldn’t have been able to escape the realization that in the event of a pandemic, it would be important for Congress to have a way of working remotely. This week, several representatives and senators directed some staffers to work from home. Still, members of Congress, many of whom are at risk of higher mortality rates given their average age—57.8 years in the House and 61.8 years in the Senate— don’t have an established way to conduct their business remotely. The Wolfgang Petersen film “Outbreak” is perhaps the least subtle of the group of films. A lab clinician infected with Motaba sees a movie with his girlfriend. As a result, the entire town of Cedar Creek, California—population 2,600—is nearly bombed with the “the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in our arsenal” by the U.S. government to contain the spread of the virus.  When Daniels and Keough survey the infected at a makeshift hospital in Cedar Creek, Keough remarks: “So many—so fast.”  “Apparently they all gathered at a movie theater,” Daniels replies.  In “Contagion,” the CDC administrator urges social distancing and not shaking hands as the best advice for controlling the spread of MEV-1. We see empty gyms and open-floor plan offices. “Right now, our best defense has been social distancing,” Fishburne’s Cheever, the CDC director, tells Dr. Sanjay Gutpa in a cable television studio. “No handshaking. Staying home when you are sick. Washing your hands frequently.”  The idea for the scene came from Lipkin, the Columbia University epidemiologist who told the film’s writer, Scott Z. Burns, that he would serve as a technical adviser on the movie if he agreed to make it as scientifically accurate a film as possible.  In the film’s emotional denouement, Cheever visits the home of one the CDC’s janitors to deliver a vaccine, where he explains to the janitor’s son the origins of the handshake. (The scene was “designed” to disclose the history of the handshake,” Lipkin told me in an interview earlier this week.  “Do you know where this comes from? Shaking hands?” he asks the boy, after delivering the vaccine by pushing a swab up his nostril. “It was a way of showing a stranger you weren’t carrying a weapon in the old days.”  These days, we are all presumed to be armed and dangerous.",What I Learned About Coronavirus From Binge-watching 10 Hours of Virus Movies,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/21/pandemic-movies-coronavirus-140043,politico
"David Zuckerman, the lieutenant governor of Vermont, is an eccentric longtime figure in state politics — a ponytail-sporting organic farmer and Bernie Sanders protege who has proudly fought against government-mandated vaccinations.  But the arrival of the coronavirus has suddenly put Zuckerman on the defensive in his campaign for governor this year: Amid the worsening pandemic, one of his top Democratic opponents is calling out his anti-vaxxer views as dangerous, and attempting to make them politically toxic. “In moments like this, we see just how critical it is that we support vaccines and make them as available as possible,” said Rebecca Holcome, the state’s former education secretary who is challenging Zuckerman for the Democratic nomination in the August primary to take on popular Republican incumbent Gov. Phil Scott. “It's scary that anyone in public office or seeking public office would cast doubt about the value of vaccines. It's unbelievable this is even up for debate."" Zuckerman shot back that Holcome is trying to use a public health crisis to score political points. “The fact that any political campaign is trying to use this moment for political opportunism is unconscionable,” he told POLITICO. “Right now, my primary focus is to disseminate important health information about the virus and how to keep Vermonters, their families and our community safe...When the COVID-19 vaccine is available for the coronavirus it should be free for all and universally accessible.” The fight in Vermont’s Democratic gubernatorial primary sets up a larger test of how mainstream the “anti-vaxxer” movement has become on the left, and whether the coronavirus pandemic could make it politically untenable even in liberal bastions. Anti-vaccine advocacy is a growing force in American politics and around the globe as formerly fringe activists have developed a wide reach across social media platforms. Other candidates who oppose mandatory vaccinations are running for office, and some are winning, with support from large and well-funded advocacy groups.  Recently-ousted Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin has said that mandatory vaccines are un-American. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has repeatedly said parents should be able to decide whether or not to vaccinate their children. With backing by the group Texans for Vaccine Choice as well as Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, libertarian Susanna Dokupil is making another run for the state legislature, primarying one of the most vocally pro-vaccine Republicans in Austin.  But the movement has had even more success in blocking pro-vaccine legislation, defeating efforts in New Jersey, California and other states that would have eliminated exemptions to immunization. Zuckerman, 48, has faced fierce criticism from Republican opponents in past races for his position on vaccinations, yet still won. He is seen as the frontrunner in an August primary for the Democratic nomination, though Scott is favored to win reelection. But Holcome is betting that the anxiety surrounding coronavirus will make the issue more salient and perhaps will force a reckoning with the anti-vaxx left. That movement includes several high-profile celebrities along with former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, a vocal skeptic of mandatory vaccinations, campaigned for Sanders after she dropped out of the race. Last year, the World Health Organization labeled what it called “vaccine hesitancy” one of the top 10 threats to global health, citing a 30% increase in measles cases worldwide. Vaccine skepticism is often tied to populist political movements on the right and the left. It’s part of a bigger surge of anti-establishment anger around the world — including in the U.S., where less than half the population gets vaccinated against the seasonal flu, which has killed tens of thousands in the past year alone. Despite past blowback for his positions, Zuckerman has remained firm in his opposition to mandatory vaccinations. He was called a “hero” by the co-founder of a Vermont “vaccine choice” group during his 2016 bid for lieutenant governor. In 2015, while serving in the state Senate, Zuckerman strongly opposed a bill that repealed the “philosophical exemption” to vaccinations which ultimately passed. And in a 2018 debate while running for reelection, he defended his past positions by arguing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has financial connections with the pharmaceutical industry that made him skeptical of its recommendations. “The CDC’s infectious disease control board actually has a number of conflicts of interests,” he argued. “And so yes, like many, I do sometimes question when government agencies are a bit too infused with corporate influence with respect to some of the outcomes and decisions they make.”  Yet Zuckerman has thrived politically, and some Vermont Democratic officials speculate he could someday succeed Sanders, a longtime ally, in the Senate. Sanders’ presidential campaign declined to comment on Zuckerman, but one aide noted that Sanders supports mandatory vaccinations with ""very limited exceptions.” The aide said “there are some health exceptions“ but declined to provide further details on which exceptions he supports. Many in the so-called “anti-vaxxer” community have tried in recent years to make their position more politically palatable by arguing that while they believe vaccines are effective, they are opposed to the government requiring them. Zuckerman has taken a similar messaging approach. In the 2018 debate, Zuckerman said “the science behind vaccines is sound, I think vaccines do good for our communities, my daughter is vaccinated. But it’s a question of whether government should be forcing that onto individuals.” Public health experts say such arguments put vulnerable people at risk. Even before the recent coronavirus pandemic, several states had been moving to eliminate religious and other exemptions for childhood vaccinations, as measles and other diseases have resurged in recent years.  “That's a dangerous message, that everyone should decide for themselves,” said Lois Privor-Dumm, a senior researcher on global vaccine policy at Johns Hopkins University. “If [people who forego vaccines] want to keep themselves quarantined all the time, that’s one thing. But that’s not what happens in life. So it's not appropriate for candidates to go against all the public health experts out there.” While campaigning in 2016 the Republican primary, Donald Trump also argued without evidence there is a correlation between vaccines and autism, a position which drew rebuke from the medical and scientific community as well as fellow candidate Ben Carson, a brain surgeon who now serves as his secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  As president, however, Trump shifted his position. In response to a number of Measles outbreaks in 2019, Trump told parents that their children “have to get the shots. The vaccinations are so important.”",Anti-vaxx politicians under fire as coronavirus spreads,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/anti-vaccine-coronavirus-137446,politico
"While Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) sought on Friday to explain sales of stock made at a time when they were reassuring the public about the coronavirus threat, they weren’t the only elected officials to buy and sell stocks at key moments in the unfolding crisis. A POLITICO review of stock sales and purchases reported by members of Congress and senior aides found that while none had engaged in sales of the magnitude of Burr and Loeffler, several had traded shares at times or in industries that bore a relationship to the coronavirus threat. Previously unreported lawmakers who sold assets in the weeks leading up to the market crash include Rep. Susan Davis (D-Calif.), who unloaded thousands of dollars of stock in Alaska Air and Royal Caribbean cruises. A senior aide to Sen. Mitch McConnell made a mid-January purchase of Moderna, Inc., a biotechnology company that had four days earlier announced it would begin developing a coronavirus vaccine. And an aide to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sold off stock in companies including Delta Airlines in late January and later bought stock in Clorox, Inc., which makes bleach and sanitary wipes. The trades show that -- as much of the public was blindsided by both the pandemic and the economic meltdown over the last two weeks -- a number of lawmakers, aides and their brokers helping manage their portfolios adjusted their investments. Lawmakers in both chambers were being briefed via both classified and non-classified meetings about the coronavirus in late January and February, giving people on Capitol Hill a closer look at how the coming pandemic might shape their lives and finances that much of the country was lacking. “The reality is that if you work on the Hill, or you work in government, you have access to information that the public doesn't have or, if they have it, they can’t always see the signal through the noise,” said Meredith McGehee, executive director of the watchdog group Issue One. “If you’re on the HELP Committee, you’re going to grasp threats much faster than the general public. You see things much more clearly.” Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Friday called for a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into his trades amid an uproar over reports that he had sought to safeguard his portfolio against the looming pandemic even as he assured the public all was well. Burr, who had been present for a classified briefing on the outbreak in late January, wrote an op-ed declaring the U.S. “better prepared than ever before” to face down the virus on Feb. 7 -- six days before unloading at least $628,000 of his own stock as the market was peaking.  The North Carolina Republican is one of several senators, including Loeffler, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sen. James Inhofe (R.-Okla.) and Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who sold stock in late January and early February as the Senate was ramping up coronavirus briefings. It’s illegal for lawmakers and aides to trade stocks based on private information. But they are allowed to buy and sell shares based on public information they absorb on Capitol Hill so long as they disclose those trades within 30 days. That permissive approach to buying and selling stocks -- the executive branch has much stricter rules -- has drawn criticism from watchdogs who argue the freedom to trade isn’t as important as the need for the public to trust Congress to act only on its behalf. Davis, the 10-term California Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services and Education and Labor Committees, unloaded stock on Feb. 11 in the airline and cruise industries, two sectors that have since been ground to a halt by the pandemic nearly two weeks before the market tanked. Davis’ spokesman said she has a “third party handling her portfolio and does not play a role in the purchase or sale of her stocks.” Other members stand to make money off companies working to combat the disease. Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.) purchased between $1,001 and $15,000 of stock in the pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc., on Feb. 27, the day the company released a statement saying it had donated one of its antiviral drugs to China as an experimental option for treating the coronavirus and that it was exploring a research collaboration on potential treatment options.  Wittman’s office said he “does not have any involvement in investment decisions for his financial portfolio” and noted that AbbVie shares have since lost value. Still others were able to move their money to safe havens ahead of the general public. On Jan. 29, the day he and others were briefed on the coronavirus, Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) sold between $500,001 and $1 million in Butte-Glenn municipal bonds. He and his wife moved over $2 million from local government bonds to U.S. Treasury notes, considered a port in the storm amid market turbulence, between Jan. 27 and Jan. 29. The muni bond market is currently facing strong headwinds. Peters’ office said he and his wife “sold one set of government bonds and bought other government bonds” and said the suggestion that it was linked to the virus briefing is “out of bounds.” Aides, who sometimes spend years working alongside their bosses on Capitol Hill and can play as much a role in shaping the response to a crisis as their bosses, also bought and sold stocks in January and February. Scott Sloofman, a top communications aide in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office, purchased stock in a company that could wind up being instrumental in the fight against the coronavirus in late January: Moderna, Inc., which is now testing the first vaccine for the disease in Washington state. Sloofman purchased the stock on Jan. 28, one week after Moderna, Inc. announced it was collaborating with the federal government to develop the vaccine. The company’s stock rose in the days since, at some points more than 20 percent. The purchase was listed as between $1,001 and $15,000 in value. A Senate aide familiar with the trade said Sloofman purchased just under $1,400 in stock. He bought the stock two weeks after seeing a CNBC segment featuring Moderna’s CEO discussing plans to develop new medications on Jan. 15, the aide said, and Sloofman does not focus on health care or national security policymaking for his job. Sarah Holmes, New Hampshire-based state director to New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and a longtime aide to the senator, sold between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock in Delta Airlines on Jan. 24, as lawmakers were beginning to be clued into the forthcoming crisis.  Holmes traded out two stocks a week later, on Jan. 29, then on Feb. 27 made two purchases that could prove advantageous in the weeks ahead: Holmes purchased between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in each of two more companies, the pharmaceutical company Gilead, Inc. -- which makes remdesivir, a drug that is currently being tested to treat coronavirus -- and wipe manufacturer Clorox. The trades were made in a joint account, Shaheen spokesman Ryan Nickel said, and ""were made at the complete discretion of her broker with no input from Sarah or her husband.""  Additionally, the sale of the Delta stock on Jan. 24 was made prior to the classified Jan. 24 briefing for senators, Nickel said, at 9:30 a.m., and ""neither Senator Shaheen nor any of her staff were present for the classified briefing on Jan. 24."" Holmes does not have a security clearance and has complied with disclosure requirements, Nickel added. Though there is no current evidence that any of these elected officials or aides violated the law, there are several different bodies that could investigate lawmakers and aides for trading stocks. In addition to the ethics committees on Capitol Hill, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have the authority to launch probes of their own.  Burr and other lawmakers’ trades may be enough to spur a probe from the federal government, said Kevin Muhlendorf, a former investigator at the Department of Justice and SEC. “My gut on this is that based on the trading and the publicity, it’s highly likely that there will be some investigations by DOJ. I don't think the political nature of this is going to stop that,” said Muhlendorf. “It’s going to come down to very fact-specific inquiries: What were the sources of information? What was the timing of the trades? Those are going to all have to be scrutinized closely and thoroughly.”"," House members, Senate aides traded stocks in early days of coronavirus",2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/coronavirus-trading-house-senate-140260,politico
"Joe Biden reached a new and heady milestone when he shellacked Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois and Arizona to become the de facto Democratic nominee for president. But there was no soaring speech to acknowledge the moment. He never took the stage amid a sea of Biden signs or before an adoring crowd on national television. Biden was instead stuck in a makeshift studio in his Delaware home, webcasting his remarks with a low-quality personal computer camera against a straight-out-of-YouTube black backdrop and two American flags. He warned about the coronavirus contagion. He offered an olive branch to Bernie Sanders. Then, despite two consecutive weeks of smashing victories, he all but disappeared from the news cycle for days. The moment was a perfect distillation of Biden’s current predicament — in a state of suspended political animation, trapped between a rival who refuses to quit and the global pandemic that has all but shut down the Democratic primary campaign. Because Sanders won’t quit, Biden can’t fully pivot to the general election. He can’t truly unite the party’s warring factions. Nor can he begin stockpiling the vast amounts of money he’ll need for November. His momentum has effectively been stopped cold. A source familiar with the Democratic National Committee’s discussions says the party offered both the Biden and Sanders campaigns the opportunity to open joint-fundraising accounts. But since Sanders declined, the party is reluctant to enter into one with Biden because of the bad optics of seeming to help one candidate. “That’s going to eventually hurt Biden with financing if the DNC doesn’t go ahead with this,” the source said. Stuck at home because of coronavirus precautions, Biden also can’t meet with donors at fundraisers — which, in turn, may become less lucrative with an economy that’s sinking into recession or perhaps worse. “It’s a tough position,” said Matt Littman, who’s hosting a virtual fundraiser for Biden next month that the candidate and donors will attend through tele-conferencing software. “It’s harder to raise money when there’s no face-to-face meeting and personal contact,” Littman said. “And some of the normal people I have to raise money from I can’t count on. They have their own concerns. They have to keep their houses. The universe of people who will donate money will be smaller.” For the foreseeable future, all live campaign events are canceled, so he can’t hit the stump to try to capitalize on the excitement he had just stoked. His ability to criticize Trump on anything other than his performance on coronavirus response and preparedness is constrained by the emergency-like conditions. As new polling suggests that Trump’s approval for responding to the virus is improving, some of Biden’s fellow Democrats worry he’s paralyzed himself. “Biden is only in limbo if he keeps himself there. He’s only in a predicament to the degree he chooses to view himself in one,” said Jeff Hauser, a veteran of progressive politics who is head of the Revolving Door Project, which watchdogs executive branch appointees. “Joe Biden can either complain about the fact that he is not getting significant media coverage or he could do something to change that,” Hauser said. “He needs to offer an alternative and offer a running play-by-play critique of the failings of this administration.” Biden aides and allies, however, are projecting an aura of calm, saying Trump’s false claims and reinvented history about the virus will haunt him on their own as the economy craters. The former vice president pledged to call him out on it by Monday — but made the statement via conference call Friday with reporters instead of on camera. Meanwhile, his staff is scattered, communicating via teleconferencing, email and conference call. Some remain holed up in Philadelphia apartments near campaign headquarters but others went home to Washington. A few are near the candidate in Wilmington, Delaware. Another is in the mountains of Puerto Rico. The headquarters and campaign trail now run through Biden’s living room as his staff scrambles to increase his social media outreach to compensate for the social distancing. The first step: installing a better video camera in Biden’s house, which will soon have broadcast-ready capabilities and high-quality livestreaming software. To limit the risk of infecting the candidate, the number of staffers is limited within the house. The campaign also plans to flood social media with Biden to promote the brand of the former vice president who helped lead the nation’s Ebola virus response, has a vast knowledge of domestic and foreign policy and is known both as comforter-in-chief as well as the ice-cream-eating, aviator-shade-wearing everyman parodied in The Onion. “The thing that’s good about Joe Biden and the way the internet thinks about him is that there is a sense of brand, people know him as vice president, and they know ice cream and aviators. For us, we have to evolve from ice cream and aviators and being vice president to being commander-in-chief, while remaining relatable and true to his personality. That's the balance,” said Rob Flaherty, Biden’s digital director. “Our digital operation is putting out five-minute Iran crisis explainers and koozies that say, ‘keep it cool kid.’ It’s always been this tension,” Flaherty said. “And for us, the challenge and the opportunity is how we keep it between the buoys and present the best image of Joe Biden.” To increase voters’ sense of intimacy with Biden — who revels in one-on-one time with voters after public events — the campaign is discussing ways to find the technology and invent a “virtual rope-line” in which voters would wait in an electronic “queue” to speak with him briefly face-to-face, albeit via livestream. The campaign is also planning to hold more tele-town halls and is discussing a Biden podcast, in addition to pumping out more video clips of him. In some ways, the Biden campaign wants to give followers and viewers a sense of Biden as if he were a character in a reality show, building a loyal following online similar to the way former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke’s campaign did. Flaherty, who was O’Rourke’s digital director, said Biden’s social media presence will be unique to him. So unlike O’Rourke, Biden won’t be livestreaming from the dentist office chair or skateboarding in a Whataburger parking lot. Flaherty said the campaign always planned to have a heavy social-media focus. The only major difference now is the campaign is completely online and it has to ramp up faster and on a bigger scale. From the start, the campaign was designed to limit the news media’s interactions with Biden due to his reputation for gaffes and going off-script, which in some ways makes Biden’s social distancing a boon — his campaign can more tightly control his image. Rallies, after all, are only a small part of a campaign, said Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager. “The vast majority of voters don't interact with campaigns by attending rallies. They experience the campaign through TV coverage, social media, and advertising, and contact from volunteers, all of which will still continue,” Mook said. “This isn't the end of the campaign trail, but rather it's full transition into the digital space.” But the Biden campaign knows that time is precious. Trump’s campaign is preparing to unload on Biden to negatively define him before he’s the nominee and consolidates his base, which is harder now with Sanders still hanging around. Trump already has a far-bigger social media following, presence and reach than Biden. “With respect to the Trump camp — the entire right in general — they’re all rallying against one candidate: Biden. It’s so concentrated. But on the left, it’s still pretty fractured,” said Glenn Parham, founder of the Republican political intelligence firm Pundit Analytics. “The left is starting to funnel into Biden, but a lot of different advocacy groups are running attack ads against Joe and are supporting other candidates, even ones that have dropped out, which is kind of absurd.”  On the right, he said, the volume and concentrated fire “are orders of magnitude greater than on the left.” While Trump is more negatively affected on the campaign trail by coronavirus than Biden — the president’s campaign revolves around his big rallies — he has been able to occupy center stage by giving a daily White House press briefing. Joe Lockhart, former White House spokesman for the Clinton administration, said Biden needs to carefully calibrate his response to Trump. “It’s very tricky. When you’re in a crisis, there can only be one president. Just attacking him every day is a bad strategy,” said Lockhart, anticipating the Trump campaign’s response leveled Friday at Biden. “Where I think Biden is going is if he gives a series of strategic speeches that talk about the importance of preparing, the importance of government pulling together and the importance of being straight with the American public,” Lockhart said. Steve Schale, leader of the pro-Biden super PAC Unite The Country, said voters might still want an abeyance in the appearance of politicking in a time of crisis, at least in the short term. Schale said he was supposed to be on the road this week raising money from donors — a task made easier by Biden’s emergence as the all-but-certain nominee. But he’s stuck at home along with nearly everyone else. “This is affecting everyone’s lives in ways we didn’t imagine, not just Biden,” Schale said. “There’s no playbook for this.”",’There’s no playbook for this’: Biden trapped in campaign limbo,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/coranavirus-puts-biden-in-limbo-138726,politico
"OKLAHOMA CITY — This deeply conservative state is about to become a testing ground for turning a key piece of Obamacare into Trumpcare. Even before the coronavirus outbreak highlighted the potential cost of being uninsured, Oklahoma’s Republican governor was on the verge of joining the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, covering as many as 200,000 low-income adults. And there’s been little pushback from Republican legislators or conservative activists who have railed against Obamacare in the 10 years since its passage as an unaffordable, bureaucratic nightmare. But it’s not so simple. Oklahoma actually has two paths for expanding the safety net program. Voters could later this year decide to go for a straight expansion. Or under Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt’s preferred route, Oklahoma could become the first state to try and take up the Trump administration’s new offer of a block grant, part of a major conservative revamping of the program that’s been a high priority of this White House. Medicaid has long been an open-ended entitlement, with costs shared by the state and federal government. Under a block grant, there would be defined payment and the program would grow more slowly. Along with work requirements, block grants are a pillar of the GOP attempt to remake at least some portions of Obamacare after repeatedly failing to repeal it. What happens here in the Sooner State, which has the nation’s second-highest uninsured rate, could lay the groundwork for conservative states around the nation — including some that already expanded and the dozen-plus others who have steadfastly resisted providing Medicaid coverage to millions more of their poorest residents. Amber England, the energetic campaign manager behind the expansion ballot measure, argued her case before a dozen supporters on a back porch here on a temperate night earlier this month — less than a week before federal health officials would urge Americans to hunker down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. England polled the group on why they supported the campaign. A health care provider said he worried about a rash of rural hospital closures. One woman saw how Medicaid helped her brother receive care for multiple sclerosis before his death. Another said she had once lost her job; she had health insurance through her husband’s workplace but was shaken by the possibility of not having been so lucky. Oklahoma could soon join a recent wave of red states that expanded Medicaid through the ballot, defying Republican officials. While Obamacare remains unpopular with Republican voters, elements like Medicaid expansion and preexisting insurance protections have proven to be popular. Voters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah in 2018 approved expansion, only for GOP-controlled legislatures to come back and pursue conservative policies to pare back the program, like adding work requirements. The Oklahoma ballot measure, Question 802, could prevent similar conservative detours by making Medicaid expansion part of the state’s constitution. That would make it virtually impossible for Stitt to go through with his plan — which is important, ballot initiative supporters argue, so that care isn’t capped. “There is a pattern here,” England told the group. “If you don't protect this health care in our constitution from the whims of politicians, specifically in election years, that this health care could be restricted or go away.” In late January, CMS Administrator Seema Verma announced a major Medicaid overhaul – and a potential lifeline for Stitt, who opposed expanding Medicaid during his campaign just over a year earlier. Stitt flew to Washington, D.C., to appear with Verma as she announced a long-awaited offer to let states radically restructure Medicaid financing for poor adults who enroll in Obamacare’s expansion. And Stitt had an announcement of his own: He would be the first to take up the Trump administration’s offer. The policy, dubbed the Healthy Adult Opportunity, is a radical departure for the 55-year-old safety net program. Instead of the federal government matching state spending as it does now, states would receive a defined sum and significant more flexibility to tailor enrollment standards and benefits. The concept, known as a block grant, has long had support from Republicans, who argue it would help cash-strapped states better manage and design their own programs. Democrats and Medicaid advocates contend it would lead to states cutting enrollment and services, especially in economic downturns and public health emergencies — like the ongoing pandemic that’s brought the country to a standstill. Oklahoma, which has some of the worst health outcomes of any state, wasn’t a likely candidate to be the first in line for a block grant. It doesn’t have the reputation for being a conservative pioneer in health policy. The looming ballot measure changed the calculus. Greg Treat, the Republican leader of the state Senate, is opposed to Medicaid expansion, and has been since he was a staffer for former Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) during the debate over Obamacare. He doesn’t support the ballot initiative, but said he’s open to considering the governor’s plan, though he acknowledged concerns it could face court challenges. “I've looked, along with my caucus, at options to be able to try to do some kind of controlled expansion where you have a lot more flexibility,” Treat said. “The Healthy Adult Opportunity is the first time I've seen where the administration has really embraced concepts that allow more flexibility.” As the ballot measure was gaining support, Stitt and federal Medicaid officials began talking late last year about the block grant plan, which Verma had been developing for months at that point — and came as Stitt was growing more comfortable with the idea of adding people to the Medicaid rolls, said Carter Kimble, Oklahoma’s deputy secretary of health and mental health. “The more and more we learned about it, I think the more and more it appealed to the governor's business sense,” Kimble said. Verma is selling the plan as giving governors what they’ve been asking for: “The administration is offering states the upfront flexibility to design a program that works for their state’s unique needs, rather than being constrained by top-down dictates from Washington,” she wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. Stitt earlier this month took the first steps toward Medicaid expansion, asking the Trump administration for permission to broaden the program by this summer. Review of the block grant plan will happen later. Supporters of the ballot question suspect that maneuver was meant to dampen voter enthusiasm for their measure, though Stitt’s office says it will help the state better prepare for his plan and bring federal cash to the state’s hospitals sooner. Earlier this week, not long after Stitt received national backlash for encouraging people to dine out as health experts were urgently warning people to avoid crowds, his Medicaid agency posted the formal block grant proposal. It would initially start as per-person payments based on program enrollment, rather than a lump sum block grant, as the state gathers data on new enrollees. The state hopes to switch to a block grant in two years. It’s now accepting public feedback over a 30-day period before it can submit the proposal to the federal government. Opponents of his plan have urged him to call it back while the nation addresses the pandemic. “Oklahomans have countless issues to address during this national health crisis; fighting for health care coverage should not be one of those issues,” said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the left-leaning Oklahoma Policy Institute. Stitt said there's no reason to delay, since state health officials are accepting comments on the plan online, by phone and mail. “A global health crisis is exactly the time we should be seeking to expand coverage for Oklahomans,” he said in a statement, though his administration has already asked CMS to expand Medicaid while it works on the block grant plan. Other red states are taking notice of Oklahoma’s plan. But none are rushing in just yet. Tennessee, which hasn’t expanded Medicaid, last fall submitted to Trump a proposal to block-grant much of its Medicaid program, which Verma has indicated won’t pass muster under the narrower guidelines put out this year. Arkansas, at the forefront of Medicaid expansion experiments the past decade, has a state law requiring it to pursue a block grant once the federal government authorizes them. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson has been noncommittal on whether the state would pursue Trump’s offer. “We’ve talked to the Trump administration on their guidelines for a block grant, and we’re seeing how we can uniquely make that work in Arkansas,” Hutchinson told POLITICO last month. “It’s a work in progress, it’s a big lift — but it’s something the states have asked for, and something I’ve asked for.” Even states supportive of the idea likely will want to take their time studying it. But there are also political considerations. The block grant offer would certainly be wiped away if Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders is elected president this fall. Also, Medicaid advocates are expected to challenge Oklahoma’s plan in court if it’s approved by the Trump administration, potentially entangling it in legal battles for years to come. Another one of Trump’s major Medicaid initiatives, the program’s first-ever work requirements, has stalled after courts found the administration didn’t have the authority to mandate that some enrollees work or volunteer to keep their coverage. Block grant critics say that Trump similarly doesn’t have the authority to unilaterally rewrite the rules for Medicaid financing. But if Trump gets a second term, he can continue his conservative transformation of the judiciary, increasing the odds that the courts, which have become more conservative with Trump appointees, may ultimately bless his Medicaid overhaul. In Missouri, Medicaid advocates are close to securing enough signatures to put Medicaid expansion on the ballot this year. Republican Gov. Mike Parson, who’s running for reelection and opposes Medicaid expansion, said he likes block grants but is waiting for the outcome of the ballot measure. In Kansas, Trump’s block grant announcement didn’t scramble a bipartisan deal to expand Medicaid reached weeks earlier, much to the surprise of the state’s Democratic governor. “When I saw that was coming out, I thought, ‘Oh this is going to throw a monkey wrench in here’ — but no,” Gov. Laura Kelly told POLITICO. Instead, expansion has been held up over an unrelated anti-abortion measure. A key driving force behind Medicaid expansion in Oklahoma and other conservative states that have pursued expansion has been the struggles of rural hospitals. Richard Gillespie knows about those all too well. More than three years ago, the 18-bed rural hospital he runs was in dire straits. The equipment at Jefferson County Hospital was antiquated. Doctors were in short supply, and admissions were declining. Gillespie already told one board member the hospital, the last in the town of 1,934 people, would need to close. Then a deal came through: a larger system 30 minutes away, Duncan Regional Hospital, was willing to lease it. “I thought I was going to cry, literally,” Gillespie recalled, as he sat next to Jay Johnson, Duncan’s president and CEO. The facility now has new equipment and more patients — and sports a “Keep Rural Hospitals Open” sign on its front door in support of the ballot initiative. But other rural hospitals haven’t been so fortunate. In addition to the six that have closed in Oklahoma since 2016, another eight have declared bankruptcy. Even a larger rural hospital like Duncan — the county’s second-largest employer and so much a fixture in the community that residents eat in its cafe after church on Sunday — has thin operating margins that make it difficult to grow and provide more care. State Rep. Marcus McEntire, whose district includes both Duncan and Jefferson hospitals, was the rare Oklahoma Republican to support Medicaid expansion when he ran for office in 2016. “We’ve had six or seven [hospitals] close — not saying that that’s all because we haven’t expanded Medicaid … but I am saying that it would have helped,” said McEntire, who helped lead a bipartisan health care task force that discussed Medicaid expansion in the legislature. Many of the state’s uninsured also turn to the state’s robust community health center network, which cares for 250,000 patients per year. Roughly 28 percent of them don’t have health coverage. “When you’re sitting at the dead last outcomes in the country, practically, you kind of have to say, ‘Gee, what are other states doing?’ and then steal some of those best ideas and put them together the way you’ll think they’ll work in Oklahoma,” said Lou Carmichael, CEO of Variety Care, which operates 14 clinics. Medicaid expansion supporters said there’s been a noticeable shift in the state’s attitude toward the program. “I’ve seen us go from, ‘Oh, hell no,’ to by the end of last year’s legislative session, I think the question was not, 'Should we expand Medicaid,' but 'How will we expand Medicaid?'” said Carly Putnam, policy director of the Oklahoma Policy Institute. The feeling isn’t universal. The conservative Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, which lost a lawsuit to strike the Medicaid expansion ballot question, contends the program won’t make a dent in the state’s underlying health problems, like high obesity rates and physical inactivity. “Medicaid expansion is not going to solve [that],” said Jonathan Small, the group’s president.",The state trying to turn Obamacare into Trumpcare,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/the-state-trying-to-turn-obamacare-into-trumpcare-139964,politico
"The coronavirus outbreak means a deep and sudden economic contraction is likely now upon us. Public authorities have two important priorities here. The first is stopping the spread as quickly as possible. The second should be to limit the economic damage as much as possible, minimizing hardships like mass unemployment, debt defaults, and corporate failures. Cash injections and other financial support from the government will be an important part of the response. Lawmakers are debating how to dispense money where it is most needed, whether that means loans to various industries hard hit by the pandemic, direct cash payments to American families, or the expansion of social safety net programs. Each requires large outlays of public expenditures, so part of the debate is how much of this public spending American taxpayers can bear over the long term.  However, there is a large source of potential cash that doesn’t have any of the challenges and problems of public spending: home equity. Americans collectively own homes worth nearly $30 trillion. They have mortgages on those homes totaling about $11 trillion. That leaves $19 trillion in home equity. In the decade since the financial crisis, Americans have been deleveraging and mortgages now only represent about 34 percent of the value of owned homes. The last time leverage was lower was 1991. In the response to the financial crisis, many new regulations and mandates were implemented in the mortgage origination process. Take for example, cash-out refinancing. Since the crisis, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Administration have all added rules that prevent borrowers from using a mortgage refinance to take out some extra cash if that will leave them with less than 20 percent equity in their homes. The new rules also require lenders to engage in time-consuming and expensive underwriting processes. They must prove to regulators that they are using new guidelines to make sure borrowers are qualified. And, if a borrower defaults, lenders are at risk of being punished by regulators in addition to bearing the normal costs of foreclosure. The effects of these new regulations on mortgage lending have been noticeable. Compare the first quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2019, periods that are largely similar in terms of the interest rate environment. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, during the first quarter of 2003, lenders originated $304 billion in new mortgages to borrowers with pristine credit scores above 760. In the fourth quarter of 2019, they originated $479 billion to borrowers with credit scores above 760 —an increase of 57 percent. Borrowers with the best credit never really reduced their borrowing activity during and after the crisis, and with the recent drop in interest rates, they are borrowing more than ever. Contrast this with borrowers with credit scores below 760. During the first quarter of 2003, they took out $665 billion in loans. In 2019, they only took out $273 billion —a decline of 59 percent. In other words, the people who are most likely to struggle in the coming months have less access to home lending resources than they did prior to the events that fed the financial crisis. The same is true when it comes to leveraging their own home equity. The New York Fed has also tracked a significant decline in home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). The value of HELOCs outstanding topped out at about $710 billion in 2009 and has declined nearly every quarter since then, to a current level of $390 billion. This suggests that there are many households that might want to either tactically refinance hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of mortgages or tap their home equity for cash, but have been prevented from doing so by the current set of regulatory hurdles. Certainly, the 2008 financial crisis has created some reasonable fear about mortgage lending. But the dangers that were present in 2008 are not present today. There aren’t millions of recently purchased homes in cities where prices have suddenly doubled in a short period of time. Most borrowers will be long-time homeowners who braved the worst housing market in nearly a century and managed to hold on. In other words, unlike the housing bubble, these borrowers won’t be naïve new buyers speculating on a frenzied market; they will be established homeowners seeking financial safety during a pandemic. If ever there was a time to suspend the post-crisis regulatory framework, that time is now. We should carve out an exception to the post-crisis mortgage regulations, at least temporarily. For the next three months — with an important caveat — banks should have the ability to offer customers a home equity line of credit or a cash-out refinance.  The caveat is that banks that make these loans should be required to hold them in their own portfolios. This ensures that they can’t pass the risk onto others, either the government or other investors. To make sure these mortgages are solid, banks should bear the risk themselves. Let them decide, solely with their own discretion, which loans they think are good risks. Let them perform underwriting on those loans like they would have for decades before the 2008 crisis, without all the time-consuming extra documentation they are required to file now. Call them “Coronavirus HELOCs.” There is no guarantee that large-scale public policy responses will get money to all the Americans who need it most. We can, however, provide a financial lifeline for many American homeowners by letting them decide for themselves if a refinancing or HELOC is a good option for them. Americans could tap their homes for a trillion dollars in home equity and still not be any more leveraged than they had been in the 1990s when the housing market was quite docile and without driving up the national debt. This would be a simple way to use the private sector to quickly infuse cash into local economies.",How Mortgages Can Ease the Downturn,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/03/21/how-mortgages-can-ease-the-downturn-140317,politico
"Barren streets, vacant offices and empty gyms. A quarantined small California town of 2,600, guarded by military officials. Rationing medical care. Government turf wars and bureaucratic battles.  All of these scenes unfolded on the screen before me—not on cable news television—but in a generation’s worth of Hollywood blockbusters and a six-part miniseries about viral epidemics.  On the first weekend of our national emergency, I self-quarantined inside my apartment. I socially distanced from hundreds of St. Patrick’s Day revelers who crowded inside a white party tent and listened to a blaring Bon Jovi cover band outside the Irish pub across the street below. Then, I binge-watched nearly 10 hours of virus entertainment, from 1995’s “Outbreak” to 2019’s “The Hot Zone.”  While I didn’t emerge as a postdoc epidemiologist, the lessons I took away, hidden in plain sight all these years, would be valuable to any member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. It’s all there, from Contagion’s advocacy for social distancing to Outbreak’s and Hot Zone’s depictions of how interagency squabbling can slow responses. Even the epigraph of “Outbreak,” from the Nobel laureate and bacteriologist Joshua Lederberg, should have focused us on the gravity of a pandemic earlier: “The single biggest threat to man’s continued dominance on the planet is the virus.” But I also noticed something else: These films have perhaps numbed us to those very viruses that threaten us most—the viruses that do not have a giant fatality rate or change our physical appearance. In “Outbreak,” Dustin Hoffman’s Col. Sam Daniels, a virologist with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, contends with Motaba, a fever-inducing virus that kills 100 percent of its patients in two to three days. In “The Hot Zone,” Ebola leaves its patients with a rash and kills them quickly. In “Contagion,” MEV-1 has a mortality rate around 20 percent. If Motaba had hit the U.S. the government would have been faster to quarantine cities and issue shelter-in-place orders, shutting down schools and non-essential businesses. Had Ebola been spreading around Indianapolis, I bet those revelers across the street would have stayed at home. But my neighbors seemed blind to COVID-19, which is more insidious and subtly dangerous than the diseases from the movies. Its mortality rate is in the single digits —low enough so many think they have little to fear—but it is proving just as disabling to the economy and our way of life, if not more, than much more deadly outbreaks, which can be contained faster.  Earlier this week, I asked Dr. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiologist, why all of these movies hadn’t moved politicians and voters to take viral epidemics more seriously. “I don’t think movies change the way people feel about things,” he told me, adding that he was working with the writer of “Contagion,” Scott Z. Burns, on a public awareness campaign ad on the novel coronavirus.  “The fact that the United States has dodged the bullet with all of the latest infectious diseases, my perception of our government is that unless it’s screaming hot in the headlines, nothing will be done,” says Tracey McNamara, a technical consultant on “Contagion” and a veterinary medicine professor at Western University of Health Services, told me. “Contagion,” hints at our lackadaisical approach to any virus that isn’t produced in a Hollywood studio: There’s a scene in which a reporter asks Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Administrator Dr. Ellis Cheever, played by Laurence Fishburne, whether the government is overreacting to a virus that would claim 26 million lives in 29 days.  “Dr. Cheever, are you concerned that the CDC faces a credibility issue here, after the perceived overreaction to H1N1?” the reporter asks.  “I’d rather the news story be that we overreacted than that many people lost their lives because we didn’t do enough,” Cheever replies.  Set pieces and dramatic press conference scenes like this one seemed a critical part of any disaster movie. Now, we see them almost everyday when the coronavirus task force briefs the nation. For decades, these films have thrilled theatergoers with an invisible enemy, the stark reality of an apocalyptic human-versus-nature, us-versus-it conflict. But the actual conflict in all of these films is actually something different: It’s us versus the bureaucracy. These are not so much films about disasters as they are films about government.  “Contagion is such a compelling film—life is unfolding very much like the movie,” says McNamara, who discovered West Nile Virus in the summer of 1999 while working as the chief pathologist at the Bronx Zoo, when crows started falling from the sky and into exhibits that August. “The speed with which it spread. How it spread.” Turns out, Hollywood has been offering Washington clues about how a pandemic might transpire for decades—and what the government should do to fight it. Here are just a few: Much of “Outbreak” revolves around the efforts of the protagonist (Col. Sam Daniels, played by Dustin Hoffman) to convince his boss, Brigadier General William Ford (played by Morgan Freeman) that the country faces a real threat from the fictional Motaba virus. Daniels spends much of the film battling with Army General Donald McClintock, played by Donald Sutherland, to get the word out about the dangers of the virus.  After Daniels’ ex-wife, CDC staffer Dr. Roberta “Robby” Keough—played by Rene Russo—treats a dying and infected patient, she laments not getting a CDC advisory out about the virus faster. The CDC staffers’ efforts were blocked by her superiors. “I should’ve forced the alert,” the doctor says, explaining Motaba’s deadly effects. “Christ, Sam. I opened this guy up,” she tells her ex. “Looked like a bomb went off inside. His pancreas, liver, kidney, spleen—all the organs were liquified. Christ, I should’ve forced the alert.” In “Contagion,” weeks into the outbreak of MEV-1, Dr. Sanjay Gupta (played by himself) asks CDC Administrator Cheever how many people have died from the disease during a cable television appearance. The answer, Cheever admits, was “very difficult” to know exact numbers because reporting varied by state. “There are 50 different states in this country, which means there are 50 different health departments. Followed by 50 different protocols.” And in the final episode of “The Hot Zone,” a dispute between an Ebola researcher and the head of the CDC almost derails efforts to get to the bottom of the Reston, Virginia, Ebola outbreak.  “The guy hates my guts,” Walter said of the CDC official Trevor Rhodes (James D’Arcy). “I’m never going to convince him to help.”  “You need to bury whatever happened between you two, Carter. You got no choice.” The messages of all these films—infighting and turf battles make things worse—felt apt for the ongoing feud between Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is a branch of HHS that operates independently. “A series of incidents over the past 120 days suggest basic communication and coordination between CMS and HHS is lacking, thereby jeopardizing HHS’ mission and undermining public trust,” HHS chief information officer Jose Arrieta wrote a recent memo. The latest incident? On February 23, HHS’ email system crashed, causing vital messages about the emergency coronavirus funding package to be delayed for up to 11 hours. The cause: Verma’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had failed to brief HHS leaders about a test that would send thousands of messages through the system. The outage slowed the administration’s response to the deadly outbreak.  In the six-part National Geographic mini-series “The Hot Zone,” based on the 1994 non-fiction book by Richard Preston, Wade Carter, a fictionalized reclusive Ebola expert who studied the virus in the field, is frustrated that more senior officials aren’t taking the threat of Ebola on American soil more seriously. Carter tells Army Col. Nancy Jaax (played by Julianna Margulies), a veterinarian who helped contain Ebola-infected monkeys from the Philippines: “Did I want this? Never. Now it’s here. Would it be good for the Oval Office to be pissing its pants about this now? You bet.”  But by the end of the series, after the scientists ultimately contained an Ebola outbreak in Reston, Virginia, there seems to be little appetite from public policymakers to take the threat of an epidemic seriously. We see a flyover shot of Capitol Hill. In a nameless committee room, the deputy secretary of the National Institutes of Health asks Jaax: “So no one died?”  “That’s correct, Mr. Chairman,” Jaax says. “But four people tested positive for the Ebola virus.  “And 172 people were tested and came up negative,” the deputy secretary responded, unperturbed.  The warning was clear: When scientists are worried, people should listen. And yet, not more than a week ago, President Donald Trump and some Republican members of Congress, along with conservative television hosts, were saying that journalists and Democrats were overplaying the threat of the coronavirus. Now some of those pols who thought it was no big deal are getting tested for COVID-19 themselves.  In “The Hot Zone,” Jaax’s husband, Noah Emmerich’s Lt. Col. Jerry Jaax, makes a plea: “It’s no secret the CDC needs more funding for research and development”—meaning that the CDC was caught somewhat flat-footed by the outbreak in Reston.  But back in real life, just last week, even as coronavirus was spreading in the United States, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought defended the Trump administration’s proposed $35 million cut to the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund, designed for use by the CDC.  Rep. Matt Cartwright, the Democratic member from Pennsylvania, bristled at the cuts in a hearing with Vought. “The question is today, as we sit here and we know about coronavirus and the impact it’s taking on the people of the world and the economies of the world and the stock market and everything, as you sit here today, are you ready to take that back?” In none of the virus movies I watched do we see the U.S. president. He or she is often one of the least important characters. In “Contagion,” he’s moved underground. In “Outbreak,” we only see the chief of staff, talking White House officials through the ethics of bombing a California town, executing all of its citizens in order to contain Mataba. Instead, the most important characters—the ones who do the talking—are the public health officials, virologists, researchers and frontline healthcare workers. In the movies, scientists always offer a clear explanation and as much information as they have to concerned citizens. Politicians would only get in the way. President Donald Trump didn’t get the memo. His statements about coronavirus have been perplexing and counterproductive. He said we have it “under control.” He compared it to the flu. He told people with the virus to go to work. He suggested the virus would “disappear.” Then he declared a national emergency. In contrast, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, a global health official at the State Department who is now White House coronavirus response coordinator, are lucid, calm presenters of information—perhaps the administration’s most credible spokespeople. If this were a Hollywood movie, those two would have been doing most of the talking from the beginning.  Bryan Cranston, who plays Rear Admiral Lyle Haggerty in “Contagion,” alludes to a congressman who is at risk of infecting his fellow members of Congress with MEV-1. “There’s a sick congressman from Illinois in D.C.,” Haggerty says. “He was in Chicago over the holiday. They are using the pod to fly him home, and then they are closing Midway and O’Hare. The governor there is calling out the national guard. They are setting up roadblocks. They are shutting down the board of trade, public transportation. Even the Teamsters are pulling their drivers off the road.”  Any policymaker who watched that scene and connected the dots wouldn’t have been able to escape the realization that in the event of a pandemic, it would be important for Congress to have a way of working remotely. This week, several representatives and senators directed some staffers to work from home. Still, members of Congress, many of whom are at risk of higher mortality rates given their average age—57.8 years in the House and 61.8 years in the Senate— don’t have an established way to conduct their business remotely. The Wolfgang Petersen film “Outbreak” is perhaps the least subtle of the group of films. A lab clinician infected with Motaba sees a movie with his girlfriend. As a result, the entire town of Cedar Creek, California—population 2,600—is nearly bombed with the “the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in our arsenal” by the U.S. government to contain the spread of the virus.  When Daniels and Keough survey the infected at a makeshift hospital in Cedar Creek, Keough remarks: “So many—so fast.”  “Apparently they all gathered at a movie theater,” Daniels replies.  In “Contagion,” the CDC administrator urges social distancing and not shaking hands as the best advice for controlling the spread of MEV-1. We see empty gyms and open-floor plan offices. “Right now, our best defense has been social distancing,” Fishburne’s Cheever, the CDC director, tells Dr. Sanjay Gutpa in a cable television studio. “No handshaking. Staying home when you are sick. Washing your hands frequently.”  The idea for the scene came from Lipkin, the Columbia University epidemiologist who told the film’s writer, Scott Z. Burns, that he would serve as a technical adviser on the movie if he agreed to make it as scientifically accurate a film as possible.  In the film’s emotional denouement, Cheever visits the home of one the CDC’s janitors to deliver a vaccine, where he explains to the janitor’s son the origins of the handshake. (The scene was “designed” to disclose the history of the handshake,” Lipkin told me in an interview earlier this week.  “Do you know where this comes from? Shaking hands?” he asks the boy, after delivering the vaccine by pushing a swab up his nostril. “It was a way of showing a stranger you weren’t carrying a weapon in the old days.”  These days, we are all presumed to be armed and dangerous.",What I Learned About Coronavirus From Binge-watching 10 Hours of Virus Movies,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/21/pandemic-movies-coronavirus-140043,politico
"David Zuckerman, the lieutenant governor of Vermont, is an eccentric longtime figure in state politics — a ponytail-sporting organic farmer and Bernie Sanders protege who has proudly fought against government-mandated vaccinations.  But the arrival of the coronavirus has suddenly put Zuckerman on the defensive in his campaign for governor this year: Amid the worsening pandemic, one of his top Democratic opponents is calling out his anti-vaxxer views as dangerous, and attempting to make them politically toxic. “In moments like this, we see just how critical it is that we support vaccines and make them as available as possible,” said Rebecca Holcombe, the state’s former education secretary who is challenging Zuckerman for the Democratic nomination in the August primary to take on popular Republican incumbent Gov. Phil Scott. “It's scary that anyone in public office or seeking public office would cast doubt about the value of vaccines. It's unbelievable this is even up for debate."" Zuckerman shot back that Holcombe is trying to use a public health crisis to score political points. “The fact that any political campaign is trying to use this moment for political opportunism is unconscionable,” he told POLITICO. “Right now, my primary focus is to disseminate important health information about the virus and how to keep Vermonters, their families and our community safe...When the COVID-19 vaccine is available for the coronavirus it should be free for all and universally accessible.” The fight in Vermont’s Democratic gubernatorial primary sets up a larger test of how mainstream the “anti-vaxxer” movement has become on the left, and whether the coronavirus pandemic could make it politically untenable even in liberal bastions. Anti-vaccine advocacy is a growing force in American politics and around the globe as formerly fringe activists have developed a wide reach across social media platforms. Other candidates who oppose mandatory vaccinations are running for office, and some are winning, with support from large and well-funded advocacy groups.  Recently-ousted Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin has said that mandatory vaccines are un-American. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has repeatedly said parents should be able to decide whether or not to vaccinate their children. With backing by the group Texans for Vaccine Choice as well as Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, libertarian Susanna Dokupil is making another run for the state legislature, primarying one of the most vocally pro-vaccine Republicans in Austin.  But the movement has had even more success in blocking pro-vaccine legislation, defeating efforts in New Jersey, California and other states that would have eliminated exemptions to immunization. Zuckerman, 48, has faced fierce criticism from Republican opponents in past races for his position on vaccinations, yet still won. He is seen as the frontrunner in an August primary for the Democratic nomination, though Scott is favored to win reelection. But Holcombe is betting that the anxiety surrounding coronavirus will make the issue more salient and perhaps will force a reckoning with the anti-vaxx left. That movement includes several high-profile celebrities along with former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, a vocal skeptic of mandatory vaccinations, campaigned for Sanders after she dropped out of the race. Last year, the World Health Organization labeled what it called “vaccine hesitancy” one of the top 10 threats to global health, citing a 30% increase in measles cases worldwide. Vaccine skepticism is often tied to populist political movements on the right and the left. It’s part of a bigger surge of anti-establishment anger around the world — including in the U.S., where less than half the population gets vaccinated against the seasonal flu, which has killed tens of thousands in the past year alone. Despite past blowback for his positions, Zuckerman has remained firm in his opposition to mandatory vaccinations. He was called a “hero” by the co-founder of a Vermont “vaccine choice” group during his 2016 bid for lieutenant governor. In 2015, while serving in the state Senate, Zuckerman strongly opposed a bill that repealed the “philosophical exemption” to vaccinations which ultimately passed. And in a 2018 debate while running for reelection, he defended his past positions by arguing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has financial connections with the pharmaceutical industry that made him skeptical of its recommendations. “The CDC’s infectious disease control board actually has a number of conflicts of interests,” he argued. “And so yes, like many, I do sometimes question when government agencies are a bit too infused with corporate influence with respect to some of the outcomes and decisions they make.”  Yet Zuckerman has thrived politically, and some Vermont Democratic officials speculate he could someday succeed Sanders, a longtime ally, in the Senate. Sanders’ presidential campaign declined to comment on Zuckerman, but one aide noted that Sanders supports mandatory vaccinations with ""very limited exceptions.” The aide said “there are some health exceptions“ but declined to provide further details on which exceptions he supports. Many in the so-called “anti-vaxxer” community have tried in recent years to make their position more politically palatable by arguing that while they believe vaccines are effective, they are opposed to the government requiring them. Zuckerman has taken a similar messaging approach. In the 2018 debate, Zuckerman said “the science behind vaccines is sound, I think vaccines do good for our communities, my daughter is vaccinated. But it’s a question of whether government should be forcing that onto individuals.” Public health experts say such arguments put vulnerable people at risk. Even before the recent coronavirus pandemic, several states had been moving to eliminate religious and other exemptions for childhood vaccinations, as measles and other diseases have resurged in recent years.  “That's a dangerous message, that everyone should decide for themselves,” said Lois Privor-Dumm, a senior researcher on global vaccine policy at Johns Hopkins University. “If [people who forego vaccines] want to keep themselves quarantined all the time, that’s one thing. But that’s not what happens in life. So it's not appropriate for candidates to go against all the public health experts out there.” While campaigning in 2016 the Republican primary, Donald Trump also argued without evidence there is a correlation between vaccines and autism, a position which drew rebuke from the medical and scientific community as well as fellow candidate Ben Carson, a brain surgeon who now serves as his secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  As president, however, Trump shifted his position. In response to a number of Measles outbreaks in 2019, Trump told parents that their children “have to get the shots. The vaccinations are so important.”",Anti-vaxx politicians under fire as coronavirus spreads,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/anti-vaccine-coronavirus-137446,politico
"Joe Biden reached a new and heady milestone when he shellacked Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois and Arizona to become the de facto Democratic nominee for president. But there was no soaring speech to acknowledge the moment. He never took the stage amid a sea of Biden signs or before an adoring crowd on national television. Biden was instead stuck in a makeshift studio in his Delaware home, webcasting his remarks with a low-quality personal computer camera against a straight-out-of-YouTube black backdrop and two American flags. He warned about the coronavirus contagion. He offered an olive branch to Bernie Sanders. Then, despite two consecutive weeks of smashing victories, he all but disappeared from the news cycle for days. The moment was a perfect distillation of Biden’s current predicament — in a state of suspended political animation, trapped between a rival who refuses to quit and the global pandemic that has all but shut down the Democratic primary campaign. Because Sanders won’t quit, Biden can’t fully pivot to the general election. He can’t truly unite the party’s warring factions. Nor can he begin stockpiling the vast amounts of money he’ll need for November. His momentum has effectively been stopped cold. A source familiar with the Democratic National Committee’s discussions says the party offered both the Biden and Sanders campaigns the opportunity to open joint-fundraising accounts. But since Sanders declined, the party is reluctant to enter into one with Biden because of the bad optics of seeming to help one candidate. “That’s going to eventually hurt Biden with financing if the DNC doesn’t go ahead with this,” the source said. Stuck at home because of coronavirus precautions, Biden also can’t meet with donors at fundraisers — which, in turn, may become less lucrative with an economy that’s sinking into recession or perhaps worse. “It’s a tough position,” said Matt Littman, who’s hosting a virtual fundraiser for Biden next month that the candidate and donors will attend through tele-conferencing software. “It’s harder to raise money when there’s no face-to-face meeting and personal contact,” Littman said. “And some of the normal people I have to raise money from I can’t count on. They have their own concerns. They have to keep their houses. The universe of people who will donate money will be smaller.” For the foreseeable future, all live campaign events are canceled, so he can’t hit the stump to try to capitalize on the excitement he had just stoked. His ability to criticize Trump on anything other than his performance on coronavirus response and preparedness is constrained by the emergency-like conditions. As new polling suggests that Trump’s approval for responding to the virus is improving, some of Biden’s fellow Democrats worry he’s paralyzed himself. “Biden is only in limbo if he keeps himself there. He’s only in a predicament to the degree he chooses to view himself in one,” said Jeff Hauser, a veteran of progressive politics who is head of the Revolving Door Project, which watchdogs executive branch appointees. “Joe Biden can either complain about the fact that he is not getting significant media coverage or he could do something to change that,” Hauser said. “He needs to offer an alternative and offer a running play-by-play critique of the failings of this administration.” Biden aides and allies, however, are projecting an aura of calm, saying Trump’s false claims and reinvented history about the virus will haunt him on their own as the economy craters. The former vice president pledged to call him out on it by Monday — but made the statement via conference call Friday with reporters instead of on camera. Meanwhile, his staff is scattered, communicating via teleconferencing, email and conference call. Some remain holed up in Philadelphia apartments near campaign headquarters but others went home to Washington. A few are near the candidate in Wilmington, Delaware. Another is in the mountains of Puerto Rico. The headquarters and campaign trail now run through Biden’s living room as his staff scrambles to increase his social media outreach to compensate for the social distancing. The first step: installing a better video camera in Biden’s house, which will soon have broadcast-ready capabilities and high-quality livestreaming software. To limit the risk of infecting the candidate, the number of staffers is limited within the house. The campaign also plans to flood social media with Biden to promote the brand of the former vice president who helped lead the nation’s Ebola virus response, has a vast knowledge of domestic and foreign policy and is known both as comforter-in-chief as well as the ice-cream-eating, aviator-shade-wearing everyman parodied in The Onion. “The thing that’s good about Joe Biden and the way the internet thinks about him is that there is a sense of brand, people know him as vice president, and they know ice cream and aviators. For us, we have to evolve from ice cream and aviators and being vice president to being commander-in-chief, while remaining relatable and true to his personality. That's the balance,” said Rob Flaherty, Biden’s digital director. “Our digital operation is putting out five-minute Iran crisis explainers and koozies that say, ‘keep it cool kid.’ It’s always been this tension,” Flaherty said. “And for us, the challenge and the opportunity is how we keep it between the buoys and present the best image of Joe Biden.” To increase voters’ sense of intimacy with Biden — who revels in one-on-one time with voters after public events — the campaign is discussing ways to find the technology and invent a “virtual rope-line” in which voters would wait in an electronic “queue” to speak with him briefly face-to-face, albeit via livestream. The campaign is also planning to hold more tele-town halls and is discussing a Biden podcast, in addition to pumping out more video clips of him. In some ways, the Biden campaign wants to give followers and viewers a sense of Biden as if he were a character in a reality show, building a loyal following online similar to the way former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke’s campaign did. Flaherty, who was O’Rourke’s digital director, said Biden’s social media presence will be unique to him. So unlike O’Rourke, Biden won’t be livestreaming from the dentist office chair or skateboarding in a Whataburger parking lot. Flaherty said the campaign always planned to have a heavy social-media focus. The only major difference now is the campaign is completely online and it has to ramp up faster and on a bigger scale. From the start, the campaign was designed to limit the news media’s interactions with Biden due to his reputation for gaffes and going off-script, which in some ways makes Biden’s social distancing a boon — his campaign can more tightly control his image. Rallies, after all, are only a small part of a campaign, said Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager. “The vast majority of voters don't interact with campaigns by attending rallies. They experience the campaign through TV coverage, social media, and advertising, and contact from volunteers, all of which will still continue,” Mook said. “This isn't the end of the campaign trail, but rather it's full transition into the digital space.” But the Biden campaign knows that time is precious. Trump’s campaign is preparing to unload on Biden to negatively define him before he’s the nominee and consolidates his base, which is harder now with Sanders still hanging around. Trump already has a far-bigger social media following, presence and reach than Biden. “With respect to the Trump camp — the entire right in general — they’re all rallying against one candidate: Biden. It’s so concentrated. But on the left, it’s still pretty fractured,” said Glenn Parham, founder of the Republican political intelligence firm Pundit Analytics. “The left is starting to funnel into Biden, but a lot of different advocacy groups are running attack ads against Joe and are supporting other candidates, even ones that have dropped out, which is kind of absurd.”  On the right, he said, the volume and concentrated fire “are orders of magnitude greater than on the left.” While Trump is more negatively affected on the campaign trail by coronavirus than Biden — the president’s campaign revolves around his big rallies — he has been able to occupy center stage by giving a daily White House press briefing. Joe Lockhart, former White House spokesman for the Clinton administration, said Biden needs to carefully calibrate his response to Trump. “It’s very tricky. When you’re in a crisis, there can only be one president. Just attacking him every day is a bad strategy,” said Lockhart, anticipating the Trump campaign’s response leveled Friday at Biden. “Where I think Biden is going is if he gives a series of strategic speeches that talk about the importance of preparing, the importance of government pulling together and the importance of being straight with the American public,” Lockhart said. Steve Schale, leader of the pro-Biden super PAC Unite The Country, said voters might still want an abeyance in the appearance of politicking in a time of crisis, at least in the short term. Schale said he was supposed to be on the road this week raising money from donors — a task made easier by Biden’s emergence as the all-but-certain nominee. But he’s stuck at home along with nearly everyone else. “This is affecting everyone’s lives in ways we didn’t imagine, not just Biden,” Schale said. “There’s no playbook for this.”",‘There’s no playbook for this’: Biden trapped in campaign limbo,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/coranavirus-puts-biden-in-limbo-138726,politico
"The United Nations Security Council, a premier global forum, hasn’t yet held a session on the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world. The European Union is trying to limit exports of key medical supplies to nations beyond its borders — while its own members are barely helping one another.  Financial institutions worldwide have only recently started cooperating to mitigate the economic damage from the rapidly spreading illness, but investors are still spooked.  And, the United States, led by President Donald Trump and his America First vision, is focused more on the virus’ internal challenge than its global impact. Instead of rallying the world, as it has in the past on major challenges, the U.S. is brawling with other countries affected by the crisis.  If there’s one thing the coronavirus has shown, it’s that a crisis that affects all of humanity does not necessarily inspire international unity, coordination or leadership. Instead, borders are closing, competition for resources is up, politicians are insulting one another, and no country is taking charge.  “This is a challenge that’s hitting every country at the same time, and we’re all working in our own little silos instead of working together,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former Obama administration official who oversaw disaster response. “There’s no attempt at global leadership from anyone right now, and we’re not going to win if ultimately we’re not working together on this.”  The difference in reaction is particularly stark when compared to the Ebola virus crisis, which — while more limited in geographical scope — nonetheless inspired a global response spearheaded by the U.S. under then-President Barack Obama.  As of Friday, the coronavirus had been spotted in over 150 countries, with more than 255,000 confirmed cases and over 10,000 deaths, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.  That number has grown quickly in recent weeks as Western officials have struggled to absorb the hard-won lessons of their counterparts in Asia, where draconian measures — in the case of China, which shut down entire regions — and more innovative tactics in Singapore and South Korea have beaten back the disease.  As the outbreak's center of gravity shifts to Europe and North America, the deadly illness is straining health care systems, as well as supply lines for medicines, ventilators and other critical items. It is shocking economies as governments close their borders, order quarantines and enact severe “social distancing” measures that are devastating retail businesses and roiling markets.  Instead of uniting, world powers are squabbling. On Friday, the White House circulated a video of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accusing Russia, China, Iran and others of spreading disinformation about the virus. Perhaps most glaringly, there’s been no significant international gathering of political leaders tasked with devising a global strategy to tackle the disease.  The closest thing to it came earlier this week when the leaders of countries in the Group of Seven — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — held a video conference call on the virus.  The discussion reportedly took place at the urging of France’s President Emmanuel Macron. It yielded notable commitments, including pledges to work together on research and a vague promise to “coordinate our efforts to delay the spread of the virus, including through appropriate border management measures.”  But Trump has barely mentioned the call since. His earlier, sudden decision to impose a travel ban on Europe due to the virus had already surprised and upset key G-7 members, who complained that they had not been consulted. And seeing as the G-7 does not include major affected countries, such as China, its commitments — if carried out — will arguably have limited effect. (The G-7’s foreign ministers are due to hold a virtual meeting next week.)  Saudi Arabia has called for an emergency virtual summit next week of the leaders of the Group of 20, which does include China. But as of Friday, it was unclear when — or if — that session would happen. Saudi Arabia currently holds the group’s presidency, but its recent precipitous moves to slash oil prices have not helped soothe financial markets.  During a White House news conference Friday, Pompeo, who has kept an unusually low profile throughout the crisis, praised “the global leadership that America has always delivered” and claimed it “has been great to see countries around the world rally behind what we are doing.”  Pressed for examples, a senior Trump administration official pointed to U.S. plans to spend more than $1 billion to help the international community fight the pandemic.  The official added that the administration “has conducted numerous conference calls with science ministers from around the world, leading to actions on data sharing, clinical trials, enhanced access to data and research publications, and unity among the international science community.”  China’s communist leaders have taken perhaps the most visible moves aimed at burnishing their global credentials during the crisis.  Scientists believe the infectious disease emerged in China’s Hubei province last year. For weeks, the Chinese downplayed the disease, muzzling doctors and resisting allowing in a team from the World Health Organization. Eventually, Beijing used extreme means to limit the spread of the illness, and the country claims to have brought it under control.  In recent days, China has sent supplies and experts to other countries fighting the illness. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has taken a high profile amid the sudden Chinese generosity, and his state-controlled media machine has promoted China’s authoritarian governance model as best suited for dealing with such an enemy. Still, there are signs that China is reluctant to take too bold a stance. For one thing, China currently holds the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council, and yet it has not convened a session on the coronavirus.  When asked why the Security Council hasn’t met to discuss the pandemic, a senior U.N. diplomat told POLITICO: “They just haven’t,” adding, “We’re able to support them either virtually or even if they want to meet in person.”  Chinese officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  While rare, holding a U.N. Security Council session on a health crisis is not without precedent; one was held on the Ebola crisis.  One possible reason no Security Council session has been called this time is the ongoing war of words over the virus between China and another permanent, veto-wielding member: the United States.  Chinese officials have been floating conspiracy theories alleging that the coronavirus may have originated outside their borders, possibly even at the hands of the U.S. military.  In response, Trump, Pompeo and some Republican lawmakers have been calling the illness the “Chinese virus” or similar terms, angering Beijing. U.S. officials also keep hammering China for its original lack of candor about the seriousness of the outbreak, though Trump has praised Xi personally for his handling of it.  At times, Trump has even appeared to welcome the pandemic’s rapidly mounting consequences for the world order, claiming he was happy to see Americans stay home and buy their goods from U.S. factories. There are few signs, however, that he is deeply engaged with cajoling or negotiating with other leaders to coordinate their plans for combating the virus.  At the United Nations, the main organization involved in a global response to the virus is the WHO. On other U.N. fronts, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs are trying to help relief groups navigate the viral terrain as they aid vulnerable populations such as refugees.  But these are largely technical bodies, not ones that can hammer out political agreements — or at least guidelines — on issues like medical supply lines, financial assistance and border policies.  When countries have come to agreements related to the virus, it’s often been bilateral — such as the Canada-U.S. decision to limit border crossings — or through regional blocs, such as the EU.  Those agreements, however, could have negative impacts elsewhere on Earth.  In Europe, countries have been hoarding medical supplies, with some putting up restrictions on exports of items such as face masks. The EU stepped in, announcing limits on exports of such materials outside the bloc in an effort to boost availability within.  Researchers are warning, however, that those new external limits could hurt other, poorer countries that need Europe to supply such equipment. Europe’s move could also prompt nations outside the bloc to restrict their exports of materials European nations will require.  G-7 finance ministers and central bankers pledged on March 3 to use “all appropriate policy tools” to keep their economies afloat. But stock markets continued to fall, and financial institutions across the world have begun stepping up their actions in recent days.  Several central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have taken what appear to be coordinated actions to stabilize the markets, such as buying bonds, cutting interest rates and re-opening emergency lending programs last used during the financial crisis of 2008.  The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank said earlier this month that they “stand ready to help our member countries address the human tragedy and economic challenge posed by the COVID-19 virus.”  But such financial promises also run into political realities, such as whether the IMF should lend funds to Venezuela, Iran and other countries whose regimes are opposed by the United States, a major global financial player.  Former U.S. officials and analysts who watch multilateral institutions note that the coronavirus is simply unprecedented in its geographical scope and the resulting implications. The virus, officially called COVID-19, is a new strain that scientists are still trying to understand, and it has even stricken some government officials who would be involved in planning a response.  “Who can muster an international response when no one can travel, when countries are in lockdown? Even within countries you can’t travel,” one former senior State Department official said.  They note, however, that there’s one past model that offers some lessons: The U.S.-led response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. That crisis began in the early months of 2014, with an outbreak in Guinea. Over the next several months, cases appeared in neighboring countries. The WHO stepped in to help, with assistance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In August, as global concern grew over the vicious illness, Obama used a gathering of African leaders in the United States to raise awareness of the crisis and pledge continued U.S. support. By mid-September, Obama announced that, among other measures, the U.S. would send 3,000 troops to West Africa to help build medical facilities and offer other aid to medical professionals. Obama seemed aware of criticism that he’d moved too slowly, saying, “We have to act fast — we can’t dawdle on this one” and adding that “this is a global threat, and it demands a truly global response.”  That same week, the U.N. Security Council passed a U.S.-drafted resolution declaring Ebola a threat to world peace and security. The meeting was led by the United States, which held the Security Council’s rotating presidency at the time. U.N. observers said it was a rare, possibly unprecedented council session due to its focus on a public health crisis.  Days later, during the annual gathering of the U.N. General Assembly, a special high-level meeting was held on the issue of the Ebola virus. Speaking to those gathered, Obama warned that the global community was “not doing enough.”  In the ensuing weeks and months, other countries joined or stepped up efforts to help West African states contain the illness. Although some Republicans insisted Obama fumbled the response (and Trump was a critic, too), the former Democratic president’s aides defend his approach.  With the coronavirus, “there’s been a complete absence of anything like that,” said Konyndyk, who helped lead the Ebola response under Obama. “Our diplomatic toolbox is more absent despite the fact that it’s more necessary.”  Among those arguing for a more united international front against the coronavirus is U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.  In what his office dubbed a “virtual press encounter” Thursday, Guterres called on world leaders to “come together and offer an urgent and coordinated response to this global crisis.”  “Current responses at the country level will not address the global scale and complexity of the crisis,” he warned.",World leaders are fighting the virus.

"Barren streets, vacant offices and empty gyms. A quarantined small California town of 2,600, guarded by military officials. Rationing medical care. Government turf wars and bureaucratic battles.  All of these scenes unfolded on the screen before me—not on cable news television—but in a generation’s worth of Hollywood blockbusters and a six-part miniseries about viral epidemics.  On the first weekend of our national emergency, I self-quarantined inside my apartment. I socially distanced from hundreds of St. Patrick’s Day revelers who crowded inside a white party tent and listened to a blaring Bon Jovi cover band outside the Irish pub across the street below. Then, I binge-watched nearly 10 hours of virus entertainment, from 1995’s “Outbreak” to 2019’s “The Hot Zone.”  While I didn’t emerge as a postdoc epidemiologist, the lessons I took away, hidden in plain sight all these years, would be valuable to any member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. It’s all there, from Contagion’s advocacy for social distancing to Outbreak’s and Hot Zone’s depictions of how interagency squabbling can slow responses. Even the epigraph of “Outbreak,” from the Nobel laureate and bacteriologist Joshua Lederberg, should have focused us on the gravity of a pandemic earlier: “The single biggest threat to man’s continued dominance on the planet is the virus.” But I also noticed something else: These films have perhaps numbed us to those very viruses that threaten us most—the viruses that do not have a giant fatality rate or change our physical appearance. In “Outbreak,” Dustin Hoffman’s Col. Sam Daniels, a virologist with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, contends with Motaba, a fever-inducing virus that kills 100 percent of its patients in two to three days. In “The Hot Zone,” Ebola leaves its patients with a rash and kills them quickly. In “Contagion,” MEV-1 has a mortality rate around 20 percent. If Motaba had hit the U.S. the government would have been faster to quarantine cities and issue shelter-in-place orders, shutting down schools and non-essential businesses. Had Ebola been spreading around Indianapolis, I bet those revelers across the street would have stayed at home. But my neighbors seemed blind to COVID-19, which is more insidious and subtly dangerous than the diseases from the movies. Its mortality rate is in the single digits —low enough so many think they have little to fear—but it is proving just as disabling to the economy and our way of life, if not more, than much more deadly outbreaks, which can be contained faster.  Earlier this week, I asked Dr. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiologist, why all of these movies hadn’t moved politicians and voters to take viral epidemics more seriously. “I don’t think movies change the way people feel about things,” he told me, adding that he was working with the writer of “Contagion,” Scott Z. Burns, on a public awareness campaign ad on the novel coronavirus.  “The fact that the United States has dodged the bullet with all of the latest infectious diseases, my perception of our government is that unless it’s screaming hot in the headlines, nothing will be done,” says Tracey McNamara, a technical consultant on “Contagion” and a veterinary medicine professor at Western University of Health Services, told me. “Contagion,” hints at our lackadaisical approach to any virus that isn’t produced in a Hollywood studio: There’s a scene in which a reporter asks Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Administrator Dr. Ellis Cheever, played by Laurence Fishburne, whether the government is overreacting to a virus that would claim 26 million lives in 29 days.  “Dr. Cheever, are you concerned that the CDC faces a credibility issue here, after the perceived overreaction to H1N1?” the reporter asks.  “I’d rather the news story be that we overreacted than that many people lost their lives because we didn’t do enough,” Cheever replies.  Set pieces and dramatic press conference scenes like this one seemed a critical part of any disaster movie. Now, we see them almost everyday when the coronavirus task force briefs the nation. For decades, these films have thrilled theatergoers with an invisible enemy, the stark reality of an apocalyptic human-versus-nature, us-versus-it conflict. But the actual conflict in all of these films is actually something different: It’s us versus the bureaucracy. These are not so much films about disasters as they are films about government.  “Contagion is such a compelling film—life is unfolding very much like the movie,” says McNamara, who discovered West Nile Virus in the summer of 1999 while working as the chief pathologist at the Bronx Zoo, when crows started falling from the sky and into exhibits that August. “The speed with which it spread. How it spread.” Turns out, Hollywood has been offering Washington clues about how a pandemic might transpire for decades—and what the government should do to fight it. Here are just a few: Much of “Outbreak” revolves around the efforts of the protagonist (Col. Sam Daniels, played by Dustin Hoffman) to convince his boss, Brigadier General William Ford (played by Morgan Freeman) that the country faces a real threat from the fictional Motaba virus. Daniels spends much of the film battling with Army General Donald McClintock, played by Donald Sutherland, to get the word out about the dangers of the virus.  After Daniels’ ex-wife, CDC staffer Dr. Roberta “Robby” Keough—played by Rene Russo—treats a dying and infected patient, she laments not getting a CDC advisory out about the virus faster. The CDC staffers’ efforts were blocked by her superiors. “I should’ve forced the alert,” the doctor says, explaining Motaba’s deadly effects. “Christ, Sam. I opened this guy up,” she tells her ex. “Looked like a bomb went off inside. His pancreas, liver, kidney, spleen—all the organs were liquified. Christ, I should’ve forced the alert.” In “Contagion,” weeks into the outbreak of MEV-1, Dr. Sanjay Gupta (played by himself) asks CDC Administrator Cheever how many people have died from the disease during a cable television appearance. The answer, Cheever admits, was “very difficult” to know exact numbers because reporting varied by state. “There are 50 different states in this country, which means there are 50 different health departments. Followed by 50 different protocols.” And in the final episode of “The Hot Zone,” a dispute between an Ebola researcher and the head of the CDC almost derails efforts to get to the bottom of the Reston, Virginia, Ebola outbreak.  “The guy hates my guts,” Walter said of the CDC official Trevor Rhodes (James D’Arcy). “I’m never going to convince him to help.”  “You need to bury whatever happened between you two, Carter. You got no choice.” The messages of all these films—infighting and turf battles make things worse—felt apt for the ongoing feud between Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is a branch of HHS that operates independently. “A series of incidents over the past 120 days suggest basic communication and coordination between CMS and HHS is lacking, thereby jeopardizing HHS’ mission and undermining public trust,” HHS chief information officer Jose Arrieta wrote a recent memo. The latest incident? On February 23, HHS’ email system crashed, causing vital messages about the emergency coronavirus funding package to be delayed for up to 11 hours. The cause: Verma’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had failed to brief HHS leaders about a test that would send thousands of messages through the system. The outage slowed the administration’s response to the deadly outbreak.  In the six-part National Geographic mini-series “The Hot Zone,” based on the 1994 non-fiction book by Richard Preston, Wade Carter, a fictionalized reclusive Ebola expert who studied the virus in the field, is frustrated that more senior officials aren’t taking the threat of Ebola on American soil more seriously. Carter tells Army Col. Nancy Jaax (played by Julianna Margulies), a veterinarian who helped contain Ebola-infected monkeys from the Philippines: “Did I want this? Never. Now it’s here. Would it be good for the Oval Office to be pissing its pants about this now? You bet.”  But by the end of the series, after the scientists ultimately contained an Ebola outbreak in Reston, Virginia, there seems to be little appetite from public policymakers to take the threat of an epidemic seriously. We see a flyover shot of Capitol Hill. In a nameless committee room, the deputy secretary of the National Institutes of Health asks Jaax: “So no one died?”  “That’s correct, Mr. Chairman,” Jaax says. “But four people tested positive for the Ebola virus.  “And 172 people were tested and came up negative,” the deputy secretary responded, unperturbed.  The warning was clear: When scientists are worried, people should listen. And yet, not more than a week ago, President Donald Trump and some Republican members of Congress, along with conservative television hosts, were saying that journalists and Democrats were overplaying the threat of the coronavirus. Now some of those pols who thought it was no big deal are getting tested for COVID-19 themselves.  In “The Hot Zone,” Jaax’s husband, Noah Emmerich’s Lt. Col. Jerry Jaax, makes a plea: “It’s no secret the CDC needs more funding for research and development”—meaning that the CDC was caught somewhat flat-footed by the outbreak in Reston.  But back in real life, just last week, even as coronavirus was spreading in the United States, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought defended the Trump administration’s proposed $35 million cut to the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund, designed for use by the CDC.  Rep. Matt Cartwright, the Democratic member from Pennsylvania, bristled at the cuts in a hearing with Vought. “The question is today, as we sit here and we know about coronavirus and the impact it’s taking on the people of the world and the economies of the world and the stock market and everything, as you sit here today, are you ready to take that back?” In none of the virus movies I watched do we see the U.S. president. He or she is often one of the least important characters. In “Contagion,” he’s moved underground. In “Outbreak,” we only see the chief of staff, talking White House officials through the ethics of bombing a California town, executing all of its citizens in order to contain Mataba. Instead, the most important characters—the ones who do the talking—are the public health officials, virologists, researchers and frontline healthcare workers. In the movies, scientists always offer a clear explanation and as much information as they have to concerned citizens. Politicians would only get in the way. President Donald Trump didn’t get the memo. His statements about coronavirus have been perplexing and counterproductive. He said we have it “under control.” He compared it to the flu. He told people with the virus to go to work. He suggested the virus would “disappear.” Then he declared a national emergency. In contrast, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, a global health official at the State Department who is now White House coronavirus response coordinator, are lucid, calm presenters of information—perhaps the administration’s most credible spokespeople. If this were a Hollywood movie, those two would have been doing most of the talking from the beginning.  Bryan Cranston, who plays Rear Admiral Lyle Haggerty in “Contagion,” alludes to a congressman who is at risk of infecting his fellow members of Congress with MEV-1. “There’s a sick congressman from Illinois in D.C.,” Haggerty says. “He was in Chicago over the holiday. They are using the pod to fly him home, and then they are closing Midway and O’Hare. The governor there is calling out the national guard. They are setting up roadblocks. They are shutting down the board of trade, public transportation. Even the Teamsters are pulling their drivers off the road.”  Any policymaker who watched that scene and connected the dots wouldn’t have been able to escape the realization that in the event of a pandemic, it would be important for Congress to have a way of working remotely. This week, several representatives and senators directed some staffers to work from home. Still, members of Congress, many of whom are at risk of higher mortality rates given their average age—57.8 years in the House and 61.8 years in the Senate— don’t have an established way to conduct their business remotely. The Wolfgang Petersen film “Outbreak” is perhaps the least subtle of the group of films. A lab clinician infected with Motaba sees a movie with his girlfriend. As a result, the entire town of Cedar Creek, California—population 2,600—is nearly bombed with the “the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in our arsenal” by the U.S. government to contain the spread of the virus.  When Daniels and Keough survey the infected at a makeshift hospital in Cedar Creek, Keough remarks: “So many—so fast.”  “Apparently they all gathered at a movie theater,” Daniels replies.  In “Contagion,” the CDC administrator urges social distancing and not shaking hands as the best advice for controlling the spread of MEV-1. We see empty gyms and open-floor plan offices. “Right now, our best defense has been social distancing,” Fishburne’s Cheever, the CDC director, tells Dr. Sanjay Gutpa in a cable television studio. “No handshaking. Staying home when you are sick. Washing your hands frequently.”  The idea for the scene came from Lipkin, the Columbia University epidemiologist who told the film’s writer, Scott Z. Burns, that he would serve as a technical adviser on the movie if he agreed to make it as scientifically accurate a film as possible.  In the film’s emotional denouement, Cheever visits the home of one the CDC’s janitors to deliver a vaccine, where he explains to the janitor’s son the origins of the handshake. (The scene was “designed” to disclose the history of the handshake,” Lipkin told me in an interview earlier this week.) “Do you know where this comes from? Shaking hands?” he asks the boy, after delivering the vaccine by pushing a swab up his nostril. “It was a way of showing a stranger you weren’t carrying a weapon in the old days.”  These days, we are all presumed to be armed and dangerous.",What I Learned About Coronavirus From Binge-watching 10 Hours of Virus Movies,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/21/pandemic-movies-coronavirus-140043,politico
"While Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) sought on Friday to explain sales of stock made at a time when they were reassuring the public about the coronavirus threat, they weren’t the only elected officials to buy and sell stocks at key moments in the unfolding crisis. A POLITICO review of stock sales and purchases reported by members of Congress and senior aides found that while none had engaged in sales of the magnitude of Burr and Loeffler, several had traded shares at times or in industries that bore a relationship to the coronavirus threat. Previously unreported lawmakers who sold assets in the weeks leading up to the market crash include Rep. Susan Davis (D-Calif.), who unloaded thousands of dollars of stock in Alaska Air and Royal Caribbean cruises. A senior aide to Sen. Mitch McConnell made a mid-January purchase of Moderna, Inc., a biotechnology company that had four days earlier announced it would begin developing a coronavirus vaccine. And an aide to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sold off stock in companies including Delta Airlines in late January and later bought stock in Clorox, Inc., which makes bleach and sanitary wipes. The trades show that -- as much of the public was blindsided by both the pandemic and the economic meltdown over the last two weeks -- a number of lawmakers, aides and their brokers helping manage their portfolios adjusted their investments. Lawmakers in both chambers were being briefed via both classified and non-classified meetings about the coronavirus in late January and February, giving people on Capitol Hill a closer look at how the coming pandemic might shape their lives and finances that much of the country was lacking. “The reality is that if you work on the Hill, or you work in government, you have access to information that the public doesn't have or, if they have it, they can’t always see the signal through the noise,” said Meredith McGehee, executive director of the watchdog group Issue One. “If you’re on the HELP Committee, you’re going to grasp threats much faster than the general public. You see things much more clearly.” Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Friday called for a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into his trades amid an uproar over reports that he had sought to safeguard his portfolio against the looming pandemic even as he assured the public all was well. Burr, who had been present for a classified briefing on the outbreak in late January, wrote an op-ed declaring the U.S. “better prepared than ever before” to face down the virus on Feb. 7 -- six days before unloading at least $628,000 of his own stock as the market was peaking.  The North Carolina Republican is one of several senators, including Loeffler, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sen. James Inhofe (R.-Okla.) and Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who sold stock in late January and early February as the Senate was ramping up coronavirus briefings. It’s illegal for lawmakers and aides to trade stocks based on private information. But they are allowed to buy and sell shares based on public information they absorb on Capitol Hill so long as they disclose those trades within 30 days. That permissive approach to buying and selling stocks -- the executive branch has much stricter rules -- has drawn criticism from watchdogs who argue the freedom to trade isn’t as important as the need for the public to trust Congress to act only on its behalf. Davis, the 10-term California Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services and Education and Labor Committees, unloaded stock on Feb. 11 in the airline and cruise industries, two sectors that have since been ground to a halt by the pandemic nearly two weeks before the market tanked. Davis’ spokesman said she has a “third party handling her portfolio and does not play a role in the purchase or sale of her stocks.” Other members stand to make money off companies working to combat the disease. Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.) purchased between $1,001 and $15,000 of stock in the pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc., on Feb. 27, the day the company released a statement saying it had donated one of its antiviral drugs to China as an experimental option for treating the coronavirus and that it was exploring a research collaboration on potential treatment options.  Wittman’s office said he “does not have any involvement in investment decisions for his financial portfolio” and noted that AbbVie shares have since lost value. Still others were able to move their money to safe havens ahead of the general public. On Jan. 29, the day he and others were briefed on the coronavirus, Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) sold between $500,001 and $1 million in Butte-Glenn municipal bonds. He and his wife moved over $2 million from local government bonds to U.S. Treasury notes, considered a port in the storm amid market turbulence, between Jan. 27 and Jan. 29. The muni bond market is currently facing strong headwinds. Peters’ office said he and his wife “sold one set of government bonds and bought other government bonds” and said the suggestion that it was linked to the virus briefing is “out of bounds.” Aides, who sometimes spend years working alongside their bosses on Capitol Hill and can play as much a role in shaping the response to a crisis as their bosses, also bought and sold stocks in January and February. Scott Sloofman, a top communications aide in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office, purchased stock in a company that could wind up being instrumental in the fight against the coronavirus in late January: Moderna, Inc., which is now testing the first vaccine for the disease in Washington state. Sloofman purchased the stock on Jan. 28, one week after Moderna, Inc. announced it was collaborating with the federal government to develop the vaccine. The company’s stock rose in the days since, at some points more than 20 percent. The purchase was listed as between $1,001 and $15,000 in value. A Senate aide familiar with the trade said Sloofman purchased just under $1,400 in stock. He bought the stock two weeks after seeing a CNBC segment featuring Moderna’s CEO discussing plans to develop new medications on Jan. 15, the aide said, and Sloofman does not focus on health care or national security policymaking for his job. Sarah Holmes, New Hampshire-based state director to New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and a longtime aide to the senator, sold between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock in Delta Airlines on Jan. 24, as lawmakers were beginning to be clued into the forthcoming crisis.  Holmes traded out two stocks a week later, on Jan. 29, then on Feb. 27 made two purchases that could prove advantageous in the weeks ahead: Holmes purchased between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in each of two more companies, the pharmaceutical company Gilead, Inc. -- which makes remdesivir, a drug that is currently being tested to treat coronavirus -- and wipe manufacturer Clorox. The trades were made in a joint account, Shaheen spokesman Ryan Nickel said, and ""were made at the complete discretion of her broker with no input from Sarah or her husband.""  Additionally, the sale of the Delta stock on Jan. 24 was made prior to the classified Jan. 24 briefing for senators, Nickel said, at 9:30 a.m., and ""neither Senator Shaheen nor any of her staff were present for the classified briefing on Jan. 24."" Holmes does not have a security clearance and has complied with disclosure requirements, Nickel added. Though there is no current evidence that any of these elected officials or aides violated the law, there are several different bodies that could investigate lawmakers and aides for trading stocks. In addition to the ethics committees on Capitol Hill, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have the authority to launch probes of their own.  Burr and other lawmakers’ trades may be enough to spur a probe from the federal government, said Kevin Muhlendorf, a former investigator at the Department of Justice and SEC. “My gut on this is that based on the trading and the publicity, it’s highly likely that there will be some investigations by DOJ,"" said Muhlendorf.

"Mike Pence and his wife will be tested for coronavirus on Saturday afternoon, a day after one of the vice president's staffers tested positive for the infection.  Pence said here was ""no reason to believe"" he or his wife, Karen Pence, were exposed to the virus. But he said he will get tested because of his sensitive role in the Trump administration. Pence made the comments at a Saturday afternoon press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic alongside President Donald Trump.  ""We've done all contact tracing and while the White House doctor has indicated that he has no reason to believe that I was exposed and no need to be tested, given the unique position that I have as vice president and as the leader of the White House coronavirus task force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon,"" Pence said.  The White House learned on Friday that a member of Pence's staff had tested positive for the coronavirus. Pence said the staffer ""had mild cold-like symptoms"" for about a day and a half but is ""doing well."" ""He has not been to the White House since Monday,"" Pence added. ""Neither the president nor I had direct contact with that staff person."" Trump took a test for the coronavirus last week, which the White House said was negative.  During his remarks on Saturday, Pence said 195,000 Americans have been tested for the coronavirus, a total that does not include tests done at county hospitals or health care labs. Of those tests, 19,343 came back positive, Pence said. Both numbers are expected to jump in the coming days as testing becomes more available. Almost 300 people in the U.S. have died form the disease thus far, according to researchers.  In an effort to slow the number of new coronavirus cases, the Trump administration has urged people to avoid groups larger than 10 people. Many theaters, restaurants, theme parks have shuttered and millions of people have shifted to remote work if possible. Churches and other places of worship have also taken their services online. Pence urged church-goers to continue donating to religious institutions, regardless of whether they can attend in person.  ""One thing the president and I promised was to remind people that on the weekends that you're not in the pews, it's still a good — it's still a good idea to, if you can, to go ahead and make that donation.

"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- As Florida officials move to expel the hundreds of thousands of spring-breakers who ignored calls for social distancing, public-health specialists are nervously wondering what will happen once the party’s over. For much of this week, revelers continued to cram four and five to a hotel room, swarm beaches over hundreds of miles of coastline, and then gather shoulder-to-shoulder in bars and clubs – almost a model process for spreading contagious diseases.  Now, with their campuses likely shuttered, most spring breakers will return to hometowns across the country where any exposure to coronavirus could set off a contagion, public-health experts warned. They called for greater vigilance in those communities and sharply criticized Florida authorities for their slowness in closing beaches and nightspots. “What is happening in Florida with spring break partying-on by students oblivious to the epidemiological implications of their actions is nothing short of tragic,” wrote Gregg Gonsalves, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, in an email. “While many of us have been hunkering down to try to break the chains of infection in our communities, these young people have decided the pleasures of the moment are worth bring back the coronavirus to their friends and family.”  Justin Lessler, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the crush of swimsuit-clad students consuming large amounts of alcohol could create so-called “super-spreading events” that worsen the pandemic. “The students who are going and partying at spring break potentially are feeding into a world where they are stuck in their houses for weeks on end later on,” he said. “So I think they should keep that in mind."" There is some precedent for resort communities being slow to wake up to epidemics. The Austrian village of Ischgl, an Alpine ski destination and party hotspot, was slow to close down its establishments even as other nations issued travel warnings of potential coronavirus exposure. Thousands of revelers returning from vacations in Ischgl spread infections across much of Scandinavia. On Tuesday, Norway said 40 percent of its then-1,400 infections were traced to Ischgl. The outbreak has prompted accusations that authorities there acted too slowly out of a fear of harming the local tourist economy. Unlike other states, Florida did not initially impose strict controls on crowds and left it up to local officials to take action.  On Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered bars and nightclubs to close for 30 days and directed restaurants to cut their seating capacity by half. That same day he said that beaches could remain open but that groups of more than 10 people would not be allowed in one place. The edict wasn’t enforced. Aerial pictures of hundreds of thousands of beachgoers hit the national airwaves and shocked people in other states where even major thoroughfares were empty. Forced to explain his decision, DeSantis said he did not want to do a statewide order because there were places where the virus had not yet spread. People were on “edge,” he said, and he wanted them to be able to go outside. Some local officials stepped in. Those in Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Naples and Clearwater moved to shut their beaches down. On Friday, DeSantis ordered restaurants to shut their doors, except for takeout and delivery. He told gyms to shutter and closed the beaches and other “non-essential” businesses in Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach at the urging of local officials. This action came a day after Miami officials closed many businesses. Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber told POLITICO on Friday that the city is finally getting spring breakers to leave after a month of revelry. Gelber ordered beaches shut on Thursday, and posted photos of the empty sandscape on Facebook on Friday.  Hotels will “substantially close” by Monday evening, Gelber announced in a late-Friday tweet. Gelber predicted the measures would reduce the transmission of coronavirus but, at this point, he didn’t know how much. Florida spring break went on for weeks before anyone took action, when the virus seemed less threatening.  “This is about risk management,” Gelber said. “It might have been too late a month ago, frankly.” Miami Beach spokesperson Melissa Berthier said there have been no confirmed spring break coronavirus cases reported in the city. But Hansel Tookes, a public-health physician specializing in infectious diseases at University of Miami’s medical school, said no one knows how much the coronavirus has spread among spring breakers because of a lack of testing. Had there been enough tests, the students could have gone to clinics, and the sick ones could have isolated themselves in Florida before going home. “If there was testing, they could be isolated in say, a hotel or a place where they could remain alone until they were no longer infectious,” he said. “Younger people have more social interactions. There’s more transmission amongst them. Most people are infectious before they are symptomatic.” Indeed, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin have found that the virus also spreads quickly even among people who are asymptomatic. Ten percent of patients are infected by someone who has no symptoms. So far, there’s no sign of a spring break surge in Florida's safety net hospitals, which would potentially be more likely to take in a struggling spring breaker. But It’s also too early. Infected Florida spring breakers are still incubating the illness, spreading the disease. And, state officials don’t know if there will be a surge in other parts of the country because they’re not tracking anyone who has left Florida without symptoms.  “There’s the strong possibility that we could start to see cases popping up after the incubation period. And if it’s not the spring breakers, their parents and grandparents are at high risk as well,” said Nitesh Paryani, an oncologist in Lakeland, who said his cancer specialty doesn't mean anything amid the public health crisis. “Everybody is treating coronavirus, whether we want to or not. All physicians are being pulled into this fight. It’s an all hands on deck situation.” Ironically, the risk of returning spring breakers carrying the virus has already manifested itself in Florida. In the city of Gainesville, home to the University of Florida, four students have tested positive. One of the students had returned from Portugal while on spring break, according to local media. The Gainesville Sun reported that one student was a dentistry student who worked in a clinic after returning. The revelation that there was positive tests among university students played into the university system’s decision to scrap in-person classes for the rest of the semester. Initially, schools planned to delay opening campuses after spring break and resume classes in early April. DeSantis admonished university students this week for returning to fraternity houses to party instead of going home. Florida State University President John Thrasher, whose college was on spring break this past week, said that he is hopeful that many of the school’s 41,000 plus students will stay away, even those who live off-campus locally. “We are doing everything we can to discourage them from going back,” Thrasher said. But while Florida schools contribute to the spring break crowds, students also stream in from the rest of the South and even the Midwest. And it’s not quite clear how many came to the state – and where they are going now that the bars, restaurants and many of the beaches have shut down. “I would think it next to impossible to track that many people and potential exposures,” said Craig Fugate, the former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency who also led Florida’s emergency management agency when the state dealt with back-to-back hurricanes. “This may end up being tracked by spring breakers if they get sick here or once they get home and working backwards.” Visit Florida, the state’s tourism marketing arm, does not figures for this year, but says that more than 32 million visitors come to the state in March through May. An average of 2.7 million students come to Florida each year, the group estimates.  DeSantis acknowledged Thursday — at the opening of a South Florida mobile testing site — the unintended consequences of a March 11 directive that he and the State University System Board of Governors worked together on. They told students to delay returning to campus from spring break for two weeks.  “We were thinking, don’t come back yet,” DeSantis said. “Instead, they all went back, and they were drinking at the bars every night.” Despite the clear risks, experts said that several factors might mitigate the threat posed by the spring breakers. “It certainly has the potential to cause spread, but it may not be as dramatic as some people might think,"" said Lessler, the Johns Hopkins professor. Young people are more likely to be asymptomatic, and might therefore be less contagious, he said. Lessler also cited the short duration of spring break, which lasts about a week for most revelers. The generation time of the virus ranges from four to eight days, weighted towards the higher end, he said. That means that infected spring breakers could spread the virus to one other person, but there might not be enough time to pass the virus on again before heading home.  Still, all public-health officials who were interviewed warned that returning spring breakers could easily bring the virus to new parts of the country, as the disease continues its relentless spread. “Students on spring break are likely to introduce [coronavirus] into communities that have not yet been exposed to the virus, especially in quieter less well-connected parts of the country,” said William Hanage, professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in an emailed statement. “However this does not change the fact that the virus is well established and community transmission is widespread. Once this has happened, limits on travel become much less important.”",Will spring breakers become super-spreaders?,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/spring-breakers-coronavirus-140609,politico
"The Justice Department has quietly asked Congress for the ability to ask chief judges to detain people indefinitely without trial during emergencies — part of a push for new powers that comes as the coronavirus spreads through the United States. Documents reviewed by POLITICO detail the department’s requests to lawmakers on a host of topics, including the statute of limitations, asylum and the way court hearings are conducted. POLITICO also reviewed and previously reported on documents seeking the authority to extend deadlines on merger reviews and prosecutions. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the documents. The move has tapped into a broader fear among civil liberties advocates and Donald Trump’s critics — that the president will use a moment of crisis to push for controversial policy changes. Already, he has cited the pandemic as a reason for heightening border restrictions and restricting asylum claims. He has also pushed for further tax cuts as the economy withers, arguing that it would soften the financial blow to Americans. And even without policy changes, Trump has vast emergency powers that he could legally deploy right now to try and slow the coronavirus outbreak. The DOJ requests — which are unlikely to make it through a Democratic-led House — span several stages of the legal process, from initial arrest to how cases are processed and investigated. In one of the documents, the department proposed that Congress grant the attorney general power to ask the chief judge of any district court to pause court proceedings “whenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situation.”  The proposal would also grant those top judges broad authority to pause court proceedings during emergencies. It would apply to “any statutes or rules of procedure otherwise affecting pre-arrest, post-arrest, pre-trial, trial, and post-trial procedures in criminal and juvenile proceedings and all civil process and proceedings,” according to draft legislative language the department shared with Congress. In making the case for the change, the DOJ document wrote that individual judges can currently pause proceedings during emergencies, but that their proposal would make sure all judges in any particular district could handle emergencies “in a consistent manner.”  The request raised eyebrows because of its potential implications for habeas corpus –– the constitutional right to appear before a judge after arrest and seek release. “Not only would it be a violation of that, but it says ‘affecting pre-arrest,’” said Norman L. Reimer, the executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. “So that means you could be arrested and never brought before a judge until they decide that the emergency or the civil disobedience is over. I find it absolutely terrifying. Especially in a time of emergency, we should be very careful about granting new powers to the government.” Reimer said the possibility of chief judges suspending all court rules during an emergency without a clear end in sight was deeply disturbing. “That is something that should not happen in a democracy,” he said. The department also asked Congress to pause the statute of limitations for criminal investigations and civil proceedings during national emergencies, “and for one year following the end of the national emergency,” according to the draft legislative text. Trump recently declared the coronavirus crisis a national emergency.  Another controversial request: The department is looking to change the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in some cases to expand the use of videoconference hearings, and to let some of those hearings happen without defendants’ consent, according to the draft legislative text. “Video teleconferencing may be used to conduct an appearance under this rule,” read a draft of potential new language for Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(f), crossing out the phrase “if the defendant consents.”  “Video teleconferencing may be used to arraign a defendant,” read draft text of rule 10(c), again striking out the phrase “if the defendant consents.” Reimer said forcing people to have hearings over video rather than in person would threaten civil liberties. “If it were with the consent of the accused person it would be fine,” he said. “But if it’s not with the consent of the accused person, it’s a terrible road to go down. We have a right to public trials. People have a right to be present in court.” The department also wants Congress to change the law to explicitly say that people with Covid-19 –– the illness caused by the novel coronavirus –– are not included among those who may apply for asylum. And the department asked for the same change regarding people who are “subject to a presidential proclamation suspending and limiting the entry of aliens into the United States,” according to the draft legislative language. Layli Miller-Munro, the CEO of the Tahirih Justice Center, which advocates for women and girls fleeing violence, said the language would block anyone on a presidential travel ban list from seeking asylum in the U.S. “I think it’s a humanitarian tragedy that fails to recognize that vulnerable people from those countries are among the most persecuted and that protecting them is exactly what the refugee convention was designed to do,” she said. The asylum request comes as the Trump administration on Friday said that it would begin denying entry to all migrants illegally crossing the U.S. southern border, including those seeking asylum. “I hope we come out of this with a sense of oneness, interconnectedness,” Miller-Munro said of the coronavirus pandemic. “Borders can’t protect us. Viruses do not care.”",DOJ seeks new emergency powers amid coronavirus pandemic,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023,politico
"One of Kelly Loeffler’s most appealing traits to Republicans who embraced her for a coveted Senate appointment — her ability to self-fund a competitive election this fall through immense wealth — is suddenly looking like a serious liability for her and the GOP. Loeffler’s rivals in a special election pounced on revelations that the recently appointed senator dumped millions of dollars in stocks after a classified Covid-19 briefing in January — damaging her bid against a formidable GOP opponent in Rep. Doug Collins, a close ally of President Donald Trump. Collins is seizing on the stock trades by Loeffler, who’s married to the head of the New York Stock Exchange. Collins told POLITICO in an interview Friday that Loeffler needs “to explain to Georgians and Americans what happened here, and why it happened.” “To have sold and then bought stocks that benefit them personally is just very, very frustrating,” Collins said. ""And it's very disheartening for those of us who have been in public service."" “This is just not something you want to see, being perceived as profiting off a crisis,” Collins added, though he did not call on her to resign or face an Senate Ethics Committee investigation. Loeffler denied doing anything inappropriate, saying the stocks were sold by third-party financial advisers, and that she did not use information from private briefings about the coronavirus to benefit herself financially. She reported selling between nearly $1.3 million and $3.1 million worth of stocks owned jointly with her husband between late January and mid-February. She also reported jointly purchasing between $200,000 and $500,000 of stock in two technology companies. “I don't direct the activity. I'm not involved in the investment decisions,” Loeffler said in an interview on CNBC Friday afternoon. “I made that decision many years ago for the position I had in financial services — that I would not get involved in investment decisions."" The Georgia special election is already perilous for Republicans, given that it is an all-party contest that will go to a January runoff if no candidate receives a majority in November — a likely outcome given the crowd of contenders. Three Democrats are in the race currently: Rev. Raphael Warnock; former U.S. Attorney Ed Tarver; and Matt Lieberman, son of former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.). Warnock has endorsements from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Stacey Abrams, the former gubernatorial candidate. Loeffler has the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Gov. Brian Kemp, who appointed her to the seat to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned late last year due to health concerns. But Collins also has some significant allies in the state, and he is running an insurgent campaign attempting to outflank Loeffler as an ally to Trump, who has not taken sides in the race. One Georgia Republican operative, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said Loeffler was in a “perilous” political situation caused by the revelations about her stocks specifically because, in the all-party November contest, another Republican was on the ballot. “They can't just appeal to partisan loyalties and say, 'Don't believe these storylines. This is a media attack,'” the operative said. “People have somewhere else to go if they're uncertain about her, and that's a really dangerous place to be.” The accusations of self-dealing while the U.S. copes with the unprecedented coronavirus crisis — combined with reports that other senators, including Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), also sold off stocks before the market crashed — represent a major early test for Loeffler, a first-time political candidate on whom Republicans are counting to keep a contested Senate seat in GOP hands as Democrats mount a charge to retake the chamber in this year's elections. Some Democrats immediately called for Loeffler's resignation following the initial report from The Daily Beast about the transactions, which came in the days and weeks following a private briefing for senators on the coronavirus. Others called for an investigation by the Ethics Committee. Lieberman said in a statement that Loeffler’s actions were “incredibly disappointing and shameful.” Warnock, national Democrats' preferred candidate in the race, called the transactions “deeply disappointing” and said they should be investigated. Tarver, the former U.S. attorney, said Loeffler should resign. “This is more than just poor judgment,” Tarver said. “This is downright wrong and everything that’s wrong with Washington. We’re in the middle of a pandemic the likes of which many of us having never seen. We need honest leadership in Washington, and it’s clear we’re not getting that with Sen. Loeffler.” Stephen Lawson, a spokesperson for her campaign, said Loeffler ""has done absolutely nothing wrong"" and hit both Collins and Democrats for ""spending their time launching baseless attacks"" against the senator. Burr, who also faced swift condemnation for his sale of stocks in recent weeks, asked the Ethics Committee to review the matter. Loeffler, who did multiple cable news interviews Friday to push back on the reports, said in the appearance on CNBC that she was “happy to answer any and all questions and would submit to whatever review is needed,” but she has not called on the Ethics Committee to look into the matter. “I think we have to make sure that all the rules and laws are followed,” Loeffler said on CNBC. “I think they are being followed, at least in my case I know they are. I can't speak for other people. But that's certainly what securities laws are for. That's what ethics rules are for. That's what I'm very confident we are complying with, have always complied with and will continue to do.""",Loeffler stock trades roil Georgia special election,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/loeffler-stock-trades-roil-georgia-special-election-140088,politico
"The White House Correspondents’ Association is postponing its giant dinner scheduled for late April, but still hopes to hold the annual event this summer or fall if the coronavirus threat abates.  The WHCD joins a long list of prominent events that have been postponed or scrapped altogether in light of the coronavirus pandemic, which has sickened thousands across the globe and prompted calls for widespread “social distancing” in affected areas. In the U.S., where Trump has declared the pandemic a national emergency, the outbreak has shuttered schools across the country, prompted the suspension of major sports leagues’ entire seasons, postponed music festivals and shut down American landmarks like the U.S. Capitol, Broadway and Disneyland. Coronavirus has also thrown a wrench into the 2020 elections, with presidential campaigns ditching in-person rallies and at least one state moving to delay its primary elections.  The featured entertainment for this year’s iteration of the WHCA gala — the marquee event of a spring weekend around which a small ecosystem of elite gatherings has sprung — would have been Saturday Night Live cast member Kenan Thompson and comedian Hasan Minhaj. The inclusion of comedy headliners at the dinner marked a return to historical precedent. The dinner, which celebrates political journalism by handing out awards and scholarships, has traditionally featured a comedy act as well as remarks from the sitting president. But after a sharply criticized set from comedian Michelle Wolf at the 2018 dinner, the WCHA opted for less controversial entertainment by picking historian Ron Chernow to serve as the night’s featured speaker.  President Donald Trump has, in keeping with his disruption of a laundry list of other presidential norms, refused to attend the dinner throughout his tenure in office. Instead, Trump has counter-programmed the glitzy event with political rallies in swing states that he won in the 2016 election. Last year, the president ordered administration officials to boycott the dinner. But he had not announced whether he planned to attend this year’s dinner.",White House Correspondents' Association postpones annual dinner,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/white-house-correspondents-association-postpones-2020-dinner-140431,politico
"Senate negotiators and the White House on Saturday are scrambling to reach an accord on a stimulus package that’s likely to exceed $1 trillion, staring down an aggressive timeline to deliver relief amid the rapidly worsening coronavirus outbreak. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has set a deadline of Saturday afternoon for both sides to settle on the terms of the legislation, after failing to do so after more than 12 hours of talks on Friday, splitting on key issues such as how to get financial help directly to Americans hurt by the crisis. “We’re getting closer and closer to an agreement,” McConnell told reporters Saturday. “I think we’re clearly going to get there.“ Senate Republicans tried to break the impasse on Saturday morning, delivering their latest bid to Democrats on the biggest remaining sticking point: Unemployment insurance. The two sides huddled separately as Republicans and White House officials await the next steps from Democrats, who are seeking longer-term benefits for furloughed workers, rather than direct payments as GOP leaders have pushed. ""I had a very good conversation with [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin and we are making good progress on many of the issues Democrats care about,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Saturday.  Mnuchin declined to comment on the talks, but told reporters that he's also spoken with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, and plans to speak with Speaker Nancy Pelosi later in the day. Democrats would not disclose details of the GOP’s latest proposal, but said it would get the Senate closer to a deal. “I would say it’s a pretty good faith offer, but it’s not one that we can finally accept, we have to move it a little more, but we’re pretty close,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who is among the negotiators, told reporters. But the New Jersey Democrat wouldn’t commit to meeting the afternoon deadline to reaching a final agreement and producing legislative text. “This is going to be the largest — when it’s all concluded — relief package in history. So yes, speed is necessary, but getting this done right, so it actually has the effect that we want, is equally important,” Menendez said. As negotiations progress, the size and scope of the package appeared to steadily increase. The price tag of the legislation is now expected to exceed $1.3 trillion, according to National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow. The total size of the package, including loans from the federal government, would likely exceed 10 percent of GDP — roughly $2 trillion, he said. That would include a payroll tax holiday for small businesses.  McConnell is pushing hard for a deal, and GOP lawmakers and White House officials warn they will start drafting their own bill if no accord is reached with Democrats by Saturday afternoon. McConnell wants the normally slow-moving Senate to complete work on the rescue package by Monday. Among the outstanding issues are assistance for hospitals, a ""State Stabilization Fund,"" which would assist state governments with looming revenue shortfalls during the pandemic, and unemployment insurance. Democrats are pushing for workers to see their full wages compensated, while Republicans argue that the state agencies do not have the capacity to meet this demand. White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland said Saturday that there's been a ""lot of great progress on a bipartisan basis between Republicans and Democrats"" but acknowledged the differences on unemployment insurance.  ""We've discussed some of the technical challenges,"" Ueland said. ""I'm hopeful we understand more on the unemployment piece today."" Democrats are also calling for expanded paid sick leave. But so far there doesn't appear to be much appetite among Republicans for the idea.  The Senate pushed through the House's package earlier this week which included new paid sick leave provisions. While the Senate approved the measure in a 90-8 vote, McConnell had to convince his caucus to support it and vowed to address shortcomings in this new, third stimulus package. The discussions come after Senate Republicans introduced a $1 trillion package Thursday to salvage the economy by providing assistance to individuals, small businesses and industries. Under the GOP proposal, individuals and families would receive $1,200 and $2,400 in direct cash payments based on their income. But some Republicans, including Sens. Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Mitt Romney (Utah), say the proposal's structure — as written — penalizes lower income Americans who do not have a taxable income. Hawley has an amendment to address the issue and Senate Republican aides appear open to negotiating. In addition to the direct cash payments, Republicans are pushing for $300 billion in federally guaranteed loans to small businesses and $200 billion for loans to hard-hit industries. Aides are also discussing adding more money for eligible industries to the package. Senate Democrats are also calling for a ""Marshall Plan"" for hospitals to help prepare for a surge in cases due to the pandemic. Schumer and Pelosi (D-Calif.), who are working in lockstep on the negotiations, argue that the Republican proposal prioritizes businesses over workers. Republicans and the White House appear open to more hospital assistance.",Senate races to finish negotiations on massive coronavirus stimulus package,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/senate-coronavirus-stimulus-negotiations-140334,politico

"While Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) sought on Friday to explain sales of stock made at a time when they were reassuring the public about the coronavirus threat, they weren’t the only elected officials to buy and sell stocks at key moments in the unfolding crisis. A POLITICO review of stock sales and purchases reported by members of Congress and senior aides found that while none had engaged in sales of the magnitude of Burr and Loeffler, several had traded shares at times or in industries that bore a relationship to the coronavirus threat. Previously unreported lawmakers who sold assets in the weeks leading up to the market crash include Rep. Susan Davis (D-Calif.), who unloaded thousands of dollars of stock in Alaska Air and Royal Caribbean cruises. A senior aide to Sen. Mitch McConnell made a mid-January purchase of Moderna, Inc., a biotechnology company that had four days earlier announced it would begin developing a coronavirus vaccine. And an aide to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sold off stock in companies including Delta Airlines in late January and later bought stock in Clorox, Inc., which makes bleach and sanitary wipes. The trades show that -- as much of the public was blindsided by both the pandemic and the economic meltdown over the last two weeks -- a number of lawmakers, aides and their brokers helping manage their portfolios adjusted their investments. Lawmakers in both chambers were being briefed via both classified and non-classified meetings about the coronavirus in late January and February, giving people on Capitol Hill a closer look at how the coming pandemic might shape their lives and finances that much of the country was lacking. “The reality is that if you work on the Hill, or you work in government, you have access to information that the public doesn't have or, if they have it, they can’t always see the signal through the noise,” said Meredith McGehee, executive director of the watchdog group Issue One. “If you’re on the HELP Committee, you’re going to grasp threats much faster than the general public. You see things much more clearly.” Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Friday called for a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into his trades amid an uproar over reports that he had sought to safeguard his portfolio against the looming pandemic even as he assured the public all was well. Burr, who had been present for a classified briefing on the outbreak in late January, wrote an op-ed declaring the U.S. “better prepared than ever before” to face down the virus on Feb. 7 -- six days before unloading at least $628,000 of his own stock as the market was peaking.  The North Carolina Republican is one of several senators, including Loeffler, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sen. James Inhofe (R.-Okla.) and Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who sold stock in late January and early February as the Senate was ramping up coronavirus briefings. It’s illegal for lawmakers and aides to trade stocks based on private information. But they are allowed to buy and sell shares based on public information they absorb on Capitol Hill so long as they disclose those trades within 30 days. That permissive approach to buying and selling stocks -- the executive branch has much stricter rules -- has drawn criticism from watchdogs who argue the freedom to trade isn’t as important as the need for the public to trust Congress to act only on its behalf. Davis, the 10-term California Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services and Education and Labor Committees, unloaded stock on Feb. 11 in the airline and cruise industries, two sectors that have since been ground to a halt by the pandemic nearly two weeks before the market tanked. Davis’ spokesman said she has a “third party handling her portfolio and does not play a role in the purchase or sale of her stocks.” Other members stand to make money off companies working to combat the disease. Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.) purchased between $1,001 and $15,000 of stock in the pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc., on Feb. 27, the day the company released a statement saying it had donated one of its antiviral drugs to China as an experimental option for treating the coronavirus and that it was exploring a research collaboration on potential treatment options.  Wittman’s office said he “does not have any involvement in investment decisions for his financial portfolio” and noted that AbbVie shares have since lost value. The office later added that Wittman's initial AbbVie purchase was for $1,218. Still others were able to move their money to safe havens ahead of the general public. On Jan. 29, the day he and others were briefed on the coronavirus, Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) sold between $500,001 and $1 million in Butte-Glenn municipal bonds. He and his wife moved over $2 million from local government bonds to U.S. Treasury notes, considered a port in the storm amid market turbulence, between Jan. 27 and Jan. 29. The muni bond market is currently facing strong headwinds. Peters’ office said he and his wife “sold one set of government bonds and bought other government bonds” and said the suggestion that it was linked to the virus briefing is “out of bounds.” Aides, who sometimes spend years working alongside their bosses on Capitol Hill and can play as much a role in shaping the response to a crisis as their bosses, also bought and sold stocks in January and February. Scott Sloofman, a top communications aide in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office, purchased stock in a company that could wind up being instrumental in the fight against the coronavirus in late January: Moderna, Inc., which is now testing the first vaccine for the disease in Washington state. Sloofman purchased the stock on Jan. 28, one week after Moderna, Inc. announced it was collaborating with the federal government to develop the vaccine. The company’s stock rose in the days since, at some points more than 20 percent. The purchase was listed as between $1,001 and $15,000 in value. A Senate aide familiar with the trade said Sloofman purchased just under $1,400 in stock. He bought the stock two weeks after seeing a CNBC segment featuring Moderna’s CEO discussing plans to develop new medications on Jan. 15, the aide said, and Sloofman does not focus on health care or national security policymaking for his job. Sarah Holmes, New Hampshire-based state director to New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and a longtime aide to the senator, sold between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock in Delta Airlines on Jan. 24, as lawmakers were beginning to be clued into the forthcoming crisis.  Holmes traded out two stocks a week later, on Jan. 29, then on Feb. 27 made two purchases that could prove advantageous in the weeks ahead: Holmes purchased between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in each of two more companies, the pharmaceutical company Gilead, Inc. -- which makes remdesivir, a drug that is currently being tested to treat coronavirus -- and wipe manufacturer Clorox. The trades were made in a joint account, Shaheen spokesman Ryan Nickel said, and ""were made at the complete discretion of her broker with no input from Sarah or her husband.""  Additionally, the sale of the Delta stock on Jan. 24 was made prior to the classified Jan. 24 briefing for senators, Nickel said, at 9:30 a.m., and ""neither Senator Shaheen nor any of her staff were present for the classified briefing on Jan. 24."" Holmes does not have a security clearance and has complied with disclosure requirements, Nickel added. Though there is no current evidence that any of these elected officials or aides violated the law, there are several different bodies that could investigate lawmakers and aides for trading stocks. In addition to the ethics committees on Capitol Hill, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have the authority to launch probes of their own.  Burr and other lawmakers’ trades may be enough to spur a probe from the federal government, said Kevin Muhlendorf, a former investigator at the Department of Justice and SEC. “My gut on this is that based on the trading and the publicity, it’s highly likely that there will be some investigations by DOJ,"" said Muhlendorf.

"Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart spoke out Saturday about his battle with COVID-19 after testing positive for the coronavirus, saying he believes the “worst part"" has passed.  “It’s a tricky bug because just when I thought I was over it or I was pretty close to getting over it, the fever will come back,” the Florida Republican said during his first on-camera interview on NBC's ""Nightly News.""  Diaz-Belart, 58, recalled the symptoms he said “hit him like a ton of bricks” last Saturday after he voted on a coronavirus response bill on the House floor, describing a headache that quickly developed into a fever and cough.   “Now luckily, I have not had an issue breathing so I’ve never had a scary moment but obviously very, very unpleasant with headaches, with coughing, and with a pretty intense fever — all coming at the same time it seems,” he recounted.  Rep. Ben McAdams, 45, the second congressman who has tested positive for the coronavirus, detailed a similar experience.   “I’m feeling about as sick as I’ve been,” the Utah Democrat said during a CNN interview on Friday. “I got really labored breathing. I feel like I have a belt around my chest, really tight. When I cough, my muscles are so sore so I just feel pain every time I cough, which is frequently. I feel short of breath, and I have a fever of about 102. So, it’s pretty bad.”  Diaz-Balart said he has continued with his work while self-quarantining in Washington, D.C., but said there are constitutional questions that need to be answered before allowing fellow lawmakers to vote from home.   “I know that the leadership, House and Senate — bipartisan — they're looking at ways to make sure that they keep people safe and allow Congress to proceed, so we just got to make sure it's done right and it's done safely, but also that it's done constitutionally,” Diaz-Balart said.

"After months of minimizing the threat to the United States, President Donald Trump jumped feet-first into the coronavirus fight this week with vows of quick fixes to the testing problem, claims about potential cures, and efforts to rope in agencies that had inexplicably been excluded, like FEMA. The show of action played well in the White House briefing room and with the public, but has had a different impact behind the scenes. Health-agency officials and outside advisers to the administration, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described a chaotic situation in which leaders rushed to address presidential requests that sometimes seem to come on a whim while losing focus on longer-term challenges. Trump’s drive to announce unfinished initiatives created a “need to make good on half-baked promises,” said one senior official — who, like other Americans, learned about some initiatives only when the president announced them at the White House podium. For instance, no one in the White House had devised a national strategy for obtaining and distributing the necessary supplies in the likely months-long fight against the pandemic that lies ahead, said three people with knowledge of the planning efforts. Those supply-planning efforts are only now underway. “How is there not a national supply strategy yet?” asked one official involved in the effort, warning that the infamous shortage of coronavirus tests is set to be replicated with other shortages across the health system. “Hospitals are going to run out of basic commodities.” The U.S. health system already has been plagued by shortages of test-kit chemicals, swabs and personal protective equipment for health workers, problems that are set to worsen as coronavirus case numbers rise and demand spikes. A government effort to obtain replacement test swabs required the U.S. military this week to airlift the specialized swabs from a factory located in coronavirus-stricken Italy. Meanwhile, leaders in coronavirus hotspots like Seattle and New York City have effectively abandoned efforts to conduct broad testing on residents, instead urging them to stay home given the shortages — an acknowledgment that efforts to contain coronavirus have failed and they need to prioritize limited supplies. Local officials also are making unusual crowdsourcing appeals. “We need companies to be creative to supply the crucial gear our healthcare workers need. NY will pay a premium and offer funding,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted on Friday. “If you have any of these unused supplies, please email [email protected].” A sympathetic HHS staffer compared Cuomo’s plea to an Internet auction. “We’re facing a pandemic and the governor has to basically turn to eBay” for supplies, the staffer said. Trump has worked to tamp down concerns about insufficient tests and supplies, saying that the flurry of federal, state and local efforts will be sufficient. “If California can get a mask sooner than we can get it for them, through all of the things we're able to do, we'll end up with a big over-supply,” the president said at a press conference on Saturday. “At some point this is going away.” Spokespeople for the Trump administration defended its planning and coordination for the coronavirus outbreak. “We’ve been working since January with American manufacturers to prepare for responding to the outbreak and will continue to coordinate closely with private suppliers and our federal partners to ensure that resources are going where they’re needed,” an HHS spokesperson said. The White House said that Trump’s leadership had sparked an ""unprecedented collaboration"" of government and private industry to curb the virus’ spread and ramp up the response. “The president has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people and he is working around the clock to ensure we emerge from this crisis healthy, safe, and strong,” said spokesperson Judd Deere. Inside the Trump administration, officials are continuing to sort out which teams are responsible for elements of coronavirus response, part of an ever-shifting patchwork of alliances and strategy, while working to manage the president’s unpredictable requests. Five officials said that Trump had grown appropriately concerned about the coronavirus outbreak after weeks of ignoring or playing down the threat, but that the administration is now rushing to solve issues that could have been addressed months ago, like obtaining the necessary supplies for the nation’s emergency stockpile. Officials also are sniping over whether to institute even more aggressive actions to prevent coronavirus transmission. Health officials are calling for stricter measures that would keep more Americans at home, for longer, but policy officials warn that the resulting economic damage could cause other, long-lasting harms. The Federal Emergency Management Agency this week took over responsibilities that had rested with the Health and Human Services department, the latest attempt to get a handle on the worsening outbreak. “FEMA is now leading federal operations for #COVID19 on behalf of the White House,” administrator Pete Gaynor tweeted on Thursday night, as some projects like drive-through test sites shifted from the health department. The agency is also taking on a larger role handling supply and distribution issues, Gaynor and other officials said at Saturday’s briefing. “The tendency is to think of FEMA as a disaster management agency,” said Craig Fugate, who ran FEMA during the Obama administration and said he had no knowledge of the Trump administration’s strategy. “It’s actually an all-hazards agency… and FEMA could add structure, planning, location to the coronavirus response,” with its regional offices and staff with crisis-management experience. Some officials and outside advisers have questioned why FEMA had not been given more authority earlier in the response given the agency’s operational expertise in responding to disasters. Two individuals said that HHS Secretary Alex Azar had focused on protecting his leadership role, which has shrunk as Vice President Mike Pence took over the broader response and deputies whom Azar had originally sidelined — like Medicare chief Seema Verma and Surgeon General Jerome Adams — have emerged as key figures in White House strategy.  But a person familiar with HHS strategy said that Azar had pushed “weeks ago” for FEMA to be involved. The hold-up was instead linked to the federal response’s rotating leadership — as Pence abruptly took over for Azar at the end of February — and administration worries that states would be further confused over who was in charge. “Secretary Azar and HHS have been and continue to be wholly supportive of a whole-of-government approach and in particular the important role FEMA is playing in coordinating the federal government’s response to COVID-19,” an HHS spokesperson said. Meanwhile, a SWAT team of government officials and outside technocrats, backed by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, spent the week working around-the-clock to deliver the drive-through testing sites that Trump publicly promised, POLITICO first reported. But the focus on drive-through testing also creates a new problem — draining limited supplies and other resources that could be used for high-priority patients in hospitals. “It’s all short-term thinking right now,” said one official involved in the response.  “They’re desperate to expand testing — which is a good idea — but I don’t know whether the president, the vice president and others at the top understand the trade-offs,” added an adviser to the effort. “It feels like each of these problems is a mini-crisis being run by a mini-team in the government.” Trump’s own involvement has caused additional headaches. Health department officials were confused on Wednesday after Trump announced that an “exciting FDA announcement” was on the way — particularly because Food and Drug Administration officials had yet to greenlight new drugs that Trump sought to fight the virus, The Wall Street Journal reported.  While Trump did hold a Thursday press conference with FDA Commissioner Steve Hahn and other officials, the event largely rehashed existing policies and work that had already been announced. Trump on Friday also repeatedly made claims about an unproven coronavirus treatment, prompting infectious-disease scientist Anthony Fauci to try and walk back the claims from the White House podium. Meanwhile, the president has repeatedly touted unfinished projects, like announcing on March 13 a Google website that he said would help coordinate testing. But the actual site, which rolled out a week later, is instead a collection of information and links. Trump on Friday also claimed that General Motors has “openly stated” it would produce medical supplies. But GM has not publicly committed to producing more supplies, although the company is working with ventilator specialist Ventec to boost its production, according to a joint statement rushed out on Friday after Trump’s remarks. ""All options are on the table on how GM can help Ventec build more ventilators,"" a GM spokesperson said. The chaotic response also has trickled down to individual hospitals, clinics and doctors, which have struggled to get answers on supply chains and fought to protect their equipment. Sen. Bill Cassidy’s office reached out to the White House on Wednesday after learning that University Medical Center in Louisiana was informed that a new lab-testing machine, due to arrive on Monday, had instead been requisitioned by government officials for a “higher priority” coronavirus situation. “We thought the machine was a high priority in Louisiana given the fast rate that things were spreading,” said a spokesperson for Cassidy’s office, noting that the state has become a hotspot for coronavirus transmission. The White House later assured Cassidy’s office that the machine would go to Louisiana next week, as originally intended. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has spent weeks competing with states and hospitals to obtain medical supplies and quickly build up national reserves. “Every single governor across the country is looking for the exact same thing,” FEMA’s Gaynor said at Saturday’s White House press briefing, responding to questions about shortages. Some experts said the president would be better served by developing a national strategy to allocate limited resources to the neediest areas while obtaining new ones, say experts, noting that dozens of individual components in the health system are at risk of being quickly diminished in the initial crush of cases — from the intricate chemicals needed for tests to the basic supplies that could’ve been rapidly produced months ago. “We’re seeing a run on swabs,” said a former official, arguing that the Trump administration should have anticipated the worldwide demand for the specialized, low-cost swabs needed to do the testing. “How on Earth did we let this happen?” Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, listed off the supply shortages that already are plaguing hospitals. “They say they don’t have reagents for the diagnostic kits, they don’t have swabs for the kits, they don’t have the N95 masks, they’re running out of gowns and gloves,” said Inglesby, who’s called on the White House to overhaul its approach and assign specialists, such as the Pentagon’s Defense Logistics Agency, to solve the supply-chain problems. “I don't think we should see these as spot shortages that will soon be resolved with significant effort,” Inglesby added. “We will be using large amounts of these supplies for a long time. COVID will be with us for a long time — we need a long-term solution.” Meanwhile, Trump on Saturday was asked about “the plan” to contain coronavirus as the nation enters day 6 of the White House’s 15-day campaign to slow the virus’ spread, and specifically whether additional measures needed to be taken. The president declined to detail next steps, saying only that leaders would know more next week.  “We’ll have to see what the result is,” Trump said.",Short-term thinking plagues Trump’s coronavirus response,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/short-term-thinking-trump-coronavirus-response-140883,politico
"The Trump administration is considering whether to create a special enrollment period for Obamacare coverage because of the coronavirus emergency, a CMS spokesperson confirmed. A number of Democratic-leaning states that run their own health insurance marketplaces have recently reopened enrollment, encouraging uninsured residents to get covered amid the pandemic. Most states, however, use the federal marketplace overseen by the Trump administration, HealthCare.gov. Major health insurance lobbies on Friday said they would support reopening enrollment in Obamacare markets if the government covered anticipated losses, despite some initial reluctance. Some insurers feared getting saddled with huge costs if many coronavirus patients signed up for coverage. The insurer lobbies, America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, called on Congress this week to include funding in the upcoming coronavirus stimulus package to offset potential losses from covering more people. The Wall Street Journal first reported the administration was weighing a special enrollment period. A spokesperson for CMS, which oversees the insurance marketplaces, said people should also check HealthCare.gov to see if they already qualify for a special enrollment period because they lost their job or other circumstances.",Trump officials weigh reopening Obamacare enrollment over coronavirus,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/trump-administration-obamacare-coronavirus-140806,politico
"American citizens in Peru who are trying to head home in response to the coronavirus outbreak are being held there by a Peruvian government that first wants assurances thousands of Peruvian citizens will be able to return from the U.S., according to two sources familiar with the situation. Peru is in the process of shutting down all international travel, but thousands of Americans are believed to remain in the country. An U.S. official familiar with the situation said the Peruvian government is not allowing them to leave until the White House ensures thousands of Peruvians are given safe passage home. “The government of Peru is basically holding these Americans hostage,” the U.S. official said. “They want the U.S. to fill planes with Peruvians before they’ll let the planes land to pick up Americans. But they’re not ready or organized in the United States to gather their people up, and they don’t want to pay for the flight.“ One American stuck in the South American nation said he received similar information from the office of Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. Feinstein’s office did not respond to a request for comment. “[The State Department’s] planned repatriation flights have not yet been approved by the Peruvian government,” read an email from Feinstein’s office to the stranded Americans. “They are requesting reciprocal support for their own citizens to leave the United States.” The State Department said it flew a group of Americans home on Saturday, including “medically vulnerable” citizens and some Peace Corps volunteers and embassy personnel. But a spokesperson did not comment on whether the Peruvian government is preventing the rest from leaving. U.S. diplomats estimate a few thousand Americans remain in Peru, a spokesperson did not respond to a question about the number. Peruvian officials, meanwhile, say they are merely trying to figure out how best to get each nation’s residents home. ""We are actively engaging State Department officials to coordinate in a harmonic way the best way to carry out bringing Americans from Peru back to the U.S. and Peruvians in the U.S. back to Peru,"" said Rodolfo Pereira, press counselor for the Peruvian Embassy in Washington. ""What we are trying to set up is the best system to conduct that operation."" Pereira dismissed questions about tensions between the two sides, saying there are constant communications, including at high levels, and that much of what is being discussed is logistics. In a phone interview, he said he didn't know exactly how many Peruvians in the United States were trying to get back home, but estimated that it was about 6,000. He described them as a mix of students, vacationers and temporary workers. He noted that Peru's government was trying to help its citizens stranded in other countries return as well while Peru imposes a full shutdown of its borders and airports. Asked about criticism that Peru was essentially taking Americans hostage until its citizens were brought back, Pereira said, ""No, that's not the case,."" He said it was simply a matter of reciprocity. ""It's a two-way conversation,"" he said. He did not immediately respond to a follow-up question about whether Peru will cover the cost of the flights. He also urged Americans stranded in Peru to visit websites his government has arranged if they need assistance. Americans also remain stuck abroad in other countries, including Guatemala, which closed its borders this past week. The U.S. citizens there, having received little help from the embassy and unable to book flights home, are crossing the border with Mexico in droves to get to airports where planes are still taking off back to the U.S., several people on the ground told POLITICO. The State Department on Friday began flying charter flights from Morocco, another hotspot for Americans stranded abroad, back to 10 different U.S. airports. The U.S. government has made ""individual efforts"" to bring home about 3,000 Americans since the outbreak began affecting flight service, Vice President Mike Pence said at a Saturday afternoon White House press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic, ""I think there is an ongoing effort to address that with chartered commercial flights that the government is providing,"" Pence said. Military transport is also available, he said. ""We would just encourage any American that is looking on from overseas, contact the local U.S. Embassy,"" Pence said. ""Let them know about your circumstances. And know that we're going to work, continue to work very diligently to get our Americans home.""","Peru spars with U.S. over letting stranded Americans fly home during coronavirus outbreak

"Puerto Rico on Saturday became the eighth jurisdiction to postpone its presidential primary as the coronavirus spreads across the United States, according to a statement from the island's Democratic Party. The U.S. territory joins seven states in postponing primaries over the virus, as governments race to enact policies to prevent mass gatherings.  Puerto Rico was originally scheduled to hold its primary on March 29 and will now hold it no earlier than April 26. With Puerto Rico's suspension, no more primaries will be held in March. So far, seven states have postponed their primaries: Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Maryland and Ohio.  ""Without a doubt, this is the time for preventative measures to stop the spread of the virus. But even in this crisis, both the legislature and the governor highlighted the democratic freedoms and rights that allow us to be a society based on the value of voting, as an expression of the will of the majority of our people,"" Charles Rodríguez, the chair of the Puerto Rico Democratic Party, said in a statement. The next set of presidential primaries on the calendar is scheduled for April 4, the day Louisiana was originally scheduled to vote. Alaska, Hawaii and Wyoming are set to vote on that day. Wyoming, which is hosting a caucus, has already canceled in-person caucusing for a mail-in and drop-off only option. Alaska and Hawaii's party-run primaries already have vote-by-mail options. Puerto RIco's primary was changed after Gov. Wanda Vazquez signed a resolution that passed through the island's legislature.

"The Justice Department is asking Congress to let it extend deadlines on merger reviews and price-fixing prosecutions because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to documents viewed by POLITICO. The proposal — which the agency hopes to have included in the next round of pandemic legislation — would let the DOJ and its sister agency, the FTC, add 15 days onto merger timelines during emergencies, such as disease outbreaks, natural disasters or government shutdowns. Prosecutors are also asking to stop the clock on price-fixing and bid-rigging cases, a move that would ensure that the pandemic doesn’t let companies that fixed prices on generic drugs off the hook. Under current law, all mergers valued at more than $94 million have to be notified to the United States' two antitrust agencies, which have 30 days to decide whether to undertake an in-depth review. The legislative proposal would change that to 45 days. The FTC and DOJ receive notices on more than 2,000 deals annually, and seek additional information, known as a second-request, in about 3 to 5 percent of cases. After a company provides the additional details, the FTC or DOJ must decide within 30 days whether to challenge a deal. In the majority of cases, companies agree with the agency to extend that timeline in the hopes of reaching a settlement to avoid a lawsuit. Both the FTC and DOJ said this week that they would be asking companies with pending deals for additional time to complete their reviews. But with the markets in turmoil, some companies are less willing to give the agency extensions over fears that deal financing may fall through, an individual with several pending deals before the agencies said. Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, estimated Friday that U.S. corporate revenues will decline by about $4 trillion because of the coronavirus, and noted that lenders are already pulling back over default concerns. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairman of House Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee, is working on his own proposal related to merger reviews during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a person familiar with his plans. FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra, a Democrat, previously called on Congress to relax the waiting periods to allow the agencies more time. “During a national emergency, corporations shouldn't be able to dictate how government is using its limited resources,” Chopra said Wednesday on Twitter. “Corporations shouldn't be able to slip big mergers through during national emergencies. Congress should stop the shot clock so public servants have enough time to investigate and sue to block bad deals.” Republican FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson said the agency is working with companies to request extensions. “@FTC is seeking more time to ensure full review of pending deals. It will not sacrifice thoroughness of investigations that may require information from third parties focused on other priorities,” she said on Twitter. The proposal viewed by POLITICO would extend the statute of limitations on price-fixing and bid-rigging cases for at least six months because of the pandemic. Price-fixing cases have a five-year statute of limitations, so prosecutors are pushing against the clock on conduct that took place in 2015, said Lisa Phelan, a partner at Morrison & Foerster. “A delay of more than a few weeks could really risk things slipping away,” said Phelan, who worked on criminal antitrust cases at DOJ for 25 years. In general, most companies and individuals involved in price-fixing schemes agree to plead guilty; at the federal level, 90 percent of cases end with plea bargains. Toward the end of investigations, though, prosecutors are faced with the hold-outs — companies and individuals who refuse plea deals in favor of trials. In those cases, prosecutors seek indictments, which require empaneling a federal grand jury. “Even if they wanted to go forward with a proceeding, that’s not going to be possible,” said Ann O’Brien, who left the antitrust division last month after 20 years and is now a partner at Baker Hostetler. “They are not going to bring in a quorum of grand jurors to be in a small room.” One major case pending at the antitrust division is its long-running probe into price-fixing among generic pharmaceutical companies. So far, three companies — Sandoz, Rising Pharmaceuticals and Heritage Pharmaceuticals — have been charged and entered into deferred-prosecution settlements with prosecutors. Three executives have also pleaded guilty. Last month, prosecutors brought an indictment against former Taro executive Ara Aprahamian, who plans to contest the charges. Teva and Sun Pharmaceuticals, who are among the world’s largest generics manufacturers, have acknowledged involvement in the probe but haven’t reached resolutions with prosecutors. While the DOJ’s attorneys are based in D.C., the grand jury for the investigation is in the federal court in Philadelphia, which suspended all grand juries on Wednesday. A Justice Department spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.","DOJ wants more time on merger reviews, price-fixing cases because of pandemic",2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-merger-reviews-coronavirus-140669,politico
"Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence have tested negative for the coronavirus, the vice president’s office announced Saturday.   “Pleased to report that the COVID-19 test results came back negative for both Vice President @Mike_Pence and Second Lady @KarenPence,"" Katie Miller, Pence’s press secretary, tweeted. The Pences were tested for coronavirus on Saturday afternoon, a day after one of the vice president's staffers tested positive for the infection.  Earlier, Pence said there was ""no reason to believe"" he or his wife were exposed to the virus. But he said he will get tested because of his sensitive role in the Trump administration.  Pence made the comments at a Saturday afternoon press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic alongside President Donald Trump.  ""We've done all contact tracing and while the White House doctor has indicated that he has no reason to believe that I was exposed and no need to be tested, given the unique position that I have as vice president and as the leader of the White House coronavirus task force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon,"" Pence said.  The White House learned on Friday that a member of Pence's staff had tested positive for the coronavirus. Pence said the staffer ""had mild cold-like symptoms"" for about a day and a half but is ""doing well."" ""He has not been to the White House since Monday,"" Pence added. ""Neither the president nor I had direct contact with that staff person."" Trump took a test for the coronavirus last week, which the White House said was negative.  During his remarks on Saturday, Pence said 195,000 Americans have been tested for the coronavirus, a total that does not include tests done at county hospitals or health care labs. Of those tests, 19,343 came back positive, Pence said. Both numbers are expected to jump in the coming days as testing becomes more available. Almost 300 people in the U.S. have died form the disease thus far, according to researchers.  In an effort to slow the number of new coronavirus cases, the Trump administration has urged people to avoid groups larger than 10 people. Many theaters, restaurants, theme parks have shuttered and millions of people have shifted to remote work if possible. Churches and other places of worship have also taken their services online. Pence urged church-goers to continue donating to religious institutions, regardless of whether they can attend in person.  ""One thing the president and I promised was to remind people that on the weekends that you're not in the pews, it's still a good — it's still a good idea to, if you can, to go ahead and make that donation.

"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — As Florida officials move to expel the hundreds of thousands of spring breakers who ignored calls for social distancing, public-health specialists are nervously wondering what will happen once the party’s over. For much of this week, revelers continued to cram four and five to a hotel room, swarm beaches over hundreds of miles of coastline, and then gather shoulder-to-shoulder in bars and clubs – almost a model process for spreading contagious diseases.  Now, with their campuses likely shuttered, most spring breakers will return to hometowns across the country where any exposure to coronavirus could set off a contagion, public-health experts warned. They called for greater vigilance in those communities and sharply criticized Florida authorities for their slowness in closing beaches and nightspots. “What is happening in Florida with spring break partying-on by students oblivious to the epidemiological implications of their actions is nothing short of tragic,” wrote Gregg Gonsalves, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, in an email. “While many of us have been hunkering down to try to break the chains of infection in our communities, these young people have decided the pleasures of the moment are worth bringing back the coronavirus to their friends and family.”  Justin Lessler, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the crush of swimsuit-clad students consuming large amounts of alcohol could create so-called “super-spreading events” that worsen the pandemic. “The students who are going and partying at spring break potentially are feeding into a world where they are stuck in their houses for weeks on end later on,” he said. “So I think they should keep that in mind."" There is some precedent for resort communities being slow to wake up to epidemics. The Austrian village of Ischgl, an Alpine ski destination and party hotspot, was slow to close down its establishments even as other nations issued travel warnings of potential coronavirus exposure. Thousands of revelers returning from vacations in Ischgl spread infections across much of Scandinavia. On Tuesday, Norway said 40 percent of its then-1,400 infections were traced to Ischgl. The outbreak has prompted accusations that authorities there acted too slowly out of a fear of harming the local tourist economy. Unlike other states, Florida did not initially impose strict controls on crowds and left it up to local officials to take action.  On Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered bars and nightclubs to close for 30 days and directed restaurants to cut their seating capacity by half. That same day he said that beaches could remain open but that groups of more than 10 people would not be allowed in one place. The edict wasn’t enforced. Aerial pictures of hundreds of thousands of beachgoers hit the national airwaves and shocked people in other states where even major thoroughfares were empty. Forced to explain his decision, DeSantis said he did not want to do a statewide order because there were places where the virus had not yet spread. People were on “edge,” he said, and he wanted them to be able to go outside. Some local officials stepped in. Those in Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Naples and Clearwater moved to shut their beaches down. On Friday, DeSantis ordered restaurants to shut their doors, except for takeout and delivery. He told gyms to shutter and closed the beaches and other “non-essential” businesses in Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach at the urging of local officials. This action came a day after Miami officials closed many businesses. Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber told POLITICO on Friday that the city is finally getting spring breakers to leave after a month of revelry. Gelber ordered beaches shut on Thursday, and posted photos of the empty sandscape on Facebook on Friday.  Hotels will “substantially close” by Monday evening, Gelber announced in a late-Friday tweet. Gelber predicted the measures would reduce the transmission of coronavirus but, at this point, he didn’t know how much. Florida spring break went on for weeks before anyone took action, when the virus seemed less threatening.  “This is about risk management,” Gelber said. “It might have been too late a month ago, frankly.” Miami Beach spokesperson Melissa Berthier said there have been no confirmed spring break coronavirus cases reported in the city. But Hansel Tookes, a public-health physician specializing in infectious diseases at University of Miami’s medical school, said no one knows how much the coronavirus has spread among spring breakers because of a lack of testing. Had there been enough tests, the students could have gone to clinics, and the sick ones could have isolated themselves in Florida before going home. “If there was testing, they could be isolated in say, a hotel or a place where they could remain alone until they were no longer infectious,” he said. “Younger people have more social interactions. There’s more transmission amongst them. Most people are infectious before they are symptomatic.” Indeed, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin have found that the virus also spreads quickly even among people who are asymptomatic. Ten percent of patients are infected by someone who has no symptoms. So far, there’s no sign of a spring break surge in Florida's safety net hospitals, which would potentially be more likely to take in a struggling spring breaker. But it’s also too early. Infected Florida spring breakers are still incubating the illness, spreading the disease. And, state officials don’t know if there will be a surge in other parts of the country because they’re not tracking anyone who has left Florida without symptoms.  “There’s the strong possibility that we could start to see cases popping up after the incubation period. And if it’s not the spring breakers, their parents and grandparents are at high risk as well,” said Nitesh Paryani, an oncologist in Lakeland, who said his cancer specialty doesn't mean anything amid the public health crisis. “Everybody is treating coronavirus, whether we want to or not. All physicians are being pulled into this fight. It’s an all hands on deck situation.” Ironically, the risk of returning spring breakers carrying the virus has already manifested itself in Florida. In the city of Gainesville, home to the University of Florida, four students have tested positive. One of the students had returned from Portugal while on spring break, according to local media. The Gainesville Sun reported that one student was a dentistry student who worked in a clinic after returning. The revelation that there was positive tests among university students played into the university system’s decision to scrap in-person classes for the rest of the semester. Initially, schools planned to delay opening campuses after spring break and resume classes in early April. DeSantis admonished university students this week for returning to fraternity houses to party instead of going home. Florida State University President John Thrasher, whose college was on spring break this past week, said that he is hopeful that many of the school’s 41,000 plus students will stay away, even those who live off-campus locally. “We are doing everything we can to discourage them from going back,” Thrasher said. But while Florida schools contribute to the spring break crowds, students also stream in from the rest of the South and even the Midwest. And it’s not quite clear how many came to the state – and where they are going now that the bars, restaurants and many of the beaches have shut down. “I would think it next to impossible to track that many people and potential exposures,” said Craig Fugate, the former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency who also led Florida’s emergency management agency when the state dealt with back-to-back hurricanes. “This may end up being tracked by spring breakers if they get sick here or once they get home and working backwards.” Visit Florida, the state’s tourism marketing arm, does not have figures for this year, but says that more than 32 million visitors come to the state in March through May. An average of 2.7 million students come to Florida each year, the group estimates.  DeSantis acknowledged Thursday — at the opening of a South Florida mobile testing site — the unintended consequences of a March 11 directive that he and the State University System Board of Governors worked together on. They told students to delay returning to campus from spring break for two weeks.  “We were thinking, don’t come back yet,” DeSantis said. “Instead, they all went back, and they were drinking at the bars every night.” Despite the clear risks, experts said that several factors might mitigate the threat posed by the spring breakers. “It certainly has the potential to cause spread, but it may not be as dramatic as some people might think,"" said Lessler, the Johns Hopkins professor. Young people are more likely to be asymptomatic, and might therefore be less contagious, he said. Lessler also cited the short duration of spring break, which lasts about a week for most revelers. The generation time of the virus ranges from four to eight days, weighted towards the higher end, he said. That means that infected spring breakers could spread the virus to one other person, but there might not be enough time to pass the virus on again before heading home.  Still, all public-health officials who were interviewed warned that returning spring breakers could easily bring the virus to new parts of the country, as the disease continues its relentless spread. “Students on spring break are likely to introduce [coronavirus] into communities that have not yet been exposed to the virus, especially in quieter less well-connected parts of the country,” said William Hanage, professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in an emailed statement. “However this does not change the fact that the virus is well established and community transmission is widespread. Once this has happened, limits on travel become much less important.”",Will spring breakers become super-spreaders?,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/spring-breakers-coronavirus-140609,politico
"Senate Republicans and Democrats have yet to reach an overall deal on a massive economic rescue package in response to the coronavirus crisis — but the two sides are getting closer. And Senate GOP leaders said Saturday they will press ahead with drafting portions of the bill, which will cost at least $1.6 trillion, according to three GOP sources. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remains adamant about sticking to a Monday deadline to hold a final vote on the legislation, the most expensive economic rescue package in U.S. history. McConnell has set up a critical procedural vote for Sunday afternoon, and he will need Democratic support to continue moving forward. McConnell late Saturday evening said the Senate is ""poised to deliver the significant relief that Americans need with the speed that this crisis demands"" and is instructing committee chairmen to draft final legislative text. A spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) cautioned there is no agreement yet and that Democrats have yet to see several parts of the Republican draft.  ""We look forward to reviewing their first draft and negotiating a bipartisan compromise,"" the spokesperson said.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, McConnell, Schumer, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will meet in McConnell's office Sunday at 11 a.m. to discuss the legislation. But there is still no guarantee a deal will be reached. A senior Democratic aide said Saturday evening that ""Republicans abruptly pulled out of negotiations for reasons Democrats still don’t understand."" A GOP official involved in the negotiations countered that Republicans have conceded to Democratic demands on key issues and that it's time to meet McConnell’s time frame.  The two sides continue to squabble over boosting paid leave for sick workers and those caring for infected family members — a major issue for Democrats — as well as what kind of financial help the federal government can provide to distressed industries, such as the major U.S. airlines. The White House and Senate Republicans want several hundred billion dollars for impacted industries, said officials involved in the talks.  But there was significant progress during Saturday's negotiations on boosting unemployment insurance payments, a major source of contention between GOP and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. Senate Republicans have agreed to boost those payments by $250 billion, a major win for Democrats, said two sources familiar with the discussions. This will come on top of $250 billion in direct payments from the IRS to individual Americans, which President Donald Trump, Mnuchin and Senate Republicans have made their key priority. And Senate GOP leaders and the White House conceded to a Democratic demand for tens of billions of dollars for hospitals and health-care providers as part of the rescue package. There also appears to be broad support for $350 billion in loans to small and medium-sides businesses that have been decimated as the U.S. economy grinds to a jarring halt in the facing of the growing coronavirus outbreak.  “What [McConnell] has instructed his committees to do is to finish drafting legislation that reflects agreements reached so far, and where the chairmen and the majority believe Democrats could be in a position to support by the time the vote occurs,” said White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland, a key Trump administration official involved in the high-level talks. “It’s critically important that Congress be in a position to act for the American people and the American economy on Monday.”  McConnell was hopeful about the prospects for an agreement, telling reporters: “I think we’re clearly going to get there.” “Basically, we know the general contours of what this is going to look like,” added Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), as he left a closed-door GOP luncheon earlier in the day. Now it’s just a question of plugging in some of the policy, and figuring out where the numbers are.” “The Democrats are getting some of the things they’ve asked for,” said Thune, ticking off priorities like immediate relief to individuals, protections for health care workers, and shoring up small businesses. “They’re getting what they wanted on unemployment insurance.” Senate Democrats have been tight-lipped about specific issues but generally said Republicans were making good-faith offers as they attempt to reach agreement. “We’ve reached a point where the big issues — the really big important issues — are just interrelated, and we can make progress,” added Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of his party’s top negotiators on financial issues. In a sign that negotiations were reaching a critical point, Pelosi spent part of Saturday flying back to D.C. Mnuchin spoke with Pelosi and Schumer during the afternoon. ""We're making very good progress. I'm optimistic we can make a deal,"" Schumer said late Saturday afternoon. McConnell had originally demanded an agreement be reached by Saturday afternoon. Mnuchin declined to comment on the talks, but told reporters that he's also spoken with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. ""Everybody's working very hard,"" Mnuchin said just before 4 p.m. on Saturday. Senate Republicans earlier tried to break the deadlock by delivering their latest concession to Democrats on one of the biggest remaining issues — $250 billion more for unemployment insurance payments. The two sides huddled separately as they sought a way to incorporate the Democratic demands, such as longer-term benefits for furloughed workers. ""We have a good bipartisan agreement on enhanced unemployment compensations,"" said Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). As negotiations moved forward, the size and scope of the package appeared to steadily increase. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said earlier Saturday that the price tag of the legislation was expected to exceed $1.3 trillion, and that the total size of the package, including loans from the federal government, would likely exceed 10 percent of GDP — roughly $2 trillion. That would include a payroll tax holiday for small businesses.  During a Senate GOP lunch, Republicans discussed an idea from the Trump administration for possible specific assistance for General Electric and Boeing, but several pushed back on it, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), according to two sources familiar with the meeting. Cruz later tweeted his opposition to ""a special carve-out"" for the two companies, adding, ""Millions are losing jobs; we don’t need bailouts or corporate welfare—those companies should participate in the same liquidity programs as everyone else."" Inside the Trump administration, there is a strong desire to help both Boeing and GE, a major contributor to the Boeing supply chain. Both companies employ tens of thousands of workers, and the administration wants to prevent any major loss of jobs at the iconic firms. In addition to providing the companies money or loans directly through the ""Phase 3"" package, Mnuchin is also trying to ensure the legislation gives both Treasury and the Federal Reserve the flexibility to loan the two companies additional funds, according to three sources familiar with the Hill negotiations. Another issue still under negotiation is the Democrats' call for a ""State Stabilization Fund,"" which would assist state governments with looming revenue shortfalls during the pandemic. Democrats are optimistic about their ask on aid to states. In a tweet, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Saturday that Republicans are now negotiating on the terms and amount of funding. The debate over expanding paid leave may be the toughest remaining point of conflict. The Senate pushed through the House's ""Phase 2"" relief package earlier this week which included new paid sick leave provisions. While the Senate approved the measure in a 90-8 vote, McConnell had to convince his caucus to support it and vowed to address shortcomings in this new, third stimulus package. The discussions come after Senate Republicans introduced a $1 trillion measure Thursday to salvage the economy by providing assistance to individuals, small businesses and industries. Under the GOP proposal, individuals and families would receive $1,200 and $2,400 in direct cash payments based on their income. But some Republicans, including Sens. Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Mitt Romney (Utah), complained the proposal's structure — as written — would penalize lower income Americans who do not have a taxable income. Republican lawmakers and aides say this has been resolved.

"President Donald Trump is always keeping score. Sometimes it's a simple brag — boasting about the highest State of the Union TV ratings in history, trumpeting that he appointed more judges than George Washington, inflating the number of electoral college votes he won in 2016. But cherry-picked numbers are also central to how Trump comprehends a crisis and crafts a positive narrative. As the coronavirus raced around the globe and seized the world’s economy, he has cited numbers to suit his own story that the pandemic would quickly pass and that his administration was in control.  It’s a playbook that hasn’t always worked. In late February, Trump claimed there were only 15 coronavirus cases in the United States — a vast understatement — and promised “within a couple of days,” the number would be close to zero. That number has now soared past 14,000 and is climbing exponentially. He seized on figures about how many people the seasonal flu killed annually — 37,000 last year alone — without the country needing to shutter most businesses. His own health officials categorically rejected the comparison.  Then, Trump promised the administration would have 1.4 million coronavirus tests available by mid-March. But as of Saturday, only 195,000 people had been tested, even as the administration has met its goals of providing tests. One of the president’s top infectious disease experts to conceded, “Clearly, more needs to be done,” but vowed that officials were “rapidly getting to the point where we will have many, many tests out there available for virtually everyone.” Public health specialists say Trump’s use of misleading numbers to downplay the coronavirus outbreak — a challenge that could make-or-break his presidency — has had dangerous consequences, leading Americans to ignore official warnings about modifying behaviors to slow the disease’s spread.  “He's a man that hears what he wants to hears … and he puts it through the lens of a marketer. He is a marketer,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “His image is, ‘I’m on top of this, I’m tough,’ and anything he hears that supports that theory of the case, he grabs and utilizes.” Those around Trump disagree. They say his numbers-focused mindset is a crisis asset. Trump’s specific obsession with the number of coronavirus cases is the right approach, argued former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who made headlines when he insisted — wrongly — that Trump had drawn the largest ever inaugural crowd. “Having a metric-based business mentality is what you need during periods of crisis,” said Spicer, who visited the White House at least twice this week. “Either people are getting better and it’s being contained or it’s not. It’s the only judge of success.” More broadly, Trump’s team thinks the numbers are in his favor, arguing the administration started taking action the first week of January. Since then, Trump has up a task force, declared a public health emergency, requested billions from Congress and announced early restrictions on travel from China. Trump aides also note the administration has facilitated the shipments of test kits to U.S. and foreign labs.  For years, Trump has been obsessed with records, ratings and statistics, mentioning them constantly — and often inflating the figures, failing to acknowledge the human aspect or overhyping his own role. There’s interest rates and unemployment rates, crowd sizes and polls, stock markets gains and immigrant apprehension numbers. Before running for office in 2016, Trump had spent his five decades in the real estate, marketing and reality TV businesses. He sold himself to voters on that background, touting his ability to strike deals with countries and companies alike.  Once in office, he talked about policy moves like one-off deals, often becoming preoccupied with certain figures. For example, he has constantly complained about trade deficits — when the value of what the country imports exceeds its exports — spouting off the amount with each country. $500 billion a year with China, $100 billion with Japan, $17 billion with Canada.  When Trump has struck new deals with China, Mexico and Canada and others, he’s always noted how much the agreement will reduce each trade deficit.  “When you’re in the real investment business, the performance is only based on numbers and that’s all that matters,” said a Republican who speaks to Trump. “He spent a lifetime on it. He’s not going to think differently now. That’s how you judge real estate. That’s all they have. It’s all about the money.” But Trump has been accused of forgetting the people behind the numbers. In August, Trump touted the crowd size of a rally — held at the same time as an event of then Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke —- while visiting medical staff who had treated victims of a mass shooting.  That criticism has resurfaced during the coronavirus pandemic. During the early stages of the outbreak, Trump mused about keeping coronavirus-infected passengers aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship in the waters off California to keep down the number of U.S. cases.  “I like the numbers being where they are,” he said. “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.” Michael Caputo, who has known Trump for three decades and served as a campaign adviser in 2016, acknowledged Trump can be accused of being unfeeling, but compared it to how a statistician or economist might be criticised for being too focused on numbers and not people. But Caputo argued Trump has changed his approach as president.  “That’s part of the learning curve,” he said. “He has embraced the human side.” Caputo said toying with numbers is how Trump processes his options and reveals his thinking. “When global society is melting around him, he leans back on what he knows. Data is what he knows,” he said. “He muses, thinking aloud. My experience with the president he verbalizes all the options on the table and discusses every piece of data.” Trump’s political fixation on favorable figures goes back to his campaign. While on the campaign trail, Trump often talked about having a statistician he frequently called to get numbers about whatever he wanted. “You know, I have a person. He's a statistician. He's so excited by his job. He loves it,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Albuquerque, N.M., in May. “I do like details and I do like statisticians,” he said at a Sacramento rally the following month. There was even a rally where he held up charts to illustrate what he said were the failures of President Barack Obama and his secretary of State, Hillary Clinton — Trump’s rival. There were charts on homeownership rates, the national debt, Syrian refugees entering the U.S., commuted prison sentences as well as hedge fund managers-turned Clinton campaign contributors and foreign donations to the Clinton family foundation. Trump’s rallies have continued during his presidency — until coronavirus, that is. And certain figures have become a recurring part of his stump speech.  He describes the African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates are the lowest rate in history, though they have risen again. He claims seven million people have joined the workforce since he’s been president, though the gains are lower than Obama’s final three years. He said his administration has built 100 miles of new wall along the southern border, though most of that was simply upgrading existing sections. And he always talks about his 2016 electoral college vote total — which was 304, not 306 — without noting that Clinton won the popular vote.  “We were not supposed to crack 220, you know that, right?” Trump told a crowd in February 2017. “There was no way to 221, but then they said there’s no way to 270.” Trump still talks about crowd sizes, boasting about the “record” numbers who have attended or watched from outdoor jumbo screens at the nearly 100 rallies he’s held as president. This less-consequential braggadocio has also surfaced during his near-daily coronavirus briefings.  On Sunday, Trump touted a stock market surge that occurred late Friday after he declared a national emergency to free up funds to combat the coronavirus.  “It went up 2,000 — almost 2,000 points,” he said. He wasn’t wrong, but by Monday the stock market plummeted again amid reports Trump had inflated the progress made fighting the virus — another fallout from his reliance on misleading figures during the coronavirus crisis.  An outside Trump adviser said Trump feels the need to offer up his record because he needs to justify himself against what he sees as the constant media attacks. “Numbers matter,” the person said. “That’s how you judge the status of things. Numbers don’t lie. Numbers give you benchmarks to achieve.” But the adviser acknowledged Trump can go too far in his language, attributing that to Trump being from New York. He even had a number to express his thoughts: “I wish he said two-thirds less of the things he did.”",Trump has scoreboard obsession.

"Before the three weeks that miraculously brought Joe Biden to the cusp of the Democratic presidential nomination, his campaign was limping along — and Biden knows it. “The press kept saying Biden has no money, and they were right,” the former vice president said during Sunday’s Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders. “Biden had no money.” And new campaign finance disclosures filed late Friday highlight how Biden captured the Democratic nomination on momentum and message instead of organizational prowess — and the work his operation has to do to build up for a grueling general election campaign against President Donald Trump. Biden, who brought in $18.1 million in February, was outraised by four other Democratic presidential contenders that month: Bernie Sanders ($47.7 million), Elizabeth Warren ($29.5 million), Amy Klobuchar ($18.7 million) and Pete Buttigieg ($18.6 million). While Biden’s fundraising took off in March as he started reeling off primary wins, his campaign operation lagged well behind others’. Sanders had 1,215 people on the payroll in February, according to his campaign finance report, while Warren paid salaries to 1,203 different staffers. Buttigieg had over 550 people on his campaign at that point.  Meanwhile, Biden’s payroll stood at 477, as his lower fundraising totals throughout 2019 and early 2020 meant his campaign had to try to keep costs low. Sanders outspent Biden $46 million to $13 million in February — and still finished the month with more cash in the bank, $18.7 million to $12.1 million. “As is typical, [Biden]’s got to pull in talent from other campaigns and across the party to run a general election, and he’s got to move quickly,” said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who served as deputy campaign manager for former President Barack Obama in 2012. “He just needs more of everything.” Lying in wait is Trump’s reelection campaign, which has been preparing for the general election for years and already has more than $94 million socked away in its bank account. The Republican National Committee has also built a big financial advantage over the Democratic National Committee that even a big windfall from billionaire Mike Bloomberg can’t erase. The DNC ended February with $14.1 million on hand, compared to $76.8 million for the RNC. Biden’s retooling process is already underway, with another former Obama hand, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, taking over as Biden’s campaign manager last week. But the coronavirus pandemic and the sudden onset of social distancing and remote work from home may impair the Biden campaign’s buildup. “The lack of infrastructure in the states was a reflection of the limited resources available at that time, and now, that will all change,” said Tom McMahon, a former DNC executive director.  “They may be playing catch up but in light of how campaigning will take place going forward they aren’t necessarily at a disadvantage,” McMahon continued. “The real challenge they’re going to have to face going forward is putting together a comprehensive campaign remotely.”  Biden will have the cash to try: He revealed during last Sunday’s debate that he had raised $33 million in the first half of March, and that was before he swept the primaries on March 17 and padded his delegate lead over Sanders. Even before he started raising such large amounts of money, Biden’s other strengths were ultimately more important than the power of an organization during the primary, said Matt Paul, a former aide to Hillary Clinton and former Agriculture secretary and Iowa governor Tom Vilsack.  “But it’s a different game now,” Paul continued, “and they know that. This break in the campaign is bizarre, but it’s an opportunity to think very carefully and plan very carefully about how to marshal their resources.”",'He just needs more of everything': Biden campaign faces retool after primary surge,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/joe-biden-fec-fundraising-140262,politico
"ELY, Minn. -- At the edge of a vast wilderness ringed by lakes and woods, a surprise discovery provided a rare jolt of optimism for a struggling mining town now known mainly as a prime destination for canoers: Massive deposits of nickel and copper -- minerals that power car batteries and smart phones -- lie under the earth. Many jubilant residents of Ely and nearby towns are now hanging their hopes on a plan to build a massive mining facility under a patch of national forest land that’s a stone’s throw from one of the most verdant watersheds in the world. But the project increases the risk of acidic waste contaminating the area’s lakes and streams. Environmental groups mounted a well-funded push against the project. Democratic presidential contenders began objecting, too: Bernie Sanders, Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren pledged to stop the project. Joe Biden has yet to take a position.  And that’s forced people in Ely and Minnesota’s Iron Range region to think again about who are its protectors and defenders. A place that once gave Democratic native sons Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale 4:1 voting margins and considers the late Sen. Paul Wellstone a local hero has begun to embrace a president who bears little resemblance to them, except that he reversed the “injustice” of an Obama-era order that would have brought the nickel-copper project to a 20-year standstill. On top of that were the 25 percent tariffs Trump imposed on most foreign steel, which provided an initial boost to the 5,000 miners still employed in the region’s numerous iron-ore mines that have served as the backbone to the region’s economy. All of that put Ely in the middle of a political transformation that makes Minnesota the president’s top target among states he lost in 2016, and potentially a pivot point in the 2020 presidential race. Trump lost the state by a margin of 45,000 votes in 2016, a remarkable feat considering how entrenched Democrats have been in the state. “The Iron Range is back in business,” Trump declared in a speech in Minneapolis last October. The area's growing affinity toward Trump provides a case study in how the president has brought the blue-collar vote to heel with a mix of culture and economic promise. But not everyone is willing to cede the town and region to the Republicans. Even some who like Trump’s mining policies chafe at his harsh rhetoric. Still others express concern about the threat to local waterways and wilderness. But all agree that the economic changes looming over the area created a mixed-up political stew in which Trumpism floated most easily to the top. “The hope rested with Trump, that’s where the people went … it’s hope. People want hope for a better future,” said Ely Mayor Chuck Novak, a self-described Humphrey Democrat who has thrown his support behind the president winning a second term. He is an ardent supporter of the new mining project. “This is the old method of politics,” he added. “You take care of your economy and your people.” *** Fifty miles west along the Iron Range, in the mining towns where empty storefronts outnumber the bars, banks and pizza joints, labor unions are grappling with a new political reality.  Every time Chris Johnson gathers his United Steelworkers Local 2705 at the hall in Chisholm, Minn., the union of roughly 600 mine workers that pull iron ore out of the Hibbing Taconite mine have one question: Why isn’t their leadership going all in on Trump? It’s a question Johnson, once a mine worker himself and now the local president, struggles to answer to his rank and file. He strongly supports nickel-copper mining but can’t overcome decades of Democratic support that led him to embrace Wellstone, Amy Klobuchar, Al Franken and other liberal heroes. Trump’s “not pro-labor and that’s the only message we really have for them,” he said. “He basically stole the union’s message and is using that, but to his core he doesn’t believe any of the stuff we do, but he knows he’s getting votes for it.” Johnson estimates that about 75 percent of his membership supports Trump.  Trump’s appeal to the “forgotten people” has resonated with a population that has seen the iron-ore mining industry go through decades of boom-bust cycles that have led to mass layoffs, a declining population and a growing sense of survivalism. In the late 1970s the industry employed 15,000 people. That’s down to roughly 5,000. The area never recovered those mining jobs after mass layoffs in 1981 as the U.S. steel industry underwent changes and automation took hold. The environmental priorities of Democrats at a national and state level are shifting support in places like the Iron Range, where even pro-labor members feel increasingly alienated by a platform more suited to a political party that is rapidly becoming more urbanized. Johnson recounted a meeting last year in Washington with Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minneapolis. He said the lawmaker told him the way of life in the Iron Range is going to change. “We’re a vital part of all products made in this country and abroad and for her to just sit there and say, ‘look you guys are going to have to learn a different industry’ doesn’t go over well,” he said. “I’ve voted Democrat my whole life. It’s getting tougher,” said Steve Bonach, president of United Steelworkers Local 1938, the union for the roughly 1,200 workers at the area’s largest mine. He said he’s leaning towards supporting Bernie Sanders. “I wish I could put my hand on the transformation going on around here,” he said from his union hall in Virginia, Minn., a building wrapped in a mural of military men and women in uniform. St. Louis County, which includes Ely, lost 20,000 people between 1980 and 1990. The county, which also encompasses the lake port city of Duluth, has not really seen its population rebound since that time. David Bednarczak, a county employee who was laid off from a mining job in 1981, said he can’t vote for Trump because of his views on immigrants and women, but recognizes that the pull of the Democratic party is waning in the area. He was the sole person from his voting precinct in Hibbing to show up to a late-February caucus night for the Democrats, known in Minnesota as the Democrat-Farmer-Labor Party. A paltry crowd of 35 people representing 10 precincts in a city of 16,000 showed up to the event. “We lost our future, we lost our enthusiasm for living. We lost that vibrant group of young people that participated in the economy,” said Bednarczak, who was supporting Sanders. “We’ve never really recovered, not in population and not in economy.” While the Iron Range declined, the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul prospered, leaving some to think that the Democratic party could soon cut its losses here.  The challenge of maintaining Democratic support of rural and small-town voters that value gun rights and resource-intensive industries has grown even more difficult. That’s even harder in an area where miners can make anywhere between $80,000 to $100,000 per year. The industry claims each direct mining jobs supports at least two more indirect jobs. Before the coronavirus crisis hit, mine workers in the area had enjoyed some clear benefits from economic growth in the Trump era. Overall employment in St. Louis County grew by only 0.7 percent from the third quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2019 (the most recent data available), compared to 4.2 percent growth in natural resources and mining employment in the county. But wages in natural resources and mining increased a robust 31 percent in the county, compared with 5 percent wage growth across all of Minnesota.  “When you get some of the radicals in the state Democratic party trying to push the environmental agenda a little too far, that’s when people are going to push back,” said John Lamusga, a salaried mine worker who supported Trump in the last election. He called Bill Clinton a good president and lauded Wellstone as a “a great human being” but said people are just tired of establishment politicians. “I think most people voted for Trump definitely not because he was going to be an angel in office, and not because they thought he was going to be a savior,” he said, sipping a beer after a curling match at the Hibbing Curling Club. “I think most people voted for Trump up here because they were pretty fed up with the political establishment on both sides.” *** Talk of economic diversification in the Iron Range is usually met with a shake of the head and shrug of shoulders. No one’s betting on the area becoming a tech hub or even a center for non-mining manufacturing. Even local leaders concede that pulling minerals out of the land is what people do here. Iron ore was discovered in the area in the mid-1800s. Immigrants from Eastern Europe, the Balkans and Scandinavia came to the region in waves to work in the growing mines. Eventually the soft, high-grade ore found near the surface was exhausted and miners began blasting deeper and deeper to extract taconite, a lower-grade ore that is turned into pellets and carried by trains to ports on Lake Superior where it is shipped to steel-making plants in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. But the industry is continuing to change. Some of the open pit mines where the ore is extracted are beginning to see deposits run thin. The steel industry is also evolving as companies invest in new methods to make the metal, shifting from blast furnaces that rely on the area’s taconite ore to newer electric arc furnaces that primarily melt scrap to make new steel.  United States Steel Corp. announced late last year that it will shutter its Great Lakes Works blast furnace operation near Detroit, laying off more than 1,500 workers. U.S. Steel operates the largest mining operation in the Iron Range. The uncertain fate of the iron-ore industry is fueling the debate over nickel-copper mining that permeates conversations along the entire range.  Twin Metals Minnesota, a subsidiary of the Chilean mining giant Antofagasta, is proposing mining an area of Superior National Forest for nickel, copper and potentially other minerals. “That’s how you diversify the economy here. It’s going to be mineral-based,” said Bob Vlaisavljevich, mayor of nearby Eveleth, Minn. “If copper is down, you’ve got three other minerals. That’s where you get those dips, not the peaks and valleys where people are losing their homes, moving away. As far as diversification, that’s how it’s going to be.” The Twin Metals company said the 100-acre site won’t pose the environmental risk that people fear. The company insists its method of processing the mine waste won’t jeopardize the surrounding lakes and waterway. Proponents point to an underground nickel-copper mine in operation in Michigan’s upper peninsula as a model for the industry in northern Minnesota. Environmentalists insist otherwise. They say the nickel-copper mining process, no matter how technologically advanced, will risk leaching sulfuric acid, heavy metals and sulfates into the surrounding watershed. A statewide poll released last month showed that a majority of Minnesotans opposed the project near Ely. “Our communities have built our way of life around the wilderness. This poll makes clear that the majority of Minnesotans stand with us in protecting our nation’s greatest canoe country wilderness,” said Becky Rom, national chair of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters. Nonetheless, the Twin Metals project, still in the planning and permitting phase, is estimated to directly employ 700 people and create 1,400 spinoff jobs for the area. And it isn’t the only nickel-copper project in the area. A mining company called PolyMet has gotten all of its permits for a similar mine in nearby Hoyt Lakes, Minn., but the project is tied up in complex litigation. Trump’s steel tariffs and protective trade policies have only left a region long dependent on mining here wanting even more. The president imposed a 25 percent tariff on most imported steel in 2018, but most people don’t highlight the policy as the saving grace Trump touts it to be. While steel prices initially shot up, they’ve settled back down as the U.S. steel industry continues to undergo a somewhat painful transformation. “There’s sure no boom up here,” said Gary Skalko. After nine terms as mayor of the town of Mountain Iron, Minn., the self-described “hippie” and former school teacher is standing down. He’s a strong supporter of the mining industry, but he senses a change in culture. “I’m a pro-choice guy. I’m still worried about losing my First Amendment rights, not my Second Amendment rights. I felt [Trump] should have been convicted for what he did,” he said. “Why would I represent people who don’t have the same values? There’s so much hatred on both sides.” Preserving “our way of life” has become a rallying cry in the region. Rep. Pete Stauber, a former Duluth police officer who once played professional hockey, flipped the area’s eighth congressional district to red in the 2018 midterm. He used the phrase in his campaign. Stauber is “not running a political campaign, he’s running a cultural campaign and it’s invincible as far as I’m concerned,” said Aaron Brown, a fifth generation Iron Ranger who teaches at Hibbing Community College and writes commentary on local issues.  It all comes down to a cultural balance that remains undecided and “almost a sense of inferiority that comes from an up and down economy,” he said. “Presidents have come and gone. Clinton and Bush and Obama and now Trump,” said Brown. “Very different policies but this place hasn’t changed that much, and I think there’s something about the hollowing out of the industrialization of this area that we feel that we no longer have any control over our self-destiny and I think that just feeds into our politics.” * * * The same downturns in open pit mining and the U.S. steel industry that are fueling the support for nickel and copper mining have provoked skepticism in some other Iron Range residents – those who have started to think about the area’s natural beauty as a resource that can be monetized. And natural beauty, unlike mineral deposits, never gets tapped out. Sue Schurke looks at the economy differently than most of her neighbors. Her house overlooks a lake that sits downstream from the proposed Twin Metals nickel and copper mine. Schurke and her husband Paul have benefitted from the natural richness of the area. She employs nine people that design and manufacture outerwear. The couple has also operated a dogsled lodge since the 1980s where they own a pack of 60 friendly but hyperactive Inuit sled dogs brought in from northern Canada.  “Ely is not a dying town,” she said, countering the argument that the tourism economy can’t sustain the town. “I have a manufacturing business and there’s room for lots of good businesses in this town that are sustainable.” Ely sits at the gateway of the million-acre Boundary Waters Canoe Area, a wilderness of lakes and forest that stretches to the Canadian border. The last iron-ore operation in the town, the underground Pioneer Mine, closed in 1967. In succeeding decades, the population has become a hybrid of people who still work at mines in nearby towns and those who have migrated to the area to take advantage of the outdoor recreation economy. Paul Schurke said pro-mining advocates in town are being “hoodwinked.” “If they score the permits, they'll sit on them until the market improves and until expensive mining manpower has been replaced by robotics,” he said. “I empathize with the locals clamoring for high-paying mining jobs, but it's sad to see them being exploited by foreign plutocrats and Trump's populist movement.” In an ironic twist, the Schurkes were invited to the White House in 2018 for the administration’s annual “Made in America” product showcase, where her colorful parkas and jackets caught the eye of Melania Trump. Sue says she has nothing against the iron ore industry that has been here for more than 100 years. Many of her employees come from mining families that support the nickel-copper project. But she fears the impact the new mine might have on her family’s businesses and the environment. “I just feel like Trump came along and just basically opened the door for people,” she said. “Mining is their history … they went with Trump because he was opening the door for it.” Taylor Miller Thomas contributed to this report.",Minnesota on the edge: ‘I’ve voted Democrat my whole life.

"DALLAS — Thousands of people streamed through the church lobby and into the pews. Ushers at First Baptist Dallas invited members to the front rows, gesturing to the prime seats still available. Trumpets blared, bright blue and purple lights illuminated the stage, and behind the orchestra pit the 100 or so members of choir—ranging from late teens to late 60s—stood inches apart, ready to sing for the next 30 minutes. When Robert Jeffress, the senior pastor, walked onto the stage, wearing a dark suit and shiny teal tie, he thanked the musicians.  “Isn’t it great to see so many of them here today?” he asked the audience. Jeffress’ sermon that morning, presented in his usual stoic-but-chipper demeanor, was titled “The Road to Armageddon,” and focused largely on biblical stories of God’s punishments. “God’s judgment is not always immediate,” he told his congregation, and the tens of thousands of people watching online. “But it’s always inevitable.” Aside from a few empty pews in the back of the sanctuary, this seemed like any other Sunday. Except it wasn’t. This was Sunday, March 15. Most of the country was already being reminded to stay at home, to practice social distancing, to flatten the curve of the coronavirus outbreak, which President Donald Trump, the man Jeffress supports at every turn, had just declared a national emergency. Every major sports league had suspended play. The city of Dallas had banned gathering over 500 people and canceled its beloved St. Patrick’s Day parade and party, scheduled for the same weekend. Most ministers, rabbis and imams in North Texas had decided it was safer to share the faith on camera rather than in person. But not Jeffress. On Twitter, the church’s announcement that it would hold live services—there were two that morning—received dozens of replies. Some messages thanked the church. But the vast majority said things like “blood will be on your hands” and “criminally negligent” and “this is foolishness.” Dr. Shelley Conroy, dean of the Louise Herrington School of Nursing at Baylor University—the same university Jeffress attended in the mid-1970s—tweeted: “We should not be putting our elderly members at risk by encouraging them to come to church right now. We should have complied with the intent of the public health orders to keep everyone socially distant for one week to control the spread of this virulent disease.”  Against all these criticisms, the doomsaying and alarming news on television screens and newspaper headlines, Jeffress remained resolute and unmoving. “How do we avoid what I call the pandemic panic?” he told a television station.  “We wanted to have as much normalcy as possible last morning,” he’d explain to me later. But, as we’ve all come to realize, normal could last only so long. Jeffress, 64, is no stranger to controversy. For the past five years, he has been Donald Trump’s most visible, most vocal Evangelical supporter. In addition to leading the 13,000-member megachurch in Dallas, one of the oldest in the country, Jeffress appears regularly on Fox News and Fox Business, excoriating the president’s critics while enthusiastically defending the administration’s policies on everything from child separation at the border to saber rattling on the Korean Peninsula. In the past, he has preached sermons with titles like “Gay Is Not Okay,” he’s called Islam “a false religion based on the teachings of a false prophet,” and he referred to Oprah Winfrey as “a tool of Satan.” (He isn’t afraid to let fly on Republicans, either. Last year, he called Mitt Romney a “self-righteous snake.”) Though he doesn’t mention politics from the pulpit all that often, American flag pins are fairly common in the pews. For more than a century, the church has combined a conservative brand of patriotism with a brimstone-scented piety. Not long after Trump’s inauguration, the First Baptist Dallas choir performed a hymn called “Make America Great Again”—written by the church’s former music director—at a ""Celebrate Freedom"" concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington. I’ve written about Jeffress several times over the past few years. I wanted to know what he was thinking when he decided First Baptist would buck the almost universal cultural retreat that public health officials were promoting. So I called him. Was this a play for publicity, I asked. Jeffress told me he wasn’t trying to court controversy. He said the church was careful not to defy the city’s crowd-size guidelines. Ushers limited the number of people in the main sanctuary to 500, then directed the overflow into other venues on the church’s six-block campus, where attendees could watch a live telecast of the services. Fire marshals were on-site to make sure the church was abiding by the new protocols.  “We have been committed from the very beginning to following the city regulations for meeting together,” Jeffress said. “Those regulations are changing quickly because the situation is changing quickly.” He said he was on a phone call with Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson and about 70 other faith leaders earlier last week, before the live service. “Some churches were staying open, some were closing,” he said. “But we were all committed to following the city's guidelines on this.” The city, in its explanation, used the example of a movie theater. “They said a movie theater complex has thousands of people that pass through it during the day, but no more than 500 are gathering in various venues at one time,” Jeffress explained. This was the church’s green light. (Movie theaters in Dallas have since been closed.) Jeffress told me the church also warned that anyone with symptoms and anybody over 60, with any underlying health issue “should really think seriously about not coming, and worshiping with us online.” He said there were a record 166,000 people watching livestreams of the services. I asked Jeffress if he was worried about an outbreak of the virus at his church—where the membership is disproportionately older. He thought about it for a moment. “We made the best decision we could make at that point in time,” he said. “This is a very real threat that we need to take seriously. But the Bible has a great balance between faith and practicality.”  He quoted St. Paul’s second letter to Timothy: “God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love and of a sound mind.” In other words, he said, “God doesn’t want us to be paralyzed with panic, but at the same time he expects us to exercise a sound mind in what we do.” At the end of last Sunday’s sermon, Jeffress told the congregation he was uncertain about what the church would do over the next week. He announced that they would cancel evening service and weekday gatherings. But whether to meet the following Sunday—this Sunday—was still being evaluated. Early this week, the city of Dallas closed down bars and restaurants, except for to-go orders, and told theaters to close. On Monday, Trump suggested keeping gatherings to 10 people or fewer. Soon the virus was detected in all 50 states, and the number of positive tests and deaths looked like they were mirroring the early growth in Italy, where they’re now seeing more than 600 coronavirus deaths a day.  All of these factors played a role in the church’s deliberations. By the time I talked to Jeffress on Thursday, he said he had made its decision for Sunday.  “This will be the first time in the 152-year history of First Baptist Church of Dallas that we will not meet,” he told me.  Sunday, he will stand on stage alone in the sanctuary, with a minimal camera and light crew. He’ll preach to an audience he cannot see and cannot hear. If people are moved by what he says, he won’t know it, at least not immediately. That’s the church’s policy going forward: no plans to resume live services. This is the new normal.  “It's very eerie,” he told me. “But I think we have a responsibility not only for the safety of our members, but for the citizens of Dallas to do our part in trying to keep our city safe.” Jeffress grew up around First Baptist and he’s preached somewhere nearly every Sunday of the year for decades now. Usually, there are dozens of people roaming the halls and offices of the church. Between the family events, recruiting events, community Bible studies, there’s almost always something going on somewhere. But for now, the offices are nearly empty. As he talked about it, he sounded downright melancholy.  “It's sad to think about people not being able to come together,” he told me. “This is the time that we really need one another, and yet we have to follow common-sense guidelines because of our care for other people. But personally, it's very sad for me as a pastor, not to be able to be with his congregation.” I know he’s particularly savvy when it comes to publicity. I asked if there was any part of him that wanted to hold service despite the new guidelines, if only to force the government to shut it down. Imagine the optics! Jeffress laughed. “There was zero part of me that was tempted to do that,” he said. “People should not confuse faith with foolishness.” He reminded me that every morning when he gets on the highway, he prays for his safety, but he wears a seat belt, too. “God expects us to certainly exercise faith,” Jeffress told me. “But common sense as well.”",One of Trump’s Evangelical Defenders Wrestles With Flattening the Curve,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/22/coronavirus-trump-robert-jeffress-evangelical-supporter-140355,politico
"In Finland, they’re drinking boxed wine and playing Korona, the board game. In Greece, they’re stockpiling feta. The French refuse to stop kissing. ISIS is telling its members to avoid traveling to Europe to conduct attacks. And, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, hand-washing stations are everywhere; they know the drill. As coronavirus continues its deadly spread, the whole world is preparing for the onslaught in similar ways—social distancing, working from home, panic buying at their local grocery stores. But people in different countries are also weathering this crisis in vastly different ways, finding, for example, different products to hoard, different ways to pass the time, different people to blame and even different things to worry about. Over the last week, I emailed, texted and posted a request on Facebook for friends around the world—including a network of acquaintances and colleagues I’ve built over 20 years working in foreign policy, living in Europe and traveling widely—to tell me about their lives under coronavirus watch: items in scarce supply, coping mechanisms, jokes and the effect of culture and history on national responses. In total, I heard from more than 90 people in 68 countries, all of whom sent me anecdotes, press clips and Twitter videos providing a snapshot of life in mid-March under COVID-19. Here’s what I’ve learned so far. You probably think everybody’s buying toilet paper. And across the Western world, you’d be right. A dramatic supermarket fight over TP between two Australian women went viral. When the Dutch prime minister visited a grocery store, he reassured shoppers there was sufficient supply so “we can all poop for 10 years.” (Perhaps more worrisome, a 2015 survey found the Dutch were the least likely among Europeans to wash their hands after using the restroom; Bosnians and Turks fared much better.) A Lebanese friend cited a local saying that “we lived 20 years of civil war and never once were we out of toilet paper.” The great divide occurs around the use of bidets. As a Jordanian smugly told me, the TP hoarders are those who don’t use them. An Azerbaijani friend said his compatriots “tend to use water.” An amused Bosnian pointed out that toilet paper takes up storage space and people could simply shower. And an American posted on Facebook that her husband presciently requested a bidet last Christmas; sales have recently increased ten-fold. Across Africa, expats told me many people there cannot afford or culturally do not use toilet paper. As hand sanitizer and other cleaning products are in short supply everywhere, friends shared the desperate measures and creative thinking from their countries. In the UK, people have ripped hand sanitizers off the walls in doctors’ offices and stolen bottles from hospitals. In the Czech Republic, a friend saw a doctor on television dismiss concerns about a lack of disinfectant by citing the example of Moravia, where people make their own alcohol from apricots and plums. In Turkey, people are relying on a longtime tradition; Kolonya, a cologne whose alcohol to essential oils ratio can reach 80 percent, is found in nearly every Turkish household and ceremonially poured into the palm of visitors as a sanitizer. In Istanbul, one man offered it to riders on the subway. Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko joked that vodka is not only a good hand sanitizer, but its consumption could help kill the virus. The situation is better in South Korea, where press reports cite bottles of hand sanitizers in elevators and people dressed in costumes at subway entrances reminding the public to wash their hands.  While Westerners are being schooled in proper handwashing techniques, expat friends in African countries previously afflicted with Ebola said people there are already well-informed about proper sanitation measures. For example, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) there are handwashing stations (described as “little plastic tanks with chlorinated water and a faucet”) in every restaurant, store, business and airport. In Niger, the government has been continuing public safety campaigns and sending daily communications with doctors’ phone numbers if people suspect they are sick.  In the West, people are mostly avoiding masks, heeding doctors’ pleas to save them for health workers. But they are ubiquitous in Asia, though many already wore them to address air pollution. An Indian friend reported that a temple covered its idols with masks to protect them. In Lebanon, a friend said masks are serving a new purpose: Many women get botox in their lips every few months, but now some are wearing masks and postponing their fillers.  Germans, who have a word for everything, describe panic shopping as “Hamsterkauf”— mindless spending like a hamster storing food in its cheeks. Almost everyone across the Western world is stockpiling pasta. Spaniards are panic-buying toilet paper and jamón, with a meme showing someone slicing a loo roll as if it were meat. An expat in Kyrgyzstan heard radio commentators encouraging people to buy sugar and flour. Moldovans are purchasing garlic, with the cost recently tripling. Afghans are stockpiling rice, wheat and cooking oil, as prices skyrocket. Feta cheese sales are high in Greece. Serbs are buying rakija (a fruit brandy), while Finns are investing in multi-liter boxed wines. In the Netherlands, people panicked after the government announced plans to close “coffee shops” and formed long lines to stock up on weed.  Some shoppers are driven by memories of previous periods of deprivation. In Lithuania, a friend saw Soviet echoes in purchases of buckwheat and other grain for making porridges, pasta and potatoes. In Denmark, people are buying rye bread and yeast. (A Danish friend explained that a 1998 labor strike led to yeast hoarding when locals anticipated shops closing; although a shortage occurred then, producers anticipated the coming crisis and ensured sufficient capacity.) Several Bosnian expats, who survived a devastating war when the capital was under siege for 1,425 days, said the experience left a “huge imprint.” Their families in Sarajevo began storing food weeks ago, while others are planting more vegetables than usual. An Iraqi friend said decades of political instability and price uncertainty have long led people to store enough food in their houses to last at least a month. He recalled his father in the 1980s buying 50lb bags of rice and an entire sheep to keep in the freezer. Amid coronavirus, his mother is supplementing their existing stockpile with extra toothpaste and batteries for flashlights. A German friend with a Vietnamese wife said his in-laws call daily with advice about preparing for difficult situations and recommendations for natural treatments. Closer to home, a friend’s sister-in-law in Puerto Rico said “people have been buying supplies as if they are getting ready for a hurricane.” There is less concern elsewhere about food availability. Friends in stricken Italy and China reported a gradual reduction in panic buying as supply chains continue to function. Similarly, an Iranian friend said shoppers there were relatively relaxed, given memories of sufficient provisions during past wars. An expat in Vietnam reported that neighborhoods under quarantine near her get daily rations of rice, eggs, protein and cooking oil. In Africa, people have generally limited means to stockpile, which a Senegalese friend described as a “very Western concept.”  Others are more worried about their long-term economic survival. Ukraine and Georgia experienced extreme deprivation in the 1990s, which a local friend said created a survivor mentality; although people are not hoarding commodities, many are buying as much hard currency as possible. An Azerbaijani friend described calm at the stores but panic at the banks, as people want to buy dollars in anticipation of a currency devaluation amid declining oil prices.  People around the world are losing access to their traditional gathering places, which have closed as a health precaution: hookah bars in the Middle East, karaoke bars in Asia and banyas (public saunas) in Central Asia. In Greece, the government launched a communications campaign with the hashtag #menoume_spiti (stay at home). Spaniards have promoted their own self-quarantine, with hashtags saying #quedateencasa (stay at home) and #yomequedoencasa (I’m staying home). After seeing online images of Dubliners in packed bars last Saturday, the hashtag #closethepubs started trending in Ireland; the government ordered them to close the following day. Despite the “she’ll be right mate” attitude of Australians, a friend there said her sports-obsessed compatriots are stressed by the cancellation of participatory and televised events.  Several governments are taking extreme steps to enforce social distancing rules. In Italy, residents are only allowed to leave home for work, food, health or emergencies. They must carry an “auto-certification” form whenever they head outside, which can be downloaded from the Interior Ministry website, that describes their origin and destination. Failure to comply could result in jail time and a $230 fine. France is similarly requiring residents to carry documentation justifying “essential” reasons for being outside their homes, while the German state of Bavaria is imposing $27,000 fines if people violate new lockdown measures. In Serbia, the government deployed the army to its borders and the streets of its capital city to enforce the new state of emergency, including the requirement that those older than 70 remain home. In some countries, critics have accused governments of violating privacy rights. The Israeli government’s security agency is using cellphone data to track those under quarantine. The South Korean government is using technology to trace the movements of infected people before they were diagnosed, which it then publishes online so others can determine if their paths crossed.  Responses to these restrictions vary. Finns, who are renowned for their introversion, joke about having long wanted mandatory social distancing. As families prepare for a period of seclusion, a Finnish friend said people are purchasing a classic board game that coincidentally happens to be called Korona (the Finnish spelling of the virus). Likewise, an English friend joked that his country’s “main contribution to disease control is the social isolation we learn from childhood. It only breaks down in queues. It’s OK to talk in queues. But definitely not in lifts or on the tube. And certainly not over breakfast.” Others find it harder to adapt. The French are continuing their signature “la bise” greeting, with one survey reporting 66 percent of respondents greeted friends with cheek kisses in recent days. In Argentina, an expat reported that locals are struggling to stop sharing mate (the national tea drink). You’ve probably seen the beautiful scenes of quarantined Italians, singing together from their balconies. In Madrid, sequestered residents gathered on their terraces last Saturday evening to cheer their health workers. In Colombia, “ciclovía culture” (biking) remains strong. In Germany, the American dating show “Love is Blind” ranks third on Netflix and stores report shortages of barbells. Sadly, the Eurovision song contest has been cancelled. A new genre of reality show has emerged in China: livestreams of celebrities and regular people singing, cooking and exercising at home. Yet an expat in Kazakhstan predicted increasing frustration there, as the government has long throttled the internet, limiting access to YouTube, Twitter and WhatsApp, in the evenings when the president’s rival is online.  Mosques across the Middle East were closed, with worshipers urged to pray at home instead. Saudi Arabia temporarily banned Umrah pilgrimages, which can be undertaken by Muslims at any time of year, to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; the government has not yet decided about the annual Hajj in July.  Churches have also been shuttered. Poland’s first coronavirus victim was the wife of a church steward who distributed communion during mass. A Polish friend said bishops revised their approach after that, explaining communion could be experienced spiritually instead of physically. Although the church initially increased the number of masses to comply with government restrictions on group gatherings, it has begun encouraging worshippers to watch broadcasts instead amid tightening limits. In some places, coronavirus has affected the relationship between church and state. Greece’s Orthodox Church caused controversy by stating that attendance at Eucharist and communion “cannot be a cause of disease transmission.” As doctors protested, the government intervened, with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis invoking his faith while advocating the need to follow scientific advice.  In addition, I learned about numerous kissing constraints. Orthodox worshippers in countries like Lithuania were told to stop kissing religious icons, while Spanish Catholics were advised against kissing statues. In Israel, the Chief Rabbi ruled that people should stop kissing the mezuzah when they enter or depart Jewish homes.  An expat in Moldova reported people drinking hot tea, which they believe will kill the virus. An Indian friend told me ayurvedic home remedies (such as turmeric and ginger) and cow urine are being recommended there as ways to get rid of the disease. In Lebanon, some Christian worshippers are delivering a mixture of holy water and soil from the grave of Saint Charbel Makhlouf, which is believed to have miraculous healing powers, to infected patients in Beirut hospitals. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has a nonchalant approach to the crisis, showed an audience the good luck charms—including an American two dollar bill and four leaf clover—that he carries in his wallet as “bodyguards.”  In Afghanistan, the Taliban tweeted assurances to international health organizations of their readiness to coordinate on coronavirus and urged special attention to the health of their prisoners in Afghan jails. In Libya, an expat’s friend said the existing closure of airports is largely positive as a containment measure, though people are worried that restrictions on borders and the entry of foreigners could affect the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The Syrian government has denied the existence of any coronavirus cases, but press reports cite concern among over-stretched hospitals and aid workers in refugee camps about their limited capacity to manage an outbreak. Even ISIS has issued health instructions, using Koranic verses, on washing hands, avoiding infected areas, and coughing or sneezing into hands or clothes. The group’s newsletter also advised its members against traveling to Europe for terror attacks given the pandemic there.  Racist attacks on Asian people in numerous countries have been well-documented. In China, an expat reports the opposite concern: a fear of foreigners. Although the virus is largely under control there, many fear a resurgence from overseas—even though new cases in the country are almost exclusively Chinese travelers who went abroad and returned home.  In Africa, the coronavirus is largely seen as a foreign intrusion, with early cases reported from European travelers or residents who recently visited Europe. For example, the Central Africa Republic just had its first case, from an Italian who had been in Milan. The first case in the DRC was a Congolese national who returned to Kinshasa from his home in France. Anti-foreigner sentiment is rising in Ethiopia, where typical derogatory comments targeting “ferengi” (foreigner) are now being combined with “corona.” Reports of foreigners being harassed and assaulted in coronavirus-related incidents—including being hit with stones, spat on, chased and denied transportation services—led the U.S. Embassy there to issue a travel advisory this week.  An Afghan friend said some of his compatriots believe coronavirus is a conspiracy from infidel countries to prevent Muslims from practicing their religious rights, while others view it as a new economic warfare tool between the U.S. and China that doesn’t affect them. The Taliban suggested coronavirus is a God-sent scourge in response to “disobedience” and “sins of mankind.” In Egypt, the minister of religious affairs accused the Muslim Brotherhood of seeking to spread the coronavirus among the military, police, judiciary and media. The Iranian regime has blamed the U.S. and Israel, while Chinese officials have suggested the disease was brought to their country by the American army. The United States is not immune to the conspiracy theory trend; for example, former congressman Ron Paul called it a “big hoax” and Liberty University President Jerry Falwell blamed the North Koreans. When South African President Cyril Ramaphosa instructed his citizens on the healthy elbow bump, it quickly became a local dance move. Even in Syria, there are music videos; this one lambasts President Bashar al-Assad as the “real corona.” A viral clip from Britain’s classic tv show “Yes, Minister” about hapless government officials reflects how many feel about London’s sluggish response. A Serbian friend shared a circulating video that shows a pig being roasted the traditional way on a spit; the swine is wearing a face mask, as an off-camera voice cites the importance of prevention. There is widespread chuckling about the number of divorces and births that coronavirus may cause. A popular Twitter meme says: “Your grandparents were called to war. You are being called to sit on a couch. You can do this!” A common European joke says it is the first time in history that the original is from China and the copy is from Milan. Azerbaijanis love garlic and onion, so they suggest that their eating habits will induce social distancing and destroy the virus. Self-deprecating Kosovars jest that “even the virus doesn’t want to visit Kosovo.” Inspired by the crowded supermarkets in Bulgaria, someone there wrote a parody of a classic poem about the historic battle at Shipka Pass in 1877 during the Russo-Turkish war. The new version describes a bloody grocery store battle, which rages until Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and President Donald Trump arrive to impose order.","Cologne Sanitizer, Boxed Wine and Bidets: How People in 68 Countries Are Coping With Coronavirus",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/22/cologne-sanitizer-boxed-wine-and-bidets-how-people-in-68-countries-are-coping-with-coronavirus-140648,politico
"Donald Trump’s MAGA followers finally agree: the coronavirus threat is real. But there’s now a growing chorus worried the president might overdo the response.  The fear is that the media and mass hysteria has cowed Trump into fully tanking the economy in response to what they believe is a dangerous, but not apocalyptic, disease. Despite warnings from Trump’s own health officials that millions could die unless drastic action is taken, some of the president’s supporters worry that the dangers of overreacting could also be severe.  “More than a month of people actually quarantined will break down civil society. Nobody is used to this, and when the money runs out for people they will get desperate — and there’s not enough money the government can dole out that’ll be enough,” said David Reaboi, the former vice president for strategic communications at the far-right Center for Security Policy think tank and a political commentator. “People will start to panic, then [begin] killing and looting. And we’ll face a society-wide crisis that’s more than simply economic. Absorbing the death of a certain number of people is preferable to that, if those are the options. Amazing and horrible to even think like that, but here we are.” A variation of the debate has also started to infiltrate more mainstream circles, with a much-read Wall Street Journal editorial recently weighing how much financial devastation is worth the health benefits a prolonged economic stoppage will bring. Public health officials insist such measures are necessary for now, noting the coronavirus is far worse than the flu — it is at least 10 times as lethal and about three times as contagious, according to officials. And recent data has also shown that the disease may pose greater risks to younger generations than previously thought — nearly 40 percent of coronavirus hospitalizations were people aged 20 to 54, according to a government report. The fall-out has ramifications for Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, robbing the president of his most-common talking point — that he has overseen a growing economy. Instead Trump is facing criticism that problems with coronavirus testing and his own misleading rhetoric harmed efforts to quash the disease’s spread. And with large gatherings barred for the foreseeable future, Trump’s energetic rallies are off for now. After initially downplaying the coronavirus threat, Trump has gotten behind severe measures to slow the disease’s spread. He supported governors as they ordered the closure of all restaurants and bars and applauded shelter-at-home orders, even as it caused the stock market to tank and sent businesses sliding toward bankruptcy. Trump himself has directed Americans to avoid any gathering of more than 10 people. The reaction among Trump’s supporters is evolving, as well. A week after Trump’s base seemed to be splitting over the seriousness of the coronavirus, the quarrel is now over how much the government should damage the economy in response to the present threat. “For generation X and younger MAGA influencers, we’re pretty much all uniformly on board with social distancing [and] flattening the curve policies. [The] only discussion is about severity,” said Jack Posobiec, a correspondent with the Trump-friendly One America News Network.  Posobiec advocates a “kill this thing, whatever it takes” approach, but acknowledged that “the draconian nature of government edicts is definitely something that causes old school conservatives to viscerally recoil — especially as pertains to business.” It will inevitably be difficult for Trump to please his entire base, though. Some think Trump should deploy any emergency power that would help contain the virus. Others believe shutting down major sectors of the economy for weeks — dramatically limiting personal freedoms in the process — is misguided. Reaboi worried that the people able to drive the conversation about the shutdown--”information economy folks [who] are used to telecommuting and taking two weeks of vacation”--were disconnected from the very real struggles of people who need to physically be at their work.  “Those people are still the lifeblood of the economy, and even the telecommuters depend on them being at their jobs. There are millions of people like that who are uncertain about their futures now, and it’s not long until worry becomes panic, and panic becomes terror. What happens after that is a nightmare for everyone, even the tweeters most alarmed by the virus.” Fiscal conservative circles are starting to have their own discussion about how long the Trump administration should leave the economy fallow. The Wall Street Journal editorial board on Thursday called the extreme social-distancing policies “necessary,” but warned that they were not “sustainable.” “There is no amount of money that can make up for losses of the magnitude we are facing if this extends for several more weeks,” the piece said. “If this government-ordered shutdown continues for much more than another week or two, the human cost of job losses and bankruptcies will exceed what most Americans imagine.”  The Trump administration has stressed that two weeks of strict social distancing will help avoid an overwhelming crush of patients at hospitals that are already struggling with resource shortages. Trump’s advisers have said they will reassess those guidelines around the end of the month.  Yet in recent days, there have been signs that the situation is growing more dire in hard-hit areas, including California and New York. Both states have issued stay-at-home orders, and other states, such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Illinois, are following suit. Health care professionals are also scrounging for basic medical equipment, such as masks, to protect themselves — a shortage the Trump administration has vowed to address. More hardline Trump supporters claim the media and Democrats are still putting much of the pressure on Trump to fully stall the economy, even as other countries take similar steps and Republican governors implement economic restrictions almost identical to those of Democratic governors. Conservative commentator Candace Owens initially urged at-risk elderly people to quarantine themselves instead of shutting down bars and restaurants — an assertion health officials warn is dangerous because it ignores the fact that people of all ages are falling severely ill from this disease.  “Life does not mean ‘you get to live forever,’” Owens said during a March 16th Periscope stream, calling the “mass hysteria” surrounding coronavirus a media-driven “social experiment” that showed how much personal liberty people — particularly ostensible small-government conservatives — would shed during a crisis.  “The majority of Americans are not reacting in a way that you think that they should be acting because you’re fearful,” she said. “And if you believe in freedom, freedom doesn’t suddenly stop when you get scared.” A segment of American voters, particularly those who sided with Trump through the past three years of scandals, agree.  “We’re Americans, right? We don't live in a communist country, nor do we have to stay indoors,” said Katie Williams, a Las Vegas woman running for Carson County school board, citing Owens as an influence Williams blamed the media and liberals for pushing things this far.  “I mean, we are just one step away from communism at that point, you know?” she said. “With this media hype about the coronavirus, I think a lot of more democratic politicians, local politicians, are trying to push that agenda into more of a communist rule.” Williams' commentary went viral last week when she fired off a snarky tweet Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in defiance of the popular progressive’s plea for people to stop going to restaurants.  “I just went to a crowded Red Robin and I’m 30,” Williams tweeted. “It was delicious and I took my sweet time eating my meal. Because this is America. And I’ll do what I want.” Williams does not believe her tweet was endangering public health.  “I don't have it. I haven't been exposed to anyone who has it,” she said to Politico. “I don't have any elderly people in my 10-foot radius of where I would go. And so when people were like, ‘You're irresponsible, you're out there spreading it,’ I'm like, ‘I can't spread it if I don't have it.’”  Health officials have pushed back against such logic, cautioning that younger people may not realize they’re infected and contagious. Still, Williams said that her tweet was simply meant to underline the hypocrisy of Ocasio-Cortez’s statement days earlier that “racism” was behind people avoiding Chinese restaurants after the disease originated in China. To this point, the Trump administration has taken several steps to keep Americans afloat during the crisis, delaying the tax filing deadline and suspending federal student loan payments for 60 days. The White House is also negotiating a massive stimulus package that could top $2 trillion and include loans to businesses and one-off payments to people.  In a comment to Politico, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign touted recent polling showing that the public largely approved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “President Trump ignited the American economy once before. He is clearly the leader to restore our position once we are through this crisis. Joe Biden would undo all of the hard work that built the economy,” they said. For Trump voters, and the wider universe of people who generally support Trump, the tug-of-war between acting in the interest of public health and keeping Americans financially secure is only likely to grow stronger. “People diverge on severity of crisis versus economic cost,” Reaboi said. “It’s a real issue. Anyone who’s not taking that balance seriously is an idiot.”",A new MAGA movement debate: Is Trump overdoing it?,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/maga-movement-trump-coronavirus-140949,politico
"A U.S. House Democrat has been working to enlist the leader of a foreign government in a debate over a proposed copper mine in her state. The trick is that leader is Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Minnesota Rep. Betty McCollum hopes that Trudeau will insert himself in the fray based on a 100-year-old treaty between Canada and the U.S. that governs the countries’ treatment of boundary waters. Opponents of the project near the Minnesota-Ontario border say it would threaten pristine waters and risk violating the binational treaty. The proposed mine would be located about five miles from the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. ""From the air it looks like a green carpet, gouged southwest to northeast by glaciers,"" wrote a travel writer after time spent in the area. ""From the water it looks like another time — when nature was not a thing that grew at the edge of civilization."" What makes McCollum's pressure campaign to protect the area unusual is how publicly she has appealed to leaders outside the U.S. for intervention. The extent of the Canadian government’s willingness to engage is unclear. Communities and First Nations in Ontario upstream from the Twin Metals mine site question whether they’ll get to air their concerns about a massive resource development project that would be just miles away and subject to U.S. permitting rules. Any construction on the proposed copper mine, which environmentalists say poses the risk of leaching toxic slurry into the Boundary Waters, is likely years away. Proponents argue the mine would bring jobs to an economically distressed area of the state and would yield minerals integral to advanced technologies ranging from smartphones to wind turbines. The canoe wilderness is a federally protected area that doesn’t allow even motorized fishing boats and limits the number of canoe permits to keep the number of people there at any given time low. Trudeau has just come off a rocky few years with the president during which Canada grappled with the possibility that free trade with its biggest customer would evaporate. It's unclear he’d readily go to bat again over something like the mine, which is owned by a subsidiary of Chilean mining conglomerate Antofagasta. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said last month that the Liberal government is “very engaged” on the issue, though she offered no specifics. “It’s a proposal for a future project and it’s something that Canada definitely is involved in and will continue to work with our American partners on,” she said. The Canadian government has signaled its wariness. “Canada is concerned about the potential for increased mining activity within the basin which could contaminate boundary waters if not properly assessed and managed, putting Canadian water quality and ecosystems at risk,” Global Affairs Canada wrote in January 2019 to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management as part of the public comment process for the agency’s draft environmental assessment of renewing the mineral leases. The Canadian government asked BLM to clarify how federal and state governments will coordinate separate review processes to account for potential cross-border impacts, plus how BLM will interact with Canada “to better understand potential impacts to Canadian waters and ecosystems.” Becky Rom, national chairwoman of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters, said she checks regularly with Canadian officials and believes they've yet to receive a response from BLM. Katherine Cuplinskas, a spokesperson for Freeland, did not comment on whether the government had received answers to its questions. BLM renewed Twin Metals Minnesota’s leases on May 15, and the company formally applied for federal and state permits in December. The Trump administration has moved to speed up environmental reviews and permitting processes for certain projects, but state regulators are conducting a separate review. The company says it expects those studies to take five to seven years. The International Joint Commission, a binational agency borne out of the 1909 treaty, is advising both governments on environmental issues tied to mining activity through the International Rainy-Lake of the Woods Watershed Board. ""Together, these represent the most appropriate forums to discuss the potential impacts and mitigation measures related to current mining activities and any new mining projects within the Rainy River Watershed,"" said Twin Metals spokesperson Kathy Graul. Still, some community leaders in Ontario are beginning to agitate for Canada to do more to notify communities near the watershed about the project and its potential impacts. Douglas Judson, a municipal Council member in Fort Frances, Ont., said his community — which borders Minnesota and is in the pathway of water flow from where the mine would be built — is still gathering information about the proposal. He said he suspects engagement has been limited in part because Global Affairs Canada is handling the issue due to its diplomatic implications. “I think that if the project were in Canada, there would be a very different discussion happening right now, and right now there’s no discussion happening,"" he told POLITICO. McCollum, whose district covers the city of St. Paul and is nearly 250 miles from the proposed mine site, is using her role as an appropriator to try to put the brakes on the project. She slipped language into the fiscal 2020 spending bill that required the State Department to report back to lawmakers on the effects of sulfide-ore copper mining in the area and U.S. plans to mitigate the risk of cross-border pollution. The department sent lawmakers an eight-paragraph response that McCollum called “embarrassingly inadequate.” She called on Ottawa to compel the Trump administration to release the “confidential” report in a scathing Feb. 20 statement. McCollum has said she plans to continue to press the issue during the fiscal 2021 appropriations process, specifically promoting “the need for a mining pollution early-warning system to protect our cross-boundary waters and prevent treaty violations.” She also has introduced a bill to effectively yank the leases from Twin Metals Minnesota by permanently withdrawing 234,328 acres of federal land in the Rainy River Watershed from most resource development. In 2016, the Obama administration proposed banning mining there for 20 years. The Trump administration canceled an environmental study of that proposal in 2018 and has refused to release any preliminary findings. McCollum attempted to revive the study in the fiscal 2020 spending measure for federal resource and environmental agencies, but the White House won out during eleventh-hour negotiations over the broad appropriations package. The project isn't without support in Congress. GOP Rep. Pete Stauber, who represents the district where the mine would be built, has blasted McCollum's attempts to get in the way. His Democratic predecessor, former Rep. Rick Nolan, also supported the mine. Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith haven't opined one way or the other but have called on the administration to finish the environmental study. Even so, the project isn't without challenges in the U.S. legal system. A federal judge heard oral arguments in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's reinstatement of the leases in December. Judson said he's communicated with the office of rookie Liberal MP Marcus Powlowski, whose riding includes Fort Frances, to bring together bureaucrats from Global Affairs and Environment and Climate Change Canada to discuss the project's implications in his community, which includes a number of First Nations. “Canada is going through a moment right now on engagement and the role for Indigenous communities in environmental conservation and resource development,” Judson said. Diplomacy, he said, is “maybe sacrificing that community engagement right now, and that is a little bit troubling.”",House Democrat trying to enlist Trudeau in fight to save boundary waters ,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/justin-trudeau-minnesota-mine-betty-mccollum-139648,politico
"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s supreme leader refused U.S. assistance Sunday to fight the new coronavirus, citing an unfounded conspiracy theory that the virus could be man-made by America. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s comments come as Iran faces crushing U.S. sanctions blocking the country from selling its crude oil and accessing international financial markets. But while Iranian civilian officials in recent days have increasingly criticized those sanctions, 80-year-old Khamenei instead chose to traffic in the same conspiracy theory increasingly used by Chinese officials about the new virus to deflect blame for the pandemic. “I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?” Khamenei said. “Possibly your medicine is a way to spread the virus more.” He also alleged without offering any evidence that the virus “is specifically built for Iran using the genetic data of Iranians which they have obtained through different means.” “You might send people as doctors and therapists, maybe they would want to come here and see the effect of the poison they have produced in person,” he said. There is no scientific proof offered anywhere in the world to support Khamenei’s comments. However, his comments come after Chinese government spokesman Lijian Zhao tweeted earlier this month that it “might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe(s) us an explanation!” Lijian likewise offered no evidence to support his claim, which saw the U.S. State Department summon China’s ambassador to complain. Wuhan is the Chinese city where the first cases of the disease were detected in December. In recent days, the Trump administration has increasingly referred to the virus as the “Chinese” or “Wuhan” virus, while the World Health Organization used the term COVID-19 to describe the illness the virus causes. Even a U.S. senator from Arkansas has trafficked in the unfounded conspiracy theory it was a man-made Chinese bioweapon. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. Scientists have not yet determined exactly how the new coronavirus first infected people. Evidence suggests it originated in bats, which infected another animal that spread it to people at a market in Wuhan. The now-shuttered Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market advertised dozens of species such as giant salamanders, baby crocodiles and raccoon dogs that were often referred to as wildlife, even when they were farmed. An article published last week in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Medicine similarly said it was “improbable” that the virus “emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus.” Khamenei made the comments in a speech in Tehran broadcast live Sunday across Iran marking Nowruz, the Persian New Year. He had called off his usual speech at Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad over the virus outbreak. His comments come as Iran has over 21,600 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus amid 1,685 reported deaths, according to government figures released Sunday. Iran is one of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the new virus. Across the Mideast, Iran represents eight of 10 cases of the virus and those leaving the Islamic Republic have carried the virus to other countries. Iranian officials have criticized U.S. offers of aid during the virus crisis as being disingenuous. They have accused the Trump administration of wanting to capitalize on its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since withdrawing from the nuclear deal in May 2018. However, the U.S. has directly offered the Islamic Republic aid in the past despite decades of enmity, like during the devastating Bam earthquake of 2003. Reassigning blame could be helpful to Iran’s government, which faced widespread public anger after denying for days it shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, killing 176 people. Widespread economic problems as well has seen mass demonstrations in recent years that saw hundreds reportedly killed. Iranian hard-liners have supported conspiracy theories in the past when it suited their interests. Following the Sept. 11 attacks, some publicly doubted al-Qaida’s role and state TV promoting the unfounded conspiracy theory that the Americans blew up the building themselves. Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad similarly raised doubt about the Sept. 11 attack, calling it a “big lie,” while also describing the Holocaust as a “myth.” Meanwhile on Sunday, Iran imposed a two-week closure on major shopping malls and centers across the country to prevent spreading the virus. Pharmacies, supermarkets, groceries and bakeries will remain open. In Saudi Arabia, the kingdom said its armed forces are now taking part in combating the virus, setting up mobile hospitals in various cities. And in Kuwait, authorities have instituted a nightly curfew from 5 p.m. to 4 a.m., warning violators face up to three years in prison and fines of $32,000 if arrested and convicted.","Iran leader refuses U.S. help, citing virus conspiracy theory",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/coronavirus-iran-conspiracy-theory-141188,politico
"Direct cash payments to American households will be a significant portion of the U.S. government’s response to the coronavirus crisis. The logic is clear: When people can’t leave their homes and businesses shut down, workers lose their paychecks. Cash injections from the government – whether in the form of checks or unemployment insurance – help cushion that blow. But that is only part of the equation for American families trying to get through this challenging period. It’s not only about cash coming into households, but also the cash going out. At a moment when some struggling households need every dollar to cover basic necessities, it doesn’t make sense for cash infusions from the government to go right back out the door to make routine monthly debt payments. The present situation is anything but routine. For the most vulnerable, amounts falling due on debt should take a back seat to meeting essential needs in this time of crisis. This is not just a humanitarian imperative. It also reflects a sound and established principle in responding to debt problems, from ancient Mesopotamia to modern financial crises. When borrowers face a “liquidity shock” – a sudden and potentially transitory loss of ability to pay – the correct response is to give more time to repay. Pursuing repayment in such circumstances produces unnecessary, avoidable, and lasting harm. With time to get back on their feet, borrowers not only have a better chance at discharging their debts. They also can participate more fully and productively as consumers and workers than is possible with impaired credit or the threat of bankruptcy. With Americans poised to experience their most abrupt liquidity shock in U.S. history – due to job losses from the sudden lockdown on economic activity – now is the time to deploy the full range of tools for addressing it. That includes deferral of near-term debt payments for those who need it. Here are the categories of payments that should be available for deferral:  Tax payments, student loans and other obligations to the government. At the federal level, announcements have already been made regarding the delay of required tax payments, as well as interest on student debt. Principal repayments on student loans are now also eligible for deferral. Similar relief should be extended to obligations associated with other government programs, such as loans to small businesses and other credit lines. Mortgage payments. Lenders should establish expedited processes for facilitating forbearance on mortgage payments for stressed borrowers. The federal government has just directed lenders that work with mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to offer affected homeowners payment flexibility for up to 12 months. Federal guarantees backstop any risk of credit losses on associated agency mortgage-backed securities. All mortgage servicers in the United States should use maximum possible latitude to facilitate deferred payments. Landlords receiving relief for mortgages on rental properties should pass through that benefit to their tenants by deferring rent payments. Auto loans, credit card payments and other debt. Financial institutions should work in an expedited fashion with vulnerable borrowers to implement interest-free deferrals of payments due on auto loans, credit cards, and other forms of consumer and business debt. These should be implemented with no penalties, fees, or negative reports to credit bureaus. Federal regulators have already encouraged financial institutions to work with customers who are having payment difficulties. Supervisory agencies should stress to these institutions that they will regard such actions favorably. Banks have indicated their willingness to implement forbearance programs, citing the model of natural disasters. But history has shown that actually achieving relief can be difficult and cumbersome for borrowers. A case in point is the mortgage modification programs following the housing collapse, which had disappointing utilization rates and consequently left many potential beneficiaries in financial distress. Many forbearance programs for natural disasters also have a poor track record.  Given the pervasive nature of this crisis and need to implement at scale, deferrals should utilize streamlined procedures that lower the barriers to accessing relief. Financial institutions already have extensive information about their customers. That can be the basis for proactive steps by banks to initiate forbearance. A web-based interface can take customer information, run it through preprogrammed algorithms, and speed up execution. In this crisis, eligibility criteria should be biased toward giving more access to relief, not less.  Thanks to the regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 crisis, banks entered the COVID-19 episode with sizable liquidity and capital buffers. Aggressive Federal Reserve operations give banks access to functionally unlimited financing at almost zero cost. These backstops mean that U.S. banks are in a position to implement forbearance programs that cushion the economy and American households against the initial shock without compromising their own financial integrity. The implementation details of all the above programs are important and require elaboration. They should be carefully designed to forestall unintended consequences in capital markets, as well as for borrowers. In particular, we must prevent households from building up excessive debt during this period that hampers their post-crisis recovery. It is certainly possible that the impact of COVID-19 on the economy will be prolonged, not transient. In such a case, further and more aggressive steps will be needed. Such uncertainties should not prevent swift action on deferrals now. Epidemiological uncertainties do not prevent us from implementing steps gauged to manage prospective risks.  Both government and financial institutions must be held accountable for stepping up at this critical moment. Facilitating forbearance is a financial analogue to social distancing. It is not sufficient to solve all economic problems linked to the epidemic, but it is a necessary early element of a response that limits the damage. Banks were the cause of the last crisis. They can be part of the solution to this one.",Banks Should Defer Consumer Debt to Save the Economy,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/03/22/deferring-consumer-debt-could-save-the-economy-for-everyone-140763,politico
"Donald Trump’s MAGA followers finally agree: the coronavirus threat is real. But there’s now a growing chorus worried the president might overdo the response.  The fear is that the media and mass hysteria has cowed Trump into fully tanking the economy in response to what they believe is a dangerous, but not apocalyptic, disease. Despite warnings from Trump’s own health officials that millions could die unless drastic action is taken, some of the president’s supporters worry that the dangers of overreacting could also be severe.  “More than a month of people actually quarantined will break down civil society. Nobody is used to this, and when the money runs out for people they will get desperate — and there’s not enough money the government can dole out that’ll be enough,” said David Reaboi, the former vice president for strategic communications at the far-right Center for Security Policy think tank and a political commentator. “People will start to panic, then [begin] killing and looting. And we’ll face a society-wide crisis that’s more than simply economic. Absorbing the death of a certain number of people is preferable to that, if those are the options. Amazing and horrible to even think like that, but here we are.” A variation of the debate has also started to infiltrate more mainstream circles, with a much-read Wall Street Journal editorial recently weighing how much financial devastation is worth the health benefits a prolonged economic stoppage will bring. Public health officials insist such measures are necessary for now, noting the coronavirus is far worse than the flu — it is at least 10 times as lethal and about three times as contagious, according to officials. And recent data has also shown that the disease may pose greater risks to younger generations than previously thought — nearly 40 percent of coronavirus hospitalizations were people aged 20 to 54, according to a government report. The fall-out has ramifications for Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, robbing the president of his most-common talking point — that he has overseen a growing economy. Instead Trump is facing criticism that problems with coronavirus testing and his own misleading rhetoric harmed efforts to quash the disease’s spread. And with large gatherings barred for the foreseeable future, Trump’s energetic rallies are off for now. After initially downplaying the coronavirus threat, Trump has gotten behind severe measures to slow the disease’s spread. He supported governors as they ordered the closure of all restaurants and bars and applauded shelter-at-home orders, even as it caused the stock market to tank and sent businesses sliding toward bankruptcy. Trump himself has directed Americans to avoid any gathering of more than 10 people. The reaction among Trump’s supporters is evolving, as well. A week after Trump’s base seemed to be splitting over the seriousness of the coronavirus, the quarrel is now over how much the government should damage the economy in response to the present threat. “For generation X and younger MAGA influencers, we’re pretty much all uniformly on board with social distancing [and] flattening the curve policies. [The] only discussion is about severity,” said Jack Posobiec, a correspondent with the Trump-friendly One America News Network.  Posobiec advocates a “kill this thing, whatever it takes” approach, but acknowledged that “the draconian nature of government edicts is definitely something that causes old school conservatives to viscerally recoil — especially as pertains to business.” It will inevitably be difficult for Trump to please his entire base, though. Some think Trump should deploy any emergency power that would help contain the virus. Others believe shutting down major sectors of the economy for weeks — dramatically limiting personal freedoms in the process — is misguided. Reaboi worried that the people able to drive the conversation about the shutdown--”information economy folks [who] are used to telecommuting and taking two weeks of vacation”--were disconnected from the very real struggles of people who need to physically be at their work.  “Those people are still the lifeblood of the economy, and even the telecommuters depend on them being at their jobs. There are millions of people like that who are uncertain about their futures now, and it’s not long until worry becomes panic, and panic becomes terror. What happens after that is a nightmare for everyone, even the tweeters most alarmed by the virus.” Fiscal conservative circles are starting to have their own discussion about how long the Trump administration should leave the economy fallow. The Wall Street Journal editorial board on Thursday called the extreme social-distancing policies “necessary,” but warned that they were not “sustainable.” “There is no amount of money that can make up for losses of the magnitude we are facing if this extends for several more weeks,” the piece said. “If this government-ordered shutdown continues for much more than another week or two, the human cost of job losses and bankruptcies will exceed what most Americans imagine.”  The Trump administration has stressed that two weeks of strict social distancing will help avoid an overwhelming crush of patients at hospitals that are already struggling with resource shortages. Trump’s advisers have said they will reassess those guidelines around the end of the month.  Yet in recent days, there have been signs that the situation is growing more dire in hard-hit areas, including California and New York. Both states have issued stay-at-home orders, and other states, such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Illinois, are following suit. Health care professionals are also scrounging for basic medical equipment, such as masks, to protect themselves — a shortage the Trump administration has vowed to address. More hardline Trump supporters claim the media and Democrats are still putting much of the pressure on Trump to fully stall the economy, even as other countries take similar steps and Republican governors implement economic restrictions almost identical to those of Democratic governors. Conservative commentator Candace Owens initially urged at-risk elderly people to quarantine themselves instead of shutting down bars and restaurants — an assertion health officials warn is dangerous because it ignores the fact that people of all ages are falling severely ill from this disease.  “Life does not mean ‘you get to live forever,’” Owens said during a March 16th Periscope stream, calling the “mass hysteria” surrounding coronavirus a media-driven “social experiment” that showed how much personal liberty people — particularly ostensible small-government conservatives — would shed during a crisis.  “The majority of Americans are not reacting in a way that you think that they should be acting because you’re fearful,” she said. “And if you believe in freedom, freedom doesn’t suddenly stop when you get scared.” A segment of American voters, particularly those who sided with Trump through the past three years of scandals, agree.  “We’re Americans, right? We don't live in a communist country, nor do we have to stay indoors,” said Katie Williams, a Las Vegas woman running for Carson County school board, citing Owens as an influence Williams blamed the media and liberals for pushing things this far.  “I mean, we are just one step away from communism at that point, you know?” she said. “With this media hype about the coronavirus, I think a lot of more democratic politicians, local politicians, are trying to push that agenda into more of a communist rule.” Williams' commentary went viral last week when she fired off a snarky tweet aimed at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in defiance of the popular progressive’s plea for people to stop going to restaurants.  “I just went to a crowded Red Robin and I’m 30,” Williams tweeted. “It was delicious and I took my sweet time eating my meal. Because this is America. And I’ll do what I want.” Williams does not believe her tweet was endangering public health.  “I don't have it. I haven't been exposed to anyone who has it,” she said to POLITICO. “I don't have any elderly people in my 10-foot radius of where I would go. And so when people were like, ‘You're irresponsible, you're out there spreading it,’ I'm like, ‘I can't spread it if I don't have it.’”  Health officials have pushed back against such logic, cautioning that younger people may not realize they’re infected and contagious. Still, Williams said that her tweet was simply meant to underline the hypocrisy of Ocasio-Cortez’s statement days earlier that “racism” was behind people avoiding Chinese restaurants after the disease originated in China. To this point, the Trump administration has taken several steps to keep Americans afloat during the crisis, delaying the tax filing deadline and suspending federal student loan payments for 60 days. The White House is also negotiating a massive stimulus package that could top $2 trillion and include loans to businesses and one-off payments to people.  In a comment to Politico, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign touted recent polling showing that the public largely approved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “President Trump ignited the American economy once before. He is clearly the leader to restore our position once we are through this crisis. Joe Biden would undo all of the hard work that built the economy,” they said. For Trump voters, and the wider universe of people who generally support Trump, the tug-of-war between acting in the interest of public health and keeping Americans financially secure is only likely to grow stronger. “People diverge on severity of crisis versus economic cost,” Reaboi said. “It’s a real issue. Anyone who’s not taking that balance seriously is an idiot.”",A new MAGA movement debate: Is Trump overdoing it?,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/maga-movement-trump-coronavirus-140949,politico
"American citizens in Peru who are trying to head home in response to the coronavirus outbreak are being held there by a Peruvian government that first wants assurances thousands of Peruvian citizens will be able to return from the U.S., according to two sources familiar with the situation. Peru is in the process of shutting down all international travel, but thousands of Americans are believed to remain in the country. An U.S. official familiar with the situation said the Peruvian government is not allowing them to leave until the White House ensures thousands of Peruvians are given safe passage home. “The government of Peru is basically holding these Americans hostage,” the U.S. official said. “They want the U.S. to fill planes with Peruvians before they’ll let the planes land to pick up Americans. But they’re not ready or organized in the United States to gather their people up, and they don’t want to pay for the flight.“ One American stuck in the South American nation said he received similar information from the office of Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. Feinstein’s office did not respond to a request for comment. “[The State Department’s] planned repatriation flights have not yet been approved by the Peruvian government,” read an email from Feinstein’s office to the stranded Americans. “They are requesting reciprocal support for their own citizens to leave the United States.” The State Department said it flew a group of Americans home on Saturday, including “medically vulnerable” citizens and some Peace Corps volunteers and embassy personnel. But a spokesperson did not comment on whether the Peruvian government is preventing the rest from leaving. U.S. diplomats estimate a few thousand Americans remain in Peru, a spokesperson did not respond to a question about the number. Peruvian officials, meanwhile, say they are merely trying to figure out how best to get each nation’s residents home. ""We are actively engaging State Department officials to coordinate in a harmonic way the best way to carry out bringing Americans from Peru back to the U.S. and Peruvians in the U.S. back to Peru,"" said Rodolfo Pereira, press counselor for the Peruvian Embassy in Washington. ""What we are trying to set up is the best system to conduct that operation."" Pereira dismissed questions about tensions between the two sides, saying there are constant communications, including at high levels, and that much of what is being discussed is logistics. In a phone interview, he said he didn't know exactly how many Peruvians in the United States were trying to get back home, but estimated that it was about 6,000. He described them as a mix of students, vacationers and temporary workers. He noted that Peru's government was trying to help its citizens stranded in other countries return as well while Peru imposes a full shutdown of its borders and airports. Asked about criticism that Peru was essentially taking Americans hostage until its citizens were brought back, Pereira said, ""No, that's not the case."" He said it was simply a matter of reciprocity. ""It's a two-way conversation,"" he said. He did not immediately respond to a follow-up question about whether Peru will cover the cost of the flights. He also urged Americans stranded in Peru to visit websites his government has arranged if they need assistance. Americans also remain stuck abroad in other countries, including Guatemala, which closed its borders this past week. The U.S. citizens there, having received little help from the embassy and unable to book flights home, are crossing the border with Mexico in droves to get to airports where planes are still taking off back to the U.S., several people on the ground told POLITICO. The State Department on Friday began flying charter flights from Morocco, another hotspot for Americans stranded abroad, back to 10 different U.S. airports. The U.S. government has made ""individual efforts"" to bring home about 3,000 Americans since the outbreak began affecting flight service, Vice President Mike Pence said at a Saturday afternoon White House press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic. ""I think there is an ongoing effort to address that with chartered commercial flights that the government is providing,"" Pence said. Military transport is also available, he said. ""We would just encourage any American that is looking on from overseas, contact the local U.S. Embassy,"" Pence said. ""Let them know about your circumstances. And know that we're going to work, continue to work very diligently to get our Americans home.""","Peru spars with U.S. over letting stranded Americans fly home during coronavirus outbreak

"Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Sunday sought to downplay public disagreement with President Donald Trump over whether a malaria drug could be used to treat coronavirus.  “There’s an issue here of where we’re coming from,” Fauci said on “Face the Nation” on CBS.  “The president, as heard, as we all have heard, what are what I call anecdotal reports that certain drugs work,” Fauci said. “So what he was trying to do and express was the hope that if they might work, let's try and push their usage. I, on the other side, have said I'm not disagreeing with the fact [that] anecdotally they might work, but my job is to prove definitively from a scientific standpoint that they do work.“ Fauci and Trump have publicly disagreed in recent days on whether the drug, hydroxychloroquine, could prevent Covid-19. Fauci said Friday that the drug had not been proved effective in clinical trials after Trump called attention to it in a press conference.  “I was taking a purely medical, scientific standpoint, and the president was trying to bring hope to the people,” Fauci said. “I think there's this issue of trying to separate the two of us.

"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called on President Donald Trump to send medically trained soldiers to his city to address escalating shortages amid the coronavirus outbreak. “All military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep, like New York, right now,” de Blasio said Sunday on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “The military is the best logistical organization in the nation. If there are ventilators being produced anywhere in the country, we need to get them to New York. Not weeks from now or months from now, in the next 10 days.“  “Why are they at their bases? Why are they not being allowed to serve?“ de Blasio said. “I guarantee you they're ready to serve. But the president has to give the order.“ More than 8,000 New Yorkers were confirmed sick as of Saturday, exacerbating fears that the city’s medical infrastructure will soon reach its breaking point. De Blasio has said the city could run out of medical supplies in as soon as two weeks. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday that the federal government would direct resources to Covid-19 hot spots, including New York.  “We were at the task force meeting yesterday, and it was very clear that the issue in New York was right on the front burner,” Fauci said on “Face the Nation“ on CBS. “The resources that are being marshaled are going to be clearly directed to those hot spots that need it most. And clearly that’s California, Washington state, and obviously New York is the most hard hit.“  De Blasio and other Democrats have called on Trump to compel businesses to manufacture more medical supplies through the Defense Production Act. “The American government is not at full bore right now,” the mayor said. “We've gotten no indication of any factory on 24/7 shifts.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) urged President Donald Trump on Sunday to order the emergency production of medical supplies, saying his reluctance to do so would “cost lives” as the New York medical system becomes overwhelmed.  “The fact that the president has not really invoked the Defense Production Act for the purpose … of emergency manufactur[ing] is going to cost lives,” Ocasio-Cortez said on “State of the Union“ on CNN.  “We’re thankful to anyone who’s pitching in on this effort, but we are nowhere near the beds and the capacity that we need in this country,” Ocasio-Cortez added.  “We’re hearing it every step of the way from this administration. First we were hearing it was a hoax. Then we were hearing that everything was fine. Then we were hearing that the fundamentals of the economy was OK until the crash comes. And we cannot wait until people start really dying in large numbers to start production.“  She also urged the quick passage of an “emergency relief package” targeted at individuals rather than corporations. “When this package rolls out, there is no reason for corporate bailouts to be included in an emergency relief package,” she said. “We should be focusing: Is unemployment expanding?

"States are competing against one another for medical supplies and, in many cases, overpaying amid a federal shortage, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Sunday.  “We’re competing against each other, we’re competing against other countries,“ Pritzker said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “It‘s a wide, wild west … out there. And indeed we’re overpaying, I would say, for [personal protective equipment] because of that competition.“ Pritzker said he’s gotten a fraction of the masks, gloves and gowns requested from the federal government. As a result, Pritzker said he’s deployed staff to purchase supplies on the open market internationally.  “I’ve got people on the phones, working the phones across the world, frankly, to get this stuff shipped to Illinois,” Pritzker said.  Pritzker also discussed his decision to move to a stay-at-home order for Illinois residents. “We have moved on now to a stay-at-home order,“ he said. “These should have been done nationally. They haven't been. But I have got to protect the 12.7 million people that live in my state. And I'm dedicated to that. It's their health and safety that matters most to me. It will work. It will work.“","It’s a ‘wild west’ for medical supplies in states, Pritzker says",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/wild-west-states-pritzker-says-141580,politico
"In early 2010, Dick Cheney assured conservatives that Barack Obama would be a one-term president, Sarah Palin teased a run for the presidency, and Donald Trump fired Rod Blagojevich from “Celebrity Apprentice.” Given how the world turns, it’s understandable why so many people were so wrong about the Affordable Care Act, signed into law 10 years ago Monday. Some treated the law like a panacea for the nation’s broken health care system, while others decried it as a certain step toward socialism. Some predicted it would end Obama’s political career and destroy the economy, while others said it would bring health care to every American — although the coronavirus pandemic has starkly shown the perils of being uninsured, or underinsured. We looked back at our favorite Obamacare predictions to see how they hold up in 2020. The results weren’t always pretty, but would you have ever guessed how important that one season of reality TV would be for Blagojevich? Not even close  The law’s insurance marketplaces never came close to hitting the projection from the nonpartisan number-crunchers at the Congressional Budget Office. Sign-ups have never topped 12.7 million, and enrollment has shrunken mildly since that peak in 2016, suggesting the marketplaces have, for now, hit a ceiling. The market never really expanded beyond those who received generous federal insurance subsidies. The CBO predicted that 4 million people would entirely pay their own way on the federal exchanges by 2016, but the actual number was closer to 1.3 million last year. “Arguably, Congress was overly stingy” said Sabrina Corlette, a researcher at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reform, arguing that the subsidies just didn’t reach enough people. Case in point: California saw new enrollment in its marketplace soar 41 percent this year after it began providing premium subsides to more middle-income people. At least two other important factors limited marketplace enrollment. The individual mandate penalty, before it was repealed, never pushed people to get covered as much as predicted. Also, employers were reluctant to dump workplace plans and send people onto the exchanges to buy their own coverage. Depends on who you ask Republicans warned the law’s mandates and new taxes would shrink the economy and kill jobs. Hardly. The private sector has grown every month since the law’s passage — at least until the virtual nationwide shutdown from coronavirus. Health care industry jobs fueled much of that growth in the past decade. In the law’s early years, Republican seized on a 2014 CBO projection that Obamacare would mean the equivalent 2.5 million fewer employers within a decade. Republicans for years claimed that was proof the law would kill jobs, but the CBO was accounting for people who would voluntarily stop working or log fewer hours because they would have a new affordable source for health insurance. In 2017, Stanford University economists found the law’s impact on jobs was close to nil. While some workers reduced their hours, a nearly equal number increased their hours to move off Medicaid and onto the exchanges, they said. Casey Mulligan, a conservative economist at the University of Chicago, argued the law’s employer mandate, requiring businesses of at least 50 full-time workers to provide coverage, kept a lot of small businesses from hiring more. And that the growth in health care jobs isn’t necessarily a good outcome, since that may have pulled money away from other sectors of the economy that might have benefited. Only if Congress kept the unpopular stuff During Obamacare’s drafting, central to Democrats’ argument for the law was the idea that it would actually be a budget saver, despite its hefty new spending on insurance subsidies and Medicaid expansion. It doesn’t seem to have worked out that way, in large part because Congress has repealed or delayed many of the provisions that would have raised revenue. Roughly half of the projected CBO savings came from a long-term care insurance program that was quickly shelved when the Obama administration determined it was financially unworkable. Congress on a bipartisan basis had also delayed taxes on health insurers and medical devices in the past decade until killing them off for good last year, blowing an estimated $373 billion hole in the budget the next decade. All of this has made it impossible to discern the law’s effect on the federal deficit. The CBO has long since given up, telling Congress in 2016 that such estimates were becoming “more challenging and less meaningful.” Not so much Candidate Barack Obama in 2008 repeatedly claimed that his health care plan would save families up to $2,500 per year on their premiums. Obamacare critics have spent more than a decade pointing to rising premiums in workplace health plans — now over $20,000 for the average family — as proof Obama was wrong. Obama’s defenders say he didn’t mean people would see a $2,500 cut in their premiums — rather, the slower than expected growth in health costs would translate to savings. The math was always fuzzy, but opponents had an easy attack line.  Here’s one way to think about this: The average employer premiums increased 26 percent between 2009 and 2014, when the Obamacare exchanges opened, but grew at a slightly slower pace of 22 percent in the following five years, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That slowdown in growth saved the average family about $1,000 per year. Not bad, but definitely not $2,500. Of course, it’s hard to say how much of those savings could be attributed to Obamacare measures promoting more efficient care. Economists have cited other factors, including hangover effects from the Great Recession and other changes in the industry, like the explosion of high-deductible plans requiring patients to pay more from their own pockets for care. Worst fears never materialized Some of the law’s critics predicted there just wouldn’t be enough doctors to care for all of the law’s new insured patients. Some Obamacare proponents argued the law’s plan to boost pay for primary care providers would alleviate the physician shortage. That didn’t quite work out. The nation is still facing a shortage of primary care physicians and wait times did increase. Two 2017 studies, from JAMA Internal Medicine and the New England Journal of Medicine, found that Medicaid and privately insured patients experienced a slight increase in wait times since Obamacare’s coverage expansion took effect in 2014. But the NEJM study found more appointments were available to Medicaid patients and the rate stayed about the same for privately insured patients. The upshot: Obamacare certainly didn’t buckle the health system. While wait times in some areas may have increased, there has also been a boom in urgent care clinics to help meet demand. Stay tuned In a rare instance of a bipartisan agreement, top congressional leaders at the time said Obamacare laid the foundation for single-payer — albeit for different reasons. John Boehner said the ACA set up the infrastructure for the government “to eventually take control of all of our health care.” Harry Reid, a few years after the law’s passage, said it was a “step” toward nationalized health care. Many on the left, fed up with ever-climbing health care costs and that 30 million Americans remain uninsured, are embracing a Sen. Bernie Sanders-style “Medicare for All” plan that would provide generous government insurance to virtually everyone. But many Democrats still view the idea skeptically, wary of its price tag and taking away private insurance. Still, a government-run insurance alternative known as a public option, which a decade ago was considered too radical for Obamacare, now has broad support among moderates. And you’ll find many progressives who say a public option is the next logical step to single payer — that was essentially Sen. Elizabeth Warren's health care plan. So, put this prediction in the TBD column. The jury is still out There were many who thought the Supreme Court decision upholding Obamacare in 2012, followed by Obama’s reelection that fall, would end existential threats to the law. The first indication that prediction wouldn’t pan out came two days after the 2012 election, when Boehner’s declaration that Obamacare was “the law of the land” sparked outrage on the right. Since then, Obamacare survived another major threat at the Supreme Court, when the justices in 2015 upheld the law’s insurance subsidy scheme, and a failed repeal effort during Trump’s first year in office. But it’s not out of the woods yet. Trump still muses that Republicans could repeal Obamacare if they retake full control of Washington. And there’s a more immediate threat to the law: The Supreme Court later this year is set to hear another case that could upend Obamacare. Ironically, the seeds of the latest challenge were sowed by Chief Justice John Robert’s 2012 decision upholding the individual mandate penalty as a tax. A group of red states, with the full support of the Trump administration, argue Congress’ decision to eliminate the penalty in its 2017 tax cut invalidated the individual mandate — and that the entire law must be struck. The lawsuit was once seen as a longshot, but it’s gained traction with Republican-appointed judges who have reviewed it. Roberts, just like in 2012, could hold the fate of the law in his hands. Not for some When the Supreme Court in the same 2012 case also ruled the federal government couldn’t force states to expand Medicaid, few Obamacare supporters predicted that even red states opposed to the law would refuse the program. After all, the federal government was paying at least 90 percent of the program’s costs — what state could pass that up? Some liberal pundits dismissed early refusals from Republican governors as brinksmanship, but the resistance has remained strong for a bloc of states. “I don’t think anybody anticipated the breadth and depth of political opposition that arose against this,” said Corlette, the Georgetown researcher. Fourteen states still have not expanded Medicaid, leaving about 4.5 million people without access to the program in those states. There are cracks in the resistance though. Since Trump’s election five states have expanded Medicaid, including four through ballot measures. Three more states — Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma — could join the program this year. Epically wrong  This is the most infamous prediction tied to the law. Obama’s assurances that people wouldn’t lose their doctor or insurer under the law were far too sweeping, and an estimated 4 million people received cancellation notices from health plans in 2013 as the law’s robust benefit requirements kicked in. PolitiFact labeled it “Lie of the Year,” and Obama apologized for the promise. The law did grandfather plans for people who purchased insurance before Obamacare was enacted, but the plans lost their protection if relatively minor changes were then made. To deal with the political uproar over plan cancellations, the Obama administration allowed an exception for these plans to continue — an allowance that exists today. Roughly 1.3 million people still have health plans that don’t conform to the law’s requirements. Insurance experts think that politically calculated decision to extend the old plans may have hurt Obamacare’s marketplaces in the early years. The older plans did not have to comply with many of the law’s requirements, such as protections for preexisting conditions, meaning the younger and healthier in those plans were likelier to keep the coverage while older and sicker customers gravitated toward robust Obamacare coverage. The law keeps going Republicans predicted the law would collapse under its own weight. Trump during his first year in office said the law was “imploding” before later declaring against all evidence that it’s “dead” and shouldn’t even be talked about anymore. Obamacare is still very much with us, and in many respects is stronger than it’s even been — unless the latest lawsuit kills it. Years of skyrocketing premiums have given way to modest declines in the past two years, and more insurers are signing up to sell coverage. HHS Secretary Alex Azar, who previously said Obamacare was “circling the drain,” boasts about how well the administration is running the law, even though insurance experts say the marketplaces have matured as they always expected. Despite turbulence around the law — the repeal efforts, the court challenges, the early HealthCare.gov struggles — the marketplaces seem to have stabilized. That’s largely thanks to its generous insurance subsidies, which have created a reliable base of customers shield from high premiums. Democrats not thrilled about Medicare for All have called for extending subsidies to more of the middle class. There’s little support for the idea among Republicans, who say Obamacare is too expensive and people need cheaper options. So, as Obamacare leaves its first decade, there’s one prediction we feel confident making about its second: You can keep your partisan fight over health care.",The Obamacare predictions that didn't quite pan out,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/the-obamacare-predictions-that-didnt-quite-pan-out-140547,politico
"Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor said Sunday that masks are currently being shipped to states, particularly hot spots like New York City and California — an announcement that comes as health care workers grow increasingly desperate for critical medical gear. However, Gaynor was unable to give more detail on when the masks would arrive or provide specific numbers. “They have been distributed. They've been distributed over the past couple of weeks. They're shipping today. They'll ship tomorrow,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”  ABC’s Martha Raddatz asked Gaynor if facilities would get them in time before the health system in critically affected states is overwhelmed. “Again, they're shipping today, they shipped yesterday and they're shipping tomorrow.” The White House coronavirus task force announced Saturday that 600 million N-95 masks were ordered to protect U.S. health care workers, but officials were unable to answer when they would be ready for use. At the briefing, Gaynor told reporters: “Every single governor across the country is looking for the exact same thing, so it’s a balance” and added that the masks “are out there now.” On Sunday, Raddatz pressed Gaynor: ""When you say 'they,' how many? Which masks? The new masks?"" ""I mean, it is hundreds of thousands of millions of things that we're shipping from the stockpile. I can't give you the details about what every single state of what every single city is doing,"" he responded. “But I'm telling you that we are shipping from our national stockpile, we're shipping from vendors, we're shipping from donations. It is happening. The demand is great."" Gaynor said the administration is prepared to “go to zero” in the national stockpile to meet medical demands.  He also reiterated that FEMA has been fulfilling its mandated mission in addressing the coronavirus, having let the Health and Human Services Department take the reins. “The public health medical mission, that authority lies with HHS“ Gaynor said. “My mission, FEMA, prior to this, natural disasters and those catastrophic events that happen. Now it's a different world.

"PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday that he would close the border if the U.K. did not take more restrictive measures to contain the coronavirus. “We had prepared the closure of our border and told Prime Minister Johnson we would implement it that day if there was no evolution [of British measures],” a senior French official familiar with the conversation told POLITICO. French paper Libération reported Saturday evening that Macron had “threatened” Johnson. The French official said that was “too strong a word” to describe the call. The U.K. on Friday ordered pubs and restaurants to shut, and asked people to stay indoors. Schools were also closed. However, Johnson’s office rejected any suggestion he had announced the stricter rules because of another country’s threats. “As the PM said on Friday these new measures were taken based on scientific advice and following the government’s action plan set out two weeks ago,” said a Downing Street official. Well before that call between Macron and Johnson, countries had started taking measures on their borders to contain the contagion, and to call for more homogenous measures across the EU. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on Monday for a temporary restriction on nonessential travel to the EU due to the coronavirus pandemic. (An exception would be made for the U.K. since it is still in a Brexit transition period.) The U.K. Foreign Office advised “against all non-essential international travel, initially for a period of 30 days,” effective Tuesday.

"Top congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet Sunday, as the Senate moves toward a key procedural vote on a massive $1.6 trillion-plus emergency economic package to deal with the coronavirus crisis.  And while Senate Republicans and Democrats say they are close to an agreement, they have yet to announce any deal.

According to a source familiar with the Republican text, there's still no language preventing layoffs for companies that accept federal aid. The source also said the tentative proposal gives too much discretion to the Treasury Department on who gets funds and does not include strong enough provisions to prevent stock buybacks. In addition, funding for the airline industry is a major sticking point.  Schumer and Pelosi have stayed in close touch with Mnuchin throughout the negotiations. Pelosi flew back to Washington on Saturday.  Late Saturday evening, McConnell instructed chairmen of key committees to draft language that senators could review before a floor vote Sunday that would advance the legislation, in an effort to meet a Monday deadline for passage. Democrats insist there’s no final deal.  While outstanding issues remain, Democrats are expected to see a win with $250 billion allocated to unemployment insurance — one of the major sticking points in the negotiations. In addition, billions are expected to go to hospitals to address the influx of patients due to the pandemic. Schumer has called for a “Marshall Plan” for hospitals. In addition, Sens.

Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), on the package’s small business provisions. The final deal on small businesses would amount to $350 billion, covering 58 million American workers and more than 30 million small businesses, Rubio tweeted Saturday. Meanwhile, hundreds of billions of dollars are expected to go to distressed industries, including airlines. Democrats insist the package include provisions to stop stock buybacks or increases in pay for top executives. Democrats have also pushed for expanded paid leave provisions.

"A federal judge in Los Angeles has rejected a plea from prominent convicted lawyer Michael Avenatti to be released from jail because of the risk he could contract the coronavirus. U.S. District Court Judge James Selna turned aside Avenatti’s claims that a bout he had with pneumonia last September puts him in grave danger if COVID-19 begins to rampage through federal prisons like the Manhattan detention center where he’s currently locked up. Avenatti, who was convicted by a New York federal court jury last month on charges of trying to extort shoemaking giant Nike and is facing other federal charges in Manhattan and Los Angeles, also contended that his cellmate was recently removed after exhibiting fever and a severe cough. But Selna, who revoked Avenatti’s bail in January based on evidence of extensive financial manipulation, said the health concerns were not adequate to justify his release. “The Court is mindful of the Covid 19 pandemic,” Selna wrote in a three-page order Saturday. “The Court accepts Avenatti’s showing that the had pneumonia about six months ago. ... However, there is no showing that his cellmate was infected by the virus, and there have been no reportedcases of Covid 19 at the New York MCC.” “There is no basis to release Avenatti on medical grounds,” added Selna, an appointee of President George W. Bush. “The Bureau of Prisons and MCC specifically have taken substantial steps to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. MCC has moved ‘at-risk’ prisoners, which presumably includes Avenatti, to a separate unit.” Avenatti rose to prominence in 2018 after filing a suit against President Donald Trump on behalf of adult film star Stormy Daniels, seeking to void a non-disclosure agreement the pair reached just prior to the 2016 election — a deal that appeared intended to hush up claims she and Trump had sex a decade earlier. Avenatti became a fixture on cable news shows and briefly mulled entering the 2020 Democratic presidential race. However, Avenatti and Daniels had an acrimonious relationship, with the porn star eventually switching to another lawyer last year. One of the three pending criminal cases against Avenatti involves charges he swindled Daniels out of nearly $300,000. Federal prosecutors opposed Avenatti’s recent request for release, arguing that his risk of infection is “minimal and entirely manageable.” “Defendant … has not cited any information or evidence demonstrating that defendant, who is an otherwise healthy 49-year man, is at greater risk from COVID-19 merely because he may have had pneumonia six months ago,” government lawyers wrote. “Thus, there is no reason to conclude that defendant’s personal circumstances are meaningfully distinguishable from the vast majority of individuals detained in BOP facilities or would justify the extraordinary relief he now seeks.” The prosecution also said Avenatti’s history indicated that the California resident was not only likely to defy court orders, but also the statewide lockdown ordered by Gov. Gavin Newsom. “A person who ignores such admonitions and rules could increase infection rates, leading to severe illness and death. Defendant has shown an unwillingness or inability to follow rules, and a disregard for the welfare of others. Thus, defendant’s failure to follow rules poses particular dangers to the community,” prosecutors wrote. Documents submitted by the government said officials at the Manhattan detention center where Avenatti is located have taken numerous steps to limit the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak, including screening prisoners and staff for fevers, distributing more soap and segregating most prisoners over 55. However, H. Dean Steward, a lawyer for Avenatti, said the conditions at the lower-Manhattan jail known as the MCC are deplorable and are inviting a major COVID outbreak. ""Mr. Avenatti’ s cell contained three rats,"" Steward wrote. ""Inmates on one unit were forced to share one toilet among 26 people, and prevented from washing their clothing: prime conditions for the spread, rather than containment, of infectious disease."" The federal Bureau of Prisons reported its first confirmed case of novel coronavirus Saturday, involving an inmate at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Two staff members at BOP facilities in Kansas and Texas have also been stricken by the illness. Avenatti’s trial in the New York case involving stealing from Daniels is set to open April 21, but the judge handling that matter said last week it seemed “highly doubtful” it would go forward then due to virus-related suspensions of most proceedings in federal courts nationwide. Avenatti’s trial on fraud, perjury, tax dodging, and embezzlement charges in the Los Angeles case is scheduled for May 19, but Selna said that will likely be postponed as well.

"Donald Trump’s MAGA followers finally agree: the coronavirus threat is real. But there’s now a growing chorus worried the president might overdo the response.  The fear is that the media and mass hysteria has cowed Trump into fully tanking the economy in response to what they believe is a dangerous, but not apocalyptic, disease. Despite warnings from Trump’s own health officials that millions could die unless drastic action is taken, some of the president’s supporters worry that the dangers of overreacting could also be severe.  “More than a month of people actually quarantined will break down civil society. Nobody is used to this, and when the money runs out for people they will get desperate — and there’s not enough money the government can dole out that’ll be enough,” said David Reaboi, vice president for strategic operations at Security Studies Group who writes for The Federalist. “People will start to panic, then [begin] killing and looting. And we’ll face a society-wide crisis that’s more than simply economic. Absorbing the death of a certain number of people is preferable to that, if those are the options. Amazing and horrible to even think like that, but here we are.” A variation of the debate has also started to infiltrate more mainstream circles, with a much-read Wall Street Journal editorial recently weighing how much financial devastation is worth the health benefits a prolonged economic stoppage will bring. Public health officials insist such measures are necessary for now, noting the coronavirus is far worse than the flu — it is at least 10 times as lethal and about three times as contagious, according to officials. And recent data has also shown that the disease may pose greater risks to younger generations than previously thought — nearly 40 percent of coronavirus hospitalizations were people aged 20 to 54, according to a government report. The fall-out has ramifications for Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, robbing the president of his most-common talking point — that he has overseen a growing economy. Instead Trump is facing criticism that problems with coronavirus testing and his own misleading rhetoric harmed efforts to quash the disease’s spread. And with large gatherings barred for the foreseeable future, Trump’s energetic rallies are off for now. After initially downplaying the coronavirus threat, Trump has gotten behind severe measures to slow the disease’s spread. He supported governors as they ordered the closure of all restaurants and bars and applauded shelter-at-home orders, even as it caused the stock market to tank and sent businesses sliding toward bankruptcy. Trump himself has directed Americans to avoid any gathering of more than 10 people. The reaction among Trump’s supporters is evolving, as well. A week after Trump’s base seemed to be splitting over the seriousness of the coronavirus, the quarrel is now over how much the government should damage the economy in response to the present threat. “For generation X and younger MAGA influencers, we’re pretty much all uniformly on board with social distancing [and] flattening the curve policies. [The] only discussion is about severity,” said Jack Posobiec, a correspondent with the Trump-friendly One America News Network.  Posobiec advocates a “kill this thing, whatever it takes” approach, but acknowledged that “the draconian nature of government edicts is definitely something that causes old school conservatives to viscerally recoil — especially as pertains to business.” It will inevitably be difficult for Trump to please his entire base, though. Some think Trump should deploy any emergency power that would help contain the virus. Others believe shutting down major sectors of the economy for weeks — dramatically limiting personal freedoms in the process — is misguided. Reaboi worried that the people able to drive the conversation about the shutdown--”information economy folks [who] are used to telecommuting and taking two weeks of vacation”--were disconnected from the very real struggles of people who need to physically be at their work.  “Those people are still the lifeblood of the economy, and even the telecommuters depend on them being at their jobs. There are millions of people like that who are uncertain about their futures now, and it’s not long until worry becomes panic, and panic becomes terror. What happens after that is a nightmare for everyone, even the tweeters most alarmed by the virus.” Fiscal conservative circles are starting to have their own discussion about how long the Trump administration should leave the economy fallow. The Wall Street Journal editorial board on Thursday called the extreme social-distancing policies “necessary,” but warned that they were not “sustainable.” “There is no amount of money that can make up for losses of the magnitude we are facing if this extends for several more weeks,” the piece said. “If this government-ordered shutdown continues for much more than another week or two, the human cost of job losses and bankruptcies will exceed what most Americans imagine.”  The Trump administration has stressed that two weeks of strict social distancing will help avoid an overwhelming crush of patients at hospitals that are already struggling with resource shortages. Trump’s advisers have said they will reassess those guidelines around the end of the month.  Yet in recent days, there have been signs that the situation is growing more dire in hard-hit areas, including California and New York. Both states have issued stay-at-home orders, and other states, such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Illinois, are following suit. Health care professionals are also scrounging for basic medical equipment, such as masks, to protect themselves — a shortage the Trump administration has vowed to address. More hardline Trump supporters claim the media and Democrats are still putting much of the pressure on Trump to fully stall the economy, even as other countries take similar steps and Republican governors implement economic restrictions almost identical to those of Democratic governors. Conservative commentator Candace Owens initially urged at-risk elderly people to quarantine themselves instead of shutting down bars and restaurants — an assertion health officials warn is dangerous because it ignores the fact that people of all ages are falling severely ill from this disease.  “Life does not mean ‘you get to live forever,’” Owens said during a March 16th Periscope stream, calling the “mass hysteria” surrounding coronavirus a media-driven “social experiment” that showed how much personal liberty people — particularly ostensible small-government conservatives — would shed during a crisis.  “The majority of Americans are not reacting in a way that you think that they should be acting because you’re fearful,” she said. “And if you believe in freedom, freedom doesn’t suddenly stop when you get scared.” A segment of American voters, particularly those who sided with Trump through the past three years of scandals, agree.  “We’re Americans, right? We don't live in a communist country, nor do we have to stay indoors,” said Katie Williams, a Las Vegas woman running for Clark County school board, citing Owens as an influence Williams blamed the media and liberals for pushing things this far.  “I mean, we are just one step away from communism at that point, you know?” she said. “With this media hype about the coronavirus, I think a lot of more democratic politicians, local politicians, are trying to push that agenda into more of a communist rule.” Williams' commentary went viral last week when she fired off a snarky tweet aimed at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in defiance of the popular progressive’s plea for people to stop going to restaurants.  “I just went to a crowded Red Robin and I’m 30,” Williams tweeted. “It was delicious and I took my sweet time eating my meal. Because this is America. And I’ll do what I want.” Williams does not believe her tweet was endangering public health.  “I don't have it. I haven't been exposed to anyone who has it,” she said to POLITICO. “I don't have any elderly people in my 10-foot radius of where I would go. And so when people were like, ‘You're irresponsible, you're out there spreading it,’ I'm like, ‘I can't spread it if I don't have it.’”  Health officials have pushed back against such logic, cautioning that younger people may not realize they’re infected and contagious. Still, Williams said that her tweet was simply meant to underline the hypocrisy of Ocasio-Cortez’s statement days earlier that “racism” was behind people avoiding Chinese restaurants after the disease originated in China. To this point, the Trump administration has taken several steps to keep Americans afloat during the crisis, delaying the tax filing deadline and suspending federal student loan payments for 60 days. The White House is also negotiating a massive stimulus package that could top $2 trillion and include loans to businesses and one-off payments to people.  In a comment to POLITICO, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign touted recent polling showing that the public largely approved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “President Trump ignited the American economy once before. He is clearly the leader to restore our position once we are through this crisis. Joe Biden would undo all of the hard work that built the economy,” they said. For Trump voters, and the wider universe of people who generally support Trump, the tug-of-war between acting in the interest of public health and keeping Americans financially secure is only likely to grow stronger. “People diverge on severity of crisis versus economic cost,” Reaboi said. “It’s a real issue. Anyone who’s not taking that balance seriously is an idiot.”",A new MAGA movement debate: Is Trump overdoing it?,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/maga-movement-trump-coronavirus-140949,politico
"The Justice Department has quietly asked Congress for the ability to ask chief judges to detain people indefinitely without trial during emergencies — part of a push for new powers that comes as the coronavirus spreads through the United States. Documents reviewed by POLITICO detail the department’s requests to lawmakers on a host of topics, including the statute of limitations, asylum and the way court hearings are conducted. POLITICO also reviewed and previously reported on documents seeking the authority to extend deadlines on merger reviews and prosecutions. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the documents. The move has tapped into a broader fear among civil liberties advocates and Donald Trump’s critics — that the president will use a moment of crisis to push for controversial policy changes. Already, he has cited the pandemic as a reason for heightening border restrictions and restricting asylum claims. He has also pushed for further tax cuts as the economy withers, arguing that it would soften the financial blow to Americans. And even without policy changes, Trump has vast emergency powers that he could legally deploy right now to try and slow the coronavirus outbreak. The DOJ requests — which are unlikely to make it through a Democratic-led House — span several stages of the legal process, from initial arrest to how cases are processed and investigated. In one of the documents, the department proposed that Congress grant the attorney general power to ask the chief judge of any district court to pause court proceedings “whenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situation.”  The proposal would also grant those top judges broad authority to pause court proceedings during emergencies. It would apply to “any statutes or rules of procedure otherwise affecting pre-arrest, post-arrest, pre-trial, trial, and post-trial procedures in criminal and juvenile proceedings and all civil process and proceedings,” according to draft legislative language the department shared with Congress. In making the case for the change, the DOJ document wrote that individual judges can currently pause proceedings during emergencies, but that their proposal would make sure all judges in any particular district could handle emergencies “in a consistent manner.”  The request raised eyebrows because of its potential implications for habeas corpus –– the constitutional right to appear before a judge after arrest and seek release. “Not only would it be a violation of that, but it says ‘affecting pre-arrest,’” said Norman L. Reimer, the executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. “So that means you could be arrested and never brought before a judge until they decide that the emergency or the civil disobedience is over. I find it absolutely terrifying. Especially in a time of emergency, we should be very careful about granting new powers to the government.” Reimer said the possibility of chief judges suspending all court rules during an emergency without a clear end in sight was deeply disturbing. “That is something that should not happen in a democracy,” he said. The department also asked Congress to pause the statute of limitations for criminal investigations and civil proceedings during national emergencies, “and for one year following the end of the national emergency,” according to the draft legislative text. Trump recently declared the coronavirus crisis a national emergency.  Another controversial request: The department is looking to change the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in some cases to expand the use of videoconference hearings, and to let some of those hearings happen without defendants’ consent, according to the draft legislative text. “Video teleconferencing may be used to conduct an appearance under this rule,” read a draft of potential new language for Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(f), crossing out the phrase “if the defendant consents.”  “Video teleconferencing may be used to arraign a defendant,” read draft text of rule 10(c), again striking out the phrase “if the defendant consents.” Reimer said forcing people to have hearings over video rather than in person would threaten civil liberties. “If it were with the consent of the accused person it would be fine,” he said. “But if it’s not with the consent of the accused person, it’s a terrible road to go down. We have a right to public trials. People have a right to be present in court.” The department also wants Congress to change the law to explicitly say that people with Covid-19 –– the illness caused by the novel coronavirus –– are not included among those who may apply for asylum. And the department asked for the same change regarding people who are “subject to a presidential proclamation suspending and limiting the entry of aliens into the United States,” according to the draft legislative language. Layli Miller-Muro, the CEO of the Tahirih Justice Center, which advocates for women and girls fleeing violence, said the language would block anyone on a presidential travel ban list from seeking asylum in the U.S. “I think it’s a humanitarian tragedy that fails to recognize that vulnerable people from those countries are among the most persecuted and that protecting them is exactly what the refugee convention was designed to do,” she said. The asylum request comes as the Trump administration on Friday said that it would begin denying entry to all migrants illegally crossing the U.S. southern border, including those seeking asylum. “I hope we come out of this with a sense of oneness, interconnectedness,” Miller-Munro said of the coronavirus pandemic. “Borders can’t protect us. Viruses do not care.”",DOJ seeks new emergency powers amid coronavirus pandemic,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023,politico
"President Donald Trump’s former economic chief said Sunday that Congress should require businesses to pay independent contractors out of work during the coronavirus crisis.  “Think of people that work at stadiums and arenas. Think of people that work in catering businesses. Think of Uber drivers and Lyft drivers. They need to get compensated as well,” Gary Cohn, Trump’s former chief economic adviser, said on “Face the Nation” on CBS.  Democrats are expected to secure $250 billion allocated to unemployment insurance in a deal with the Trump administration. But that would not help workers classified as independent contractors, who are ineligible for unemployment benefits.  Cohn said that the legislation should require businesses that hired contractors and part-time workers to “go back and look at what you were paying them for the last month, or the last two weeks, and you go back and pay them that exact amount of money.“","Congress should bail out gig workers, Cohn says",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/congress-gig-economy-workers-cohn-141886,politico
"Governors, mayors and front-line health care workers confronting rising numbers of critically ill coronavirus patients said Sunday they have not received meaningful amounts of federal aid, including the shipments of desperately needed masks and other emergency equipment that administration officials say they have already dispatched. As the crisis spreads, Congress was planning a rare Sunday procedural vote as it moved toward a deal on a third coronavirus aid package. Containing both broad economic stimulus measures and direct help for American families, it could pass the Senate as early as Monday. The pressure on hospitals in hard-hit areas was mounting, and several Democratic governors demanded a more coordinated national response to get supplies as fast as possible to where they are needed most critically. “We are desperate,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told ABC Sunday morning. “We've had a big ask into the strategic stockpile in the White House. They've given us a fraction of our ask.” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer echoed that urgency, saying her state’s hospitals are dealing with about 800 confirmed cases of the virus — up from only one just 12 days ago — and are struggling with serious shortages of both test kits and protective equipment for medical workers. The shortages have forced hospitals to adopt risky practices like reusing masks and having staff wear bandanas when no mask is available. A lack of personal protective equipment puts medical personnel at greater risk of becoming infected or placed in quarantine, exacerbating hospitals' existing staff shortages. “We’ve got to have those masks,” Whitmer said. “Had the federal government really started focusing when it became clear that the whole world was going to be confronting this, we would be in a stronger position right now ... Lives will be lost because we weren’t prepared.” President Donald Trump tweeted that a ""very small group"" of governors ""shouldn't be blaming the Federal Goverment for their own shortcomings. "" He said the federal government is ""there to back you up should you fail, and always will be!"" The main hospital association said there are still crucial gaps in the supply line. ""There is a supply. Many people have them, but there's a gap and we're going to need more,"" Richard Pollack, the CEO of the American Hospital Association, told CBS. ""If we don't protect our health care workers, the system will completely collapse."" Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor, whose agency was not activated to run the pandemic response until Friday, painted a more optimistic picture in Sunday morning appearances on ABC and CNN. He said masks and other equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile are well on their way to states — particularly hard-hit areas like Washington, California and New York. “They have been distributed. They've been distributed over the past couple of weeks. They're shipping today. They'll ship tomorrow,” Gaynor told ABC. “We are shipping from our national stockpile, we're shipping from vendors, we're shipping from donations. It is happening.” Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, offered similar assurances on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""The resources that are being marshaled are going to be clearly directed to those hot spots that need it most,"" he said. ""So not only is New York trying to get resources themselves, but we're going to be pouring it in from the federal government. So it would be a combination of local and federal. But it's very, very clear that they are a very high priority."" But Gaynor and other administration officials sidestepped repeated questions on exactly how many masks were being shipped and when they would be in the hands of doctors and nurses who need them. “I can't give you a rough number,” he said in another interview on CNN, adding that governors should not depend on federal disbursements and should try on their own to obtain masks and other equipment. “If you find it on the market, go ahead and buy it. FEMA will reimburse you for it,” he said. “This is a shared responsibility.” Several governors pushed back, warning that pitting states against one another, the federal government, and other countries in a bidding war on the private market is no way to respond to a pandemic that requires a coordinated national response to obtain and allocate emergency goods. “It’s a wide, Wild West…out there,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said of his attempts to obtain supplies. “And indeed we’re overpaying, I would say, for [personal protective equipment] because of that competition.” ""We need the federal government to get us those test kits,” Whitmer agreed. “We need PPEs. And frankly a patchwork strategy of each state doing what they can is — we’re going to do it if we have to, but it would be nice to have a national strategy.” Governors, congressional lawmakers and mayors continued to plead with the White House over the weekend to use the powers of the Defense Production Act to speed up manufacture of masks, ventilators and other scarce supplies as many hospitals say they’re set to run out within days. President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday morning that he has given a handful of car companies ""the go ahead"" to make ventilators and other unnamed ""metal products"" for hospitals, but gave no indication of a timeline or quantity. Converting factories from making cars to making medical equipment cannot happen immediately, and could take several months. In the meantime, hospitals need immediate help. “We've gotten no indication of any factory on 24/7 shifts. We've gotten no shipments,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on NBC. “I can’t be blunt enough: If the president does not act, people will die who could have lived otherwise.” De Blasio also called on the president to mobilize the military's health care workers to immediately deploy to coronavirus hot spots like his own city. ""All military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep, like New York, right now,"" he said. ""Why are they at their bases? Why are they not being allowed to serve? I guarantee you they're ready to serve. But the president has to give the order."" Though Trump signed the defense act last week, Gaynor confirmed that the administration has yet to use it to order any companies to manufacture more products. He suggested such a step wasn’t necessary as companies are already stepping up. “We haven't had to use it, because companies around the country, donations, they are saying, ‘What can we do to help you?’ And it's happening without using that — that lever,” he said. “If it comes to a point where we have to pull the level, we will.” Both in private calls with the White House and in public interviews, lawmakers are insisting that time is now. “We cannot wait until people start really dying in large numbers to start production, especially of more complicated equipment like ventilators and hospital beds,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told CNN. “We need to start this production right now to get ready for the surge that is coming in two to three weeks.”",Desperate and angry state leaders push back on Trump admin claims of mass mask shipments,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/state-leaders-trump-administration-mask-shipments-141884,politico
"Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Sunday sought to downplay a public disagreement with President Donald Trump over whether a malaria drug could be used to treat coronavirus.  “There’s an issue here of where we’re coming from,” Fauci said on “Face the Nation” on CBS.  “The president, as heard, as we all have heard, what are what I call anecdotal reports that certain drugs work,” Fauci said. “So what he was trying to do and express was the hope that if they might work, let's try and push their usage. I, on the other side, have said I'm not disagreeing with the fact [that] anecdotally they might work, but my job is to prove definitively from a scientific standpoint that they do work.“ Fauci and Trump have publicly disagreed in recent days on whether the drug, hydroxychloroquine, could prevent Covid-19. Fauci said Friday that the drug had not been proved effective in clinical trials after Trump called attention to it in a press conference.  “I was taking a purely medical, scientific standpoint, and the president was trying to bring hope to the people,” Fauci said. “I think there's this issue of trying to separate the two of us.

"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called on President Donald Trump to send medically trained soldiers to his city to address escalating shortages amid the coronavirus outbreak. “All military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep, like New York, right now,” de Blasio said Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press.”  “The military is the best logistical organization in the nation. If there are ventilators being produced anywhere in the country, we need to get them to New York. Not weeks from now or months from now, in the next 10 days.“  “Why are they at their bases? Why are they not being allowed to serve?“ de Blasio said. “I guarantee you, they're ready to serve. But the president has to give the order.“ More than 8,000 New Yorkers were confirmed to have the virus as of Saturday, exacerbating fears that the city’s medical infrastructure will soon reach its breaking point. De Blasio has said the city could run out of medical supplies in as soon as two weeks. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday the federal government would direct resources to COVID-19 hot spots, including New York.  “We were at the task force meeting yesterday, and it was very clear that the issue in New York was right on the front burner,” Fauci said on CBS' “Face the Nation.“ “The resources that are being marshaled are going to be clearly directed to those hot spots that need it most. And clearly that’s California, Washington state, and, obviously, New York is the most hard hit.“  De Blasio and other Democrats have called on Trump to compel businesses to manufacture more medical supplies through the Defense Production Act. “The American government is not at full bore right now,” the mayor said. “We've gotten no indication of any factory on 24/7 shifts.

"States are competing against one another for medical supplies and, in many cases, overpaying amid a federal shortage, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Sunday.  “We’re competing against each other, we’re competing against other countries,“ Pritzker said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “It‘s a wide, wild west … out there. And indeed we’re overpaying, I would say, for [personal protective equipment] because of that competition.“ Pritzker said he’s gotten a fraction of the masks, gloves and gowns requested from the federal government. As a result, Pritzker said he’s deployed staff to purchase supplies on the open market internationally.  “I’ve got people on the phones, working the phones across the world, frankly, to get this stuff shipped to Illinois,” Pritzker said.  Pritzker also discussed his decision to move to a stay-at-home order for Illinois residents. “We have moved on now to a stay-at-home order,“ he said. “These should have been done nationally. They haven't been. But I have got to protect the 12.7 million people that live in my state. And I'm dedicated to that. It's their health and safety that matters most to me. It will work.

"Direct cash payments to American households will be a significant portion of the U.S. government’s response to the coronavirus crisis. The logic is clear: When people can’t leave their homes and businesses shut down, workers lose their paychecks. Cash injections from the government – whether in the form of checks or unemployment insurance – help cushion that blow. But that is only part of the equation for American families trying to get through this challenging period. It’s not only about cash coming into households, but also the cash going out. At a moment when some struggling households need every dollar to cover basic necessities, it doesn’t make sense for cash infusions from the government to go right back out the door to make routine monthly debt payments. The present situation is anything but routine. For the most vulnerable, amounts falling due on debt should take a back seat to meeting essential needs in this time of crisis. This is not just a humanitarian imperative. It also reflects a sound and established principle in responding to debt problems, from ancient Mesopotamia to modern financial crises. When borrowers face a “liquidity shock” – a sudden and potentially transitory loss of ability to pay – the correct response is to give more time to repay. Pursuing repayment in such circumstances produces unnecessary, avoidable, and lasting harm. With time to get back on their feet, borrowers not only have a better chance at discharging their debts. They also can participate more fully and productively as consumers and workers than is possible with impaired credit or the threat of bankruptcy. With Americans poised to experience their most abrupt liquidity shock in U.S. history – due to job losses from the sudden lockdown on economic activity – now is the time to deploy the full range of tools for addressing it. That includes deferral of near-term debt payments for those who need it. Here are the categories of payments that should be available for deferral:  Tax payments, student loans and other obligations to the government. At the federal level, announcements have already been made regarding the delay of required tax payments, as well as interest on student debt. Principal repayments on student loans are now also eligible for deferral. Similar relief should be extended to obligations associated with other government programs, such as loans to small businesses and other credit lines. Mortgage payments. Lenders should establish expedited processes for facilitating forbearance on mortgage payments for stressed borrowers. The federal government has just directed lenders that work with mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to offer affected homeowners payment flexibility for up to 12 months. Federal guarantees backstop any risk of credit losses on associated agency mortgage-backed securities. All mortgage servicers in the United States should use maximum possible latitude to facilitate deferred payments. Landlords receiving relief for mortgages on rental properties should pass through that benefit to their tenants by deferring rent payments. Auto loans, credit card payments and other debt. Financial institutions should work in an expedited fashion with vulnerable borrowers to implement interest-free deferrals of payments due on auto loans, credit cards, and other forms of consumer and business debt. These should be implemented with no penalties, fees, or negative reports to credit bureaus. Federal regulators have already encouraged financial institutions to work with customers who are having payment difficulties. Supervisory agencies should stress to these institutions that they will regard such actions favorably. Banks have indicated their willingness to implement forbearance programs, citing the model of natural disasters. But history has shown that actually achieving relief can be difficult and cumbersome for borrowers. A case in point is the mortgage modification programs following the housing collapse, which had disappointing utilization rates and consequently left many potential beneficiaries in financial distress. Many forbearance programs for natural disasters also have a poor track record.  Given the pervasive nature of this crisis and need to implement at scale, deferrals should utilize streamlined procedures that lower the barriers to accessing relief. Financial institutions already have extensive information about their customers. That can be the basis for proactive steps by banks to initiate forbearance. A web-based interface can take customer information, run it through preprogrammed algorithms, and speed up execution. In this crisis, eligibility criteria should be biased toward giving more access to relief, not less.  Thanks to the regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 crisis, banks entered the COVID-19 episode with sizable liquidity and capital buffers. Aggressive Federal Reserve operations give banks access to functionally unlimited financing at almost zero cost. These backstops mean that U.S. banks are in a position to implement forbearance programs that cushion the economy and American households against the initial shock without compromising their own financial integrity. The implementation details of all the above programs are important and require elaboration. They should be carefully designed to forestall unintended consequences in capital markets, as well as for borrowers. In particular, we must prevent households from building up excessive debt during this period that hampers their post-crisis recovery. It is certainly possible that the impact of COVID-19 on the economy will be prolonged, not transient. In such a case, further and more aggressive steps will be needed. Such uncertainties should not prevent swift action on deferrals now. Epidemiological uncertainties do not prevent us from implementing steps gauged to manage prospective risks.  Both government and financial institutions must be held accountable for stepping up at this critical moment. Facilitating forbearance is a financial analogue to social distancing. It is not sufficient to solve all economic problems linked to the epidemic, but it is a necessary early element of a response that limits the damage. Banks were the cause of the last crisis. They can be part of the solution to this one.",Banks Should Defer Household Debt to Protect the Economy,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/03/22/deferring-consumer-debt-could-save-the-economy-for-everyone-140763,politico
"In Finland, they’re drinking boxed wine and playing Korona, a board game. In Greece, they’re stockpiling feta. The French refuse to stop kissing. ISIS is telling its members to avoid traveling to Europe to conduct attacks. And, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, hand-washing stations are everywhere; they know the drill. As the novel coronavirus continues spreading, the whole world is preparing for the onslaught in similar ways—social distancing, working from home, panic buying at grocery stores. But people in different countries are also weathering this crisis in different ways, finding, for example, different products to hoard, different ways to pass the time, different people to blame and even different things to worry about. Over the past week, I emailed, texted and contacted via Facebook friends around the world—including a network of acquaintances and colleagues I’ve built over 20 years working in foreign policy, living in Europe and traveling widely—and asked them to tell me about their lives under coronavirus watch: items in scarce supply, coping mechanisms, jokes and the effect of culture and history on national responses. In total, I heard from more than 90 people in 68 countries, all of whom sent me anecdotes, press clips and Twitter videos providing a snapshot of life in mid-March under COVID-19. Here’s what I’ve learned so far. You probably think everybody’s buying toilet paper, and across the Western world, you’d be right. A dramatic supermarket fight over TP between two Australian women went viral. When the Dutch prime minister visited a grocery store, he reassured shoppers there was sufficient supply so “we can all poop for 10 years.” (Perhaps more worrisome, a 2015 survey found the Dutch were the least likely among Europeans to wash their hands after using the restroom; Bosnians and Turks fared much better.) A Lebanese friend cited a local saying: “We lived 20 years of civil war and never once were we out of toilet paper.” The great divide occurs around the use of bidets. As a Jordanian smugly told me, the TP hoarders are those who don’t use them. An Azerbaijani friend said his compatriots “tend to use water.” An amused Bosnian pointed out that toilet paper takes up storage space and people could simply shower. And an American posted on Facebook that her husband presciently requested a bidet for Christmas; sales have recently increased tenfold. Across Africa, expats told me many people there either cannot afford or culturally do not use toilet paper. As hand sanitizer and other cleaning products are in short supply everywhere, friends shared the desperate measures and creative thinking from their countries. In the UK, people have ripped hand sanitizer dispensers off the walls in doctors’ offices and have stolen bottles from hospitals. In the Czech Republic, a friend saw a doctor on television dismiss concerns about a lack of disinfectant by citing the example of Moravia, where people make their own alcohol from apricots and plums. In Turkey, people are relying on a longtime tradition: Kolonya, a cologne whose alcohol to essential oils ratio can reach 80-20, is found in nearly every Turkish household and ceremonially poured into the palm of visitors as a sanitizer. In Istanbul, one man offered it to riders on the subway. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko joked that vodka is not only a good hand sanitizer but it could also help kill the virus. The situation is better in South Korea, where news reports cite bottles of hand sanitizers in elevators and people dressed in costumes at subway entrances reminding the public to wash their hands.  While Westerners are being schooled in proper hand-washing techniques, expat friends in African countries previously afflicted with Ebola said people there are already well-informed about proper sanitation measures. For example, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo there are hand-washing stations (described as “little plastic tanks with chlorinated water and a faucet”) in every restaurant, store, business and airport. In Niger, the government has been continuing public safety campaigns and sending daily communications with doctors’ phone numbers for people if they suspect they are sick.  In the West, people are mostly avoiding masks, heeding doctors’ pleas to save them for health workers. But they are ubiquitous in Asia, though many already wore them to address air pollution. An Indian friend reported that a temple covered its idols with masks to protect them. In Lebanon, a friend said masks are serving a new purpose: Many women get botox in their lips every few months, and now some are wearing masks and postponing their fillers.  Germans, who have a word for everything, describe panic shopping as “Hamsterkauf”— mindless spending like a hamster storing food in its cheeks. Almost everyone across the Western world is stockpiling pasta. Spaniards are panic-buying toilet paper and jamón, with a meme showing someone slicing a loo roll as if it were meat. An expat in Kyrgyzstan heard radio commentators encouraging people to buy sugar and flour. Moldovans are purchasing garlic, with the cost recently tripling. Afghans are stockpiling rice, wheat and cooking oil, as prices skyrocket. Feta cheese sales are high in Greece. Serbs are buying rakija (a fruit brandy), while Finns are investing in multiliter boxed wines. In the Netherlands, people panicked after the government announced plans to close “coffee shops” and formed long lines to stock up on weed.  Some shoppers are driven by memories of previous periods of deprivation. In Lithuania, a friend saw Soviet echoes in purchases of buckwheat and other grain for making porridges, pasta and potatoes. In Denmark, people are buying rye bread and yeast. (A Danish friend explained that a 1998 labor strike led to yeast hoarding when locals anticipated shops closing; although a shortage occurred then, producers anticipated the coming crisis and ensured sufficient capacity.) Several Bosnian expats, who survived a devastating war when the capital was under siege for 1,425 days, said the experience left a “huge imprint.” Their families in Sarajevo began storing food weeks ago, while others are planting more vegetables than usual. An Iraqi friend said decades of political instability and price uncertainty have long led people to store enough food in their houses to last at least a month. He recalled his father in the 1980s buying 50lb bags of rice and an entire sheep to keep in the freezer. Amid coronavirus, his mother is supplementing their existing stockpile with extra toothpaste and batteries for flashlights. A German friend with a Vietnamese wife said his in-laws call daily with advice about preparing for difficult situations and with recommendations for natural treatments. Closer to home, a friend’s sister-in-law in Puerto Rico said, “People have been buying supplies as if they are getting ready for a hurricane.” There is less concern elsewhere about food availability. Friends in stricken Italy and China reported a gradual reduction in panic-buying as supply chains continue to function. Similarly, an Iranian friend said shoppers there were relatively relaxed, given memories of sufficient provisions during past wars. An expat in Vietnam reported that neighborhoods under quarantine near her get daily rations of rice, eggs, protein and cooking oil. In Africa, people have generally limited means to stockpile, which a Senegalese friend described as a “very Western concept.”  Others are more worried about their long-term economic survival. Ukraine and Georgia experienced extreme deprivation in the 1990s, which a local friend said created a survivor mentality; although people are not hoarding commodities, many are gathering as much hard currency as possible. An Azerbaijani friend described calm at the stores but panic at the banks, as people want to retrieve dollars in anticipation of a currency devaluation amid declining oil prices.  People around the world are losing access to their traditional gathering places, which have closed as a health precaution: hookah bars in the Middle East, karaoke bars in Asia and banyas (public saunas) in Central Asia. In Greece, the government launched a communications campaign with #menoume_spiti (stay at home). Spaniards have promoted their own self-quarantines, with #quedateencasa (stay at home) and #yomequedoencasa (I’m staying home). After seeing online images of Dubliners in packed bars last Saturday, #closethepubs started trending in Ireland; the government ordered them to close the following day. Despite the “she’ll be right mate” attitude of Australians, a friend there said her sports-obsessed compatriots are stressed by the cancellation of participatory and televised events.  Several governments are taking extreme steps to enforce social distancing rules. In Italy, residents are only allowed to leave home for work, food, health or emergencies. They must carry an “auto-certification” form whenever they head outside, which can be downloaded from the Interior Ministry website, that describes their origin and destination. Failure to comply could result in jail time and a $230 fine. France is similarly requiring residents to carry documentation justifying “essential” reasons for being outside their homes, while the German state of Bavaria is imposing $27,000 fines if people violate new lockdown measures. In Serbia, the government deployed the army to its borders and the streets of its capital to enforce the new state of emergency, including the requirement that those older than 70 remain home. In some countries, critics have accused governments of violating privacy rights. The Israeli government’s security agency is using cellphone data to track those under quarantine. The South Korean government is using technology to trace the movements of infected people before they were diagnosed, which it then publishes online so others can determine if their paths crossed.  Responses to these restrictions vary. Finns, who are renowned for their introversion, joke about having long wanted mandatory social distancing. As families prepare for a period of seclusion, a Finnish friend said people are purchasing a classic board game that coincidentally happens to be called Korona (the Finnish spelling of the virus). Likewise, an English friend joked that his country’s “main contribution to disease control is the social isolation we learn from childhood. It only breaks down in queues. It’s OK to talk in queues. But definitely not in lifts or on the tube. And certainly not over breakfast.” Others find it harder to adapt. The French are continuing their signature “la bise” greeting, with one survey reporting 66 percent of respondents greeted friends with cheek kisses in recent days. In Argentina, an expat reported that locals are struggling to stop sharing mate, the national tealike drink. You’ve probably seen the beautiful scenes of quarantined Italians, singing together from their balconies. In Madrid, sequestered residents gathered on their terraces Saturday evening to cheer their health workers. In Colombia, “ciclovía culture” (biking) remains strong. In Germany, the American dating show Love is Blind ranks third on Netflix and stores report shortages of barbells. Sadly, the Eurovision song contest has been canceled. A new genre of reality show has emerged in China: livestreams of celebrities and regular people singing, cooking and exercising at home. Yet an expat in Kazakhstan predicted increasing frustration there, as the government has long throttled the internet, limiting access to YouTube, Twitter and WhatsApp, in the evenings when the president’s rival is online.  Mosques across the Middle East were closed, with worshipers urged to pray at home instead. Saudi Arabia temporarily banned Umrah pilgrimages, which can be undertaken by Muslims at any time of year, to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; the government has not yet decided about the annual Hajj in July.  Churches have also been shuttered. Poland’s first coronavirus victim was the wife of a church steward who distributed communion during mass. A Polish friend said bishops revised their approach after that, explaining communion could be experienced spiritually instead of physically. Although the church initially increased the number of masses to comply with government restrictions on group gatherings, it has begun encouraging worshippers to watch broadcasts instead amid tightening limits. In some places, coronavirus has affected the relationship between church and state. The Greek Orthodox Church caused controversy by stating that attendance at Eucharist and communion “cannot be a cause of disease transmission.” As doctors protested, the government intervened, with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis invoking his faith while advocating the need to follow scientific advice.  In addition, I learned about numerous kissing constraints. Orthodox worshippers in countries like Lithuania were told to stop kissing religious icons, while Spanish Catholics were advised against kissing statues. In Israel, the chief rabbi ruled people should stop kissing mezuzahs when they enter or depart Jewish homes.  An expat in Moldova reported people drinking hot tea, which they believe will kill the virus. An Indian friend told me ayurvedic home remedies—such as turmeric and ginger—and cow urine are being recommended there as ways to get rid of the disease. In Lebanon, some Christians are delivering a mixture of holy water and soil from the grave of Saint Charbel Makhlouf, which is believed to have miraculous healing powers, to infected patients in Beirut hospitals. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has a nonchalant approach to the crisis, showed an audience the good luck charms—including an American $2 bill and four-leaf clover—that he carries in his wallet as “bodyguards.”  In Afghanistan, the Taliban tweeted assurances to international health organizations of their readiness to coordinate on coronavirus responses and urged special attention to the health of their prisoners in Afghan jails. In Libya, an expat’s friend said the existing closure of airports is largely positive as a containment measure, though people are worried restrictions on borders and the entry of foreigners could affect the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The Syrian government has denied the existence of any coronavirus cases, but news reports cite concern among over-stretched hospitals and aid workers in refugee camps about their limited capacity to manage an outbreak. Even ISIS has issued health instructions, using Quranic verses, on washing hands, avoiding infected areas, and coughing or sneezing into hands or clothes. The group’s newsletter also advised its members against traveling to Europe for terror attacks given the pandemic.  Racist attacks on Asian people in numerous countries have been well-documented. In China, an expat reports the opposite concern: a fear of foreigners. Although the virus is largely under control there, many fear a resurgence from overseas—even though new cases in the country are almost exclusively Chinese travelers who went abroad and returned home.  In Africa, the coronavirus is largely seen as a foreign intrusion, with early cases reported from European travelers or residents who recently visited Europe. For example, the Central Africa Republic just had its first case, from an Italian who had been in Milan. The first case in the DRC was a Congolese national who returned to Kinshasa from his home in France. Anti-foreigner sentiment is rising in Ethiopia, where typical derogatory comments targeting “ferengi” (foreigner) are now being combined with “corona.” Reports of foreigners being harassed and assaulted—including being hit with stones, spat on, chased and denied transportation services—led the U.S. Embassy there to issue a travel advisory this week.  An Afghan friend said some of his compatriots believe coronavirus is a conspiracy from infidel countries to prevent Muslims from practicing their religious rights, while others view it as a new economic warfare tool between the U.S. and China that doesn’t affect them. The Taliban suggested coronavirus is a God-sent scourge in response to “disobedience” and “sins of mankind.” In Egypt, the minister of religious affairs accused the Muslim Brotherhood of seeking to spread the coronavirus among the military, police, judiciary and media. The Iranian regime has blamed the U.S. and Israel, while Chinese officials have suggested the disease was brought to their country by the American Army. The United States is not immune to the conspiracy theory trend; for example, former U.S. Representative Ron Paul called it a “big hoax” and Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. blamed the North Koreans. After South African President Cyril Ramaphosa instructed his citizens on the healthy elbow bump, it quickly became a local dance move. Even in Syria, there are music videos; this one lambasts President Bashar Assad as the “real corona.” A viral clip from Britain’s classic TV show Yes Minister about hapless government officials reflects how many feel about London’s sluggish response. A Serbian friend shared a circulating video that shows a pig being roasted on a spit; the swine is wearing a face mask, as an off-camera voice cites the importance of prevention. There is widespread chuckling about the number of divorces and births that coronavirus may cause. A popular Twitter meme says: “Your grandparents were called to war. You are being called to sit on a couch. You can do this!” A common European joke says it is the first time in history that the original is from China and the copy is from Milan. Azerbaijanis love garlic and onion, so they suggest their eating habits will induce social distancing and destroy the virus. Self-deprecating Kosovars jest that “even the virus doesn’t want to visit Kosovo.” Inspired by the crowded supermarkets in Bulgaria, someone there wrote a parody of a classic poem about the historic battle at Shipka Pass in 1877 during the Russo-Turkish War. The new version describes a bloody grocery store battle, which rages until Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and President Donald Trump arrive to impose order.","Cologne Sanitizer, Boxed Wine and Bidets: How People in 68 Countries Are Coping With Coronavirus",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/22/cologne-sanitizer-boxed-wine-and-bidets-how-people-in-68-countries-are-coping-with-coronavirus-140648,politico
"Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hitting pause on bipartisan negotiations on a $1.6 trillion-plus emergency package in the Senate, saying the House will forge ahead with its own bill to address coronavirus after congressional leaders failed to reach a deal earlier Sunday.  Pelosi’s comments come just hours before the Senate is scheduled to take a critical procedural vote on the package aimed at trying to stymie an economic collapse as the coronavirus continues to disrupt massive sectors of the U.S. economy.  “From my standpoint, we’re apart,” Pelosi told reporters as she entered Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) office Sunday morning.  Pelosi and McConnell met with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in hopes of hammering out a final agreement before the afternoon Senate vote.  Pelosi’s outlook for a deal wasn’t any better as she left the hour-long meeting, declaring plans for the House to introduce its own bill. Pelosi said the two sides were “still talking” but made clear that the Monday timeframe to pass something is McConnell’s self-imposed deadline, not hers.  “It’s on the Senate side because that’s their deadline for a vote,” Pelosi said about the Monday deadline. “We'll be introducing our own bill and hopefully it will be compatible.”  Senior House Democrats have been working on dual tracks for days — simultaneously drafting language for their own bill while also conferring with Senate Democrats on what they’d like to see in the McConnell-Schumer proposal.  The various House panels involved, from Financial Services to Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce and Education and Labor, were told to wrap up their portions of the bill Saturday night. The House Appropriations Committee is now compiling all of the language and a policy framework could be introduced as early as Sunday evening, according to multiple sources.  Democratic leadership also huddled on a conference call on Friday night, where Pelosi reiterated her plans to release a legislative framework that lets Democrats lay a marker in the talks.  It's unclear what exactly will be in the final House Democratic package. The caucus held several hours of conference calls this week for members to promote their ideas, including a significant expansion of unemployment insurance, direct cash payments to Americans under a certain income threshold, funding for hospitals and medical supplies, and grants to keep small businesses from folding. Hundreds of proposals were submitted from all corners of the caucus. ""I'm anxious to see what Speaker Pelosi would put on the table. She needs to be part of this conversation,"" said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) when asked about Pelosi's plans. ""We do have a bicameral Congress and the House of Representatives will ultimately consider whatever is sent to them. And I hope we can have a bipartisan agreement when that's sent."" Many of those same provisions are also being negotiated in the Senate bill but some House Democrats wanted to go even further, using the urgency of the herculean package to achieve broader, long term policy goals like a massive infrastructure deal. But even some House Democrats are privately wondering what is Pelosi’s endgame, especially given that lawmakers, including many in her own caucus, don’t even want to return to Washington at all, much less for a standoff with the Senate. Already, two House members have tested positive for coronavirus and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Sunday said he’s contracted the virus.  McConnell, meanwhile, has sought to drum up the pressure on House Democrats to support the Senate’s package, comparing it to last week’s multi-billion dollar “Phase 2” emergency package that Congress approved, which was largely crafted by Pelosi and Mnuchin. “It would be best for the country if the House would take it up and pass it just like we did earlier this week when the House passed a bill that I had only marginal participation in because the country was desperate for results. So I hope that’s the way this ends,” McConnell told reporters. Senate Republicans and the White House reiterated on Sunday they are ready to muscle ahead with the $1.6-plus trillion economic rescue package, which includes $350 billion for small businesses support and $250 billion for unemployment insurance. It also includes billions in relief to distressed industries like airlines, and billions more to help hospitals address the influx of patients. But Pelosi’s stance has thrown a wrench in negotiations just as McConnell is ready to close down talks altogether and vote. Pelosi took part in her first face-to-face meetings on the package Sunday morning, after flying back from San Francisco on Saturday.  But it’s not clear how Pelosi’s plan would work — committee chairs have been frenetically compiling ideas for a legislative package, but not ready for legislative text. Members have been largely kept in the dark, though they trust leadership to compile a package. The impasse in negotiations on Sunday comes after both sides insisted on Saturday that they were nearing the end of marathon talks on a $1 trillion-plus package that would attempt to blunt the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, which threatens to halt virtually all U.S. commerce for weeks, if not months. During a rare Saturday session at the Capitol, top Republicans and Democrats worked to narrow the list of sticking points on issues like unemployment insurance and airline relief, with the intention of releasing a framework of the deal, if not full legislative text, by late afternoon. “The Democrats are getting some of the things they’ve asked for,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) told reporters, ticking off wins like immediate relief to individuals, protections for health care workers, and shoring up small businesses. “They’re getting what they wanted on unemployment insurance.” But the two sides did not come to an agreement after roughly 12 more hours of talks on Saturday. By Sunday afternoon, Republicans had begun circulating text among their own members, which they intend to put on the floor on Monday.

The Kentucky Republican — who has been in working from the Senate in recent days — said he was tested out of caution “due to his extensive travel and events” and did not note any specific exposure.

"BERLIN — Germany will ramp up efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus by banning meetings of more than two people outside the same household and mandating the closure of nonessential businesses, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Sunday. Speaking after meeting the leaders of Germany’s regions earlier on Sunday afternoon, Merkel was clear the new restrictions are not desirable but necessary. “None of us wished that we would ever have to face the people with such rules,” said Merkel. The new regulations, the tightest in modern Germany’s history, will last at least two weeks, and mean restaurants, hairdressers, massage parlors and other nonessential stores should close. The measures stop short of a curfew. Merkel also warned of consequences if people violate the new measures, but did not specify what that would entail. “These are not recommendations, but rules,” she said. The new regulation says: “Spending time in public space is only permitted on your own, with another person who does not live in the household or with members of your own household.” When in public, people should stand at least 1.5 meters apart, Merkel said. Some federal states, including Bavaria in the south, have already implemented their own lockdown measures. Germany has already taken steps to try to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by expanding border controls to EU travelers and suspending various aspects of public life. Also Sunday, Merkel said she will go into self-quarantine at home after a doctor who gave her a vaccination tested positive for the coronavirus. A government spokesperson said the doctor had given the chancellor a “prophylactic pneumococcus vaccine” on Friday afternoon. The chancellor was informed of the positive test after she announced strict new rules across the country on Sunday aimed at containing the virus, the spokesperson said. She decided to immediately self-quarantine and will be tested regularly in the coming days, but will continue her official duties from home, the government said. On Wednesday, Merkel addressed the nation in a televised audience with an empathetic plea for solidarity and an end to stockpiling. She also called on residents to accept temporary restrictions on their way of life in order to curtail the spread of the virus. To date, there have been 24,714 cases in Germany with 92 deaths.",Germany’s Merkel bans meetings of more than 2 people to slow coronavirus,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/germany-merkel-bans-meetings-two-people-142283,politico
"Governors, mayors and front-line health care workers confronting rising numbers of critically ill coronavirus patients said Sunday they have not received meaningful amounts of federal aid, including the shipments of desperately needed masks and other emergency equipment that administration officials say they have already dispatched. As the crisis spreads, the Senate was moving forward with a rare Sunday procedural vote despite a breakdown in negotiations between Democrats and Republicans on a third coronavirus aid package. Among the points of contention: funding for hospitals and conditions on the billions of dollars that would flow to impacted corporations. The Senate wants to pass the bill containing both broad economic stimulus measures and direct help for American families as early as Monday. Meanwhile, the pressure on hospitals in hard-hit areas is mounting, and several Democratic governors are demanding a more coordinated national response to get supplies as fast as possible to where they are needed most critically. But President Donald Trump hit back at the governors' televised pleas, tweeting Sunday that they ""shouldn't be blaming the Federal Goverment for their own shortcomings."" He told the governors the federal government's role is to be there ""to back you up should you fail, and always will be!"" “We are desperate,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told ABC Sunday morning. “We've had a big ask into the strategic stockpile in the White House. They've given us a fraction of our ask.” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer echoed that urgency, saying her state’s hospitals are dealing with about 800 confirmed cases of the virus — up from only one just 12 days ago — and are struggling with serious shortages of both test kits and protective equipment for medical workers. The shortages have forced hospitals to adopt risky practices like reusing masks and having staff wear bandanas when no mask is available. A lack of personal protective equipment puts medical personnel at greater risk of becoming infected or placed in quarantine, exacerbating hospitals' existing staff shortages. “We’ve got to have those masks,” Whitmer said. “Had the federal government really started focusing when it became clear that the whole world was going to be confronting this, we would be in a stronger position right now ... Lives will be lost because we weren’t prepared.” The nation's main hospital association is also reporting ongoing gaps in the supply line, despite the mobilization of some federal aid from the Strategic National Stockpile, donations from other industries and other sources. ""There is a supply. Many people have them, but there's a gap and we're going to need more,"" Richard Pollack, the CEO of the American Hospital Association, told CBS. ""If we don't protect our health care workers, the system will completely collapse."" Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor, whose agency was not activated to run the pandemic response until Friday, painted a more optimistic picture in Sunday morning appearances on ABC and CNN. He said masks and other equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile are well on their way to states — particularly hard-hit areas like Washington, California and New York. “They have been distributed. They've been distributed over the past couple of weeks. They're shipping today. They'll ship tomorrow,” Gaynor told ABC. “We are shipping from our national stockpile, we're shipping from vendors, we're shipping from donations. It is happening.” Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, offered similar assurances on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""The resources that are being marshaled are going to be clearly directed to those hot spots that need it most,"" he said. ""So not only is New York trying to get resources themselves, but we're going to be pouring it in from the federal government. So it would be a combination of local and federal. But it's very, very clear that they are a very high priority."" But Gaynor and other administration officials sidestepped repeated questions on exactly how many masks were being shipped and when they would be in the hands of doctors and nurses who need them. “I can't give you a rough number,” he said in another interview on CNN, adding that governors should not depend on federal disbursements and should try on their own to obtain masks and other equipment. “If you find it on the market, go ahead and buy it. FEMA will reimburse you for it,” he said. “This is a shared responsibility.” Several governors pushed back, warning that pitting states against one another, the federal government, and other countries in a bidding war on the private market is no way to respond to a pandemic that requires a coordinated national response to obtain and allocate emergency goods. “It’s a wide, Wild West…out there,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said of his attempts to obtain supplies. “And indeed we’re overpaying, I would say, for [personal protective equipment] because of that competition.” ""We need the federal government to get us those test kits,” Whitmer agreed. “We need PPEs. And frankly a patchwork strategy of each state doing what they can is — we’re going to do it if we have to, but it would be nice to have a national strategy.” Governors, congressional lawmakers and mayors continued to plead with the White House over the weekend to use the powers of the Defense Production Act to speed up manufacture of masks, ventilators and other scarce supplies as many hospitals say they’re set to run out within days. Trump also tweeted Sunday morning that he has given a handful of car companies ""the go ahead"" to make ventilators and other unnamed ""metal products"" for hospitals, but gave no indication of a timeline or quantity. Converting factories from making cars to making medical equipment cannot happen immediately, and could take several months. In the meantime, hospitals need immediate help. “We've gotten no indication of any factory on 24/7 shifts. We've gotten no shipments,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on NBC. “I can’t be blunt enough: If the president does not act, people will die who could have lived otherwise.” De Blasio also called on the president to mobilize the military's health care workers to immediately deploy to coronavirus hot spots like his own city. ""All military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep, like New York, right now,"" he said. ""Why are they at their bases? Why are they not being allowed to serve? I guarantee you they're ready to serve. But the president has to give the order."" Though Trump signed the defense act last week, Gaynor confirmed that the administration has yet to use it to order any companies to manufacture more products. He suggested such a step wasn’t necessary as companies are already stepping up. “We haven't had to use it, because companies around the country, donations, they are saying, ‘What can we do to help you?’ And it's happening without using that — that lever,” he said. “If it comes to a point where we have to pull the level, we will.” Both in private calls with the White House and in public interviews, lawmakers are insisting that time is now. “We cannot wait until people start really dying in large numbers to start production, especially of more complicated equipment like ventilators and hospital beds,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told CNN. “We need to start this production right now to get ready for the surge that is coming in two to three weeks.”",Desperate and angry state leaders push back on Trump admin claims of mass mask shipments,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/state-leaders-trump-administration-mask-shipments-141884,politico
"Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor said Sunday that masks are currently being shipped to states, particularly hot spots like New York City and California — an announcement that comes as health care workers grow increasingly desperate for critical medical gear. However, Gaynor was unable to give more detail on when the masks would arrive or provide specific numbers. “They have been distributed. They've been distributed over the past couple of weeks. They're shipping today. They'll ship tomorrow,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”  ABC’s Martha Raddatz asked Gaynor if facilities would get them in time before the health system in critically affected states is overwhelmed. “Again, they're shipping today, they shipped yesterday and they're shipping tomorrow.” The White House coronavirus task force announced Saturday that 600 million N-95 masks were ordered to protect U.S. health care workers, but officials were unable to answer when they would be ready for use. At the briefing, Gaynor told reporters: “Every single governor across the country is looking for the exact same thing, so it’s a balance” and added that the masks “are out there now.” On Sunday, Raddatz pressed Gaynor: ""When you say 'they,' how many? Which masks? The new masks?"" ""I mean, it is hundreds of thousands of millions of things that we're shipping from the stockpile. I can't give you the details about what every single state of what every single city is doing,"" he responded. “But I'm telling you that we are shipping from our national stockpile, we're shipping from vendors, we're shipping from donations. It is happening. The demand is great."" Gaynor said the administration is prepared to “go to zero” in the national stockpile to meet medical demands.  He also reiterated that FEMA has been fulfilling its mandated mission in addressing the coronavirus, having let the Health and Human Services Department take the reins. “The public health medical mission, that authority lies with HHS“ Gaynor said. “My mission, FEMA, prior to this, natural disasters and those catastrophic events that happen. Now it's a different world. Now HHS and FEMA are locked arm in arm … today I'm trying to focus on today and tomorrow and where we want to be in a couple weeks.”",FEMA head says masks are being sent but declines to be specific,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/coronavirus-masks-fema-gaynor-141525,politico
"Negotiations on massive $1.6 trillion-plus emergency economic package to deal with the coronavirus crisis faltered on Sunday, and House Democrats are now planning to introduce their own proposal, according to Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to go ahead with a key procedural vote at 3 p.m. on Sunday, and he said that congressional leaders and the White House are ""very close"" to agreement on a massive economic package worth at least $1.6 trillion. Senate GOP leaders circulated text of a nearly 580-page bill to senators' offices and K Street before the vote.  ""I think it's safe to say we're very close,"" McConnell told reporters following a nearly hour-long meeting in his office with Pelosi, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).  ""We have integrated a number of ideas the Democrats had over the last 48 hours in these working groups that you're familiar with. Now we're at a point in the discussions where people will say yes or no, and I'm confident given the desire to see an outcome, that we'll get to yes,” he said.   McConnell predicted the Senate would vote Sunday afternoon for cloture for a ""shell bill."" That would allow senators to move forward on consideration of the actual legislation, although hurdles remain. McConnell wants to have a final vote on Monday.   But Pelosi indicated that House Democrats didn't support the Senate bill and will move ahead with their own proposal.  “We’ll be introducing our own bill and hopefully it will be compatible,"" Pelosi said after leaving McConnell's office. ""I can tell you what happened -- we're continuing to talk,"" Schumer said. The New York Democrat wouldn't say whether he'd advise Senate Democrats to vote against cloture, which would totally disrupt McConnell's timetable for passing the stimulus package. Such a vote could be politically risky for Senate Democrats as the party seeks to win the Senate back. McConnell and President Donald Trump could then hit them for obstruction in the face of a unprecedented public health emergency and economic slowdown.  But Pelosi's announcement means that she is not considering just taking up the Senate bill and passing it through the House on unanimous consent basis. That also means the House may be forced back into session, even though many lawmakers are concerned about the threat from the coronavirus and the difficulties in reaching Capitol Hill from their home districts.  Democrats are saying that there's still major hurdles before they get to an agreement.   According to Democrats, there's still no language preventing layoffs for companies that accept federal aid. The source also said the tentative proposal gives too much discretion to the Treasury Department on who gets funds and does not include strong enough provisions to prevent stock buybacks. In addition, funding for the hard-hit airline industry is a major sticking point.   Democrats are also concerned about Senate language affecting funding for Planned Parenthood.  Schumer and Pelosi have stayed in close touch with Mnuchin throughout the negotiations. Pelosi flew back to Washington on Saturday.   Late Saturday evening, McConnell instructed chairmen of key committees to draft language that senators could review before a floor vote Sunday that would advance the legislation, in an effort to meet a Monday deadline for passage. Democrats insist there’s no final deal.   While outstanding issues remain, Democrats are expected to see a win with $250 billion allocated to unemployment insurance — one of the major sticking points in the negotiations. In addition, billions are expected to go to hospitals to address the influx of patients due to the pandemic. Schumer has called for a “Marshall Plan” for hospitals.  In addition, Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) reached an agreement in principle Saturday evening with Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), on the package’s small business provisions. The final deal on small businesses would amount to $350 billion, covering 58 million American workers and more than 30 million small businesses, Rubio tweeted Saturday. Meanwhile, as much as $500 billion is expected to go to distressed industries, including airlines. Democrats insist the package include provisions to stop stock buybacks or increases in pay for top executives.  The Senate bill would mostly prevent companies that accept bailout money from buying back their own stock, although that restriction could be waived by the Treasury Secretary.  Democrats have also pushed for expanded paid leave provisions. But Republicans are showing little interest, with GOP aides noting the House-passed second aid package already included provisions to expand paid sick leave.  Republicans are also pushing for $250 billion in direct cash payments to workers. Under the original GOP proposal, individuals and families would receive $1,200 and $2,400 in direct cash payments, depending on their income level. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) have raised concerns that the original language of the provision penalizes lower-income Americans who do have a taxable income. But Republican aides say the issue will be resolved in the final text.

"The Justice Department has quietly asked Congress for the ability to ask chief judges to detain people indefinitely without trial during emergencies — part of a push for new powers that comes as the novel coronavirus spreads throughout the United States. Documents reviewed by POLITICO detail the department’s requests to lawmakers on a host of topics, including the statute of limitations, asylum and the way court hearings are conducted. POLITICO also reviewed and previously reported on documents seeking the authority to extend deadlines on merger reviews and prosecutions. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the documents. The move has tapped into a broader fear among civil liberties advocates and Donald Trump’s critics — that the president will use a moment of crisis to push for controversial policy changes. Already, he has cited the pandemic as a reason for heightening border restrictions and restricting asylum claims. He has also pushed for further tax cuts as the economy withers, arguing it would soften the financial blow to Americans. And even without policy changes, Trump has vast emergency powers that he could deploy right now to try to slow the coronavirus outbreak. The DOJ requests — which are unlikely to make it through a Democratic-led House — span several stages of the legal process, from initial arrest to how cases are processed and investigated. In one of the documents, the department proposed that Congress grant the attorney general power to ask the chief judge of any district court to pause court proceedings “whenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situation.”  The proposal would also grant those top judges broad authority to pause court proceedings during emergencies. It would apply to “any statutes or rules of procedure otherwise affecting pre-arrest, post-arrest, pre-trial, trial, and post-trial procedures in criminal and juvenile proceedings and all civil process and proceedings,” according to draft legislative language the department shared with Congress. In making the case for the change, the DOJ wrote that individual judges can currently pause proceedings during emergencies but that their proposal would make sure all judges in any particular district could handle emergencies “in a consistent manner.”  The request raised eyebrows because of its potential implications for habeas corpus — the constitutional right to appear before a judge after arrest and seek release. “Not only would it be a violation of that, but it says ‘affecting pre-arrest,’” said Norman L. Reimer, executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. “So that means you could be arrested and never brought before a judge until they decide that the emergency or the civil disobedience is over. I find it absolutely terrifying. Especially in a time of emergency, we should be very careful about granting new powers to the government.” Reimer said the possibility of chief judges suspending all court rules during an emergency without a clear end in sight was deeply disturbing. “That is something that should not happen in a democracy,” he said. The department also asked Congress to pause the statute of limitations for criminal investigations and civil proceedings during national emergencies, “and for one year following the end of the national emergency,” according to the draft legislative text. Trump recently declared the coronavirus crisis a national emergency.  Another controversial request: The department is looking to change the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in some cases to expand the use of videoconference hearings and to let some of those hearings happen without defendants’ consent, according to the draft legislative text. “Video teleconferencing may be used to conduct an appearance under this rule,” read a draft of potential new language for Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(f), crossing out the phrase “if the defendant consents.”  “Video teleconferencing may be used to arraign a defendant,” read draft text of rule 10(c), again striking out the phrase “if the defendant consents.” Reimer said forcing people to have hearings over video rather than in person would threaten civil liberties. “If it were with the consent of the accused person it would be fine,” he said. “But if it’s not with the consent of the accused person, it’s a terrible road to go down. We have a right to public trials. People have a right to be present in court.” The department also wants Congress to change the law to explicitly say that people with COVID-19 — the illness caused by the novel coronavirus — are not included among those who may apply for asylum. And the department asked for the same change regarding people who are “subject to a presidential proclamation suspending and limiting the entry of aliens into the United States,” according to the draft legislative language. Layli Miller-Muro, the CEO of the Tahirih Justice Center, which advocates for women and girls fleeing violence, said the language would block anyone on a presidential travel ban list from seeking asylum in the U.S. “I think it’s a humanitarian tragedy that fails to recognize that vulnerable people from those countries are among the most persecuted and that protecting them is exactly what the refugee convention was designed to do,” she said. The asylum request comes as the Trump administration says it will begin denying entry to all migrants illegally crossing the U.S. southern border, including those seeking asylum. “I hope we come out of this with a sense of oneness, interconnectedness,” Miller-Munro said of the coronavirus pandemic. “Borders can’t protect us. Viruses do not care.”",DOJ seeks new emergency powers amid coronavirus pandemic,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023,politico
"Barren streets, vacant offices and empty gyms. A small quarantined California town of 2,600, guarded by military officials. Rationing medical care. Government turf wars and bureaucratic battles.  All of these scenes unfolded on the screen before me—not on cable news television—but in a generation’s worth of Hollywood blockbusters and a six-part miniseries about viral epidemics.  On the first weekend of our national emergency, I self-quarantined inside my apartment. I socially distanced from hundreds of St. Patrick’s Day revelers who crowded inside a white party tent and listened to a blaring Bon Jovi cover band outside the Irish pub across the street below. Then, I binge-watched nearly 10 hours of virus entertainment, from 1995’s Outbreak to 2019’s The Hot Zone.  While I didn’t emerge as a postdoc epidemiologist, the lessons I took away, hidden in plain sight all these years, would be valuable to any member of the White House's coronavirus task force. It’s all there, from Contagion’s advocacy for social distancing to Outbreak and Hot Zone’s depictions of how interagency squabbling can slow responses. Even the epigraph of Outbreak, from the Nobel laureate and bacteriologist Joshua Lederberg, should have focused us on the gravity of a pandemic earlier: “The single biggest threat to man’s continued dominance on the planet is the virus.” But I also noticed something else: These films have perhaps numbed us to those very viruses that threaten us most—the viruses that do not have a giant fatality rate or change our physical appearance. In Outbreak, Dustin Hoffman’s Colonel Sam Daniels, a virologist with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, contends with Motaba, a fever-inducing virus that kills 100 percent of its victims in two to three days. In The Hot Zone, Ebola leaves its victims with a rash and kills them quickly. In Contagion, MEV-1 has a mortality rate around 20 percent. If Motaba had hit, the U.S. the government would have been faster to quarantine cities and issue shelter-in-place orders, shutting down schools and nonessential businesses. Had Ebola been spreading around Indianapolis, I bet those revelers across the street would have stayed at home. But my neighbors seemed blind to COVID-19, which is more insidious and subtly dangerous than the diseases from the movies. Its mortality rate is in the single digits—low enough that many think they have little to fear—but it is proving just as disabling to the economy and our way of life, if not more, than much more deadly outbreaks, which can be contained faster.  Earlier this week, I asked Dr. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiologist, why all of these movies hadn’t moved politicians and voters to take viral epidemics more seriously. “I don’t think movies change the way people feel about things,” he told me, adding that he was working with the writer of Contagion, Scott Z. Burns, on a public awareness campaign ad on the novel coronavirus.  “The fact that the United States has dodged the bullet with all of the latest infectious diseases, my perception of our government is that unless it’s screaming hot in the headlines, nothing will be done,” says Tracey McNamara, a technical consultant on Contagion and a veterinary medicine professor at Western University of Health Services Contagion, hints at our lackadaisical approach to any virus that isn’t produced in a Hollywood studio: There’s a scene in which a reporter asks Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Administrator Ellis Cheever, played by Laurence Fishburne, whether the government is overreacting to a virus that would claim 26 million lives in 29 days.  “Dr. Cheever, are you concerned that the CDC faces a credibility issue here, after the perceived overreaction to H1N1?” the reporter asks.  “I’d rather the news story be that we overreacted than that many people lost their lives because we didn’t do enough,” Cheever replies.  Set pieces and dramatic news conference scenes like this one seemed a critical part of any disaster movie. Now, we see them almost everyday when the coronavirus task force briefs the nation. For decades, these films have thrilled theatergoers with an invisible enemy, the stark reality of an apocalyptic human vs. nature, us vs. it conflict. But the actual conflict in all of these films is actually something different: It’s us vs. the bureaucracy. These are not so much films about disasters as they are films about government.  “Contagion is such a compelling film—life is unfolding very much like the movie,” says McNamara, who detected West Nile Virus in the summer of 1999 while working as the chief pathologist at the Bronx Zoo, when crows started falling from the sky and into exhibits. “The speed with which it spread. How it spread.” Turns out, Hollywood has been offering Washington clues about how a pandemic might transpire for decades—and what the government should do to fight it. Here are just a few: Much of Outbreak revolves around the efforts of the protagonist—Colonel Daniels, played by Hoffman—to convince his boss, Brigadier General William Ford—played by Morgan Freeman—that the country faces a real threat from the fictional Motaba virus. Daniels spends much of the film battling with Army Major General Donald McClintock, played by Donald Sutherland, to get the word out about the dangers of the virus.  After Daniels’ ex-wife, CDC staffer Dr. Robby Keough—played by Rene Russo—treats a dying and infected patient, she laments not getting a CDC advisory out about the virus faster. The CDC staffers’ efforts were blocked by her superiors. “I should’ve forced the alert,” the doctor says, explaining Motaba’s deadly effects. “Christ, Sam. I opened this guy up. Looked like a bomb went off inside. His pancreas, liver, kidney, spleen—all the organs were liquified. Christ, I should’ve forced the alert.” In Contagion, weeks into the outbreak of MEV-1, Dr. Sanjay Gupta (played by himself) asks CDC Administrator Cheever how many people have died from the disease during a cable television appearance. The answer, Cheever admits, was “very difficult” to know because reporting varied by state. “There are 50 different states in this country, which means there are 50 different health departments. Followed by 50 different protocols.” And in the final episode of The Hot Zone, a dispute between an Ebola researcher and the head of the CDC almost derails efforts to get to the bottom of the Reston, Virginia, Ebola outbreak.  “The guy hates my guts,” Walter said of the CDC official Trevor Rhodes (James D’Arcy). “I’m never going to convince him to help.”  “You need to bury whatever happened between you two, Carter. You got no choice.” The messages of all these films—infighting and turf battles make things worse—felt apt for the ongoing feud between Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is a branch of HHS that operates independently. “A series of incidents over the past 120 days suggest basic communication and coordination between CMS and HHS is lacking, thereby jeopardizing HHS’ mission and undermining public trust,” HHS chief information officer José Arrieta wrote a recent memo. The latest incident? On February 23, HHS’ email system crashed, causing vital messages about the emergency coronavirus funding package to be delayed for up to 11 hours. The cause: Verma’s CMS had failed to brief HHS leaders about a test that would send thousands of messages through the system. The outage slowed the administration’s response to the deadly outbreak.  In the six-part National Geographic mini-series The Hot Zone, based on the 1994 nonfiction book by Richard Preston, Wade Carter, a fictionalized reclusive Ebola expert who studied the virus in the field is frustrated that more senior officials aren’t taking the threat of Ebola on American soil more seriously. Carter tells Army Colonel Nancy Jaax, played by Julianna Margulies, a veterinarian who helped contain Ebola-infected monkeys from the Philippines: “Did I want this? Never. Now it’s here. Would it be good for the Oval Office to be pissing its pants about this now? You bet.”  But by the end of the series, after the scientists contain an Ebola outbreak in Reston, Virginia, there seems to be little appetite from public policymakers to take the threat of an epidemic seriously. We see a flyover shot of Capitol Hill. In a nameless committee room, the deputy secretary of the National Institutes of Health asks Jaax: “So no one died?”  “That’s correct, Mr. Chairman,” Jaax says. “But four people tested positive for the Ebola virus.  “And 172 people were tested and came up negative,” the deputy secretary responded, unperturbed.  The warning was clear: When scientists are worried, people should listen. And yet, not more than a week ago, President Donald Trump and some Republican members of Congress, along with conservative television hosts, were saying that journalists and Democrats were overplaying the threat of the coronavirus. Now some of those pols who thought it was no big deal are getting tested for COVID-19 themselves.  In The Hot Zone, Jaax’s husband, Noah Emmerich’s Lieutenant Colonel Jerry Jaax, makes a plea: “It’s no secret the CDC needs more funding for research and development”—meaning that the CDC was caught somewhat flat-footed by the outbreak in Reston.  But in real life, just last week, even as coronavirus was spreading in the United States, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought defended the Trump administration’s proposed $35 million cut to the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund, designed for use by the CDC.  Representative. Matt Cartwright Matt Cartwright, a Democratic member from Pennsylvania, bristled at the cuts in a hearing with Vought. “The question is today, as we sit here and we know about coronavirus and the impact it’s taking on the people of the world and the economies of the world and the stock market and everything, as you sit here today, are you ready to take that back?” In none of the virus movies I watched do we see the U.S. president. He or she is often one of the least important characters. In Contagion, he’s moved underground. In Outbreak, we only see the chief of staff, talking White House officials through the ethics of bombing a California town, executing all of its citizens to contain Mataba. Instead, the most important characters—the ones who do the talking—are the public health officials, virologists, researchers and frontline health care workers. In the movies, scientists always offer a clear explanation and as much information as they have to concerned citizens. Politicians would only get in the way. Trump didn’t get the memo. His statements about coronavirus have been perplexing and counterproductive. He said we have it “under control.” He compared it to the flu. He told people with the virus to go to work. He suggested the virus would “disappear.” Then he declared a national emergency. In contrast, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, a global health official at the State Department who is now White House coronavirus response coordinator, are lucid, calm presenters of information—perhaps the administration’s most credible spokespeople. If this were a Hollywood movie, those two would have been doing most of the talking from the beginning.  Rear Admiral Lyle Haggerty, played by Bryan Cranston in Contagion, alludes to a congressman who is at risk of infecting his fellow members with MEV-1. “There’s a sick congressman from Illinois in D.C.,” Haggerty says. “He was in Chicago over the holiday. They are using the pod to fly him home, and then they are closing Midway and O’Hare. The governor there is calling out the national guard. They are setting up roadblocks. They are shutting down the board of trade, public transportation. Even the Teamsters are pulling their drivers off the road.”  Any policymaker who watched that scene and connected the dots wouldn’t have been able to escape the realization that in the event of a pandemic, it would be important for Congress to have a way of working remotely. This week, several representatives and senators directed some staffers to work from home. Still, members of Congress, many of whom are at risk of higher mortality rates given their average age—57.8 years in the House and 61.8 years in the Senate— don’t have an established way to conduct their business remotely. The Wolfgang Petersen film Outbreak is perhaps the least subtle of the group of films. A lab clinician infected with Motaba sees a movie with his girlfriend. As a result, the entire town of Cedar Creek, California—population 2,600—is nearly bombed with the “the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in our arsenal” by the U.S. government to contain the spread of the virus.  When Daniels and Keough survey the infected at a makeshift hospital in Cedar Creek, Keough remarks: “So many—so fast.”  “Apparently they all gathered at a movie theater,” Daniels replies.  In Contagion, the CDC administrator urges social distancing and avoiding shaking hands as the best advice for controlling the spread of MEV-1. We see empty gyms and open-floor plan offices. “Right now, our best defense has been social distancing,” Fishburne’s Cheever, the CDC director, tells Gutpa in a cable television studio. “No handshaking. Staying home when you are sick. Washing your hands frequently.”  The idea for the scene came from Lipkin, the Columbia University epidemiologist who told the film’s writer, Scott Z. Burns, that he would serve as a technical adviser on the movie if he agreed to make it as scientifically accurate a film as possible.  In the film’s emotional denouement, Cheever visits the home of one the CDC’s janitors to deliver a vaccine, where he explains to the janitor’s son the origins of the handshake. (The scene was “designed” to disclose the history of the handshake, Lipkin told me in an interview earlier this week.) “Do you know where this comes from? Shaking hands?” he asks the boy after delivering the vaccine by pushing a swab up his nostril. “It was a way of showing a stranger you weren’t carrying a weapon in the old days.”  These days, we are all presumed to be armed and dangerous.",What I Learned About Coronavirus From Binge-watching 10 Hours of Virus Movies,2020-03-21,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/21/pandemic-movies-coronavirus-140043,politico
"The 1.7-million member American Federation of Teachers union said Sunday it is backing former Vice President Joe Biden for president, coalescing support from educators while the nation’s presidential campaign reels from the novel coronavirus pandemic. The announcement means Biden has the nod from the nation’s two largest teachers unions. The 3-million member National Education Association, the nation’s largest union overall, endorsed him last week. ""Before the Covid-19 epidemic, the 2020 election was about the soul of our country. Now it’s about our soul, our safety, our health, our security and our economic well-being,” said AFT President Randi Weingarten. “Joe Biden is the experienced and empathic leader our country needs right now.” AFT released a polling memo that showed its Democratic members favor Biden (60 percent) over Sen. Bernie Sanders (30 percent) as the party’s nominee. Seventy-five percent of members — who include teachers, higher education faculty and health care professionals — view Biden positively, a gain of five points since October, while Sanders’ positive rating has slipped 6 percentage points (to 66 percent) over the same period, according to the survey by Hart Research Associates. The endorsement comes at a time of uncertainty in the primary process, with several states postponing voting. Instead of traditional phone banks, meetings and canvassing, NEA has moved to digital get-out-the-vote efforts, including emails, social media and digital ads to encourage members to vote. Weingarten called the pandemic “the greatest challenge we have battled in generations,” and she blasted President Donald Trump and his administration for failing to secure testing and personal protective equipment to safeguard health care providers, concealing the severity of the virus and downplaying the public health risks. She said the administration has “refused to deploy the full arsenal” of federal resources, leaving leadership to governors. “Now more than ever, we need a standard-bearer who is actually looking out for us, and who has a proven track record of steering the country successfully through economic and social upheaval,” she said. AFT backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary. The early endorsement didn't go over well with some of the rank-and-file members who supported Sanders and with other labor leaders, who questioned its timing. Their endorsement this year follows candidate events, town halls, polls, regional conferences and other efforts to maximize member participation leading up to the November election. The polling memo shows support for Biden “has consolidated throughout the union, making him the first choice of every constituency, every region of the country, and both men and women. He not only enjoys a large 46-point edge among moderate/conservative Democrats, but he also leads among liberal Democrats (+17).” Most members believe he can beat Trump. Last month, AFT announced it would encourage its local and state affiliates to back or endorse the presidential bids of Biden, Sanders (I-Vt.) or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Weingarten announced her “personal support” for Warren before she dropped out of the race. Weingarten described Biden’s presidential candidacy in a November interview with POLITICO as being from “a different era.” People love that about Biden, she said, but it also means he’s “not as attentive to the cues of this era.” On Sunday, she lauded Biden’s character and his plans for investing in public education, making college “a reality for everyone” and fixing the “broken” Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. She also said Biden is with the union on making health care a human right, prioritizing clean energy and environmental justice and building a pathway to the middle class. “His whole career has been devoted to building a pathway to the middle class for the millions of people facing an affordability crisis daily. It’s time to give him the chance to do that as president,” she said.

"A new lawsuit argues that immigrant families being held under the Trump administration’s family detention policy should be released immediately because they are at grave risk of contracting the coronavirus due to conditions in those facilities. Lawyers filed suit in federal court in Washington on Saturday on behalf of more than three dozen families held at a trio of detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania. Advocates say the communal housing arrangements, limited cleaning supplies and the regular influx of new families make the centers a potential hotbed for Covid-19 infection and defy guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control discouraging any gathering of more than 10 people. “Detained mothers, fathers and children are forced to live and sleep in close quarters and required to congregate and as a result, cannot achieve the ‘social distancing’ needed to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19,” according to the suit, filed by immigration lawyers in New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. “Even in their beds they cannot even sleep or receive the required distance necessary to protect themselves.”  The suit says cleaning in the so-called Family Residential Centers is inconsistent because it is typically done by detainees who are paid $1 a day for that work. Hand sanitizer and masks are not typically available to the immigrants, and gloves are provided only for certain purposes, the complaint alleges. “It is almost certain to expect COVID-19 to infect and spread rapidly in family residential centers, especially when people cannot engage in proper hygiene or isolate themselves from infected or asymptomatic residents or staff,” the suit contends. Attorneys for the detained families alleged that the current conditions violate the Constitution, as well as a 1997 consent decree known as the Flores agreement, which requires a safe environment for minors in immigration custody. Lawyers asked the court on Saturday for an emergency hearing and temporary restraining order requiring release of their clients. Almost 2,000 detainees are part of families held at the centers in Berks County, Pa., Dilley, Texas, and Karnes City, Texas. While lawyers have called for release of all the detainees, the suit does not seek class-action status, so it is limited for now to the 37 families listed. Spokespeople for the Justice Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which oversees the centers, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the suit. The suit says there are indications that officials “have begun to release some families — those that include pregnant women or people who suffer from asthma — at the Karnes and Dilley FRCs.” The Trump administration adopted the family detention policy in 2018 after the administration’s earlier family-separation policy triggered widespread outrage. Immigration officials have since made even more dramatic changes, ordering most asylum seekers along the southern border to return to Mexico to wait for hearings in immigration courts on their claims. Some details in the new suit underscore the difficult position immigration enforcement officials are in as the virus outbreak intensifies. One complaint made on behalf of the families is that visitors, including lawyers, are often entering the centers without having their temperatures checked and without being told to wash their hands or provided with hand sanitizer. However, immigration lawyers also objected on Sunday after ICE said attorneys wishing to consult immigration detainees in person would now be required to “wear disposable vinyl gloves, N-95 or surgical masks, and eye protection.” Beginning Monday, attorneys need to “provide” those items themselves, new ICE guidelines say, despite the fact they are in short supply. ""[email protected] requiring attorneys to supply their own personal protective equipment to serve detained clients, when medical providers say THEY don’t have enough, is appalling and #unconstitutional,"" immigration lawyer Allen Orr Jr. wrote on Twitter. The suit over detained families was filed by three legal groups that provide assistance to those immigrants: ALDEA — the People’s Justice Center in Reading, Pa., the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services in San Antonio, Texas, and the Rapid Defense Network in New York. The case was not immediately assigned to a judge, a step that would typically happen on Monday for cases filed over the weekend. The request for an emergency hearing and restraining order is likely to be directed to the emergency duty judge for U.S. District Court in Washington this weekend: Ketanji Brown Jackson, an appointee of President Barack Obama.",Suit seeks release of immigrant families due to virus risk,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/suit-release-immigrant-families-coronavirus-142485,politico
"Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hitting pause on bipartisan negotiations on a $1.6 trillion-plus emergency package in the Senate, saying the House will forge ahead with its own bill to address coronavirus after congressional leaders failed to reach a deal earlier Sunday.  Pelosi’s comments come just hours before the Senate is scheduled to take a critical procedural vote on the package aimed at trying to stymie an economic collapse as the coronavirus continues to disrupt massive sectors of the U.S. economy.  “From my standpoint, we’re apart,” Pelosi told reporters as she entered Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) office Sunday morning.  Pelosi and McConnell met with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in hopes of hammering out a final agreement before the afternoon Senate vote.  Pelosi’s outlook for a deal wasn’t any better as she left the hour-long meeting, declaring plans for the House to introduce its own bill. Pelosi said the two sides were “still talking” but made clear that the Monday timeframe to pass something is McConnell’s self-imposed deadline, not hers.  “It’s on the Senate side because that’s their deadline for a vote,” Pelosi said about the Monday deadline. “We'll be introducing our own bill and hopefully it will be compatible.”  Despite saying the House would move ahead on its own, Pelosi also continued to engage in bipartisan negotiations on the Senate bill Sunday afternoon, according to a source.  Senior House Democrats have been working on dual tracks for days — simultaneously drafting language for their own bill while also conferring with Senate Democrats on what they’d like to see in the McConnell-Schumer proposal.  The various House panels involved, from Financial Services to Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce and Education and Labor, were told to wrap up their portions of the bill Saturday night. The House Appropriations Committee is now compiling all of the language and legislative text could be expected as soon as Monday, according to multiple sources.  Democratic leadership also huddled on a conference call on Friday night, where Pelosi reiterated her plans to release a legislative framework that lets Democrats lay a marker in the talks.  It's unclear what exactly will be in the final House Democratic package. The caucus held several hours of conference calls this week for members to promote their ideas, including a significant expansion of unemployment insurance, direct cash payments to Americans under a certain income threshold, funding for hospitals and medical supplies, and grants to keep small businesses from folding. Hundreds of proposals were submitted from all corners of the caucus. ""I'm anxious to see what Speaker Pelosi would put on the table. She needs to be part of this conversation,"" said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) when asked about Pelosi's plans. ""We do have a bicameral Congress and the House of Representatives will ultimately consider whatever is sent to them. And I hope we can have a bipartisan agreement when that's sent."" Many of those same provisions are also being negotiated in the Senate bill but some House Democrats wanted to go even further, using the urgency of the herculean package to achieve broader, long term policy goals like a massive infrastructure deal. But even some House Democrats are privately wondering what is Pelosi’s endgame, especially given that lawmakers, including many in her own caucus, don’t even want to return to Washington at all, much less for a standoff with the Senate. Already, two House members have tested positive for coronavirus and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Sunday said he’s contracted the virus.  McConnell, meanwhile, has sought to drum up the pressure on House Democrats to support the Senate’s package, comparing it to last week’s multi-billion dollar “Phase 2” emergency package that Congress approved, which was largely crafted by Pelosi and Mnuchin. “It would be best for the country if the House would take it up and pass it just like we did earlier this week when the House passed a bill that I had only marginal participation in because the country was desperate for results. So I hope that’s the way this ends,” McConnell told reporters. Senate Republicans and the White House reiterated on Sunday they are ready to muscle ahead with the $1.6-plus trillion economic rescue package, which includes $350 billion for small businesses support and $250 billion for unemployment insurance. It also includes billions in relief to distressed industries like airlines, and billions more to help hospitals address the influx of patients. But Pelosi’s stance has thrown a wrench in negotiations just as McConnell is ready to close down talks altogether and vote. Pelosi took part in her first face-to-face meetings on the package Sunday morning, after flying back from San Francisco on Saturday.  But it’s not clear how Pelosi’s plan would work — committee chairs have been frenetically compiling ideas for a legislative package, but are not yet ready for legislative text. Members have been largely kept in the dark about which ideas will be included, though they trust leadership to compile a package. The impasse in negotiations on Sunday comes after both sides insisted on Saturday that they were nearing the end of marathon talks on a $1 trillion-plus package that would attempt to blunt the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, which threatens to halt virtually all U.S. commerce for weeks, if not months. During a rare Saturday session at the Capitol, top Republicans and Democrats worked to narrow the list of sticking points on issues like unemployment insurance and airline relief, with the intention of releasing a framework of the deal, if not full legislative text, by late afternoon. “The Democrats are getting some of the things they’ve asked for,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) told reporters, ticking off wins like immediate relief to individuals, protections for health care workers, and shoring up small businesses. “They’re getting what they wanted on unemployment insurance.” But the two sides did not come to an agreement after roughly 12 more hours of talks on Saturday. By Sunday afternoon, Republicans had begun circulating text among their own members, which they intend to put on the floor on Monday.

"Sen. Rand Paul on Sunday announced he has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, becoming the first senator and third member of Congress known to have contracted the virus. The Kentucky Republican — who has been working from the Capitol in recent days — said he was tested out of caution “due to his extensive travel and events"" and is not showing symptoms of the highly infectious virus. Paul’s infection quickly reverberated throughout the Senate, where lawmakers were surprised by his diagnosis as they pushed ahead with a massive package to rescue the economy from the coronavirus outbreak. The Kentucky senator had been interacting with his colleagues just days prior, voting on the floor, sitting in meetings and speaking to reporters in hallways. But the news of Paul’s infection does not appear to have changed the calculation for Senate GOP leaders, whose members remain in Washington for a rare weekend session — at least until the stimulus package is complete. “I don’t believe it changes our posture,” Senate Rules Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told reporters on Sunday when asked whether the Senate would change its operations. “I think individual members will know if they’ve had much contact with him in the last week or not.” “The crisis that we’re facing requires that we be here,” added Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho.) “I can’t say that Congress should quit operating. The people of America need Congress to be working on this crisis response.” Several senators, including Susan Collins (R-Maine), however, said the chamber should take an extended leave from the Capitol after clearing the latest relief package. “I believe that our first obligation is to finish our work. After that, I think it would be wise to accelerate the break that was scheduled for April,” Collins told reporters. Paul expects to return to the Senate after isolating himself, an aide to the senator said. The staffer added that Paul’s office in Washington has been working remotely for 10 days, so “virtually no staff” has had physical contact with him. Health officials have said the virus is spread largely among people who are showing symptoms of the disease. But people who have the disease who aren’t symptomatic — like Paul — can still pass it to others.  Privately, some senators have become very concerned over Paul's diagnosis. Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran said in a GOP lunch Sunday that Paul was at the gym this morning, swimming in the pool. Paul is one of a small group of lawmakers to have tested positive for the disease, in addition to Reps. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.). Both members developed symptoms last weekend, after being in the Capitol as recently as last Saturday morning. Many lawmakers on Capitol Hill fear the virus will spread within their ranks, as the Senate remains in the building to draft and pass much-needed economic recovery legislation. The House, whose members have been working from their districts for the past week, is expected to return sometime this week to vote on the Senate’s “Phase 3” package.  Many members of the House are privately worried about returning to Washington, not just because it would require hundreds of people to get on airplanes but because it could expose them to the virus in the sprawling Capitol complex. Several anxious lawmakers of both parties have called for the House to consider voting remotely, though it would be one of the biggest procedural changes to Congress in history. The virus has likely been inside the Capitol for weeks: Several staffers in the House and Senate have tested positive, in addition to the three members. And many more lawmakers and staffers have been told by the House physician’s office of possible exposure at the Capitol, with each of those individuals asked to self-quarantine in their homes. Many parts of the Capitol have ceased regular operations: Offices are largely teleworking, visitor access is restricted, and tours are canceled.  Still, there are hundreds of people in the building each day, including Capitol police, food preparation workers and cleaning staff — not including the 100 senators, dozens of staff and reporters. And there is no universal screening for people entering the building. The concerns of infection are heightened in the Senate, where the average age of a senator is nearly 63.  “Senators, as a rule, tend to be a little bit older. So senators are at an increased risk for calculations,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a doctor, told reporters Sunday. Still, Cassidy largely downplayed the risks at the Capitol, noting that Paul took the appropriate measures to immediately quarantine himself, and he pointed out that the Senate has far lower risk than health care facilities. “But, by the way, not as high risk as a nursing home. So we’ve got to be concerned about everybody right now,” he said. “We have to put this in perspective.” Jake Sherman contributed to this report.",Sen.

"Negotiations on massive $1.6 trillion-plus emergency economic package to deal with the coronavirus crisis stalled on Sunday, with Senate Democrats objecting to the bill before a key procedural vote.  Democrats emerged from a closed-door lunch saying the emergency package had serious shortfalls and provided a ""slush fund"" to large corporations.  The opposition from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) presents a major hurdle before a bill is finalized. Pelosi told reporters that she plans to move forward with her own emergency package in the House. Republicans and the White House insist that a deal has to be reached by Monday.  ""It does not appear that there is going to be enough votes to proceed right now,"" said moderate Democrat Doug Jones (Ala.) ""It would be better for Sen. McConnell to just delay, let folks continue, because if we can get a deal done we get it to the floor and get it passed quickly."" Schumer, coming out of the GOP lunch, said there are ""serious issues"" with the GOP package. ""We hope we can get them resolved quickly. Various groups of people from both sides are meeting as we speak,” he said.  Among the issues for Democrats, according to a senior Democratic aide, is $500 billion for corporations, stock buyback language that can be waived by the Treasury Secretary, limits on executive compensation only lasting two years and no provisions to protect individuals for eviction. In addition, Democrats are objecting to a lack of money for state and local governments and a provision of only three months for unemployment insurance. In a sign that negotiations are not over, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a key procedural vote for 6 p.m. on Sunday. McConnell postponed the vote after Schumer requested more time, he said. Earlier on Sunday, the GOP Leader said that congressional leaders and the White House are ""very close"" to agreement on the massive economic package. Senate GOP leaders circulated text of a nearly 580-page bill to senators' offices and K Street before the vote.  But hours before the procedural vote, an irate McConnell took on a tougher tone and urged his Democratic colleagues to support the measure.   ""It's just about time to take yes for an answer,"" McConnell said. ""We are at the point where both sides have come a long way toward each other and each side has to decide whether to continue elbowing and arguing over the last several inches and risk the whole thing or whether to shake hands and get it done.""  McConnell met for nearly an hour with Schumer, Pelosi, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). ""We have integrated a number of ideas the Democrats had over the last 48 hours in these working groups that you're familiar with. Now we're at a point in the discussions where people will say yes or no, and I'm confident given the desire to see an outcome, that we'll get to yes,” McConnell said earlier. Pelosi indicated Sunday that House Democrats didn't support the Senate bill and will forge ahead with their own proposal. “We’ll be introducing our own bill and hopefully it will be compatible,"" Pelosi said after leaving McConnell's office. ""I can tell you what happened -- we're continuing to talk,"" Schumer said. The New York Democrat wouldn't say whether he'd advise Senate Democrats to vote against cloture, which would totally disrupt McConnell's timetable for passing the stimulus package. Such a vote could be politically risky for Senate Democrats as the party seeks to win the Senate back. McConnell and President Donald Trump could then hit them for obstruction in the face of a unprecedented public health emergency and economic slowdown. But Pelosi's announcement means that she is not considering just taking up the Senate bill and passing it through the House on unanimous consent basis. That also means the House may be forced back into session, even though many lawmakers are concerned about the threat from the coronavirus and the difficulties in reaching Capitol Hill from their home districts. Schumer and Pelosi have stayed in close touch with Mnuchin throughout the negotiations. Pelosi flew back to Washington on Saturday.  Late Saturday evening, McConnell instructed chairmen of key committees to draft language that senators could review before a floor vote Sunday that would advance the legislation, in an effort to meet a Monday deadline for passage. Democrats insist there’s no final deal.  While outstanding issues remain, Democrats are expected to see a win with $250 billion allocated to unemployment insurance — one of the major sticking points in the negotiations. In addition, billions are expected to go to hospitals to address the influx of patients due to the pandemic. Schumer has called for a “Marshall Plan” for hospitals. In addition, Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) reached an agreement in principle Saturday evening with Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), on the package’s small business provisions. The final deal on small businesses would amount to $350 billion, covering 58 million American workers and more than 30 million small businesses, Rubio tweeted Saturday. Democrats have also pushed for expanded paid leave provisions. But Republicans are showing little interest, with GOP aides noting the House-passed second aid package already included provisions to expand paid sick leave. Republicans are also pushing for $250 billion in direct cash payments to workers. Under the original GOP proposal, individuals and families would receive $1,200 and $2,400 in direct cash payments, depending on their income level. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) have raised concerns that the original language of the provision penalizes lower-income Americans who do have a taxable income. But Republican aides say the issue will be resolved in the final text.

"ELY, Minn. — At the edge of a vast wilderness ringed by lakes and woods, a surprise discovery provided a rare jolt of optimism for a struggling mining town now known mainly as a prime destination for canoers: Massive deposits of nickel and copper — minerals that power cars and smartphones — lie under the earth. Many jubilant residents of Ely and nearby towns are now hanging their hopes on a plan to build a massive mining facility under a patch of national forest that’s a stone’s throw from one of the most verdant watersheds in the world. But the project increases the risk of acidic waste contaminating the area’s lakes and streams. Environmental groups mounted a well-funded push against the project. Democratic presidential contenders began objecting, too: Bernie Sanders, Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren pledged to stop the project. Joe Biden has yet to take a position.  And that’s forced people in Ely and Minnesota’s Iron Range region to think again about who are its protectors and defenders. A place that once gave Democratic native sons Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale 4-1 voting wins and considers the late Sen. Paul Wellstone a local hero has begun to embrace a president who bears little resemblance to them, except that he reversed the “injustice” of an Obama-era order that would have brought the nickel-copper project to a 20-year standstill. On top of that were the 25 percent tariffs Trump imposed on most foreign steel, which provided an initial boost to the 5,000 miners still employed in the region’s numerous iron-ore mines that have served as the backbone to the region’s economy. All of that put Ely in the middle of a political transformation that makes Minnesota the president’s top target among states he lost in 2016 — and potentially a pivot point in the 2020 presidential race. Trump lost the state by 45,000 votes in 2016, a remarkable feat considering how entrenched Democrats have been in the state. “The Iron Range is back in business,” Trump declared in a speech in Minneapolis in October. The area's growing affinity toward Trump provides a case study in how the president has brought the blue-collar vote to heel with a mix of culture and economic promise. But not everyone is willing to cede the town and region to the Republicans. Even some who like Trump’s mining policies chafe at his harsh rhetoric. Still others express concern about the threat to local waterways and wilderness. But all agree that the economic changes looming over the area created a mixed-up political stew in which Trumpism floated most easily to the top. “The hope rested with Trump; that’s where the people went … it’s hope. People want hope for a better future,” said Ely Mayor Chuck Novak, a self-described Humphrey Democrat who has thrown his support behind the president winning a second term. He is an ardent supporter of the new mining project. “This is the old method of politics,” he added. “You take care of your economy and your people.” *** Fifty miles west along the Iron Range, in the mining towns where empty storefronts outnumber the bars, banks and pizza joints, labor unions are grappling with a new political reality.  Every time Chris Johnson gathers his United Steelworkers Local 2705 at the hall in Chisholm, the union of roughly 600 mine workers that pull iron ore out of the Hibbing Taconite mine have one question: Why isn’t their leadership going all-in on Trump? It’s a question Johnson, once a mine worker himself and now the union president, struggles to answer to his rank and file. He strongly supports nickel-copper mining but can’t overcome decades of Democratic support that led him to embrace Wellstone, Amy Klobuchar, Al Franken and other liberal heroes. Trump’s “not pro-labor and that’s the only message we really have for them,” he said. “He basically stole the union’s message and is using that, but to his core, he doesn’t believe any of the stuff we do, but he knows he’s getting votes for it.” Johnson estimates that about 75 percent of his membership supports Trump.  Trump’s appeal to the “forgotten people” has resonated with a population that has seen the iron-ore mining industry go through decades of boom-bust cycles that have led to mass layoffs, a declining population and a growing sense of survivalism. In the late 1970s, the industry employed 15,000 people. That’s down to roughly 5,000. The area never recovered those mining jobs after mass layoffs in 1981 as the U.S. steel industry underwent changes and automation took hold. The environmental priorities of Democrats at the national and state levels are shifting support in places like the Iron Range, where even pro-labor members feel increasingly alienated by a platform more suited to a political party that is rapidly becoming more urbanized. Johnson recounted a meeting last year in Washington with Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minneapolis. He said the lawmaker told him the way of life in the Iron Range is going to change. “We’re a vital part of all products made in this country and abroad and for her to just sit there and say, ‘Look you guys are going to have to learn a different industry,’ doesn’t go over well,” he said. “I’ve voted Democrat my whole life. It’s getting tougher,” said Steve Bonach, president of United Steelworkers Local 1938, the union for the roughly 1,200 workers at the area’s largest mine. He said he’s leaning toward supporting Bernie Sanders. “I wish I could put my hand on the transformation going on around here,” he said from his union hall in the city of Virginia, a building wrapped in a mural of military men and women in uniform. St. Louis County, which includes Ely, lost 20,000 people between 1980 and 1990. The county, which also encompasses the lake port city of Duluth, has not really seen its population rebound since that time. David Bednarczak, a county employee who was laid off from a mining job in 1981, said he can’t vote for Trump because of his views on immigrants and women, but recognizes that the pull of the Democratic Party is waning in the area. He was the sole person from his voting precinct in Hibbing to show up to a late-February caucus night for Democrats, known in Minnesota as the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. A paltry crowd of 35 people representing 10 precincts in a city of 16,000 showed up to the event. “We lost our future, we lost our enthusiasm for living. We lost that vibrant group of young people that participated in the economy,” said Bednarczak, who was supporting Sanders. “We’ve never really recovered, not in population and not in economy.” While the Iron Range declined, the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul prospered, leaving some to think the Democratic Party could soon cut its losses here.  The challenge of maintaining Democratic support of rural and small-town voters that value gun rights and resource-intensive industries has grown even more difficult. That’s even harder in an area where miners can make anywhere between $80,000 to $100,000 per year. The industry claims each direct mining jobs supports at least two more indirect jobs. Before the coronavirus crisis hit, mine workers in the area had enjoyed some clear benefits from economic growth in the Trump era. Overall employment in St. Louis County grew by only 0.7 percent from the third quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2019 (the most recent data available), compared to 4.2 percent growth in natural resources and mining employment in the county. But wages in natural resources and mining increased a robust 31 percent in the county, compared with 5 percent wage growth across all of Minnesota.  “When you get some of the radicals in the state Democratic Party trying to push the environmental agenda a little too far, that’s when people are going to push back,” said Jon LaMusga, a salaried mine worker who supported Trump in the last election. He called Bill Clinton a good president and lauded Wellstone as a “a great human being” but said people are just tired of establishment politicians. “I think most people voted for Trump definitely not because he was going to be an angel in office and not because they thought he was going to be a savior,” he said, sipping a beer after a curling match at the Hibbing Curling Club. “I think most people voted for Trump up here because they were pretty fed up with the political establishment on both sides.” *** Talk of economic diversification in the Iron Range is usually met with a shake of the head and shrug of shoulders. No one’s betting on the area becoming a tech hub or even a center for nonmining manufacturing. Even local leaders concede that pulling minerals out of the land is what people do here. Iron ore was discovered in the area in the mid-1800s. Immigrants from Eastern Europe, the Balkans and Scandinavia came to the region in waves to work in the growing mines. Eventually, the soft, high-grade ore found near the surface was exhausted and miners began blasting deeper and deeper to extract taconite, a lower-grade ore that is turned into pellets and carried by trains to ports on Lake Superior where it is shipped to steelmaking plants in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. But the industry is continuing to change. Some of the open pit mines where the ore is extracted are beginning to see deposits run thin. The steel industry is also evolving as companies invest in new methods to make the metal, shifting from blast furnaces that rely on the area’s taconite ore to newer electric arc furnaces that primarily melt scrap to make new steel.  U. S. Steel announced late last year that it will shutter its Great Lakes Works blast furnace operation near Detroit, laying off more than 1,500 workers. U.S. Steel operates the largest mining operation in the Iron Range. The uncertain fate of the iron-ore industry is fueling the debate over nickel-copper mining that permeates conversations along the entire range.  Twin Metals Minnesota, a subsidiary of Chilean mining giant Antofagasta, is proposing mining an area of Superior National Forest for nickel, copper and potentially other minerals. “That’s how you diversify the economy here. It’s going to be mineral-based,” said Bob Vlaisavljevich, mayor of nearby Eveleth. “If copper is down, you’ve got three other minerals. That’s where you get those dips, not the peaks and valleys where people are losing their homes, moving away. As far as diversification, that’s how it’s going to be.”  Twin Metals said the 100-acre site won’t pose the environmental risk that people fear. The company insists its method of processing the mine waste won’t jeopardize the surrounding lakes and waterway. Proponents point to an underground nickel-copper mine in operation on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula as a model for the industry in northern Minnesota. Environmentalists insist otherwise. They say the nickel-copper mining process, no matter how technologically advanced, will risk leaching sulfuric acid, heavy metals and sulfates into the surrounding watershed. A statewide poll released last month showed that a majority of Minnesotans opposed the project near Ely. “Our communities have built our way of life around the wilderness. This poll makes clear that the majority of Minnesotans stand with us in protecting our nation’s greatest canoe country wilderness,” said Becky Rom, national chairwoman of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters. Nonetheless, the Twin Metals project, still in the planning and permitting phase, is estimated to directly employ 700 people and create 1,400 spinoff jobs for the area. And it isn’t the only nickel-copper project in the area. A mining company called PolyMet has gotten all of its permits for a similar mine in nearby Hoyt Lakes, but the project is tied up in complex litigation. Trump’s steel tariffs and protective trade policies have left a region long dependent on mining here wanting even more. The president imposed a 25 percent tariff on most imported steel in 2018, but most people don’t highlight the policy as the saving grace Trump touts it to be. While steel prices initially shot up, they’ve settled back down as the U.S. steel industry continues to undergo a somewhat painful transformation. “There’s sure no boom up here,” Gary Skalko said. After nine terms as mayor of the town of Mountain Iron the self-described “hippie” and former school teacher is standing down. He’s a strong supporter of the mining industry, but he senses a change in culture. “I’m a pro-choice guy. I’m still worried about losing my First Amendment rights, not my Second Amendment rights. I felt [Trump] should have been convicted for what he did,” he said. “Why would I represent people who don’t have the same values? There’s so much hatred on both sides.” Preserving “our way of life” has become a rallying cry in the region. Rep. Pete Stauber, a former Duluth police officer who once played professional hockey, flipped the state's 8th Congressional District to red in 2018. He used the phrase in his campaign. Stauber is “not running a political campaign, he’s running a cultural campaign, and it’s invincible as far as I’m concerned,” said Aaron Brown, a fifth generation Iron Ranger who teaches at Hibbing Community College and writes commentary on local issues.  It all comes down to a cultural balance that remains undecided and “almost a sense of inferiority that comes from an up and down economy,” he said. “Presidents have come and gone. Clinton and Bush and Obama and now Trump,” said Brown. “Very different policies but this place hasn’t changed that much, and I think there’s something about the hollowing out of the industrialization of this area that we feel that we no longer have any control over our self-destiny and I think that just feeds into our politics.” * * * The same downturns in open pit mining and the U.S. steel industry that are fueling the support for nickel and copper mining have provoked skepticism in some other Iron Range residents — those who have started to think about the area’s natural beauty as a resource that can be monetized. And natural beauty, unlike mineral deposits, never gets tapped out. Sue Schurke looks at the economy differently than most of her neighbors. Her house overlooks a lake that sits downstream from the proposed Twin Metals nickel and copper mine. Schurke and her husband, Paul, have benefited from the natural richness of the area. She employs nine people that design and manufacture outerwear. The couple has also operated a dogsled lodge since the 1980s where they own a pack of 60 friendly but hyperactive Inuit sled dogs brought in from northern Canada.  “Ely is not a dying town,” she said, countering the argument that the tourism economy can’t sustain the town. “I have a manufacturing business and there’s room for lots of good businesses in this town that are sustainable.” Ely sits at the gateway of the million-acre Boundary Waters Canoe Area, a wilderness of lakes and forest that stretches to the Canadian border. The last iron-ore operation in the town, the underground Pioneer Mine, closed in 1967. In following decades, the population has become a hybrid of people who still work at mines in nearby towns and those who have migrated to the area to take advantage of the outdoor recreation economy. Paul Schurke said pro-mining advocates in town are being “hoodwinked.” “If they score the permits, they'll sit on them until the market improves and until expensive mining manpower has been replaced by robotics,” he said. “I empathize with the locals clamoring for high-paying mining jobs, but it's sad to see them being exploited by foreign plutocrats and Trump's populist movement.” In an ironic twist, the Schurkes were invited to the White House in 2018 for the administration’s annual “Made in America” product showcase, where Sue Schurke's colorful parkas and jackets caught the eye of Melania Trump. Sue Schurke said she has nothing against the iron ore industry that has been here for more than 100 years. Many of her employees come from mining families that support the nickel-copper project. But she fears the impact the new mine might have on her family’s businesses and the environment. “I just feel like Trump came along and just basically opened the door for people,” she said. “Mining is their history … they went with Trump because he was opening the door for it.” Taylor Miller Thomas contributed to this report.",Minnesota on the edge: ‘I’ve voted Democrat my whole life.

"How do you send money en masse to people in the midst of a pandemic? In a world roughly remade by virus every few days, the federal government’s desperate attempt to shore up a plummeting economy changes shape by the hour. But one partial solution has surged to the fore: sending money directly to Americans. There’s precedent for the idea: The U.S. sent money out to most households during the 2001 and 2008 recessions. But as the government tries to move at warp speed this time around, plenty of question marks remain about the tradeoffs between rapidity and accuracy. Every day it takes to pass the bill matters. And no one really knows what new wrinkles the coronavirus might add. A Treasury Department spokesman declined to comment for this article, and negotiations are still in flux. But here’s how former officials and experts expect the process to work — and how you might end up with thousands more dollars in your bank account within weeks. In the Republicans’ current bill text, the IRS would take the lead, tapping a master file of this year’s and last year’s tax filers’ personal and bank information. Unlike in 2008, most people now get their refunds via electronic direct deposit, so sending them money is simple. Once the IRS sends its file to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the payments can move fast, said Dick Gregg, a former fiscal assistant Treasury secretary and head of what’s now the Fiscal Service. But there are a few wrinkles to iron out. “All of this is nifty,” said former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, “but you don’t get the people who don’t file.” Coordinating across agencies, the government can also access information for people who haven’t filed taxes but already receive payments in the form of Social Security or Veterans Affairs benefits. A trickier task is reaching the portion of Americans who neither make enough money to file taxes nor receive those other benefits — “the new working class,” as Chuck Marr, senior director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, put it. A single dishwasher without kids, a home health aide: Not only are these people among the most vulnerable to the current economic shock, they’re also easier to miss. Electronic benefits transfer cards for people who receive food stamps and other cash assistance are one way to find them. That could require coordination with state governments to deliver the payments, said Jack Smalligan, a senior policy fellow at the Urban Institute who spent nearly three decades at the Office of Management and Budget. But too much delay in figuring out who should get a check could hold up the entire process. “Speed is of the essence at this time,” argued Michael Graetz, a law professor at Columbia and Treasury official in the George H.W. Bush administration. “And then if there are gaps or people didn’t get it, there should be a number to call that allows you to say that you didn’t get it.” Starting payments by April 6, as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin originally proposed, would be much faster than in 2008, when the IRS took two months to send out the first checks. That’s assuming, of course, that the president signs the bill this week. And how the coronavirus will affect the process remains to be seen. At the IRS, where budget and staff cuts have shrunk the agency over several years, social distancing measures for employees could slow things down more. The agency announced Friday it was closing Taxpayer Assistance Centers until further notice, which could impede elderly and low-income people’s ability to file taxes quickly. If Americans are stuck at home, those who receive physical checks may be less likely to cash them. That’s one reason sending prepaid debit cards might be a better alternative, said David Kamin, an NYU law professor and Obama OMB official. Many outstanding questions remain about Congress’ bill and the administration’s implementation of it. How will the IRS manage the payments while also handling a filing season that just got extended three months? Will the payments happen in both April and May, as Treasury proposed? Or just once, in April, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s package envisions? Will they be tiered based on income (one of the most politically contentious elements), or universal? And in the face of new opposition last week from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and other Republicans, will they even happen at all? McConnell’s proposal currently lays out up to $1,200 in “recovery rebates” for Americans who make up to $75,000 a year, double that for couples and extra for families with children. Payments would phase out for those with higher incomes and cut off at those who make $99,000 annually. But Democrats are now working on their own proposal, creating more uncertainty about how the final bill text will shake out. Democratic and Republican leaders have mostly favored a tiered approach, though there was disagreement over whether low-income people who have paid less in taxes should receive less. But experts who favor the payments said a universal approach may be best to get the money out quickly. “The issue is not so much how to stimulate employment but rather how to help people over a period where lower-than-normal employment is the right course” due to social distancing, said Greg Mankiw, a Harvard professor who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. “Targeting means it’s probably going to delay things.” Hong Kong last month announced it would give each of its roughly 7 million adult permanent residents the equivalent of $1,280. Mattie Duppler, a senior fellow at the National Taxpayers Union, suggested that the government could send payments universally now — to maximize speed — and then means-test them later, clawing back the money from some people on next year’s tax returns. Some experts warned, though, that Congress should think through unintended consequences. Extra cash could push some people over a benefits cliff, for example, meaning the one- or two-time infusion would suddenly push their incomes just high enough to lose crucial government supports. That could be avoided through a provision in the stimulus bill, said Amy Castro Baker, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy and Practice who saw that dynamic play out when she oversaw a pilot program in Stockton, Calif. “Preserving that benefit structure while we’re in this policy gray space is really important,” she said. One thing’s clear: Between the velocity Congress is trying to reach and the uncertainty of the coronavirus, some of the process will have to be worked out on the fly.  “When we think about cash transfer work that has happened since [2008], we’ve done it many different ways,” said Stacia Martin-West, an assistant professor in the University of Tennessee’s College of Social Work who co-led the Stockton experiment. But with the pandemic ongoing, “we are kind of in the Wild, Wild West.” Brian Faler contributed to this report.",Congress wants to send Americans money.

"Sen. Rand Paul on Sunday announced he has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, becoming the first senator and third member of Congress known to have contracted the virus. The Kentucky Republican — who has been working from the Capitol in recent days — said he was tested out of caution “due to his extensive travel and events"" and is not showing symptoms of the highly infectious virus. Later, his staff said that Paul had attended an event where two people tested positive, though the senator did not recall specific interactions with either of them. Paul’s infection quickly reverberated throughout the Senate, where lawmakers were surprised by his diagnosis as they pushed ahead with a massive package to rescue the economy from the outbreak. The Kentucky senator had been interacting with his colleagues just days prior, voting on the floor, sitting in meetings and speaking to reporters in hallways.  At least one other senator, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), is self-quarantining after close interactions with Paul. Lee's office said Sunday that the Capitol's attending physician directed him to stay isolated for 14 days. That means Lee, along with Paul, cannot vote on any legislation on the floor this week, leaving Senate Republicans short two more votes as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell attempts to keep his conference together on the economic rescue bill.  Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.) is also self-quarantining in Washington after potential exposure earlier this month. But the news of Paul’s infection does not appear to have changed the calculation for Senate GOP leaders, whose members remain in Washington for a rare weekend session — at least until the stimulus package is complete. “I don’t believe it changes our posture,” Senate Rules Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told reporters on Sunday when asked whether the Senate would change its operations. “I think individual members will know if they’ve had much contact with him in the last week or not.” “The crisis that we’re facing requires that we be here,” added Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho.) “I can’t say that Congress should quit operating. The people of America need Congress to be working on this crisis response.” Several senators, including Susan Collins (R-Maine), however, said the chamber should take an extended leave from the Capitol after clearing the latest relief package. “I believe that our first obligation is to finish our work. After that, I think it would be wise to accelerate the break that was scheduled for April,” Collins told reporters. Paul expects to return to the Senate after isolating himself, an aide to the senator said. The staffer added that Paul’s office in Washington has been working remotely for 10 days, so “virtually no staff” has had physical contact with him. Health officials have said the virus is spread largely among people who are showing symptoms of the disease. But people who have the disease who aren’t symptomatic — like Paul — can still pass it to others.  Privately, some senators have become very concerned over Paul's diagnosis. Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran said in a GOP lunch Sunday that Paul was at the gym this morning, swimming in the pool. Paul is one of a small group of lawmakers to have tested positive for the disease, in addition to Reps. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.). Both members developed symptoms last weekend, after being in the Capitol as recently as last Saturday morning. Many lawmakers on Capitol Hill fear the virus will spread within their ranks, as the Senate remains in the building to draft and pass much-needed economic recovery legislation. The House, whose members have been working from their districts for the past week, is expected to return sometime this week to vote on the Senate’s “Phase 3” package.  Many members of the House are privately worried about returning to Washington, not just because it would require hundreds of people to get on airplanes but because it could expose them to the virus in the sprawling Capitol complex. Several anxious lawmakers of both parties have called for the House to consider voting remotely, though it would be one of the biggest procedural changes to Congress in history. The virus has likely been inside the Capitol for weeks: Several staffers in the House and Senate have tested positive, in addition to the three members. And many more lawmakers and staffers have been told by the House physician’s office of possible exposure at the Capitol, with each of those individuals asked to self-quarantine in their homes. Many parts of the Capitol have ceased regular operations: Offices are largely teleworking, visitor access is restricted, and tours are canceled.  Still, there are hundreds of people in the building each day, including Capitol police, food preparation workers and cleaning staff — not including the 100 senators, dozens of staff and reporters. And there is no universal screening for people entering the building. The concerns of infection are heightened in the Senate, where the average age of a senator is nearly 63.  “Senators, as a rule, tend to be a little bit older. So senators are at an increased risk for calculations,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a doctor, told reporters Sunday. Still, Cassidy largely downplayed the risks at the Capitol, noting that Paul took the appropriate measures to immediately quarantine himself, and he pointed out that the Senate has far lower risk than health care facilities. “But, by the way, not as high risk as a nursing home. So we’ve got to be concerned about everybody right now,” he said. “We have to put this in perspective.” Jake Sherman and Marianne Levine contributed to this report.",Sen.

"President Donald Trump’s former economic chief said Sunday that Congress should require businesses to pay independent contractors out of work during the coronavirus crisis.  “Think of people that work at stadiums and arenas. Think of people that work in catering businesses. Think of Uber drivers and Lyft drivers. They need to get compensated as well,” Gary Cohn, Trump’s former chief economic adviser, said on CBS' “Face the Nation.”  Democrats are expected to secure $250 billion for unemployment insurance in a deal with the Trump administration. But that would not help workers classified as independent contractors, who are ineligible for unemployment benefits.  Cohn said the legislation should require businesses that hired contractors and part-time workers to “go back and look at what you were paying them for the last month, or the last two weeks, and you go back and pay them that exact amount of money.“","Congress should bail out gig workers, Cohn says",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/congress-gig-economy-workers-cohn-141886,politico
"Governors, mayors and front-line health care workers confronting rising numbers of critically ill coronavirus patients said Sunday they have not received meaningful amounts of federal aid, including the shipments of desperately needed masks and other emergency equipment that administration officials say they have already dispatched. As the crisis spreads, the Senate was moving forward with a rare Sunday procedural vote despite a breakdown in negotiations between Democrats and Republicans on a third coronavirus aid package. Among the points of contention: funding for hospitals and conditions on the billions of dollars that would flow to impacted corporations. The Senate wants to pass the bill containing both broad economic stimulus measures and direct help for American families as early as Monday. Meanwhile, the pressure on hospitals in hard-hit areas is mounting, and several Democratic governors are demanding a more coordinated national response to get supplies as fast as possible to where they are needed most critically. But President Donald Trump hit back at the governors' televised pleas, tweeting Sunday that they ""shouldn't be blaming the Federal Goverment for their own shortcomings."" He told the governors the federal government's role is to be there ""to back you up should you fail, and always will be!"" “We are desperate,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told ABC Sunday morning. “We've had a big ask into the strategic stockpile in the White House. They've given us a fraction of our ask.” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer echoed that urgency, saying her state’s hospitals are dealing with about 800 confirmed cases of the virus — up from only one just 12 days ago — and are struggling with serious shortages of both test kits and protective equipment for medical workers. The shortages have forced hospitals to adopt risky practices like reusing masks and having staff wear bandanas when no mask is available. A lack of personal protective equipment puts medical personnel at greater risk of becoming infected or placed in quarantine, exacerbating hospitals' existing staff shortages. “We’ve got to have those masks,” Whitmer said. “Had the federal government really started focusing when it became clear that the whole world was going to be confronting this, we would be in a stronger position right now ... Lives will be lost because we weren’t prepared.” The nation's main hospital association is also reporting ongoing gaps in the supply line, despite the mobilization of some federal aid from the Strategic National Stockpile, donations from other industries and other sources. ""There is a supply. Many people have them, but there's a gap and we're going to need more,"" Richard Pollack, the CEO of the American Hospital Association, told CBS. ""If we don't protect our health care workers, the system will completely collapse."" Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor, whose agency was not activated to run the pandemic response until Friday, painted a more optimistic picture in Sunday morning appearances on ABC and CNN. He said masks and other equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile are well on their way to states — particularly hard-hit areas like Washington, California and New York. “They have been distributed. They've been distributed over the past couple of weeks. They're shipping today. They'll ship tomorrow,” Gaynor told ABC. “We are shipping from our national stockpile, we're shipping from vendors, we're shipping from donations. It is happening.” Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, offered similar assurances on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""The resources that are being marshaled are going to be clearly directed to those hot spots that need it most,"" he said. ""So not only is New York trying to get resources themselves, but we're going to be pouring it in from the federal government. So it would be a combination of local and federal. But it's very, very clear that they are a very high priority."" But Gaynor and other administration officials sidestepped repeated questions on exactly how many masks were being shipped and when they would be in the hands of doctors and nurses who need them. “I can't give you a rough number,” he said in another interview on CNN, adding that governors should not depend on federal disbursements and should try on their own to obtain masks and other equipment. “If you find it on the market, go ahead and buy it. FEMA will reimburse you for it,” he said. “This is a shared responsibility.” Several governors pushed back, warning that pitting states against one another, the federal government, and other countries in a bidding war on the private market is no way to respond to a pandemic that requires a coordinated national response to obtain and allocate emergency goods. “It’s a wide, Wild West…out there,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said of his attempts to obtain supplies. “And indeed we’re overpaying, I would say, for [personal protective equipment] because of that competition.” ""We need the federal government to get us those test kits,” Whitmer agreed. “We need PPEs. And frankly a patchwork strategy of each state doing what they can is — we’re going to do it if we have to, but it would be nice to have a national strategy.” Governors, congressional lawmakers and mayors continued to plead with the White House over the weekend to use the powers of the Defense Production Act to speed up manufacture of masks, ventilators and other scarce supplies as many hospitals say they’re set to run out within days. Trump also tweeted Sunday morning that he has given a handful of car companies ""the go ahead"" to make ventilators and other unnamed ""metal products"" for hospitals, but gave no indication of a timeline or quantity. Converting factories from making cars to making medical equipment cannot happen immediately, and could take several months. In the meantime, hospitals need immediate help. “We've gotten no indication of any factory on 24/7 shifts. We've gotten no shipments,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on NBC. “I can’t be blunt enough: If the president does not act, people will die who could have lived otherwise.” De Blasio also called on the president to mobilize the military's health care workers to immediately deploy to coronavirus hot spots like his own city. ""All military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep, like New York, right now,"" he said. ""Why are they at their bases? Why are they not being allowed to serve? I guarantee you they're ready to serve. But the president has to give the order."" Though Trump signed the defense act last week, Gaynor confirmed that the administration has yet to use it to order any companies to manufacture more products. He suggested such a step wasn’t necessary as companies are already stepping up. “We haven't had to use it, because companies around the country, donations, they are saying, ‘What can we do to help you?’ And it's happening without using that — that lever,” he said. “If it comes to a point where we have to pull the level, we will.” Both in private calls with the White House and in public interviews, lawmakers are insisting that time is now. “We cannot wait until people start really dying in large numbers to start production, especially of more complicated equipment like ventilators and hospital beds,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told CNN. “We need to start this production right now to get ready for the surge that is coming in two to three weeks.”","Desperate, angry state leaders push back on Trump admin claims of mass mask shipments",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/state-leaders-trump-administration-mask-shipments-141884,politico
"States are competing against one another for medical supplies and, in many cases, overpaying amid a federal shortage, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Sunday.  “We’re competing against each other, we’re competing against other countries,“ Pritzker said on CNN's “State of the Union.” “It‘s a wide Wild West … out there. And, indeed, we’re overpaying, I would say, for [personal protective equipment] because of that competition.“ Pritzker said he’s gotten a fraction of the masks, gloves and gowns requested from the federal government. As a result, Pritzker said he’s deployed staff to purchase supplies on the open market internationally.  “I’ve got people on the phones, working the phones across the world, frankly, to get this stuff shipped to Illinois,” Pritzker said.  Pritzker also discussed his decision to move to a stay-at-home order for Illinois residents. “We have moved on now to a stay-at-home order,“ he said. “These should have been done nationally. They haven't been. But I have got to protect the 12.7 million people that live in my state. And I'm dedicated to that. It's their health and safety that matters most to me. It will work. It will work.“ The president later complained about Pritzker’s complaints. He tweeted: “@JBPritzker, Governor of Illinois, and a very small group of certain other Governors, together with Fake News @CNN & Concast (MSDNC), shouldn’t be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings. We are there to back you up should you fail, and always will be!“","It’s a ‘Wild West’ for medical supplies in states, Pritzker says",2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/wild-west-states-pritzker-says-141580,politico
"Before the three weeks that miraculously brought Joe Biden to the cusp of the Democratic presidential nomination, his campaign was limping along — and Biden knows it. “The press kept saying Biden has no money, and they were right,” the former vice president said during Sunday’s Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders. “Biden had no money.” And campaign finance disclosures filed late Friday highlight how Biden has nearly captured the Democratic nomination on momentum and message instead of organizational prowess — and the work his operation has to do to build up for a grueling general election campaign against President Donald Trump. Biden, who brought in $18.1 million in February, was outraised by four other Democratic presidential contenders that month: Bernie Sanders ($47.7 million), Elizabeth Warren ($29.5 million), Amy Klobuchar ($18.7 million) and Pete Buttigieg ($18.6 million). While Biden’s fundraising took off in March as he started stacking up primary wins, his campaign operation lagged well behind others’. Sanders had 1,215 people on the payroll in February, according to his campaign finance report, while Warren paid salaries to 1,203 staffers. Buttigieg had more than 550 people on his campaign at that point.  Meanwhile, Biden’s payroll stood at 477, as his lower fundraising totals throughout 2019 and early 2020 meant his campaign had to keep costs low. Sanders outspent Biden $46 million to $13 million in February — and still finished the month with more cash in the bank, $18.7 million to $12.1 million. “As is typical, [Biden has] got to pull in talent from other campaigns and across the party to run a general election, and he’s got to move quickly,” said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who served as deputy campaign manager for Barack Obama in 2012. “He just needs more of everything.” Lying in wait is Trump’s reelection campaign, which has been preparing for the general election for years and already has more than $94 million socked away in its bank account. The Republican National Committee has also built a big financial advantage over the Democratic National Committee that even a big windfall from billionaire Mike Bloomberg can’t erase. The DNC ended February with $14.1 million on hand, compared to $76.8 million for the RNC. Biden’s retooling process is already underway, with another former Obama hand, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, taking over as Biden’s campaign manager last week. But the coronavirus pandemic and the sudden onset of social distancing and work from home may impair the Biden campaign’s buildup. “The lack of infrastructure in the states was a reflection of the limited resources available at that time, and now, that will all change,” said Tom McMahon, a former DNC executive director.  “They may be playing catch up, but in light of how campaigning will take place going forward, they aren’t necessarily at a disadvantage,” McMahon continued. “The real challenge they’re going to have to face going forward is putting together a comprehensive campaign remotely.”  Biden will have the cash to try: He revealed during last Sunday’s debate that he had raised $33 million in the first half of March, and that was before he swept the primaries on March 17 and padded his delegate lead over Sanders. Even before the former vice president started raising such large amounts of money, Biden’s other strengths were more important than the power of an organization during the primary, said Matt Paul, a former aide both to Hillary Clinton and to Tom Vilsack, former Agriculture secretary and onetime governor of Iowa.  “But it’s a different game now,” Paul continued, “and they know that. This break in the campaign is bizarre, but it’s an opportunity to think very carefully and plan very carefully about how to marshal their resources.”",'He just needs more of everything': Biden campaign faces retool after primary surge,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/joe-biden-fec-fundraising-140262,politico
"DALLAS—Thousands of people streamed through the church lobby and into the pews. Ushers at First Baptist Dallas invited members to the front rows, gesturing to the prime seats still available. Trumpets blared, bright blue and purple lights illuminated the stage, and behind the orchestra pit the 100 or so members of choir—ranging from late teens to late 60s—stood inches apart, ready to sing for the next 30 minutes. When Robert Jeffress, the senior pastor, walked onto the stage, wearing a dark suit and shiny teal tie, he thanked the musicians.  “Isn’t it great to see so many of them here today?” he asked the audience. Jeffress’ sermon that morning, presented in his usual stoic-but-chipper demeanor, was titled “The Road to Armageddon,” and focused largely on biblical stories of God’s punishments. “God’s judgment is not always immediate,” he told his congregation, and the tens of thousands of people watching online. “But it’s always inevitable.” Aside from a few empty pews in the back of the sanctuary, this seemed like any other Sunday. Except it wasn’t. This was Sunday, March 15. Most of the country was already being reminded to stay at home, to practice social distancing, to flatten the curve of the coronavirus outbreak, which President Donald Trump, the man Jeffress supports at every turn, had just declared a national emergency. Every major sports league had suspended play. The city of Dallas had banned gathering over 500 people and canceled its beloved St. Patrick’s Day parade and party, scheduled for the same weekend. Most ministers, rabbis and imams in North Texas had decided it was safer to share the faith on camera rather than in person. But not Jeffress. On Twitter, the church’s announcement that it would hold live services—there were two that morning—received dozens of replies. Some messages thanked the church. But the vast majority said things like “blood will be on your hands” and “criminally negligent” and “this is foolishness.” Dr. Shelley Conroy, dean of the Louise Herrington School of Nursing at Baylor University—the same university Jeffress attended in the mid-1970s—tweeted: “We should not be putting our elderly members at risk by encouraging them to come to church right now. We should have complied with the intent of the public health orders to keep everyone socially distant for one week to control the spread of this virulent disease.”  Against all these criticisms, the doomsaying and alarming news on television screens and newspaper headlines, Jeffress remained resolute and unmoving. “How do we avoid what I call the pandemic panic?” he told a television station.  “We wanted to have as much normalcy as possible last morning,” he’d explain to me later. But, as we’ve all come to realize, normal could last only so long. Jeffress, 64, is no stranger to controversy. For the past five years, he has been Donald Trump’s most visible, most vocal Evangelical supporter. In addition to leading the 13,000-member megachurch in Dallas, one of the oldest in the country, Jeffress appears regularly on Fox News and Fox Business, excoriating the president’s critics while enthusiastically defending the administration’s policies on everything from child separation at the border to saber rattling on the Korean Peninsula. In the past, he has preached sermons with titles like “Gay Is Not Okay,” he’s called Islam “a false religion based on the teachings of a false prophet,” and he referred to Oprah Winfrey as “a tool of Satan.” (He isn’t afraid to let fly on Republicans, either. Last year, he called Mitt Romney a “self-righteous snake.”) Though he doesn’t mention politics from the pulpit all that often, American flag pins are fairly common in the pews. For more than a century, the church has combined a conservative brand of patriotism with a brimstone-scented piety. Not long after Trump’s inauguration, the First Baptist Dallas choir performed a hymn called “Make America Great Again”—written by the church’s former music director—at a ""Celebrate Freedom"" concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington. I’ve written about Jeffress several times over the past few years. I wanted to know what he was thinking when he decided First Baptist would buck the almost universal cultural retreat that public health officials were promoting. So I called him. Was this a play for publicity, I asked. Jeffress told me he wasn’t trying to court controversy. He said the church was careful not to defy the city’s crowd-size guidelines. Ushers limited the number of people in the main sanctuary to 500, then directed the overflow into other venues on the church’s six-block campus, where attendees could watch a live telecast of the services. Fire marshals were on-site to make sure the church was abiding by the new protocols.  “We have been committed from the very beginning to following the city regulations for meeting together,” Jeffress said. “Those regulations are changing quickly because the situation is changing quickly.” He said he was on a phone call with Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson and about 70 other faith leaders earlier last week, before the live service. “Some churches were staying open, some were closing,” he said. “But we were all committed to following the city's guidelines on this.” The city, in its explanation, used the example of a movie theater. “They said a movie theater complex has thousands of people that pass through it during the day, but no more than 500 are gathering in various venues at one time,” Jeffress explained. This was the church’s green light. (Movie theaters in Dallas have since been closed.) Jeffress told me the church also warned that anyone with symptoms and anybody over 60, with any underlying health issue “should really think seriously about not coming, and worshiping with us online.” He said there were a record 166,000 people watching livestreams of the services. I asked Jeffress if he was worried about an outbreak of the virus at his church—where the membership is disproportionately older. He thought about it for a moment. “We made the best decision we could make at that point in time,” he said. “This is a very real threat that we need to take seriously. But the Bible has a great balance between faith and practicality.”  He quoted St. Paul’s second letter to Timothy: “God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love and of a sound mind.” In other words, he said, “God doesn’t want us to be paralyzed with panic, but at the same time he expects us to exercise a sound mind in what we do.” At the end of last Sunday’s sermon, Jeffress told the congregation he was uncertain about what the church would do over the next week. He announced that they would cancel evening service and weekday gatherings. But whether to meet the following Sunday—this Sunday—was still being evaluated. Early this week, the city of Dallas closed down bars and restaurants, except for to-go orders, and told theaters to close. On Monday, Trump suggested keeping gatherings to 10 people or fewer. Soon the virus was detected in all 50 states, and the number of positive tests and deaths looked like they were mirroring the early growth in Italy, where they’re now seeing more than 600 coronavirus deaths a day.  All of these factors played a role in the church’s deliberations. By the time I talked to Jeffress on Thursday, he said he had made its decision for Sunday.  “This will be the first time in the 152-year history of First Baptist Church of Dallas that we will not meet,” he told me.  Sunday, he will stand on stage alone in the sanctuary, with a minimal camera and light crew. He’ll preach to an audience he cannot see and cannot hear. If people are moved by what he says, he won’t know it, at least not immediately. That’s the church’s policy going forward: no plans to resume live services. This is the new normal.  “It's very eerie,” he told me. “But I think we have a responsibility not only for the safety of our members, but for the citizens of Dallas to do our part in trying to keep our city safe.” Jeffress grew up around First Baptist and he’s preached somewhere nearly every Sunday of the year for decades now. Usually, there are dozens of people roaming the halls and offices of the church. Between the family events, recruiting events, community Bible studies, there’s almost always something going on somewhere. But for now, the offices are nearly empty. As he talked about it, he sounded downright melancholy.  “It's sad to think about people not being able to come together,” he told me. “This is the time that we really need one another, and yet we have to follow common-sense guidelines because of our care for other people. But personally, it's very sad for me as a pastor, not to be able to be with his congregation.” I know he’s particularly savvy when it comes to publicity. I asked if there was any part of him that wanted to hold service despite the new guidelines, if only to force the government to shut it down. Imagine the optics! Jeffress laughed. “There was zero part of me that was tempted to do that,” he said. “People should not confuse faith with foolishness.” He reminded me that every morning when he gets on the highway, he prays for his safety, but he wears a seat belt, too. “God expects us to certainly exercise faith,” Jeffress told me. “But common sense as well.”",One of Trump’s Evangelical Defenders Wrestles With Flattening the Curve,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/22/coronavirus-trump-robert-jeffress-evangelical-supporter-140355,politico
"It was just after Super Tuesday, and Joe Biden had just pulled off the seemingly impossible, transforming a near-dead campaign to romp across 14 states. Watching his old boss' moribund campaign roar back to life as the returns rolled in, Biden's longtime friend and confidant Larry Rasky picked up the phone and laughed before he even started speaking.  “I’ve worked for Joe Biden for 30 years,” Rasky said in an interview with POLITICO then. “Seven days ago we won our first primary. Seven days later, he’s the presumptive Democratic nominee. There never has been anything like it.” Rasky called it one of the greatest feats he’d seen in his lifetime. But he won't get to see how the story ends.  On Sunday, he died suddenly at the age of 69, the cause undetermined. He is survived by his wife Carolyn and son Will.  A legend in Boston political circles, Rasky worked on political campaigns for decades, employed by a roster of politicians ranging from former President Jimmy Carter to John Kerry to former Boston Mayor Ray Flynn. Rasky had worked on both of Biden’s previous presidential bids and most recently served as treasurer on a pro-Biden super PAC, Unite the Country. “Larry was Boston through and through,” Biden said in a statement Sunday. “Outspoken — as anyone who sought his counsel can attest — but also gregarious, sharp and generous in spirit.” While attending Emerson College, Rasky worked as a security guard in a building where Carter’s Massachusetts headquarters set up shop, Biden said. Four years later, Rasky served as deputy press secretary for Carter’s reelection campaign.  In an interview Sunday, former Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, who later served as U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See, said when he first flirted with running for mayor in 1984, he struck up a conversation with Rasky, whom he admired but didn’t think he could afford. Down in the polls, with little money to pose a serious threat to anyone, Flynn said Rasky joined the campaign anyway, holding up Flynn’s work on homelessness and with special needs children while he served in the statehouse. Rasky also plotted where the against-the-odds campaign would launch: in one of the poorest parts of the city.  “I’m starting my campaign as the underdog, 17 points down with three months to go,” Flynn recalled. “Here we’re doing it in a West Broadway housing development with poor people and where nobody votes.” Flynn’s message of fighting for those left behind resonated; his victory was so stunning he and Rasky couldn’t believe the returns when they came in. Flynn went on to serve as mayor until 1993 It was just one of dozens of stories that old friends and politicos shared on Sunday after learning of Rasky’s death.  “Larry was real,” said Harry Grill, political campaigns director for Unite Here, a labor union representing culinary and hotel workers, who knew Rasky for 45 years. “What you saw was what you got. If he called you his friend, you were a friend for life. He loved life and loved people. He treated everyone from all walks of life with dignity and respect. He will be sorely missed.” Rasky served as chairman of his Boston-based Rasky Partners, where his son, Will still works.  ""He loved and was loved by so many. He always treated the company like a family and we are all shocked and saddened by the news of his passing,"" a statement from the firm said. ""He has left an indelible imprint on everyone he touched and the company that bears his name will go on in his spirit."" While Rasky didn’t see the full arc of Biden’s political campaign come to a conclusion, those close to him said there was some comfort in knowing he witnessed the political turnaround. Rasky himself said Biden’s comeback was rivaled by only one other feat he’d experienced in his lifetime: the 2004 Boston Red Sox World Series win. Rasky worked for the Red Sox that year and he would often tell tales of the team's comeback from a 3-0 deficit against the Yankees to clinch the American League pennant. “I was literally driving home during one of the games and praying, and trying to talk to Babe Ruth in heaven,” Rasky said.  “We broke the curse of the Bambino, which haunted Boston since they sold Babe Ruth in 1919. Everyone in Boston thought it was divine intervention. I never thought I’d see anything like it again.”",A longtime Biden adviser reveled in his comeback.

"President Donald Trump spent the weekend vacillating between casting himself as an empathetic leader and wartime president as the coronavirus spreads through the United States.  But above all, he still wants credit. Credit for cutting off travel from China. Credit for giving up money to run for office. Credit for uniting the nation.  During three collective hours of briefings on Saturday and Sunday, the president extolled his administration’s “extraordinary mobilization in our war against the virus,” dropped superlatives while describing efforts to offset testing shortages and move a major economic stimulus bill on Capitol Hill and trumpeted a national emergency he declared over a week ago.  “There’s never been anything like we're doing on the Hill right now,” he told reporters in one of many laudatory passages. Even as he repeatedly offered comfort and hope to a nervous American public — ""no American is alone as long as we're united,” he said — Trump would fall back into familiar tropes from his campaign. He attacked the press. He decried the sacrifices that he made as a rich person in choosing to run for office. The two weekend briefings offered a window into the challenges that lie ahead for Trump, as he tries to appease the country and appear in control while also keeping in check his personal grievances. The tone Trump strikes will be critical to whether he is reelected, as the coronavirus crisis is quickly becoming the biggest challenge of the president’s three-and-a-half years in office. His daily briefings have essentially become stand-ins for his campaign rallies that are on hiatus until the coronavirus recedes — his way to communicate with the public and rally his base.  While the public’s approval of his handling of the virus jumped this past week, the ongoing challenges with testing and medical equipment — not to the mention virtual shutdown of the U.S. economy — pose problems that will be playing out for weeks, if not months. “During this event, candid and forceful truths will do us a lot more than sugarcoating false assurances, or only trying to present this only in the best light,” said Craig Fugate who ran the Federal Emergency Management Agency under President Barack Obama from 2009 until early 2017.  “I don’t care about your popularity,” added Fugate. “This isn’t about us. It’s about how many people we can save. This is brutal math right now. Can we keep the death toll as low as possible?” The president’s rhetoric this weekend belied the country’s ongoing inability to broadly test Americans for the coronavirus, almost one month after the first homegrown case appeared in California. Doctors, nurses and major medical groups spent the weekend begging for additional masks and protective equipment to keep health care workers safe as they treat an increasing number of infected patients, and local leaders and governors warned of potentially dire shortages at hospitals that lack enough beds and ventilators to treat the expected waves of new cases.  Trump tried to combat these complaints by announcing over the weekend that his administration intended to send thousands of masks, hospital gowns and respirators to hard hit states, including New York, California and Washington, early this week. Two government ships are also making their way to both New York and the West Coast to serve as extra hospital beds, the president said on Sunday night.  These announcements came after Trump and his top officials could not answer direct questions on Saturday and Sunday morning during the briefing and on various talk shows about the availability of new tests it hoped to unveil in coming weeks, or the timeframe for the federal government to get crucial N95 masks to health care workers.  “It is a dynamic and fluid operation,” Peter Gaynor, the head of FEMA said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” when pressed for an exact figure of the number of masks the government had. “The president appointed FEMA five days ago to manage federal operations. And since I have been here, we have been shipping continuously from federal warehouses and, again, connecting those governors that need supplies to those who have it in the commercial sector.” White House officials note they are working overtime to combat the coronavirus outbreak, freeing up billions in government funding, clamping down on travel and tweaking regulations to expand health care options and ease the shipping of supplies to states and cities. Trump and White House officials have argued that states and local public health leaders are also responsible for tracking down much-needed supplies. The federal government cannot solve all of these problems, officials have argued, and to assume so is a “socialist fantasy,” said one senior administration official. The president put it more diplomatically on Sunday night. He said the federal government was there to support states, not dictate strategy. Yet he made this argument while continuing to make himself the face of the administration’s response. Public health experts say the Trump administration is still playing catch-up after not responding aggressively in the early stages of the coronavirus. One former senior administration official said the U.S. government would have been in a much better situation if officials had started taking more assertive action in January or February. China reported its first death from the virus on Jan. 11. The White House argues that it was taking action then, citing the decision to bar most travel from China and declare a public health emergency on Jan. 31. But critics say the White House has not stuck to a clear and succinct message about how serious the outbreak is for the American public, and how it might be solved. Trump sent mixed signals over the weekend on potential drugs that could be used to treat this virus. He also touted the Defense Production Act — a law that allows the government to mandate that companies repurpose facilities in moments of crisis — yet his administration has yet to actually compel the production of health supplies, insisting companies are cooperating voluntarily. The shifting messaging — and debate over who deserves credit for what — only muddies the main takeaway, experts say. “We need to get out of the discussion of who said what, who did a good job and a bad job. Our outcome has to be to reduce the death toll. We get too hung up on who did what. That is a great topic for a future commission to review,” said Fugate, the former Obama FEMA administrator. “Everything now needs to be about what can we do differently tomorrow.”",Trump wants to defeat coronavirus — and make sure he gets credit,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/trump-wants-defeat-coronavirus-credit-143531,politico
"As the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. soared past 400 on Sunday, President Donald Trump reassured Americans that everything would be OK and that it would all be over soon. Even as he acknowledged the novel coronavirus as an invisible enemy that’s attacking more than 140 countries, the self-proclaimed wartime president predicted “a great victory” in America. “It’s gonna be a victory that, in my opinion, will happen much sooner than originally expected,” Trump said. In a 90-minute news conference with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Trump rattled off the number of supplies the federal government had sent to New York, California and Washington, where a combined 242 people have died from the virus. The list of materials included respirators, surgical masks, gowns, coveralls and gloves. The high volume of items being sent to some of the nation’s hot spots highlights the severity of the threat that the nation and the world face. Hospitals are warning of shortages of materials, including a lack of hospital beds and protective equipment. Meanwhile, governors across the country have closed schools, restaurants, bars and other venues in an effort to slow the spread of the virus, which has surged to beyond 33,000 cases in the U.S. Some leaders have gone so far as to order residents to shelter in place or meet a curfew. The threat has even infiltrated Congress, where three members have contracted the virus and several others are self-quarantining at home. Two congressmen and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky have tested positive in recent days. The disclosure of Paul’s diagnosis on Sunday quickly led to at least two Senate Republicans, Mitt Romney and Mike Lee of Utah, choosing to self-quarantine, leaving the GOP with a slim 48-47 majority. Trump said he believed the infected members would “all be fine” and mocked Romney, who crossed party lines earlier this year and supported his impeachment. “Romney’s in isolation?” Trump said. “Gee, that’s too bad.” The president told reporters he didn’t see any threats to a $1.6 trillion emergency rescue package, even if several Republican members were unable to vote on the legislation while they isolate themselves at home. “It’ll all work out,” he insisted. Within an hour, a procedural vote on the bill failed. In a broad mix of remarks, Trump also argued that the country was “very united,” warned that the virus would’ve been “catastrophic” if not for the massive tax cuts he signed into law in 2017, claimed the presidency had personally cost him billions of dollars, complained that no one thanked him for refusing a presidential salary, predicted the economy would “skyrocket once this is over,” touted his Department of Veterans Affairs for having “the highest poll numbers in the history of the” VA and suggested that none of his predecessors could tell him anything life-saving if he sought their advice. “I have the best people in the world,” Trump said. “Look at the approval numbers on the job we’re doing. I think we’re doing an incredible job, so I don’t want to disturb them, bother them. I don’t think I’m gonna learn much. And, you know, I guess you could say there’s probably a natural inclination not to call. Now if I felt that if I called, I’d learn something, and that would save one life — it would save one life, OK? — I would make the call in 10 minutes, but I don’t see that happening.” Trump said he had a great relationship with Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gavin Newsom of California, who are both Democrats. But he was critical of the news media, telling one reporter “you asked a nasty question” and another that her question sounded like it was “100 percent wrong.” He also expressed optimism that a drug used to treat malaria could be a cure for the coronavirus, remarking that there were “tremendous signs it could work.” “Why should we be testing it in a test tube for a year and a half when we have thousands of people that are very sick?” Trump asked. “They’re very, very sick, and we can use it on those people and maybe make them better and in some cases maybe save their lives.” “We think it might work on this, based on evidence, based on very strong evidence. We’re gonna see. We’re gonna know sometime after Tuesday,” he added. “I don’t wanna get anybody over-excited, but I’m very excited by that, by the prospect of it.” Trump’s rhetoric on the drug is at odds with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In an interview on Sunday morning on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Fauci said Trump had been “trying to bring hope to the people” by promoting the drug. “But my job is to prove definitively from a scientific standpoint that they do work,” he said, explaining their differing views. “I was taking a purely medical, scientific standpoint.”",Trump predicts victory over coronavirus ‘much sooner’ than expected,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/trump-predicts-victory-coronavirus-143459,politico
"For nearly two months, President Donald Trump downplayed the looming coronavirus threat before finally acknowledging the crisis at hand. But by the time the president shifted his stance, many of his supporters on the fringes of the internet had already adopted—and amplified—his initial skepticism, framing the pandemic as just another flu bug or a liberal media hoax. Now that the virus has circled the globe, killing thousands of people and crashing the stock market, what are these people, who live off a steady diet of perceived grievances and conspiracy theories, thinking? Are they, like Sean Hannity and other prominent Fox News hosts, no longer dismissing the novel virus as an overblown, politicized event, or are they steadfast in their denial—and even coming up with more fanciful theories as time goes on?  Given the dire situation, it seems worth knowing if the severity of the pandemic finally has penetrated the bubble of the most extreme coronavirus scoffers; if these people and their followers are ignoring safety measures because they believe the pandemic is a false flag to take away their guns or a Deep State plot to take down Trump, then they risk contributing to the disease’s spread. So, this past week, I created a faux Twitter account and set about building my own information bubble. My objective: Inhabit the world of far-right figures and conspiracy fanatics, survey the landscape and see where it leads me. I wanted to not just look into, but live in, the information universe seemingly giving comfort to people who want to believe this is all just an overreaction. Initially, my guiding principle for choosing which accounts to follow was they had to have expressed skepticism about the seriousness of the virus and the need for an all-out response. I started by following a few highly trafficked personalities that I was already familiar with, such as pro-Trump acolytes Bill Mitchell and Sidney Powell, as well as Jordan Sather, a “professional shit stirrer” (as Rolling Stone put it) in the bizarre QAnon conspiracy movement, which holds that Trump is doing battle with nefarious Deep State forces. Every time I punched in a new name, Twitter helpfully recommended like-minded souls to follow. I was served up names both less familiar (like a former CIA officer on a “mission to expose the Deep State/Shadow Government”) and very familiar (hello, Laura Ingraham and Sebastian Gorka). Some of them occupied very different parts of the info-verse from each other, but they seemed united in the urge to defend the president and his handling of the crisis. I stopped adding to my bubble when it hit close to 70 accounts.  Over the week, I could see a clear line emerging between people who live within the conservative landscape broadly speaking—like Ingraham and Mike Huckabee, who can’t resist trolling liberals, but really aren’t questioning the risks of COVID at this point—and the people who’ve left the mainstream world behind for good. The former are looking for ways to pick holes in mainstream-media consensus and criticisms of the president, but they’re still reality-based. With the others, though, it’s impossible to imagine what combination of circumstances might pull them back to reality. After spending long stretches in this fevered silo, I’m sorry to report that even a devastating pandemic can’t dent the human appetite for conspiracy ideation. Given the anxious, uncertain times we find ourselves in today, perhaps this is not surprising. Scholars say that people who feel a lack of control in their lives sometimes turn to conspiracies to help make sense of random, unfathomable events. “When disasters and tragedies take place, conspiracy theories may be more appealing—or less terrifying—than the reality of what has taken place,” Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan explained in an email.  That said, I was surprised to learn that some of the most notorious conspiracy promoters, like Infowars’ Alex Jones, did not deny the severity and spread of coronavirus. (He is banned from Twitter, but people I followed managed to lead me to his website, where I could watch his streaming broadcast.) To be clear, Jones, who is notorious for erroneously suggesting that numerous mass shootings were staged, has not changed his ways; he is still spewing ridiculous conspiracies about the pandemic’s origins and impact. Jones’ acknowledgement that the virus is more serious than an ordinary flu bug stands in contrast to some other far-right figures and QAnon promoters in my bubble who furiously argued otherwise—even after Trump’s own reality check. This divergence highlighted something else that struck me: just how many conspiracy narratives are being floated in response to the pandemic, as if they’re being tested to see which ones stick.  *** It was on Tuesday, March 17, hours after a White House press conference about the virus, that I launched my faux Twitter account. One of the first retweets that flashed across my laptop screen was from a libertarian activist (@erasethestate), who misleadingly compared flu and coronavirus statistics, something Trump had previously done numerous times. But this was also the same day that the president shed his cavalier approach to the pandemic. Would coronavirus minimizers like @erasethestate take their cue from Trump and abandon that disingenuous tack? Hardly. Bill Mitchell, a vocal Trump supporter with 547,000 followers, showed up often in my feed to bemoan the coronavirus “fearporn.” He was emblematic of many in the far-right sphere of my bubble who faulted the media for “hyping” the pandemic. Mitchell, like @erasethestate, also frequently conflated the high number of flu deaths and hospitalizations with those for coronavirus—failing to mention that the latter is believed by medical authorities to be more contagious and lethal. It will be interesting to see when or if Mitchell ever revisits his obstinate stance, illustrated vividly in this tweet: Not everyone in my feed was as adamant as Mitchell. For example, Sara Carter, a Fox News contributor Twitter suggested to me, wanted to have it both ways on her podcast. “I don’t know if it’s just me,” she started out saying in a recent episode. “I almost feel like there’s this strange overreaction.” Then in the next breath, she noted, “Italy is really suffering,” before equivocating again: “We are overreacting, maybe for good reason, but there’s also this issue where it has been politicized.” Carter’s fuzziness made it hard to understand where she stood. But to some extent, it’s understandable if some of her listeners and followers feel confused about what to think. If you’re obsessively following the outbreak news, watching the panic among real-world doctors, the anxiety of people watching their jobs and 401(k)s vanish, senior citizens and even 30-somethings struggling for life on ventilators, it can be infuriating to read tweet after tweet intimating that this isn’t a big deal at all. But if you haven’t been hit by the disease yet and don’t want to stay inside for the sake of people you’ve never met, there’s a measure of relief in occupying a world in which the situation is under control and the response has gone too far.   While both MAGA types and QAnon enthusiasts in my bubble were suspicious about the pandemic and its root cause, they expressed different reasons. Mitchell intimated that the virus’ spread was a form of bioterrorism by China. Some in the QAnon crowd, seeing the rush to develop a vaccine to fight the virus, fingered profit-seeking pharmaceutical companies as the culprits. While he loathes Big Pharma, Jordan Sather blamed other black hats closer to home after seeing this tweet from Trump: Most people likely understood that Trump was referring to a microscopic pathogen as the “hidden enemy.” But Sather deciphered the real meaning on his YouTube show. “What could he mean?” Sather asked with a grin, as he stroked his chin. “I think you know exactly what he means. He’s talking about the Deep State cabal infecting our planet right now—quite obviously.” The QAnon movement—which spun off the deranged Pizzagate episode during the 2016 election—is obsessed with rooting out supposed Deep State actors and A-list pedophiles, who according to QAnon belief, control Hollywood and the real levers of government power.  When I was in my bubble, an anonymous, QAnon adherent alleged on Facebook that Oprah Winfrey was arrested for running a child sex ring. It was preposterous and easily debunked, but the rumor circulated so widely on the internet that Winfrey felt compelled to respond on Twitter. Even crazier, according to several news reports, the Facebook post alleged that other celebrities, such as Tom Hanks, had also been arrested, but that a covert intelligence operation triggered the coronavirus epidemic to distract the world from bringing them and a Satanic cabal to justice. Toward the end of my time in the bubble, a retweet flashed across my laptop screen that contained a screen grab of something Alex Jones had said on his Infowars show. Jones helms a lucrative multi-media empire that has trafficked in outlandish conspiracies for two decades; he has been successfully sued by parents of Sandy Hook shooting victims for suggesting that the tragic event didn’t actually happen. After one of my followers tweeted a blurb from his show, I clicked on Jones’ livestream just as he was beginning of one of his trademark stream-of-consciousness monologues.  “The world is going into martial law,” he says in his raspy voice, playing off the travel restrictions that have been enacted to quell the pandemic. “Criminals, armed robbers, rapists, they are all being let out of jail by the tens of thousands.” Every word of this is false, of course, as is what he says a few minutes later: “If your neighbors sees you cough, you’re being taken away for six weeks. … This is how the West dies. This is how America dies, this is how it all unfolds.” No wonder Jones isn’t denying the severity of the coronavirus; he’s using it to frighten his listeners witless—to his own advantage. Wearing a blazer and sitting behind his faux TV studio in Austin, Texas, Jones broke off from his rants every 10 minutes or so to hawk his line of dietary supplements and other products. He sells everything from toothpaste and coffee (called “Wake Up America”) to sleeping aids (“Knock-out”). I tried to listen to two of his shows on consecutive days, but I couldn’t get very far in, especially after I heard him plug his supplements as a life and death necessity for people to survive the pandemic. “Folks, they want to train you to sit there and die in your house,” he said. “Get the boost you and your family need. A lot of stuff is selling out, a lot of stuff coming in. We have the supplements now. You better get your orders in. Do not wait.”  Agitated by his shamelessness, I slammed my laptop shut and reflected on the upside-down world I had created for myself on Twitter and YouTube. I felt unsettled by the realization that not even a monumental humanitarian crisis can keep some charlatans from exploiting people’s fears for profit. If you want to hear that the virus is no big deal, maybe even fake, you don’t have to build your own bubble. Here’s your shortcut: At the moderate end, among the media-skeptic pro-Trump crowd, the virus is real and it’s scary, but so are liberal overreach, open borders, government spending, breathless public-health fearmongering and criticism of Trump. At the extreme end, let’s call it Full QAnon, the outbreak is engineered by Chinese scientists, Big Pharma or criminal celebrities, and may or may not be real. This weekend, I peeked back at my Twitter bubble one last time to see if events on the ground had changed any of the hardened minds I’d been following for days. But everyone seemed ensconced in their altered or alternate realities. There was not a dent in the cocoon—for now.

"President Donald Trump said Sunday that as he tackles the current national crisis, he doesn’t want to “bother” his predecessors and doesn’t think he’s “going to learn much” from them.  In response to a reporter’s question on whether he would reach out to any former presidents (George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama or Jimmy Carter), Trump implied that wasn’t in the cards. “I think we're doing an incredible job. So I don't want to disturb them, bother them,” he said at the White House coronavirus task force briefing. “I don't think I'm going to learn much and, you know, I guess you could say that there's probably a natural inclination not to call.” The president instead pointed to his approval numbers on the job his administration is doing — 55 percent of respondents approve of Trump’s management, a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll found— and boasted having “the best people in the world.”  However, Trump said, if he felt that he would glean information that could save even just one life, he would “make the call in two minutes.” “But I don’t see that happening,” he finished.  There is ample precedent for current presidents asking former presidents to step in. Notably, Bush enlisted the help of Clinton and President George H.W. Bush in raising voluntary contributions in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina — just as they did to help victims of tsunami relief in 2004. Carter conducted diplomatic missions throughout his post-presidential years. America is contending with rising numbers of critically ill coronavirus patients and a shortage of emergency medical equipment. Governors, mayors and front-line health care workers have said they haven’t received meaningful amounts of federal aid. The Trump administration has been criticized for being too slow to respond to the threat, then thinking too much in the short-term on potential solutions for the pandemic.  There have been at least 33,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States and over 400 deaths, according to a database from Johns Hopkins University.

"Joe Biden has a shortlist of more than six women to be his running mate and will start the vetting process “in a matter of weeks,” he said Sunday during a call with donors. Biden, who indicated he had consulted with his former boss, President Barack Obama, didn’t mention any names. But he said nothing to dispel the speculation that he’s considering the three senators who ran against him for president — Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. “Background checks matter. They have to be prepared,” Biden said, adding that he wants to ensure that “there’s not going to be any snafu” with his selection. “The most important thing, and I've actually talked to Barack about this — the most important thing is that there has to be someone who, the day after they’re picked, is prepared to be president of the United States of America if something happened,” said Biden, who is 77. Biden said he needs “someone who is comfortable with where I am” on policy. He doesn’t want someone with “a restricted view of the United States and its required influence in the world” and wants to make sure his pick is not “at odds, in any fundamental way, with my attitude toward healthcare or education.” “I think there are plenty of women who are ready, been tested out there who are capable of answering all those questions,” Biden said, noting that “I have to start that vetting process relatively soon, meaning in a matter of weeks...there will be a group that is in excess of six or seven people that I look at.” The donor who asked Biden the question about his possible running mate then threw in a plug for former acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates, who was on the call and who was widely hailed by Democrats after she was fired for her post in 2017 for refusing to defend President Trump’s immigration policy in court. “She's really incredible. Sally's an incredible person,” Biden said. The fundraiser was originally supposed to take place in Atlanta, Georgia, but it was moved to a tele-fundraiser due to the coronavirus contagion. During the 23-minute call, Biden took a few passing shots at Trump and accused him of dishonesty and feckless leadership during the crisis. Asked if he believed the November election would be postponed, Biden said it shouldn’t be. “I know there’s a lot of rumors and speculation as to, ‘is the other guy going to try to postpone the election in November’ and all that,” Biden said. “There’s no need to do that.” Another donor said she was concerned that Biden hasn’t been visible in recent days. “We see Donald Trump every day with this crisis giving his press report,” the donor said. “And I would just love to see you more. Like how do we get more of you and less of him on our airwaves?” Biden said he would have his first press briefing on the coronavirus about 11:30 a.m. Monday now that his home is broadcast ready in the time of coronavirus and social distancing. “They put in a new high-speed line into my home,” he said. “They've converted a recreation room, basically, into a television studio.”",Biden to begin vetting VP shortlist ‘in a matter of weeks’,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/biden-running-mates-143124,politico
"AUSTIN, Texas — Gov. Greg Abbott issued two executive orders mandating that the state's health care facilities postpone elective medical procedures and suspending regulations to allow hospitals to treat two patients in one room in an effort to combat the spread of Covid-19.  He also announced the creation of a “strike force” to help Texas procure medical supplies and said that he was deploying the National Guard to help providers organize testing areas and assist hospitals in creating more bed space. Abbott has grown increasingly aggressive in responding to the pandemic, following the lead of Texas cities and counties and other states around the country. Texas, however, still lags in testing capabilities.  State officials said at Sunday’s news conference that Texas was in the early stages of the outbreak and that the measures were intended to help boost hospital capacity, supplies and medical staff as more people fall critically ill. Hospitals could face fines and providers could face jail if they don’t comply with the order postponing elective procedures. The “strike force” includes former Republican state Rep. John Zerwas, an anesthesiologist, as well as an executive from Austin-based Dell Technologies. Abbott added that the state had funds to pay for protective equipment and other supplies needed to help treat patients, but couldn’t find supplies.  The governor said that the state wasn’t prepared to strengthen restrictions on people’s movement and issue shelter-in-place rules, but added that he would consider stricter measures if people don’t follow his earlier order banning gatherings of more than 10 people. Several cities and counties already have imposed stricter bans on gatherings.  “The only thing that matters right now is public health and safety,” said Abbott.  There are now more than 300 confirmed cases of coronavirus and six deaths have been reported. The state has tested nearly 9,000 people so far.

"Two ugly truths about any epic economic crisis are that not all businesses will survive, and government interventions help determine which businesses will survive. As coronavirus crushes the economy, Washington policymakers are scrambling to figure out who to bail out, a responsibility that one veteran of the 2008 financial rescue morbidly but accurately compared to the frantic triage work that doctors are currently doing in overcrowded Italian hospitals. They don’t want to waste precious resources on patients who can’t be saved, or on patients who can recover without their help. They know they can’t prevent all deaths, but they want to prevent the preventable deaths. “You have to decide who you can bridge through this,” he said. That kind of economic triage is happening right now. With American commerce facing an unprecedented shutdown, and just about every business other than Amazon, Costco and Purell taking devastating hits, Washington is gripped in a bailout frenzy. Nearly every industry is sending its lobbyists to ask Congress for handouts, including the private jet industry. The coal industry wants permission to stop making payments to miners with black lung disease. The hotel industry alone has requested a $150 billion bailout, which would help President Donald Trump endure the cancelled bookings at his resorts. As Congress rushes to assemble an enormous stimulus package to try to slow the freefall or at least pad the landing, it’s becoming clear that a lot of federal dollars will be sent straight to American taxpayers, but also that a lot of federal dollars will go straight to the companies that employ them. Washington’s last epic bailout, the $700 billion Wall Street rescue of 2008, was wildly unpopular but ultimately quite successful—and while a financial panic is a different kind of crisis than a viral pandemic, it has some lessons for today about when companies should get help and how that help should be delivered. These are political questions, and in the current congressional negotiations, Democrats are pushing for more aid for families, especially poorer families, while Republicans are pushing for more aid for businesses, with fewer strings attached. But there’s a growing bailout literature—including a new academic treatise, titled First Responders, produced by the architects and engineers of the last bailout—that suggests some answers are better than others. In any case, Washington is about to send jetloads of money to American capitalists—perhaps not yet as much as the $700 billion it authorized in 2008 for the financial industry after the worst financial collapse since the Great Depression, but certainly more than the $80 billion it ended up injecting into the auto industry to soften the Great Recession in 2009. Trump’s own trillion-dollar proposal included $500 billion for businesses, and that figure seems to be growing as congressional leaders hash out a deal.  Ideally they’d be able to think long and hard about who to bail out and how the bailouts should be structured to minimize the short-term and long-term suffering. Right now they don’t have time to think long, but here are some hard problems they’ll need to consider. Some of the industries begging for bailouts are truly vital to the U.S. economy. Many are on the cusp of huge layoffs that would cause awful pain. And none are responsible for the pandemic that’s destroying their bottom lines. But triage is about priorities, and Washington’s top priority is as spectacularly obvious as it has been largely absent from the stimulus debate: It needs to do everything it can to contain the coronavirus right now. The first rule for getting out of a hole is to stop digging, and that means throwing money at any business that can make more tests, masks or ventilators, provide more hospital beds or medical supplies, or otherwise help get the pandemic under control. Trump’s two-page stimulus proposal did not specify one dime for these industries, but it’s the length and severity of the pandemic itself that will determine the ultimate fate of the airlines, the hotels and every other American business. Any aid that isn’t directed towards ending the pandemic is a Band-Aid. It may seem unfair to send other blameless industries to the back of the line, especially after Washington approved $700 billion for too-big-to-fail banks that actually caused the cataclysm in 2008, but it really reflects the same principle. The crisis in 2008 was a financial panic, an all-out run on the financial system that props up the economy; the only way to end the panic was to assure depositors and creditors that their money would be safe in the system, and the only way to do that was to have the government stand behind the banks. The crisis today is a public health catastrophe, and the only way to get cruise lines and hotels and factories back in business will be to stop the spread of the virus. So those industries don’t have a special claim to be first in line for bailouts—except insofar as cruise ships and hotels could be repurposed to quarantine the sick, or factories could be repurposed to make necessary medical equipment. The financial bailout worked in 2008, and every dime the government invested in dying banks was repaid with interest after they recovered. This time, Washington shouldn’t expect to get back money it invests in the overwhelmed public health sector. But if that money helps contain COVID-19, it could save millions of businesses and trillions of taxpayer dollars. While the medical sector is the only sector vital to ending this crisis, it’s certainly possible that other industries could be deemed vital to the economy, as the auto industry was in 2009. Trump’s proposal included $200 billion worth of loans to airlines and “other critical sectors of the U.S. economy experiencing severe financial distress.” The next question in front of Washington in a time of triage is: Are any other sectors so critical to the economy that ordinary taxpayers should bail them out?  After all, just about every sector is experiencing severe financial distress. So even though more than 2 million Americans work in the hotel industry, and 15 million Americans work at restaurants, it’s hard to justify helping beleaguered hoteliers or restauranteurs through industry-specific bailouts rather than general programs to help businesses and workers. U.S. cruise lines want U.S. aid even though they’re headquartered outside the U.S. to avoid U.S. taxes. Their economic adversity is not evidently more critical for government to relieve than the adversity of shuttered barber shops or retail stores or movie theaters. The airlines do seem likely to get a bailout, and they arguably do provide a vital economic service to a nation of frequent flyers that would be difficult to replace if they all went bust. Boeing is also seeking a $60 billion aid package, and while it might seem enraging even to contemplate helping a behemoth that was already in trouble before the pandemic because its planes kept falling out of the sky, it is America’s single biggest exporter. One lesson of the 2008 bailout, which rewarded reckless behavior but quelled a catastrophic panic, is that success should be measured by results for the nation, not by the morality of the bailout recipients. Incidentally, another lesson of 2008 is that turbulence on Main Street—unemployed workers and underperforming businesses unable to pay mortgages and other loans—can create turbulence on Wall Street, which can then create a vicious cycle that intensifies problems on Main Street. It is unfortunately possible that if the pandemic drags on for awhile, Big Finance might need more help from Congress to stave off another panic. It would infuriate the country, especially after Goldman Sachs just gave its CEO a raise to $27.5 million, but financial markets are already deteriorating so quickly that the Federal Reserve has quietly begun to pump liquidity into faltering credit markets. “It’s hard for markets to function when people can’t price risk, and right now there’s so much uncertainty that it’s very hard to price risk,” says Brookings Institution economist Nellie Liang, who ran the Federal Reserve's Office of Financial Stability and edited First Responders, the collection of essays by the 2008 crisis managers. “We’re definitely starting to see some dysfunction.” This is why one Main Street solution floating around, a “Jubilee”-type mandate where the government suspends all payments on mortgages and rent and other loans for a couple months, could freak out creditors and destabilize the financial system yet again. ""That. Would. Be. Crazy!"" another crisis veteran told me. When governments tell creditors their secured loans are no longer secure, credit can dry up in a hurry. That’s why the Fed is starting to revive many of the lending programs it used to backstop the credit markets in 2008—including one guaranteeing private financing for creditworthy corporations outside the financial industry.  The problem, of course, is that if the pandemic drags on too long, few financial or non-financial corporations will remain creditworthy. This is why the best way to make sure there’s no need for another financial bailout, and to minimize the need for other business bailouts, would be to contain the coronavirus so that the non-financial economy can recover.  Still, it does look like the government will bail out some industries. The next questions to ask are: What kind of terms should the government impose, and what should it get in return? The three big myths about the bank bailout is that it cost taxpayers a mint, gave the banks blank checks with no conditions, and made sure no one on Wall Street lost money. In fact, taxpayers got their money back with interest, banks faced limits on executive pay—although those modest limits were lifted once the government was repaid—and most bank investors absorbed gigantic losses, while gigantic firms like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Wachovia were wiped out. And because there were real dangers to imposing onerous conditions on financial firms during a financial panic that would not apply to non-financial companies during a pandemic, Washington can be much tougher about its bailouts this time.  The first principle for any industry-specific emergency aid is that the main goal should be to get the industry through the emergency, not to bail out its investors or executives. The government is about to blast unprecedented amounts of money into the economy, but that money ultimately comes out of the pockets of taxpayers, so it’s reasonable to ask bailed-out industries to repay the government once the emergency has passed. That means the bulk of the aid being delivered through loans or perhaps, as in 2008, government purchases of non-voting stock that avoid saddling the firms with excessive debt without subjecting them to operational control by Washington bureaucrats. Either way, the beneficiaries of the aid should not be stockholders. There are good arguments for keeping vital industries afloat—even if they were mismanaged before the pandemic, even if they blew their cash reserves on stock buybacks. There might even be a case for government to protect their senior creditors, because financial markets can implode when it starts to look like Corporate America’s credit is no longer good. But there’s no reason to bail out their investors, who simply made bets in the financial casino that didn’t pan out. If you have money in the stock market, and you’re not a Republican senator who dumped equities after a scary intelligence briefing, you’re probably getting hammered right now; you don’t deserve special help if you happen to be invested in airlines. Because this economic calamity is looking even worse than 2008, it’s unrealistic to expect the government to be as successful getting its money back this time. But the government actually has more leverage to impose harsh conditions on its bailouts than it had in 2008, when it was desperate for every bank to participate in the program despite the stigma. “The banks had a gun to our head,” another former financial first responder told me. “That’s somewhat less true when the bailouts are of, say, airlines.” Now that Washington can force bailout recipients to meet just about any demands, what should those demands be? At the very least, Congress has leverage can demand full transparency and powerful oversight over every dollar of federal aid. The Trump administration is reportedly pushing for a $500 billion bailout fund that would not even require immediate disclosure of the bailout recipients, which ought to be a non-starter. Meanwhile, the airlines have already volunteered to rein in executive compensation, stop paying dividends and refrain from stock buybacks over the life of their loans, a good indication that Congress could ask for more, like limiting those activities even after the loans are repaid. America’s top five airlines indulged in $45 billion worth of stock buybacks that drained their reserves before the pandemic, and it makes sense to ensure that any industry “vital” enough to get bailed out is also required to take its own survival seriously. Senator Elizabeth Warren has called for a permanent ban on stock buybacks for any bailed-out firm, as well as a $15-an-hour minimum wage and a worker representative on its board. Trump’s proposal suggested that bailed out airlines should face “continuation of service requirements.” But it’s worth thinking about when punitive conditions can be too punitive, since the goal is to make sure these vital industries are healthy in the future. Trump’s notion of service requirements sounds like a plan to force airlines to keep flying planes with hardly any passengers, a recipe for bigger losses and bigger bailouts. Warren and other Democrats support a $15 minimum wage for everyone, but until they can pass it in Congress, does it make sense to saddle vital industries with higher labor costs than non-vital industries? Even limits on executive compensation, while clearly sensible as long as firms remain wards of the state, could make it harder for them to attract better leaders after they repay their loans. Then again, requirements that bailed-out companies keep their workers on payroll can be onerous, too, but it’s unlikely that Washington will hand out hundreds of billions of dollars to businesses again without some kind of limits on layoffs. Bailouts aren’t only supposed to save vital industries. They’re also supposed to help the people who work in those industries. The easiest way to get money to ordinary Americans in an emergency is for the government to give it to them. The Republican and Democratic stimulus plans all envision sending checks to taxpayers. Democrats are also pushing for major increases in antipoverty payments like unemployment insurance, which many Republicans seem willing to accept. But there is also a powerful argument for giving aid to businesses, especially small businesses, if they use the aid to keep paying workers who would otherwise be laid off.  “We don’t want millions of people dropping onto the unemployment rolls, because once they’re on it’s hard to get off,” says one GOP congressional aide. “It’s important to keep people connected to their employers, and there’s also inherent dignity in having a job.” That makes sense, and it would be great to limit the disruption from a near-total shutdown of the economy. But it would also be extremely difficult to do in a triage moment. A gym, a café, a store, or any other business depending on customers who are no longer leaving their homes won’t be able to pay its employees until the virus is contained, and probably won’t be able to pay back a loan even after the virus is contained. This is why the leaders of the small business committees in the House and Senate drafted a bipartisan $300 billion plan to have the government guarantee loans covering payroll costs during the crisis, understanding that it might eventually cost much more. Americans make about $1 trillion a month, so a lot would depend on the boundaries set by Washington: Would all businesses be covered, no matter how big? Would all salaries be covered, no matter how high? Again, there’s what Liang calls an “adverse selection problem” in essentially forgiving loans like this during a crisis; businesses that need them probably won’t be able to pay them back, while businesses that can pay them back probably don’t need them. And once the government decides to stand behind a business, there’s a natural tendency to do whatever it takes to keep it afloat. The Senate Republican stimulus proposal included that bipartisan payroll idea but expanded it to cover lease and mortgage payments for small businesses as well. And Democrats have said the latest GOP version would only require bailed-out businesses to maintain their workforce “to the extent possible,” which these days could be a pretty minimal extent. This is all uncharted territory, because Washington is really dealing with two crises. One is the current nightmare of a nation in lockdown, a situation that is going to make it just about impossible for any bricks-and-mortar business that isn't selling groceries or hand sanitizer to stay afloat for long without government help. And then there’s the question of what the economy will need after the lockdown is over, which is even harder to answer when nobody knows how long the pandemic will last, or which kinds of businesses will be best suited to survive in a post-pandemic economy. That’s why ending the pandemic is almost infinitely more important than any other economic priority. Keeping businesses alive is important, too, even though some of the firms that receive government medicine are going to die anyway. But that’s why the triage analogy only goes so far. Government doesn’t have the power to save every business, just as the Italian doctors don’t have the power to save every patient, but government does have the power to make sure every American has enough cash to buy essentials during the crisis. And as they spend that cash, they’ll help lay the groundwork for a recovery. Before Washington even thinks about giving the Trump Administration a $500 billion bailout fund for businesses, it can start by bailing out the ordinary taxpayers who send money to Washington every year. Even if they aren’t too big to fail.",Washington Is About to Pick Which Companies Survive,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/22/bailout-coronavirus-congress-crisis-142961,politico
"Sen. Rand Paul on Sunday announced he has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, becoming the first senator and third member of Congress known to have contracted the virus. And Senate GOP leaders will now be short five Republicans during a key procedural vote on a massive economic rescue package to deal with the coronavirus crisis, in part due to Paul's infection. Paul — who has been working from the Capitol in recent days — said he was tested out of caution “due to his extensive travel and events"" and is not showing symptoms of the highly infectious virus. Later, his staff said that Paul had attended an event where two people tested positive, though the senator did not recall specific interactions with either of them. Paul’s infection quickly reverberated throughout the Senate, where lawmakers were surprised by his diagnosis as they pushed ahead with a massive package to rescue the economy from the outbreak. The Kentucky senator had been interacting with his colleagues just days prior, voting on the floor, sitting in meetings and speaking to reporters in hallways.  Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) are now self-quarantining after close interactions with Paul. Lee's office said Sunday that the Capitol's attending physician directed him to stay isolated for 14 days, a recommendation Romney also received. That means Lee and Romney, along with Paul, cannot vote on any legislation on the floor this week as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell attempts to keep his conference together on the economic rescue bill. Meanwhile, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.) is also self-quarantining in Washington after potential exposure earlier this month, as is Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). But the news of Paul’s infection does not appear to have changed the calculation for Senate GOP leaders, whose members remain in Washington for a rare weekend session — at least until the stimulus package is complete. “I don’t believe it changes our posture,” Senate Rules Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told reporters on Sunday when asked whether the Senate would change its operations. “I think individual members will know if they’ve had much contact with him in the last week or not.” “The crisis that we’re facing requires that we be here,” added Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho.) “I can’t say that Congress should quit operating. The people of America need Congress to be working on this crisis response.” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said he believes more senators “are being more careful than we were 12 hours ago” but added that they have no choice but to stay in Washington. “I feel a little bit like we are first responders. There’s an emergency, and there’s no one else but the United States Senate that’s going to pass this bill and it has to be passed,” Cramer told reporters. Several senators, including Susan Collins (R-Maine), however, said the chamber should take an extended leave from the Capitol after clearing the latest relief package. “I believe that our first obligation is to finish our work. After that, I think it would be wise to accelerate the break that was scheduled for April,” Collins told reporters. Paul expects to return to the Senate after isolating himself, an aide to the senator said. The staffer added that Paul’s office in Washington has been working remotely for 10 days, so “virtually no staff” has had physical contact with him. Health officials have said the virus is spread largely among people who are showing symptoms of the disease. But people who have the disease who aren’t symptomatic — like Paul — can still pass it to others.  Privately, some senators have become very concerned over Paul's diagnosis. Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran said in a GOP lunch Sunday that Paul was at the gym this morning, swimming in the pool. Paul is one of a small group of lawmakers to have tested positive for the disease, in addition to Reps. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.). Both members developed symptoms last weekend, after being in the Capitol as recently as last Saturday morning. Many lawmakers on Capitol Hill fear the virus will spread within their ranks, as the Senate remains in the building to draft and pass much-needed economic recovery legislation. The House, whose members have been working from their districts for the past week, is expected to return sometime this week to vote on the Senate’s “Phase 3” package.  Many members of the House are privately worried about returning to Washington, not just because it would require hundreds of people to get on airplanes but because it could expose them to the virus in the sprawling Capitol complex. Several anxious lawmakers of both parties have called for the House to consider voting remotely, though it would be one of the biggest procedural changes to Congress in history. The virus has likely been inside the Capitol for weeks: Several staffers in the House and Senate have tested positive, in addition to the three members. And many more lawmakers and staffers have been told by the House physician’s office of possible exposure at the Capitol, with each of those individuals asked to self-quarantine in their homes. Many parts of the Capitol have ceased regular operations: Offices are largely teleworking, visitor access is restricted, and tours are canceled.  Still, there are hundreds of people in the building each day, including Capitol police, food preparation workers and cleaning staff — not including the 100 senators, dozens of staff and reporters. And there is no universal screening for people entering the building. The concerns of infection are heightened in the Senate, where the average age of a senator is nearly 63.  “Senators, as a rule, tend to be a little bit older. So senators are at an increased risk for calculations,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a doctor, told reporters Sunday. Still, Cassidy largely downplayed the risks at the Capitol, noting that Paul took the appropriate measures to immediately quarantine himself, and he pointed out that the Senate has far lower risk than health care facilities. “But, by the way, not as high risk as a nursing home. So we’ve got to be concerned about everybody right now,” he said. “We have to put this in perspective.” Jake Sherman and Marianne Levine contributed to this report.",Sen. Rand Paul tests positive for coronavirus and more GOP senators quarantine,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/sen-rand-paul-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-142326,politico
"Governors, mayors and front-line health care workers confronting rising numbers of critically ill coronavirus patients said Sunday they have not received meaningful amounts of federal aid, including the shipments of desperately needed masks and other emergency equipment that administration officials say they have already dispatched. As the crisis spreads, the Senate was moving forward with a rare Sunday procedural vote despite a breakdown in negotiations between Democrats and Republicans on a third coronavirus aid package. Among the points of contention: funding for hospitals and conditions on the billions of dollars that would flow to impacted corporations. The Senate wants to pass the bill containing both broad economic stimulus measures and direct help for American families as early as Monday. Meanwhile, the pressure on hospitals in hard-hit areas is mounting, and several Democratic governors are demanding a more coordinated national response to get supplies as fast as possible to where they are needed most critically. But President Donald Trump hit back at the governors' televised pleas, tweeting Sunday that they ""shouldn't be blaming the Federal Goverment for their own shortcomings."" He told the governors the federal government's role is to be there ""to back you up should you fail, and always will be!"" “We are desperate,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told ABC Sunday morning. “We've had a big ask into the strategic stockpile in the White House. They've given us a fraction of our ask.” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer echoed that urgency, saying her state’s hospitals are dealing with about 800 confirmed cases of the virus — up from only one just 12 days ago — and are struggling with serious shortages of both test kits and protective equipment for medical workers. The shortages have forced hospitals to adopt risky practices like reusing masks and having staff wear bandanas when no mask is available. A lack of personal protective equipment puts medical personnel at greater risk of becoming infected or placed in quarantine, exacerbating hospitals' existing staff shortages. “We’ve got to have those masks,” Whitmer said. “Had the federal government really started focusing when it became clear that the whole world was going to be confronting this, we would be in a stronger position right now ... Lives will be lost because we weren’t prepared.” The nation's main hospital association is also reporting ongoing gaps in the supply line, despite the mobilization of some federal aid from the Strategic National Stockpile, donations from other industries and other sources. ""There is a supply. Many people have them, but there's a gap and we're going to need more,"" Richard Pollack, the CEO of the American Hospital Association, told CBS. ""If we don't protect our health care workers, the system will completely collapse."" Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor, whose agency was not activated to run the pandemic response until Friday, painted a more optimistic picture in Sunday morning appearances on ABC and CNN. He said masks and other equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile are well on their way to states — particularly hard-hit areas like Washington, California and New York. “They have been distributed. They've been distributed over the past couple of weeks. They're shipping today. They'll ship tomorrow,” Gaynor told ABC. “We are shipping from our national stockpile, we're shipping from vendors, we're shipping from donations. It is happening.” Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, offered similar assurances on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""The resources that are being marshaled are going to be clearly directed to those hot spots that need it most,"" he said. ""So not only is New York trying to get resources themselves, but we're going to be pouring it in from the federal government. So it would be a combination of local and federal. But it's very, very clear that they are a very high priority."" But Gaynor and other administration officials sidestepped repeated questions on exactly how many masks were being shipped and when they would be in the hands of doctors and nurses who need them. “I can't give you a rough number,” he said in another interview on CNN, adding that governors should not depend on federal disbursements and should try on their own to obtain masks and other equipment. “If you find it on the market, go ahead and buy it. FEMA will reimburse you for it,” he said. “This is a shared responsibility.” Several governors pushed back, warning that pitting states against one another, the federal government, and other countries in a bidding war on the private market is no way to respond to a pandemic that requires a coordinated national response to obtain and allocate emergency goods. “It’s a wide, Wild West…out there,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said of his attempts to obtain supplies. “And indeed we’re overpaying, I would say, for [personal protective equipment] because of that competition.” ""We need the federal government to get us those test kits,” Whitmer agreed. “We need PPEs. And frankly a patchwork strategy of each state doing what they can is — we’re going to do it if we have to, but it would be nice to have a national strategy.” Governors, congressional lawmakers and mayors continued to plead with the White House over the weekend to use the powers of the Defense Production Act to speed up manufacture of masks, ventilators and other scarce supplies as many hospitals say they’re set to run out within days. Trump also tweeted Sunday morning that he has given a handful of car companies ""the go ahead"" to make ventilators and other unnamed ""metal products"" for hospitals, but gave no indication of a timeline or quantity. Converting factories from making cars to making medical equipment cannot happen immediately, and could take several months. In the meantime, hospitals need immediate help. “We've gotten no indication of any factory on 24/7 shifts. We've gotten no shipments,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on NBC. “I can’t be blunt enough: If the president does not act, people will die who could have lived otherwise.” De Blasio also called on the president to mobilize the military's health care workers to immediately deploy to coronavirus hot spots like his own city. ""All military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep, like New York, right now,"" he said. ""Why are they at their bases? Why are they not being allowed to serve? I guarantee you they're ready to serve. But the president has to give the order."" Though Trump signed the defense act last week, Gaynor confirmed that the administration has yet to use it to order any companies to manufacture more products. He suggested such a step wasn’t necessary as companies are already stepping up. “We haven't had to use it, because companies around the country, donations, they are saying, ‘What can we do to help you?’ And it's happening without using that — that lever,” he said. “If it comes to a point where we have to pull the level, we will.” Both in private calls with the White House and in public interviews, lawmakers are insisting that time is now. “We cannot wait until people start really dying in large numbers to start production, especially of more complicated equipment like ventilators and hospital beds,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told CNN. “We need to start this production right now to get ready for the surge that is coming in two to three weeks.” On Sunday evening, Trump released some concrete numbers at the White House briefing by the coronavirus task force, focusing on the equipment and supplies en route to New York and Washington state. Delivered to New York, as of three days ago: 186,416 N95 respirators, 444,000 O-78 surgical masks, 84,560 face shields, 68,944 surgical gowns, 352 coveralls and 245,486 gloves.  Delivered to Washington, as of three days ago: 369,000 N95 respirators, 507,406 surgical masks, 63,788 face shields, 107,850 surgical gowns and 240,376 gloves. “And we have many, many things pending,“ Trump said.

"In an escalating war of words Sunday, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker compared President Donald Trump to “the carnival barkers that are tweeting from the cheap seats.“ Pritzker was responding to a critical tweet from Trump, who said the governor “and a very small group of certain other governors … shouldn’t be blaming the federal government for their own shortcomings. We are there to back you up should you fail, and always will be!” Trump was, in turn, responding to criticism from Pritzker about states having to compete often against each other for medical supplies and even overpaying as a result of a federal shortage. “We’re competing against each other, we’re competing against other countries,“ Pritzker said on CNN's “State of the Union.”  “It‘s a wide Wild West … out there. And, indeed, we’re overpaying, I would say, for [personal protective equipment] because of that competition,” Pritzker said on CNN. In his daily afternoon press briefing, in which Illinois announced three more deaths and 296 more confirmed cases, including of an infant, Pritzker opened his presser saying he’d address Trump’s tweet before he knew he’d take questions about it: ""I’m finding it hard to control my anger with Donald Trump's response to this crisis. I have doctors and nurses and first responders begging for masks, equipment and more tests … Donald Trump promised to deliver for all the states weeks ago and so far has done very little,” he said. “This is the time for serious people, not the carnival barkers that are tweeting from the cheap seats. All I can say is get to work or get out of the way."" Asked later if Pritzker had spoken to the president or the administration about his concerns since Trump’s tweet, and he said no. “I’ve been quite busy this afternoon. I was on the phone trying to obtain PPE from a variety of sources, some in Illinois and some from around the country and world,” said Pritzker. “So I haven’t seen what he’s responded and I haven’t responded back or had a conversation with him. Though I’m always open to a conversation that will advance the health and safety of the people of Illinois.” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot responded to Trump's tweet, too, saying: ""dear Lord—please step up and be a leader. While you have been yammering about hoaxes and fake news, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit all over America. @GovPritzker  and others have filled this country’s leadership gap. Lead or get out of their way."" In his CNN appearance, Pritzker said he’s gotten a fraction of the masks, gloves and gowns requested from the federal government. As a result, Pritzker said he’s deployed staff to purchase supplies on the open market internationally.  “I’ve got people on the phones, working the phones across the world, frankly, to get this stuff shipped to Illinois,” Pritzker said.  Pritzker also discussed his decision to move to a stay-at-home order for Illinois residents. “We have moved on now to a stay-at-home order,“ he said. “These should have been done nationally. They haven't been. But I have got to protect the 12.7 million people that live in my state. And I'm dedicated to that. It's their health and safety that matters most to me. It will work. It will work.“",Illinois Gov. Pritzker mocks Trump’s coronavirus efforts,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/wild-west-states-pritzker-says-141580,politico
"The Senate on Sunday failed to clear a key procedural hurdle on a $1.6 trillion emergency rescue package, raising pressure on both parties to try again to reach a deal to address the economic devastation of the coronavirus outbreak. On a 47-47 vote, the measure fell well short, after Democrats denied Republicans the 60 votes needed to move forward. Among the sticking points remaining are provisions for corporations getting federal assistance, including policy on stock buybacks and executive pay, as well as unemployment insurance and worker protections. A livid Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) chastised Democrats for voting against moving forward and blamed Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for interfering.  ""I want everybody to fully understand if we aren't able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem,"" McConnell said on the floor. He added that over the last 48 hours there were bipartisan discussions among ""regular members of the Senate, not in the Leadership office, not in the speaker's office for goodness sakes."" ""She's the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate,"" McConnell added. ""We were doing just fine until that intervention."" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) blamed McConnell for adopting a partisan stance by holding the cloture vote without an agreement, and said the package still has ""many problems."" ""The majority leader was well aware of how the vote would go before it happened but he chose to go forward with it anyway even though negotiations are continuing,"" Schumer said on the floor. ""So who's playing games? But our caucus is united to deliver a bill that addresses this health and economic crisis quickly and we're committed to working in a bipartisan way to get it done."" Drew Hammill, a senior Pelosi aide, chided Republicans: “Rule of thumb from the speaker of the House: don’t call the vote until you have the votes.” Republicans and the White House insist that a deal has to be reached by Monday or financial markets will further deteriorate, exacerbating an already precarious position for the U.S. economy. Late Sunday night, McConnell was forced to reschedule a repeat of the same vote he lost. McConnell had wanted to hold it at 9:45 a.m., shortly after Wall Street opened, to pressure Schumer and Senate Democrats. But Schumer objected to that schedule, and now the re-vote will be held at noon Monday. ""Maybe there will be some miraculous coming together tonight. I hope so,"" McConnell said as he left the building. ""If not, we will now be voting at noon rather than 9:45."" Even as McConnell walked out, Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were huddling in Schumer's office off the Senate floor, their seventh such discussion of the day. Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced he had become the first senator to test positive for the virus and would be isolating himself. Soon after, Utah GOP Sens. Mike Lee and Mitt Romney said they would be self-quarantining after recently spending time with Paul. And with Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) already having quarantined themselves because of possible exposure, GOP leaders are now short five Republican votes. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is weighing his next steps on his presidential campaign, also didn't vote. Democrats signaled earlier in the day that the procedural vote could fail. ""It does not appear that there is going to be enough votes to proceed right now,"" said moderate Democrat Doug Jones (Ala.). ""It would be better for Sen. McConnell to just delay, let folks continue, because if we can get a deal done we get it to the floor and get it passed quickly."" According to a senior Democratic aide, the party's concerns with the GOP proposal center on $500 billion for corporations; stock buyback language that can be waived by the Treasury secretary; only a two-year time frame on executive compensation limits; and no provisions to protect individuals from eviction. Democrats also object to what they say is an insufficient amount of money for state and local governments and providing only three months of unemployment insurance. Democrats initially asked for $750 billion in state aid, and Republicans have countered with far less. Schumer and Pelosi are also seeking an additional $200 billion for hospitals and other health-care providers as part of a supplemental government spending bill included in the overall rescue package. The White House had initially sought $48 billion for federal agencies, and Republicans upped that total to $242 billion, including $75 billion for hospitals. Democrats want to further increase it to $450 billion. Senate GOP leaders circulated text of a nearly 580-page bill to senators' offices and K Street before the vote. On Sunday, McConnell met for nearly an hour with Schumer, Pelosi, Mnuchin, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Pelosi indicated afterward that House Democrats didn't support the Senate bill and will forge ahead with their own proposal. “We’ll be introducing our own bill and hopefully it will be compatible,"" Pelosi said after leaving McConnell's office. Pelosi pushed a ""laundry list"" of demands at that meeting, according to a GOP official, including a proposal to wipe off $10,000 from anyone who owns federal student loans, as well as election-security funding. The Republicans countered those issues were not germane to the stimulus debate; Democrats say they have insisted these matters needed to be discussed all along. ""I can tell you what happened — we're continuing to talk,"" Schumer said. Delaying approval of a rescue package could be politically risky for Democrats as the party seeks to win the Senate back. McConnell and President Donald Trump could then hit them for obstruction in the face of a unprecedented public health emergency and economic slowdown. But Democrats said they needed to make a stand, and Pelosi's announcement suggests she is not considering just taking up the Senate bill and passing it through the House on a unanimous consent basis if it were somehow to be passed by the Senate. That also means the House may be forced back into session, even though many lawmakers are concerned about the threat from the coronavirus and the difficulties in reaching Capitol Hill from their home districts. Schumer and Pelosi have stayed in close touch with Mnuchin throughout the negotiations. Pelosi flew back to Washington on Saturday.  While outstanding issues remain, Democrats are expected to get a win with $250 billion allocated to unemployment insurance. In addition, billions are expected to go to hospitals to address the influx of patients due to the pandemic. Schumer has called for a “Marshall Plan” for hospitals. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) also reached an agreement in principle Saturday evening with Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), on the package’s small business provisions. The final deal on small businesses would amount to $350 billion, covering 58 million American workers and more than 30 million small businesses, Rubio tweeted Saturday. Democrats have also pushed for expanded paid leave provisions. But Republicans are showing little interest, with GOP aides noting the House-passed second aid package already included provisions to expand paid sick leave. Republicans are also pushing for $250 billion in direct cash payments to workers. Under the original GOP proposal, individuals and families would receive $1,200 and $2,400 in direct cash payments, depending on their income level. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) have raised concerns that the original language of the provision penalizes lower-income Americans who do not have a taxable income. But Republican aides say the issue will be resolved in the final text.

"America's banks are entering the most severe global crisis since 2008 as a pillar of strength in the economy, and that's giving them a powerful lever to press Congress to relax regulations to keep credit flowing. It's a stunning turn of events after a decade in which banks found their political standing in Washington severely tarnished over their role in unleashing the last financial meltdown and the multibillion-dollar government bailout that followed. With stronger balance sheets and layers of new oversight imposed since the last crisis, the banks are now touting a ""we're here to help"" message — which some delivered personally to President Donald Trump at the White House earlier this month. They're also leaning on lawmakers and regulators to ease rules that they say could limit relief to consumers and small businesses. The effort is bearing fruit. Senate Republicans granted a handful of the banks' key requests in their coronavirus legislation this weekend, which stalled on Sunday, including what could be a vast government backstop of their operations. But the lobbying push is also facing resistance from lawmakers who say they're concerned about the longer-term consequences to the financial system — and note that some of the banks' requests were lobbying priorities well before the emergence of Covid-19. “The height of a pandemic is not the time to tear down rules that protect hardworking families from financial crises,"" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. ""Banks should be pitching in to help their communities and working to keep families afloat, not lobbying Congress for handouts."" Paul Merski, group vice president for congressional relations and strategy at the Independent Community Bankers of America, rejected that argument, saying banks aren't looking for handouts but instead want to see credit flowing to small businesses that are at risk of shutting their doors. ""There are no bank bailouts needed because the banks going into this pandemic are in extremely solid positions, both with capital levels and liquidity levels,"" Merski said. ""This is absolutely not a 2008 situation. It's the reverse."" On Capitol Hill, the current potential legislative vehicle is a ""phase 3"" stimulus package but Congress will likely pass additional legislation to address the economic fallout of the pandemic. Among the industry's asks are recommendations that would let banks more freely dip into their financial buffers and allow more time to comply with a new accounting standard that requires them to immediately record potential losses on their books when they make loans. Some Hill Democrats and watchdog groups were already on alert after one of the industry's lead trade associations — the Bank Policy Institute — published a list of deregulatory recommendations in the early days of the pandemic reaching the U.S. ""That really made it difficult to have an open conversation about the full range of measures that ought to be taken here,"" said Graham Steele, director of the Corporations and Society Initiative at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a former aide to Brown. ""It's made this a hard environment to engage in because there are just concerns that we're only going to get the deregulatory ideas, we're not going to get those other pieces that build the system back up."" But in recent weeks, the nation's largest banks have embarked on a remarkable PR campaign, touting their financial strength and a willingness to help save an economy that Wall Street nearly destroyed 12 years ago. It started with a fully televised White House meeting on March 11 where the CEOs of Bank of America, Citigroup and other banking giants pledged to do their part. They've since made joint promises to temporarily stop buying back their own stock to help free up capital — pausing a controversial practice that mainly helps investors — and to tap into emergency Federal Reserve funding to remove the stigma attached to that and encourage other banks to do the same. ""The Covid-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for the world and the global economy, and the largest U.S. banks have an unquestioned ability and commitment to supporting our customers, clients and the nation,"" eight of the country's biggest banks said via their exclusive trade association, the Financial Services Forum. Banks are now trying to tap into the emerging goodwill with requests to cut red tape. Some of the asks are intended to address logistical challenges as much of America stays at home for potentially months to come. Others are focused on making sure more lenders can participate in federal small-business lending programs that are quickly ramping up and allowing larger businesses to receive the assistance. Some requests target financial safeguards that have been implemented in the years since the crisis. The recommendations vary by type and size of bank, which is typically the case in Washington's finance industry community, and the companies have been jockeying over where to focus their lobbying firepower. Bank representatives said a few consensus items are emerging. One area of focus for banks are regulations governing the capital and liquidity buffers they must maintain to support their operations. Regulators have encouraged the banks to dip into those buffers for lending. But companies want more certainty through concrete legislation or regulation that they will be able to do so. Small banks are lobbying Congress to allow more community lenders to take advantage of streamlined capital requirements. Regional, mid-size and community banks are urging Congress and financial regulators to delay the industry's compliance with a rule that requires lenders to immediately account for potential losses when they issue loans. The thinking behind the rule is that banks should have funds to cover losses earlier in the life of a loan. Banks argue that the required reserves take away resources that could be put toward lending. Some lenders have floated the idea of delaying required stress tests that are designed to gauge the resiliency of banks in a crisis. Some want regulators to temporarily suspend bank examinations. A potential increase of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s deposit insurance limit is also top of mind for some banks. Banks' lobbying efforts paid off this weekend, when Senate Republicans' revealed a coronavirus economic stimulus bill that would give the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. expanded authority to backstop the banking system beyond the traditional $250,000 of insurance it offers depositors. The GOP proposal would allow the FDIC to guarantee the banks' own debt — including that of the biggest Wall Street banks -- and provide an additional guarantee for business transaction accounts used for things like payroll. The measure, which would resurrect authority used by the FDIC during the 2008 meltdown, prompted immediate criticism that Congress was offering a giveaway to Wall Street banks. ""The FDIC is supposed to stand behind Americans' hard-earned deposits, not reward big banks for taking on too much debt,"" Steele said. In addition, the bill would make it easier for small banks to take advantage of less-onerous capital requirements and give lenders a break from complying with the accounting standards that they've argued could inhibit lending during the outbreak. Moderate Democrats are also exploring the ideas. Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) has been soliciting recommendations for how to free up credit by temporarily easing certain bank regulations and intervening in markets. The business-friendly New Democrat Coalition in the House wants Congress to encourage financial agencies to publish regulatory guidance for banks that want to provide forbearance on home mortgage and other consumer loan payments. Industry watchdogs are lobbying against the banks' efforts and looking to further rein in the industry by banning financial firms' payouts to investors via stock buybacks and dividends. ""It would be dangerously counterproductive and irresponsible to weaken the very rules that have made the financial system so much stronger and more resilient,"" Better Markets President Dennis Kelleher said. ""Those rules are why we don’t already have a financial crisis.""",Villains of 2008 try to be the saviors of 2020,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/villains-2008-economy-saviors-2020-143476,politico
"As Senate Democrats went to the floor Sunday night to vote — the first time they’d been there in days — they had one thing on their minds: a secret “slush fund” for Corporate America.  That’s what Democrats are calling a $500 billion “Exchange Stabilization Fund” included in the massive Senate GOP proposal to rescue the U.S. economy from the coronavirus crisis. The fund, which would come under the control of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is designed to aid distressed industries. It includes $58 billion for U.S. airline and air cargo companies, a source of significant controversy during the last three days of closed-door talks between senators of both parties and the White House.  But the language drafted by Senate Republicans also allows Mnuchin to withhold the names of the companies that receive federal money and how much they get for up to six months if he so decides.  That was way too much for Democrats, many of whom lived through the political furor surrounding the 2008 financial-services industry bailout. They remember facing the populist backlash and being pounded by the “Occupy Wall Street” movement. They aren't going to do it again.  “We’re gonna give $500 billion in basically a slush fund to help industries controlled by Mnuchin with very little transparency? Is that what we ought to be doing?” asked Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii.).  “We're not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends,” railed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who made corporate accountability a big part of her White House campaign. “We're here to help workers, we're here to help hospitals. And right now, what the Republicans proposed does neither of those. “  Even moderate West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin lashed out at the Republicans over the lack of controls on the Exchange Stabilization Fund. “It’s throwing caution to the wind for the average person working on Main Street, it’s balls to the walls for the people working on Wall Street,” Manchin declared. “It’s the same ol’ story from Mitch McConnell.” Senate Democrats had other high-profile issues that also led to their Sunday vote to block the stimulus bill. They sought four months of increased unemployment insurance support, but only got three months; they sought hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency funds for hospitals and other health-care providers to combat the coronavirus, yet Republicans budgeted just $75 billion; and they asked for hundreds of billions for a “State Stabilization Fund” to help state and local governments hurt by the looming economic slowdown, while Republicans offered far less.  But the key to the unanimous set of Democratic ‘no’ votes — and what made it easy for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to line them up — was the “slush fund” accusation.  Democrats noted that the Troubled Asset Relief Program — the formal name of the 2008 financial services industry bailout — created a Financial Stability Oversight Board, a Congressional Oversight Panel, a special inspector general and a mandate for periodic review by the General Accountability Office, Congress’ accounting arm. The legislation offered by Senate Republicans includes none of that.  Republicans argued the term “slush fund” was wildly inappropriate in this situation, while also pointing out that the current economic crisis is not at all comparable to 2008. While the banks and Wall Street firms had overextended themselves at that time, companies today are being hurt by a global pandemic that is far beyond their control.  Republicans also say that they have made major concessions to the Democrats on their demands for this stimulus package. Democrats secured $250 billion in additional unemployment insurance payments, which some top Republicans opposed. The $75 billion in new funding for hospitals was a Democratic win as well, although Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) want hundreds of billions more.  Republicans are also pushing for $250 billion in direct cash payments to help struggling workers, as well as hundreds of billions for other programs. All told, it’s by far the most expensive spending bill in American history.  Senate Republicans and the White House defended the structure of the ESF program as drafted, saying they actually built on the lessons of TARP and 2008 in how they created this new initiative.  “The proposal provides desperately needed resources for affected industries and sectors in order to keep people employed and at work,” said Eric Ueland, the White House director of legislative affairs and a former top Senate aide who is closely involved in the negotiations. “This carefully drawn language contains significant pro-taxpayer and pro-consumer protections in a way unprecedented since the invention of these vehicles really 12 years ago.”  Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) pushed for creation of the fund.  “The ‘Phase 3’ package takes precise and targeted measures of relief to particularly distressed industries that are at risk of hemorrhaging jobs and closing down if we don’t,” added Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio). “Think of the airlines that right now have seen their passengers reduced by 80 percent, some say 90 percent. Think of the hotel businesses. Think of the other travel and tourism businesses, entertainment business.”  Republicans also claim that a big problem with the TARP program was that as soon as a company disclosed it received a government loan, it got pounded by investors, which in turn hurt its chances of surviving. That in turn led to even more layoffs. So for this reason, Republicans believe a delay is appropriate between when a loan is received and when it becomes public.  “One of the lessons learned from TARP in 2008 was the concern that companies had about being identified publicly as soon as they accepted TARP assistance,” said a GOP official. “It caused an assumption that those companies might be headed for a terminal event.”  But Democrats weren’t hearing any of that, and as they ramped up their opposition to McConnell’s plan, they pounced on the “slush fund” to try to define the bill before GOP leaders and the White House had a chance to.  “It really isn’t putting workers and small businesses first, and you’ve got a $500 billion slush fund,” complained Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). “I think it’s important to just target it for the people and the businesses. You just don’t throw money out like it’s confetti.”",Dems seize on 'slush fund' to oppose Republican rescue package,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/democrats-slush-fund-republican-rescue-package-143565,politico
"In a flash of virus anxiety and social distancing, American electioneering has moved almost entirely online: Voter townhalls are being replaced by digital meetups, campaign rallies are now streamed speeches and donor one-on-ones are moving to FaceTime. In campaign advertising, that shift was long underway, with money moving from old-school broadcast and print ads to a flurry of custom messages on social media and search engines.  As this change has transformed politics over the past several years, and quickly accelerated in recent weeks, one national player has been noticeably silent: The United States Federal Election Commission. The FEC is the nation’s main watchdog on money in politics, meant to be a check on the unlimited and opaque spending of cash on elections. As political ads have shifted more and more to the digital battlefield, however, the nation’s primary regulator of money in politics has made no real moves to follow it.  The agency is largely bound by law last updated in 2002, back when targeted cable ads were still the cutting edge of political advertising. The last time the FEC updated its rules to address online advertising was in 2006, before Facebook had opened to the general public. More recently it has been paralyzed by an internal argument about whether its mandate should, or shouldn’t, extend further into online campaigning. At the moment, the FEC is unable to update its rules even if it wanted to: Since Republican commissioner Matthew Petersen resigned in August, it has only had three of its six seats filled – one short of the quorum required to revise its rules or even to issue official advice for companies, campaigns and consultants looking for guidance on what’s allowed.  Critics increasingly worry about a political world far outpacing its legal watchdog – a problem only growing more acute as a huge slice of American politics quickly shifts digital. “A lot of people are spending a lot of time online right now,” says Michael Beckel, research director at a bipartisan political reform group Issue One.  “Our 20th century laws, he says, “haven’t kept up with 21st century technologies.” The FEC did look on track to return to a quorum until recently; earlier this month, the Senate held a hearing to confirm James E. “Trey” Trainor III, a would-be commissioner first nominated by Trump back in 2017. The Senate hasn’t scheduled the necessary confirmation votes, and with Congress consumed by coronavirus votes, it’s not clear when that would happen. *** Today, without a quorum and without much to do, the three sitting FEC commissioners fulfill their statutory obligation to meet monthly at their building in Washington’s up-and-coming NoMa neighborhood, catty-corner from a parking lot-turned-beer garden. They meet and discuss the state of enforcement actions launched before last August; without a quorum, they can’t take up any new business. In some ways, the agency’s paralysis is by design. When the FEC was created by Congress in the wake of the 1972 election of Richard Nixon, where donors were said to arrive in D.C. bearing actual bags of actual cash, it was built with a slate of six commissioners intentionally divided evenly on party lines. The goal, for supporters, was to ensure compromise on crucial questions at the heart of democracy—but skeptics suggest that members of Congress wanted a watchdog guaranteed never to be too aggressive. Even against that backdrop, the FEC’s approach to the rise in online politics in the last decades has been notably hands-off. It took a view widely shared by many digital pioneers: that the Internet worked best as a freewheeling place. In politics, that meant upstart candidates could be on more even footing with well-funded incumbents. Conventional wisdom was that it was better for democracy for Americans to battle out their ideas online, without government getting in the way. So while many political TV and radio ads today are required to say who paid for and authorized them — thus the “…and I approve this message…” tagline — online political messaging exists in a gray zone, in practice almost totally unregulated.  The one meaningful exception is a 2006 rulemaking in which the FEC chose to extend its authority over a very small slice of the Internet. Those rules were largely intended to exclude political bloggers from campaign-finance restrictions, but they also for the first time put political ads placed on someone else’s website under the commission’s purview.  While on paper, that category might seem to capture most online advertising, in practice it’s been largely ignored. The FEC offers exceptions to its disclaimer rule for ads where it’s too difficult or impractical for disclaimers to appear, like on giveaway pens or in skywriting; online ads have largely skirted the rules by making similar claims. Are online ads more like TV commercials, or more like pens? The FEC isn’t saying. Meanwhile, the digital ad market is exploding, moving in directions that nobody anticipated in 2006. The Trump campaign has said that counting every slight variation, it ran nearly six million different online ads in 2016. Already in the 2020 campaign, the Trump, Biden, and Sanders campaigns have spent more than $80 million on Facebook and Google ads. In the run-up to Super Tuesday, Bloomberg alone dropped $16 million on ads on those platforms in a single week.  Individual FEC commissioners have made some proposals to help the agency catch up. Democratic Commissioner Ellen Weintraub has pushed for explicit rules requiring more disclosure on the face of digital ads, while chair Caroline Hunter, a Republican, has floated a lighter-touch approach that would require disclaimers but allow ads to display them in different ways, such as pop-ups when a user hovers over an ad. But the commission hasn’t been able to agree on a path forward.  Some opposed to new online ad disclosure rules point to Facebook’s post-2016 moves to adopt some transparency requirements. But, says Weintraub, “it's great if they voluntarily choose to require these kinds of disclaimers, but what if they change their mind tomorrow?”  (Hunter and Democratic-leaning Independent Steven Walther, the other remaining FEC commissioner, didn’t respond to requests to talk for this story.) Over the years, FEC commissioners who have tried to take on digital advertising have quickly learned how tough a fight it can be. After Ann Ravel, Democrat of California, joined the commission in 2013, she started looking into how the FEC might write new rules for the Internet. She got death threats. “Die, fascist, die!,” read one email. At the height of national concern over Russian interference in 2018, the FEC picked up the issue again, and even started the rulemaking process to come up with broad new rules on its authority on the Internet and disclaimers, but it dropped it when public attention died down.  One of the more difficult questions now facing the FEC is what to do about online content that interferes with elections but isn’t clearly a purchased political ad. Online videos can be put together on the extreme cheap, if not arguably for free, to push Americans one way or the other, or just stir up political chaos. In those cases, what role does a commission tasked with enforcing the country’s campaign finance rules have? Russian interference in the 2016 election has made active disinformation a topline worry for many experts; voters are being exposed to a range of questionable online politicking — from fake accounts traced back to Iran to a viral video of a garbled Joe Biden speech clipped to highlight him saying “we can only re-elect Donald Trump” to another spliced to make it look like Trump was calling Covid-19 “a hoax.” The case for disinformation being the FEC’s worry? If it costs something to produce, it’s a case of money influencing American politics, and thus falls under its umbrella. But even Weintraub concedes the FEC may have its hands tied there. “Policing disinformation is a very tricky area for us as a government entity to get into,” she says. “I doubt if it would withstand First Amendment scrutiny if we were to say to the platforms or to broadcasters or anyone else, ‘You have to take that ad down because it contains inaccurate information’,” says Weintraub. “Perhaps the best we can do is to require solid disclosure to make sure everybody knows where the information is coming from.” Weintraub’s workaround on addressing they risks of what she calls “fraudulent news and propaganda,” for now at least, is to gently or not-so-gently encourage the big platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, to figure out their own ways of what addressing the issue. In August, Weintraub put together a session on that and related topics, and asked the social media companies to come, which many did. The quickest way to give the agency more teeth would be for Congress to pass a new law handing the FEC amped-up powers over online ads. A Senate bill called the Honest Ads Act, backed by a bipartisan trio of two Democrats, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mark Warner of Virginia, and South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, would address Russia-style threats by making clear that digital ads have to abide by the same rules as offline ones, but so far hasn’t gotten much traction. (A House version passed as part of a sweeping reform package adopted after Democrats took control of the chamber last year.) Klobuchar, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate committee with oversight of elections, says she’s lost hope that the current Congress will make meaningful changes to how the U.S. conducts elections. She points to a bill on requiring paper ballots which she worked on with Republican James Lankford of Oklahoma but that which was stopped in its tracks by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a long-standing foe of restrictions on campaign spending. “The only answer is to just hope we win big in the presidential election,” says Klobuchar. Critics say that Congress handing the FEC more powers is the only way to equip it to tackle online politics. “I’m going to be a little tongue-in-cheek here, but it’s kind of almost irrelevant if they’re ‘ready’” for the upcoming election, says Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, the advocacy group pushing for campaign finance reform. “They aren’t going to get anything done, in terms of any kind of enforcement action. And they don’t have the legislative authority to do almost anything at all on a lot of the online stuff.” *** Not everyone agrees that the FEC should be taking on a major overhaul of its approach to the Internet. Bradley Smith, a former Republican chairman of the FEC, serving on the commission from 2000 to 2005, says the calls to apply campaign-finance rules to the Internet often start from a place of “hysteria.” He points to the so-called microtargeting of online ads, a practice that Weintraub has argued highlights how dangerous the medium can be. There’s always been microtargeting, says Smith. “If you wanted to reach a certain type of Republican voter, you could advertise in ‘WaterSki Magazine,’” he says, adding, “If you see somebody waterskiing, you can almost bet your house that person is a Republican.” And so, argues Smith, while it might make sense for the FEC to offer some clarity about how its old rules apply online, it shouldn’t invent a new field of rules for the Internet. In the absence of new guidance, tech companies have been winging it, making up policies as new political tactics appear. In January, the Bloomberg campaign tried out a new tactic where it paid prominent Instagram celebrities to post parody text-message exchanges on their accounts meant to draw attention to his candidacy. Were they ads? The spots didn’t explicitly celebrate Bloomberg, and they hadn’t be placed through Instagram’s ad-buying platform. Eventually, Facebook, which owns Instagram, scrambled to tweak its rules to accommodate Bloomberg — allowing once-restricted “branded content” from politicians, as long as they are clearly marked as sponsored posts. At a conference in Washington shortly after Bloomberg rolled out the tactic, Katie Harbath, Facebook’s public policy director for global elections, pointed out that the FEC hadn’t taken meaningful action on the Internet in more than a dozen years. Said Harbath, ""There are always new things, like this branded content work, that we're having to rethink, and think about, 'What should the policies be around here?' — because there's no one else helping us to think about how we need to do that."" As much as she’d love to write new rules, Weintraub says, she doesn’t agree that platforms like Facebook are paralyzed unless the federal government tells them how to behave. “It’s easy for a platform to say, ‘Boy, it would be nice to get some more guidance from the FEC or from Congress,’ knowing that they’re not going to get that. It may be sincere, or it may be a convenient thing for them to say,” she says. And while Weintraub says she’d love the FEC to have a full enough slate of commissioners to do its business, that’s no guarantee that even then it will take action. “Obviously, we couldn’t make any progress over the last six months when we didn’t have a quorum,” she says. “But we honestly weren’t making a lot of progress before that either.”","As Campaigns Move Online, America’s Chief Watchdog Isn’t Following",2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/23/campaigns-move-online-fec-watchdog-141887,politico
"The impeachment furor that consumed Washington for nearly a year has dissipated amid a far more urgent political storm: the coronavirus outbreak.   Any trace of President Donald Trump’s impeachment has vanished from Capitol Hill, cable news and the campaign trail. And long gone is the pervasive sense of anxiety that once gripped vulnerable Democrats after their votes to impeach Trump, which they feared could cost them their seats and possibly control of the House.  Instead, the battle for Congress is more likely to be redefined by a highly infectious and mysterious virus that has spread into every state, pulverized the economy and thrust lawmakers into a crisis-governing mode unseen since the Great Depression.  “It’s always about, ‘What meeting are you going to on the virus?’ or, ‘What are you going to do on the virus bill?’” said Arizona Rep. Tom O’Halleran, one of the many Democrats in Trump-won districts who had been initially reluctant to pursue the president’s impeachment.  “I’ve been through a few decades, and I haven’t seen anything like this,” O’Halleran said of the outbreak, adding that the flood of phone calls he once got on impeachment have subsided.  Democratic campaign officials say the dual threats to public health and the economy have upended an election they worried — and Republicans hoped — would focus on Trump’s impeachment. Campaigning has all but ceased in the traditional sense: Fundraising is down, and campaign officials on both sides say they’re being more careful about when and how to attack their opponents. In a recent memo sent to House Republicans, Tom Emmer, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, accused Democrats of politicizing the novel coronavirus and warned his caucus not to do the same.   “You should not fundraise off coronavirus directly as the Democrats have done,” the Minnesota representative wrote. “Be sensitive that your donors may have suffered financial losses during this pandemic.” Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, who leads the House Democratic campaign arm, said she’s working with the caucus’ most vulnerable members and urging them to follow federal health guidelines to stay safe which, recently, has meant no public gatherings of any kind.  “Nobody knows how long this is going to last,” Bustos told reporters in the Capitol just before the House departed for recess. “And here’s the thing, it’s not like coronavirus hits Dems and not Republicans.”  The economic disaster fueled by the spread of the virus has also become a dominant concern for voters, according to a national poll conducted by the House Democratic campaign arm in mid-March, just as schools and businesses began shutting their doors. Nearly 50 percent of the 2,005 registered voters surveyed said they believed the economy was getting worse, up from 22 percent who felt that way in February, according to the poll obtained by POLITICO. Meanwhile, 28 percent think their own personal economic outlook had worsened. It also showed that 49 percent of people approved of how Democrats in Congress were handling the response, slightly above the 45 percent approval rate for Trump and the 42 approval rate for Republicans in Congress.   Some Democrats privately believe the coronavirus outbreak could create an opening for a more robust debate on health care, perhaps providing for a repeat of the 2018 elections that flipped the House in their favor after Democrats campaigned heavily on that topic.  The national focus on the cost of testing, vaccines and other health issues could dovetail with the message that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee was already pushing. The DCCC’s first major TV ad campaign of the 2020 cycle focused on a prescription drug bill. But others say the political reality on the ground may be more complicated — the election cycle has been frozen at a point when it would normally be gearing up.  “This is just going to dominate American life through Election Day,” said one Democratic strategist who closely tracks House campaigns.  Some have compared it to the 2008 campaign, when the Democratic presidential primary was largely defined by the Iraq War — until Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy in September helped set off a financial collapse that quickly became the dominant issue in that November’s election.  The coronavirus outbreak has halted the lives of millions of Americans, wreaking havoc as layoffs pile up and the death toll mounts. The virus has also had a direct effect on some of the caucus’ most endangered members: Freshman Rep. Ben McAdams has tested positive for the virus and is recovering at his home in Utah.  A half-dozen other “frontline” Democrats announced they are self-quarantining after contact with McAdams, including Reps. Anthony Brindisi of New York, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, and Kendra Horn of Oklahoma.  Still, politics goes on. The GOP’s campaign arm accused New Jersey Rep. Andy Kim of raising money off the coronavirus when the freshman Democrat included a link to his fundraising page announcing the cancellation of his campaign kickoff events. Congressional candidates are relying more heavily on reaching donors via phone. There’s some concern among fundraising teams that their wealthiest supporters might pause donations as financial markets continue to plummet. And some campaigns are questioning how long they can continue to send email solicitations or run online advertisements without seeming tone deaf.  In conference calls over the past week between Democratic House campaigns and allied consultants and outside groups, strategists have been brainstorming ideas for how to fundraise tactfully, according to people familiar with those calls. One Republican, Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, said he would pause fundraising for his reelection. He was one of 40 GOP lawmakers who voted against the House’s coronavirus relief package.  And a Democratic super PAC this week announced it would spend $5 million on digital ads skewering Trump’s response to the coronavirus — marking the party’s first major ad buy related to the outbreak.  The onset of the pandemic has also left some campaigns struggling to find the right tone. House Republicans’ campaign arm has so far embraced an aggressive posture — NRCC taunts to House Democrats have left even some GOP lawmakers wincing — but Emmer in his memo urged caution in campaign communications.   “At times like this you need to ask yourself if your press release or snarky comment are in poor taste,” he wrote.  For the most part, however, the GOP’s lines of attack couldn’t look more different than two months ago, when the nation was affixed to the Senate’s six-day-a-week impeachment trial and the vote to acquit Trump on Feb. 5.  Impeachment had consumed Capitol Hill practically since Democrats took back the House majority after the 2018 midterms. First there was the question of whether to pursue it after Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Then after a whistleblower complaint surfaced in September about Trump’s bid to push Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, it became a matter of when, not if. For the dozens of freshmen representing swing districts, it was a political nightmare. All of a sudden, they were staring down millions of dollars worth of attack ads — which skewered Democrats as attempting to undo the 2016 election instead of delivering for their constituents — when their reelection campaigns had barely begun.  The American Action Network, a nonprofit aligned with GOP leadership, dropped $11 million worth of ads knocking Democrats throughout the fall and early winter, but those have been off the air since early February. Some Democrats said they never expected impeachment to stretch into the 2020 campaign and insist the national frenzy had quieted down shortly after the Senate acquitted Trump.  “I haven’t heard about impeachment since the Senate failed to do its job. People have moved on before coronavirus,” said Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford, who holds a battleground district in the Las Vegas-area.  “I heard a lot about it when it was the issue,” he said of constituents eager to discuss impeachment. “Now they’ve shifted and there’s a lot of concern about what people need to be doing to stay healthy and to make sure that our economy doesn’t decline.”  “Welcome to a 24-hour cable news,” added Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.). “And in two months, we’ll be talking about something else — hopefully — other than coronavirus.”  It’s a whiplash that political operatives say is already familiar, with Congress constantly sputtering to avoid disaster. In 2019 alone, the House saw the longest-ever government shutdown, followed by the Mueller probe and a vote to impeach a president for only the third time in history.  “We’re living in an age when crisis is followed by crisis,” said Rep. Tom Malinowski, who flipped a GOP-held seat in New Jersey in 2018 and faces a stiff reelection challenge from the son of a former governor.  But, the New Jersey Democrat said, Trump’s behavior amid the coronavirus outbreak only strengthened his belief that he made the right choice in voting for the articles of impeachment and that Trump abused his power.  “Some of his reaction and what he says — ‘I didn’t want the people off that boat because I like the numbers where we are’ — that reminds me of the president we impeached. Because, again, it’s about thinking of the self-interest ahead of the nation.”",Coronavirus upends the battle for the House,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/coronavirus-upends-battle-for-house-137888,politico
"The 2008 financial crisis reshaped American politics, birthing a politics of outrage in the Tea Party on the right and an enduring strain of progressive populism on the left. The coronavirus is already on a similar trajectory, triggering massive prospective bailouts and other policy proposals that stand to rewire the Republican and Democratic parties for a generation — or longer. Last week, Republicans joined Democrats — and in some cases got in front of them — in calling for direct payments to Americans to help cope with the economic fallout from the pandemic. The Trump administration, after laboring for years to repeal Obamacare, said it was considering creating a special enrollment period for the program due to the coronavirus. When Donald Trump himself suggested the government could take equity stakes in private companies that receive federal aid, it was a Democratic governor, Colorado’s Jared Polis, who accused the president of being a socialist. The immediate effects of the pandemic on blurring the parties’ ideological distinctions have been acute — and the virus’ toll still remains far from reaching its peak. “It’s crazy,” said Kelly Dietrich, founder of the National Democratic Training Committee, which trains candidates across the country. “Up is down, north is south.” Or as Mike Madrid, a longtime Republican strategist in California, put it, “It’s kind of nuts.” He said, “We are in for extraordinary change.” Over the weekend, Republicans and Democrats neared a deal on a rescue package that could cost at least $1.6 trillion, the most expensive such package in U.S. history. Bipartisan support for such a measure has been heralded by Democrats as an endorsement of expansive government intervention — in large part because elements of the spending, including $250 billion in direct payments to Americans, are now a priority of Republicans. Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a former Agriculture secretary in the Obama administration, said in an email that the “song of ‘government is the problem not the solution’ and the ‘era of big government is over’ may not be [an] underlying theme from this point forward.” And former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said “some of the issues that are being proposed and voted on now are going to become the norm in our political system, both with Republicans and Democrats.” He predicted that new normal including paid sick leave, and even guaranteed income of some kind. “In other words,” Richardson said, “the era of big government is back, and both parties are going to embrace it to resolve problems. And [the change] is caused by the virus.” Republicans, too, see this shift unfolding. As negotiations over a rescue picked up in Washington last week, it was Republicans pressing for direct cash assistance to Americans, irritating progressive Democrats who feared the GOP was out-flanking the Democratic Party on the left. As the two sides maneuvered, Sal Russo, a former Ronald Reagan aide and Tea Party Express co-founder, recalled the speeches he gave years ago about the esteem of the federal government swelling amid the New Deal and through the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, before eroding in recent generations. Now, he said, “You’ve got the federal government … doing good deeds again. Russo predicted Congress will “get excessive” in its coronavirus response. But he said most Americans will see its involvement positively and that “this may be a boost for the role of the federal government.” “In some ways,” he said, “the promoters of big government should hope Trump is a hero.” The prospect of upheaval isn’t an abstract notion. The 9/11 terrorist attacks — and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that resulted from them — spurred an anti-interventionist movement that led to Barack Obama’s nomination in 2008 and still resonates within the Democratic Party. The financial disaster in 2008 conceived not only the Tea Party, but an Occupy Wall Street movement that shifted the national conversation around economic inequality and the “1 percent” — catalyzing the rise of the populist progressive wing of the Democratic Party. But unlike many past crises, the coronavirus pandemic has caused turmoil in the economy, public health and politics all at once. The death toll is rising. The stock market is in freefall. The virus has consumed Trump’s presidency and his re-election prospects, and it has all but frozen the Democratic presidential primary in time. “Parties go back and forth, and they change somewhat,” said Ron Kaufman, the Republican National Committee treasurer and a former adviser to George H.W. Bush. “And this is going to be a big change.” Kaufman said the longer-lasting effect of the pandemic may not be a sustained appetite to spend, but an eventual “sea change” politically as fiscal conservatives attempt to reconcile debt from the coronavirus response. “That will change our foreign policy viewpoint, it will change our military viewpoint … It’s going to change how we look at our place in the world,” Kaufman said. The effect of the pandemic, he said, is that “both parties are going to have to – we’re going to have to come to the left and they’re going to have to come to the right a little bit.” That the parties are coming together at all on major legislation is, of itself, a remarkable turn from the intransigence that has defined Washington since Trump won election in 2016 and Democrats regained control of the House two years later. Joe Lieberman, the former Connecticut senator, described the current landscape in Washington as an “extremely partisan time, ideologically divided time in our government — worse than 2008 and 2009 by far, I’m afraid.” Still, Republicans and Democrats are “coming together to get things done,” he said, adding that “if it works — which I hope and believe it will, if they do enough quickly enough — maybe there won’t be a dominant counter-reaction among Democrats or Republicans left or right.” Yet already, the pandemic has emboldened Democrats’ calls for more comprehensive health care and employee benefits, with the crisis laying bare not only shortcomings within the nation’s health care system, but the precariousness of Americans’ financial condition. Retirement accounts have been ravaged and unemployment claims are soaring. David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said the pandemic has exposed “just that the current state of affairs just leaves so many Americans living right on the edge of disaster, and we’d heard these studies for years.” “This just bears this out,” he said. “It tells you what an unstable status quo we’re living in to start … That is something that might reframe politics for a long time.” Progressive Democrats, anticipating a recession and high rates of unemployment, are preparing to use the coronavirus pandemic to draw their party to the left on economic policy, attempting to broaden support for a Green New Deal as a way to spur employment while decarbonizing the economy. And they are watching party leaders closely in negotiations for the rescue package — and demanding constraints on corporations that receive federal aid, as well as guarantees for the working class. Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the liberal political action committee Democracy for America, said “We’re in a moment right now where obviously one of the long-term impacts of the coronavirus is likely to be a complete restructure of our economy.” If there is a time for that, this would appear to be it. Three congressmen have tested positive for the coronavirus. Democratic primaries are being postponed, and the likely nominee, Joe Biden, has been reduced to a character on a livestream. “What we’re seeing now,” said Madrid, the Republican strategist, is representative democracy’s “inability to deal with societal fragmentation.” In the same way that the music, food and media industries have been upended during the past 20 years, he said, broad cultural shifts are “just now hitting the last social institution, which is representative government.” The country will soon “find other ways of voting and engaging civically,” Madrid said. The coronavirus, he said, may be “the accelerant.”",‘Extraordinary change’: How coronavirus is rewiring the Republican and Democratic parties,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/coronavirus-rewiring-republican-democratic-parties-141298,politico
"A bipartisan chorus of outrage has erupted over news that Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) sold up to $1.72 million in stock at a moment when he was receiving daily briefings on the coronavirus and at the same time publicly downplaying its potential threat. On the surface, the conflict between Burr’s public and private activity looks suspicious. While Burr’s activity should be condemned, the charge leveled by many critics—that he engaged in illegal insider trading—is more complicated than it first appears. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which polices the stock markets, needs to determine whether there is enough evidence to prove that Burr broke the law. From my experience investigating insider cases, proving that he broke the law won’t be easy, but there is more than enough evidence to warrant a serious investigation. As NPR reported on Thursday, in a private luncheon on Feb. 27, Burr told a nonpartisan group of businesses and organizations from North Carolina that the coronavirus is “more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history.” On the same day Burr made those statements, President Donald Trump publicly downplayed the threat posed by the virus, stating that “like a miracle, it will disappear.” Burr did not contradict the president’s remarks publicly. But two weeks earlier, on Feb. 13, he had sold between $628,000 and $1.72 million of his stock holdings in 33 separate transactions, including holdings in two major hotel chains. As ProPublica noted when it broke the story, Burr was receiving daily coronavirus briefings around this time, and U.S. intelligence reports from that period warned about a likely pandemic. Eleven days after Burr sold the stocks, the market began an extremely sharp decline and by Friday had lost approximately a third of its value. Even Trump allies Tucker Carlson and Charlie Kirk have joined Democrats to call for Burr to resign. That reaction was justified, because regardless of whether Burr’s actions meet the technical legal requirements of insider trading, his obligation was to warn the public rather than protect his own portfolio. But calls for Burr’s prosecution for insider trading are premature, because it won’t be an easy case to prove. The law governing it is relatively new and untested, and long experience shows that it’s very difficult to separate the kind of knowledge you might get in a Congressional hearing from info that any close reader could get from the news. Insider trading is when someone learns of “material, nonpublic information” and uses that to trade stock. That means that the trader knew something the public didn’t know, which can sometimes give the trader a big advantage over the public. It sounds shocking but insider trading by senators and members of Congress was legal until the passage of the STOCK Act of 2012, which was enacted to prohibit members of Congress from “using nonpublic information derived from their official positions for personal benefit.” Ironically, Burr was one of only three Senators to vote against the STOCK Act. It was passed after public reports that members of Congress profited off the Great Recession. For example, a day after receiving a private briefing on the collapsing economy and financial system from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, then-Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL) shorted the market by buying options that would rise if the market tanked. A few days later, after the market plunged, he sold his position and nearly doubled his money. Burr also panicked during that period. In 2008, after hearing the then-Treasury secretary speak, Burr reportedly told his wife to “go to the A.T.M.” and “draw out everything it will let you take.” Burr’s stock sales last month look like the sort of activity that the STOCK Act was intended to prohibit. But the statute is very new. It has been enforced only once, and only then in a case that involved a member of Congress acting on information specific to an individual company. Prior insider trading cases were against corporate insiders, not governmental “insiders” under the STOCK Act, so you could expect Burr, if he were prosecuted, to argue that the law should be struck down or narrowed. But even if the law held up, there would be challenges for any investigator probing Burr’s conduct. To prove Burr engaged in insider trading, the government would have to prove that he had information that—if the public knew it as well—would have caused a significant change in the price of stocks that he sold. That will involve an investigator closely looking at the details of the private briefings Burr received to find some piece of information that was not known by the public that was so important that it would have changed stock prices. It’s worth noting that despite Trump’s attempt to mislead the public, there was a lot of public information available at that time about the general threat of the coronavirus. It’s no surprise Burr now claims he “closely followed CNBC’s daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus at that time,” and relied “solely on public news reports.” Burr may also ultimately argue that the private information he had was not “material” because there was no way he would have known it would have caused a significant change in price in the particular stocks that he sold. Burr could make a plausible argument that he couldn’t have predicted that a recession would send the stock market tumbling. Nevertheless, there is more than enough here to warrant a full investigation by the SEC. Burr has self-reported to the Senate Ethics Committee, presumably to fend off an investigation by the SEC or Department of Justice. But an ethics committee probe should not be a substitute for an investigation by professionals at the SEC. Some have called for a criminal investigation by the Justice Department, which would face a higher bar because it would need to prove Burr’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Often, the SEC and DOJ work in parallel to investigate conduct as both a civil and criminal matter. When I investigated financial crimes like insider trading as a federal prosecutor, we frequently followed after the SEC began its own investigation. Given the hurdles faced by investigators, the SEC is a reasonable place to start. Since the report of Burr’s stock sales, Senators Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and James Inhofe (R-OK) have come under scrutiny for reportedly selling stock during the same period. Each of them have offered a better public explanation than Burr did. For example, Loeffler, a former executive at a major U.S. exchange, claims that her investments decisions were made by third parties without her knowledge or involvement. Given the intense public outcry over these stock sales, it is in the public interest for the SEC to look at all of this, including the trades by the other three senators. But unless the public statements by the other senators are false, the only senator who merits a serious, long-term investigation is Burr. Obstacles exist to holding Burr accountable legally, but his disturbing actions warrant more than an ethics committee review.",Why Burr’s Stock Sales Are Easier to Condemn than Prosecute ,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/23/richard-burr-stocks-trading-coronavirus-prosecute-142976,politico

"BERLIN — Now things are really serious. The news late Sunday that Chancellor Angela Merkel has gone into quarantine after a physician she recently saw tested positive for coronavirus has pushed the already-jittery German nation one step closer to nervous-breakdown territory. There’s no indication Merkel, 65, who was exposed when the doctor gave her a pneumococcus vaccine (in line with German government recommendations for people her age) has the virus. Still, if there’s one thing that’s given Germans solace amid the tumult in recent weeks, it’s that Merkel, the “forever chancellor” who has led the country through thick and thin for the past 15 years, is still at the helm. Even Merkel’s detractors acknowledge she’s a safe pair of hands in uncertain times, having led the country through the financial implosion of 2008-2009, the eurozone debt crisis that began in 2010 and the refugee influx of 2015. Merkel was Germany’s most popular politician before coronavirus hit and there’s little reason to expect her calm stewardship over the past couple of weeks has done anything but bolster Germans’ confidence in her. Though she remains in charge — Merkel’s spokesman said in a statement that she will continue to work from home — Germany (and Europe) now face the prospect of navigating the pandemic without her. And there’s plenty to do. In the coming days, Germany’s parliament is expected to rush through a series of emergency measures designed to keep the economy from cratering. At the center of the plan is a proposed supplementary budget worth more than €150 billion on top of the regular budget of €362 billion. In addition, the government is planning to clear the way for €400 billion in loans to struggling businesses and hundreds of billions more in credit guarantees for larger companies. The pandemic crisis has dried up business for thousands of firms, small and large, in recent weeks. “It is important to send a clear and strong signal,” Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said over the weekend. Scholz, a Social Democrat who is also vice chancellor, would likely take over Merkel’s responsibilities, at least on a temporary basis, if she were incapacitated. The decision would rest in the hands of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The government’s planned crisis measures underscore just how severe Berlin expects the economic impact of the coronavirus to become. The increased spending will force the government to break the biggest taboo in German politics by sacrificing the country’s balanced budget — the so-called schwarze Null, or “black zero.” Doing so will require the ruling coalition — which includes Merkel’s center-right Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats — to trigger an emergency clause in the constitution allowing the government to spend more than 0.35 percent of gross domestic product, which totaled €3.44 trillion in 2019. Merkel’s Cabinet is expected to approve the plans Monday, followed by a vote in the Bundestag on Wednesday. Lifting Germany’s so-called debt brake, however, requires a majority of MPs (355 of 709) to be present. Party leaders, including from the opposition Greens and Free Democrats, were scrambling over the weekend to ensure a quorum. Though much maligned abroad in recent years, Germany’s parsimony has arguably put it in a better position than any other country to weather the current storm. The country has recorded a budget surplus for the past five years. Given German debt yields are currently in negative territory (meaning investors are paying to hold the country’s bonds thanks to Germany’s solid credit history), Berlin can effectively borrow money for free. At least for now. As has happened in much of the rest of Europe — and the world at large — the German economy is grinding to a halt. Major manufacturers, including Volkswagen and Mercedes, have closed factories and sent workers home. Tourism and retail are at a standstill. Virtually no aspect of the economy outside the public sector and food production has been spared the current crisis. On Sunday, just before Merkel went into quarantine, she announced a further tightening of controls on Germans’ freedom of movement and mandatory closures for many non-essential businesses, including restaurants and cafés, which had remained opened during daylight hours. The government is betting the tougher rules — which stop short of an outright house arrest while discouraging people from leaving home — will save lives by slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Even so, the new regulations will deal a further blow to Europe’s biggest economy. As of Sunday, more than 24,000 people in Germany had contracted the virus. Though the pace of new infections has decelerated slightly over the past four days, the country is far from overcoming the crisis, health officials say. The number of coronavirus deaths in Germany so far is just under 100 but is expected to rise substantially in the coming weeks. Government-imposed shutdowns across Germany’s 16 Länder, or states, in recent days already forced the closure of most aspects of public life, including most shops as well as museums and hotels. Many economists are already predicting a deeper downturn for Germany than at the height of the Lehman Brothers crisis in 2009, when the economy shrank by nearly 5 percent in a single quarter. “It’s clear that economic activity in Germany is going to fall dramatically in the coming weeks,” Commerzbank economists said in a note to clients over the weekend. The bank projects a decline in economic output of 3.5 percent in the first quarter and a further drop of 7.5 percent in the second quarter. Trouble is, no one knows what happens after that. While some economists are projecting a rebound in the second half of the year, that optimistic scenario depends on a halt in the spread of a virus that has so far defied most predictions. Former German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück, who led the effort to preserve the country’s banking system in the wake of the Lehman bankruptcy, said the coronavirus posed an even greater threat to the German economy in terms of its breadth. He encouraged the government to use the “high-caliber” weapons in its arsenal to stave off a collapse. “This crisis is much more existential than what we experienced in the financial crisis in 2008-2009,” he said, predicting a much deeper downturn than in 2009. “We shouldn’t kid ourselves.”",Germany forced to ponder coronavirus battle without Merkel,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/germany-forced-to-ponder-coronavirus-battle-without-merkel-143749,politico

"Democrats tore themselves asunder this primary season over whether to abandon Obamacare for “Medicare for All.” Yet if history is any lesson, the health care law marking its 10th anniversary on Monday will evolve and, in time, grow more generous. Incrementalism — which is either a curse word or pathway to progress in the nomination fight between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden — has been the norm for the big three entitlements: Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. All cover more people, in more kinds of circumstances, more generously than they did at their creation. For instance, neither Medicare nor Medicaid, enacted in 1965, covered disabled people until 1972; now they make up 15 percent of the people covered. In Social Security’s early years, the program left out farm and domestic workers — who were disproportionately African American, although historians argue over whether the policy was intentionally discriminatory. What Obamacare’s next step looks like will depend on the fall elections — and perhaps whether the coronavirus pandemic, which has made vivid the gaps and inequities in a system where even the insured could face big financial obstacles to care, deepens Americans’ appetite for fixing health care. Gradual change over time is what the authors of the Affordable Care Act envisioned when President Barack Obama signed it into law on March 23, 2010, following a bruising legislative battle that saw Democrats sacrifice more ambitious plans like single-payer or a public option.  “When we were doing the Affordable Care Act, we didn’t think we had the final solution to all our health care coverage problems. We thought it was a big piece of what needed to be done, the most major step we’d taken in coverage since 1965” said retired Rep. Henry Waxman, who helped write and ensure passage of the ACA as the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The law didn’t cover everyone or do everything, and Republicans have spent a decade attacking it as heavy-handed, excessively complicated and way too expensive. But Democrats counter that it protected people with preexisting conditions, provided a guaranteed package of basic benefits — now including coronavirus testing — and insurance subsidies for millions of Americans. “It was a product of 70 years of learning what’s possible to do at a national level and what’s not possible,” said David Blumenthal, a health official in the Obama administration who now runs the Commonwealth Fund and who co-authored a book on presidents and health policy. Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.), who oversaw the creation of a national insurance program for children as President Bill Clinton’s health secretary after his more ambitious health reform effort collapsed, described the ACA as an “operational platform,” a foundation for moving to covering everyone. Given the decade of rancor, there are no guarantees for Obamacare. The Supreme Court has just agreed to hear another case, backed by President Donald Trump, that could dismantle the whole law — including the popular parts like protecting preexisting conditions. And the GOP hasn’t given up its pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, even if it has given up explaining how it might do so. But the law appears more secure than in its early days. Polls show the ACA has recently hit record levels of support following the GOP’s failed drive to upend the entire law, elimination of the unpopular individual mandate penalty and the right’s new focus on torpedoing Medicare for All. The rush by numerous Obamacare-friendly states to reopen enrollment in the past week demonstrated the law's potential as a safety net in a time of a major health crisis. A drive for further change could supercharge Medicare for All proposed by Sanders. Or it could take the shape of some kind of public option, a voluntary, government-run program that would compete with private insurers, or various proposals to boost insurance subsidies or allow people to buy in to government programs. Either would be a political lift, given the health care industry’s organized opposition against an expanded role for government. Princeton historian Julian Zelizer notes that even health proposals deemed too “incremental” by progressives are always labeled “socialized medicine” by their foes. “Medicare was incremental — and it was attacked as socialized medicine. Both the Clinton plan and the ACA were seen as incremental ... but were attacked as huge government takeovers,” he said. “I don’t think the incremental approach really stops the attacks.” But all the other big entitlements were hard to enact — and eventually grew. Social Security, which is now universal and almost universally popular, began as a program for industrial and commercial workers — just about half the labor force, according to Ed Berkowitz, a professor emeritus at George Washington University and historian of social welfare policy. In addition, there was a five-year gap between when people started paying taxes into Social Security, in 1937, and when they started getting benefits back in 1942. “It was financed in a pretty unpopular way,” Berkowitz said. In a story that may be familiar to anyone who has followed the travails of the ACA, Social Security faced legislative battles, political attacks and litigation before finally becoming a broadly popular American program. But gradually, more people got covered under a series of new laws and expansions. By the early 1950s, it was well on the path to being universal. While Social Security grew, the fight for broader health coverage stagnated. President Franklin Roosevelt never pushed much for it, as he created much of what became the social safety net during the Depression. President Harry Truman did make a bid for national health insurance, and it roundly failed. By 1965, the moment came for Medicare and Medicaid. Both were breakthroughs — and both were much smaller than they are today. Lawmakers kept expanding Medicare over the coming decades: coverage for the disabled and end-stage kidney disease in the 1970s, hospice care in the early 1980s and a prescription drug benefit in 2003. Along the way, an attempt to add catastrophic care was enacted and quickly became one of the few benefit expansions ever to be repealed, because beneficiaries who bore the cost rebelled. A private insurance alternative, Medicare Advantage, was initially championed by Republicans but now has broader support. Medicaid, which got far less attention back when it was enacted, has grown to cover millions of more people than Medicare — and could continue to rise if coronavirus pushes the country into recession. The program, initially tied to cash assistance, over the years added more low-income families, pregnant women, long-term care and poor adults through a still-incomplete state-based expansion under Obamacare. As Medicaid began to be perceived as a health program, separated from its welfare-related roots, it became easier for policymakers to grow it, said Diane Rowland, who ran the Medicaid program at the Kaiser Family Foundation for many years. “There was always some kind of societal need that we could document,” said Rowland. That led Congress to add coverage, for instance to pregnant women to prevent maternal deaths and boost prenatal care. And in 1996, the Children’s Health Insurance Program was created for the working poor and lower middle class. Building on and then going beyond Medicaid, it provided close to universal health care for U.S. children. It was also arguably the most bipartisan health move in recent decades, one reason it remains popular. It seems hard to imagine anything similarly bipartisan in the near future, no matter how the 2020 elections turn out. Not everyone has abandoned hope of progress — whether it’s called incremental or evolutionary. “The American people are much more generous and much more united on the issue of insurance than are their elected officials,” said Blumenthal, the Commonwealth Fund head. “I think we believe that everyone should get the care they need when they need it. We disagree on how to accomplish it.”","For Obamacare’s next act, look to the history books",2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/obamacare-next-act-history-books-142164,politico

"The Federal Reserve on Monday announced aggressive new emergency measures to support the economy and ensure that credit flows to households and businesses as the country faces the prospect of a deep downturn from the coronavirus pandemic. The central bank is committing to buy as many U.S. government bonds and mortgage-backed securities as needed “to support smooth market functioning.” The announcement comes after Congress Sunday night failed to reach agreement on a massive stimulus package that would offer direct support to consumers and small businesses, as well as set aside funds to bail out larger companies. The stock market had looked poised to plunge when it opened Monday in reaction to the gridlock in Washington, but futures pared their losses after the central bank’s move. The Fed's actions — along with other lending programs, significant cash injections into funding markets and zero percent interest rates — make up the most extreme intervention in the economy by the central bank in its more than 100-year history. The Fed is launching three emergency lending facilities, including two that will buy corporate debt. The third is a revival of an emergency program the central bank created during the 2008 financial crisis that will lend to banks against collateral that includes bundled student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and small-business loans. These facilities are designed to support $300 billion in new credit, and the Treasury Department will kick in $30 billion to help cover losses. The Fed also said it will soon start up a program designed “to support lending to eligible small-and medium sized businesses, complementing efforts” by the Small Business Administration. “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support households, businesses, and the U.S. economy overall in this challenging time,” the central bank’s rate-setting committee said in a statement. “The coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world.” “Our nation’s first priority is to care for those afflicted and to limit the further spread of the virus,” it added. “While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions. Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.”",Fed announces vast new emergency effort to boost economy,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/fed-coronavirus-economy-143793,politico

"Senate Democrats are rushing to finish negotiations with the Trump administration on a massive $1.6 trillion-plus emergency rescue package as the coronavirus spreads and markets continue to dive. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke late into Sunday evening about the terms of the legislation and are meeting again Monday morning, along with White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland, to restart talks. On his way into the meeting, Mnuchin said he hoped to see a vote on Monday but declined to offer details on the state of the bill.   The slew of meetings and conversations comes after a vote to move forward on the GOP’s $1.6 trillion-plus package failed Sunday evening on the Senate floor, with Democrats denying Republicans the 60 votes needed. Democrats are arguing that the Republican proposal does not do enough to prioritize workers over corporations.   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will hold the same procedural vote Monday at noon, after originally planning for the vote at 9:45 a.m. shortly after the markets open.   One of the outstanding issues for Democrats is the $500 billion “Exchange Stabilization Fund,” which is designed to assist industries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus, including $58 billion for the airline industry. The GOP proposal would mostly prevent companies that accept the money from buying back their own stock. But that restriction could be waived by the Treasury Secretary — a source of significant contention for Democrats.  Democrats are also arguing that the package doesn’t do enough to prevent layoffs and that a two-year time frame on executive compensation limits is not enough.  In addition, Democrats are pushing for unemployment provisions to last four months instead of three and include independent contractors, hundreds of billions for both hospitals and a “State Stabilization Fund” to assist states with loss of revenue and expanded provisions for more worker protections.  But Republicans argue that the proposal they put forward is bipartisan, and already includes significant concessions on unemployment insurance and $75 billion for hospitals. In addition to those provisions, the proposal allocates $350 billion for small businesses, and would cover an estimated 58 million U.S. workers and more than 30 million small businesses, according to Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).  The GOP package also includes $1,200 in direct cash payments to individuals, including to Americans with no taxable income. The payments would be phased out for individuals who earn more than $75,000.  McConnell chastised Democrats Sunday evening for blocking the proposal from moving forward and accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) of interfering in the negotiations.  McConnell, Schumer, Pelosi, Mnuchin and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) met in McConnell’s office on Sunday, but Pelosi left the meeting saying that the House would draft its own bill.   The White House has called for final passage of the package by Monday, but it’s unclear if that goal remains feasible.",Senate scrambles to finish coronavirus package by end of day,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/senate-coronavirus-rescue-package-143799,politico

"As the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. soared past 400 on Sunday, President Donald Trump reassured Americans that everything would be OK and that it would all be over soon. Even as he acknowledged the novel coronavirus as an invisible enemy that’s attacking more than 140 countries, the self-proclaimed wartime president predicted “a great victory” in America. “It’s gonna be a victory that, in my opinion, will happen much sooner than originally expected,” Trump said. In a 90-minute news conference with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Trump rattled off the number of supplies the federal government had sent to New York, California and Washington, where a combined 242 people have died from the virus. The list of materials included respirators, surgical masks, gowns, coveralls and gloves. The high volume of items being sent to some of the nation’s hot spots highlights the severity of the threat that the nation and the world face. Hospitals are warning of shortages of materials, including a lack of hospital beds and protective equipment. Meanwhile, governors across the country have closed schools, restaurants, bars and other venues in an effort to slow the spread of the virus, which has surged to beyond 33,000 cases in the U.S. Some leaders have gone so far as to order residents to shelter in place or meet a curfew. The threat has even infiltrated Congress, where three members have contracted the virus and several others are self-quarantining at home. Two congressmen and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky have tested positive in recent days. The disclosure of Paul’s diagnosis on Sunday quickly led to at least two Senate Republicans, Mitt Romney and Mike Lee of Utah, choosing to self-quarantine, leaving the GOP with a slim 48-47 majority. Trump said he believed the infected members would “all be fine” and mocked Romney, who crossed party lines earlier this year and supported his impeachment. “Romney’s in isolation?” Trump said. “Gee, that’s too bad.” The president told reporters he didn’t see any threats to a $1.6 trillion emergency rescue package, even if several Republican members were unable to vote on the legislation while they isolate themselves at home. “It’ll all work out,” he insisted, moments after a procedural vote on the bill failed. In a broad mix of remarks, Trump also argued that the country was “very united,” warned that the virus would’ve been “catastrophic” if not for the massive tax cuts he signed into law in 2017, claimed the presidency had personally cost him billions of dollars, complained that no one thanked him for refusing a presidential salary, predicted the economy would “skyrocket once this is over,” touted his Department of Veterans Affairs for having “the highest poll numbers in the history of the” VA and suggested that none of his predecessors could tell him anything life-saving if he sought their advice. “I have the best people in the world,” Trump said. “Look at the approval numbers on the job we’re doing. I think we’re doing an incredible job, so I don’t want to disturb them, bother them. I don’t think I’m gonna learn much. And, you know, I guess you could say there’s probably a natural inclination not to call. Now if I felt that if I called, I’d learn something, and that would save one life — it would save one life, OK? — I would make the call in 10 minutes, but I don’t see that happening.” Trump said he had a great relationship with Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gavin Newsom of California, who are both Democrats. But he was critical of the news media, telling one reporter “you asked a nasty question” and another that her question sounded like it was “100 percent wrong.” He also expressed optimism that a drug used to treat malaria could be a cure for the coronavirus, remarking that there were “tremendous signs it could work.” “Why should we be testing it in a test tube for a year and a half when we have thousands of people that are very sick?” Trump asked. “They’re very, very sick, and we can use it on those people and maybe make them better and in some cases maybe save their lives.” “We think it might work on this, based on evidence, based on very strong evidence. We’re gonna see. We’re gonna know sometime after Tuesday,” he added. “I don’t wanna get anybody over-excited, but I’m very excited by that, by the prospect of it.” Trump’s rhetoric on the drug is at odds with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In an interview on Sunday morning on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Fauci said Trump had been “trying to bring hope to the people” by promoting the drug. “But my job is to prove definitively from a scientific standpoint that they do work,” he said, explaining their differing views. “I was taking a purely medical, scientific standpoint.”",Trump predicts victory over coronavirus ‘much sooner’ than expected,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/trump-predicts-victory-coronavirus-143459,politico
"How do you send money en masse to people in the midst of a pandemic? In a world roughly remade by virus every few days, the federal government’s desperate attempt to shore up a plummeting economy changes shape by the hour. But one partial solution has surged to the fore: sending money directly to Americans. There’s precedent for the idea: The U.S. sent money out to most households during the 2001 and 2008 recessions. But as the government tries to move at warp speed this time around, plenty of question marks remain about the tradeoffs between rapidity and accuracy. Every day it takes to pass the bill matters. And no one really knows what new wrinkles the coronavirus might add. A Treasury Department spokesman declined to comment for this article, and negotiations are still in flux. But here’s how former officials and experts expect the process to work — and how you might end up with thousands more dollars in your bank account within weeks. In the Republicans’ initial bill text, the IRS would take the lead, tapping a master file of this year’s and last year’s tax filers’ personal and bank information. Unlike in 2008, most people now get their refunds via electronic direct deposit, so sending them money is simple. Once the IRS sends its file to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the payments can move fast, said Dick Gregg, a former fiscal assistant Treasury secretary and head of what’s now the Fiscal Service. But the GOP proposal tanked Sunday night over Democratic opposition to other provisions of the bill. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are now working on a new version. Even if they preserve the new payments, there are still a few wrinkles to iron out. “All of this is nifty,” said former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, “but you don’t get the people who don’t file.” Coordinating across agencies, the government can also access information for people who haven’t filed taxes but already receive payments in the form of Social Security or Veterans Affairs benefits. A trickier task is reaching the portion of Americans who neither make enough money to file taxes nor receive those other benefits — “the new working class,” as Chuck Marr, senior director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, put it. A single dishwasher without kids, a home health aide: Not only are these people among the most vulnerable to the current economic shock, they’re also easier to miss. Electronic benefits transfer cards for people who receive food stamps and other cash assistance are one way to find them. That could require coordination with state governments to deliver the payments, said Jack Smalligan, a senior policy fellow at the Urban Institute who spent nearly three decades at the Office of Management and Budget. But too much delay in figuring out who should get a check could hold up the entire process. “Speed is of the essence at this time,” argued Michael Graetz, a law professor at Columbia and Treasury official in the George H.W. Bush administration. “And then if there are gaps or people didn’t get it, there should be a number to call that allows you to say that you didn’t get it.” Starting payments by April 6, as Mnuchin originally proposed, would be much faster than in 2008, when the IRS took two months to send out the first checks. That’s assuming, of course, that the president signs the bill this week. And how the coronavirus will affect the process remains to be seen. At the IRS, where budget and staff cuts have shrunk the agency over several years, social distancing measures for employees could slow things down more. The agency announced Friday it was closing Taxpayer Assistance Centers until further notice, which could impede elderly and low-income people’s ability to file taxes quickly. If Americans are stuck at home, those who receive physical checks may be less likely to cash them. That’s one reason sending prepaid debit cards might be a better alternative, said David Kamin, an NYU law professor and Obama OMB official. Many outstanding questions remain about Congress’ bill and the administration’s implementation of it. How will the IRS manage the payments while also handling a filing season that just got extended three months? Will the payments happen in both April and May, as Treasury proposed? Or just once, in April, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s original package envisioned? Will they be tiered based on income (one of the most politically contentious elements), or universal? And in the face of new opposition last week from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and other Republicans, will they even happen at all? McConnell’s proposal laid out up to $1,200 in “recovery rebates” for Americans who make up to $75,000 a year, double that for couples and extra for families with children. Payments would have phased out for those with higher incomes and cut off at those who make $99,000 annually. But there remains uncertainty about how the final bill text will shake out. Democratic and Republican leaders have mostly favored a tiered approach, though there was disagreement over whether low-income people who have paid less in taxes should receive less. But experts who favor the payments said a universal approach may be best to get the money out quickly. “The issue is not so much how to stimulate employment but rather how to help people over a period where lower-than-normal employment is the right course” due to social distancing, said Greg Mankiw, a Harvard professor who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. “Targeting means it’s probably going to delay things.” Hong Kong last month announced it would give each of its roughly 7 million adult permanent residents the equivalent of $1,280. Mattie Duppler, a senior fellow at the National Taxpayers Union, suggested that the government could send payments universally now — to maximize speed — and then means-test them later, clawing back the money from some people on next year’s tax returns. Some experts warned, though, that Congress should think through unintended consequences. Extra cash could push some people over a benefits cliff, for example, meaning the one- or two-time infusion would suddenly push their incomes just high enough to lose crucial government supports. That could be avoided through a provision in the stimulus bill, said Amy Castro Baker, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy and Practice who saw that dynamic play out when she oversaw a pilot program in Stockton, Calif. “Preserving that benefit structure while we’re in this policy gray space is really important,” she said. One thing’s clear: Between the velocity Congress is trying to reach and the uncertainty of the coronavirus, some of the process will have to be worked out on the fly.  “When we think about cash transfer work that has happened since [2008], we’ve done it many different ways,” said Stacia Martin-West, an assistant professor in the University of Tennessee’s College of Social Work who co-led the Stockton experiment. But with the pandemic ongoing, “we are kind of in the Wild, Wild West.” Brian Faler contributed to this report.",Congress wants to send Americans money.

"As Senate Democrats went to the floor Sunday night to vote — the first time they’d been there in days — they had one thing on their minds: a secret “slush fund” for Corporate America.  That’s what Democrats are calling a $500 billion “Exchange Stabilization Fund” included in the massive Senate GOP proposal to rescue the U.S. economy from the coronavirus crisis. The fund, which would come under the control of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is designed to aid distressed industries. It includes $58 billion for U.S. airline and air cargo companies, a source of significant controversy during the last three days of closed-door talks between senators of both parties and the White House.  But the language drafted by Senate Republicans also allows Mnuchin to withhold the names of the companies that receive federal money and how much they get for up to six months if he so decides.  That was way too much for Democrats, many of whom lived through the political furor surrounding the 2008 financial-services industry bailout. They remember facing the populist backlash and being pounded by the “Occupy Wall Street” movement. They aren't going to do it again.  “We’re gonna give $500 billion in basically a slush fund to help industries controlled by Mnuchin with very little transparency? Is that what we ought to be doing?” asked Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii.).  “We're not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends,” railed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who made corporate accountability a big part of her White House campaign. “We're here to help workers, we're here to help hospitals. And right now, what the Republicans proposed does neither of those. “  Even moderate West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin lashed out at the Republicans over the lack of controls on the Exchange Stabilization Fund. “It’s throwing caution to the wind for the average person working on Main Street, it’s balls to the walls for the people working on Wall Street,” Manchin declared. “It’s the same ol’ story from Mitch McConnell.” Senate Democrats had other high-profile issues that also led to their Sunday vote to block the stimulus bill. They sought four months of increased unemployment insurance support, but only got three months; they sought hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency funds for hospitals and other health-care providers to combat the coronavirus, yet Republicans budgeted just $75 billion; and they asked for hundreds of billions for a “State Stabilization Fund” to help state and local governments hurt by the looming economic slowdown, while Republicans offered far less.  But the key to the unanimous set of Democratic ‘no’ votes — and what made it easy for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to line them up — was the “slush fund” accusation.  Democrats noted that the Troubled Asset Relief Program — the formal name of the 2008 financial services industry bailout — created a Financial Stability Oversight Board, a Congressional Oversight Panel, a special inspector general and a mandate for periodic review by the General Accountability Office, Congress’ accounting arm. The legislation offered by Senate Republicans includes none of that.  Republicans argued the term “slush fund” was wildly inappropriate in this situation, while also pointing out that the current economic crisis is not at all comparable to 2008. While the banks and Wall Street firms had overextended themselves at that time, companies today are being hurt by a global pandemic that is far beyond their control.  Republicans also say that they have made major concessions to the Democrats on their demands for this stimulus package. Democrats secured $250 billion in additional unemployment insurance payments, which some top Republicans opposed. The $75 billion in new funding for hospitals was a Democratic win as well, although Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) want hundreds of billions more.  Republicans are also pushing for $250 billion in direct cash payments to help struggling workers, as well as hundreds of billions for other programs. All told, it’s by far the most expensive spending bill in American history.  Senate Republicans and the White House defended the structure of the ESF program as drafted, saying they actually built on the lessons of TARP and 2008 in how they created this new initiative.  “The proposal provides desperately needed resources for affected industries and sectors in order to keep people employed and at work,” said Eric Ueland, the White House director of legislative affairs and a former top Senate aide who is closely involved in the negotiations. “This carefully drawn language contains significant pro-taxpayer and pro-consumer protections in a way unprecedented since the invention of these vehicles really 12 years ago.”  Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) pushed for creation of the fund. Toomey said Monday on CNBC's Squawk Box that the point of the proposal is ""to provide the liquidity to get through this terrible moment.""  ""If this goes on much longer and we don't do anything because our Democratic colleagues won't agree to pass a bill, then some of these companies are going to start dying and they don't just come back with the flip of a switch,"" the Pennsylvania Republican said.  He added that Democrats should have raised concerns about the discretion issues during the negotiations and has previously emphasized that the loans will be paid back.  “The ‘Phase 3’ package takes precise and targeted measures of relief to particularly distressed industries that are at risk of hemorrhaging jobs and closing down if we don’t,” added Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio). “Think of the airlines that right now have seen their passengers reduced by 80 percent, some say 90 percent. Think of the hotel businesses. Think of the other travel and tourism businesses, entertainment business.”  Republicans also claim that a big problem with the TARP program was that as soon as a company disclosed it received a government loan, it got pounded by investors, which in turn hurt its chances of surviving. That in turn led to even more layoffs. So for this reason, Republicans believe a delay is appropriate between when a loan is received and when it becomes public.  “One of the lessons learned from TARP in 2008 was the concern that companies had about being identified publicly as soon as they accepted TARP assistance,” said a GOP official. “It caused an assumption that those companies might be headed for a terminal event.”  But Democrats weren’t hearing any of that, and as they ramped up their opposition to McConnell’s plan, they pounced on the “slush fund” to try to define the bill before GOP leaders and the White House had a chance to.  “It really isn’t putting workers and small businesses first, and you’ve got a $500 billion slush fund,” complained Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). “I think it’s important to just target it for the people and the businesses. You just don’t throw money out like it’s confetti.”",Dems seize on 'slush fund' to oppose Republican rescue package,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/democrats-slush-fund-republican-rescue-package-143565,politico
"In a flash of virus anxiety and social distancing, American electioneering has moved almost entirely online: Voter townhalls are being replaced by digital meetups, campaign rallies are now streamed speeches and donor one-on-ones are moving to FaceTime. In campaign advertising, that shift was long underway, with money moving from old-school broadcast and print ads to a flurry of custom messages on social media and search engines.  As this change has transformed politics over the past several years, and quickly accelerated in recent weeks, one national player has been noticeably silent: The United States Federal Election Commission. The FEC is the nation’s main watchdog on money in politics, meant to be a check on the unlimited and opaque spending of cash on elections. As political ads have shifted more and more to the digital battlefield, however, the nation’s primary regulator of money in politics has made no real moves to follow it.  The agency is largely bound by law last updated in 2002, back when targeted cable ads were still the cutting edge of political advertising. The last time the FEC updated its rules to address online advertising was in 2006, before Facebook had opened to the general public. More recently it has been paralyzed by an internal argument about whether its mandate should, or shouldn’t, extend further into online campaigning. At the moment, the FEC is unable to update its rules even if it wanted to: Since Republican commissioner Matthew Petersen resigned in August, it has only had three of its six seats filled – one short of the quorum required to revise its rules or even to issue official advice for companies, campaigns and consultants looking for guidance on what’s allowed.  Critics increasingly worry about a political world far outpacing its legal watchdog – a problem only growing more acute as a huge slice of American politics quickly shifts digital. “A lot of people are spending a lot of time online right now,” says Michael Beckel, research director at a bipartisan political reform group Issue One.  “Our 20th century laws, he says, “haven’t kept up with 21st century technologies.” The FEC did look on track to return to a quorum until recently; earlier this month, the Senate held a hearing to confirm James E. “Trey” Trainor III, a would-be commissioner first nominated by Trump back in 2017. The Senate hasn’t scheduled the necessary confirmation votes, and with Congress consumed by coronavirus votes, it’s not clear when that would happen. Today, without a quorum and without much to do, the three sitting FEC commissioners fulfill their statutory obligation to meet monthly at their building in Washington’s up-and-coming NoMa neighborhood, catty-corner from a parking lot-turned-beer garden. They meet and discuss the state of enforcement actions launched before last August; without a quorum, they can’t take up any new business. In some ways, the agency’s paralysis is by design. When the FEC was created by Congress in the wake of the 1972 election of Richard Nixon, where donors were said to arrive in D.C. bearing actual bags of actual cash, it was built with a slate of six commissioners intentionally divided evenly on party lines. The goal, for supporters, was to ensure compromise on crucial questions at the heart of democracy—but skeptics suggest that members of Congress wanted a watchdog guaranteed never to be too aggressive. Even against that backdrop, the FEC’s approach to the rise in online politics in the last decades has been notably hands-off. It took a view widely shared by many digital pioneers: that the Internet worked best as a freewheeling place. In politics, that meant upstart candidates could be on more even footing with well-funded incumbents. Conventional wisdom was that it was better for democracy for Americans to battle out their ideas online, without government getting in the way. So while many political TV and radio ads today are required to say who paid for and authorized them — thus the “…and I approve this message…” tagline — online political messaging exists in a gray zone, in practice almost totally unregulated.  The one meaningful exception is a 2006 rulemaking in which the FEC chose to extend its authority over a very small slice of the Internet. Those rules were largely intended to exclude political bloggers from campaign-finance restrictions, but they also for the first time put political ads placed on someone else’s website under the commission’s purview.  While on paper, that category might seem to capture most online advertising, in practice it’s been largely ignored. The FEC offers exceptions to its disclaimer rule for ads where it’s too difficult or impractical for disclaimers to appear, like on giveaway pens or in skywriting; online ads have largely skirted the rules by making similar claims. Are online ads more like TV commercials, or more like pens? The FEC isn’t saying. Meanwhile, the digital ad market is exploding, moving in directions that nobody anticipated in 2006. The Trump campaign has said that counting every slight variation, it ran nearly six million different online ads in 2016. Already in the 2020 campaign, the Trump, Biden, and Sanders campaigns have spent more than $80 million on Facebook and Google ads. In the run-up to Super Tuesday, Bloomberg alone dropped $16 million on ads on those platforms in a single week.  Individual FEC commissioners have made some proposals to help the agency catch up. Democratic Commissioner Ellen Weintraub has pushed for explicit rules requiring more disclosure on the face of digital ads, while chair Caroline Hunter, a Republican, has floated a lighter-touch approach that would require disclaimers but allow ads to display them in different ways, such as pop-ups when a user hovers over an ad. But the commission hasn’t been able to agree on a path forward.  Some opposed to new online ad disclosure rules point to Facebook’s post-2016 moves to adopt some transparency requirements. But, says Weintraub, “it's great if they voluntarily choose to require these kinds of disclaimers, but what if they change their mind tomorrow?”  (Hunter and Democratic-leaning Independent Steven Walther, the other remaining FEC commissioner, didn’t respond to requests to talk for this story.) Over the years, FEC commissioners who have tried to take on digital advertising have quickly learned how tough a fight it can be. After Ann Ravel, Democrat of California, joined the commission in 2013, she started looking into how the FEC might write new rules for the Internet. She got death threats. “Die, fascist, die!,” read one email. At the height of national concern over Russian interference in 2018, the FEC picked up the issue again, and even started the rulemaking process to come up with broad new rules on its authority on the Internet and disclaimers, but it dropped it when public attention died down.  One of the more difficult questions now facing the FEC is what to do about online content that interferes with elections but isn’t clearly a purchased political ad. Online videos can be put together on the extreme cheap, if not arguably for free, to push Americans one way or the other, or just stir up political chaos. In those cases, what role does a commission tasked with enforcing the country’s campaign finance rules have? Russian interference in the 2016 election has made active disinformation a topline worry for many experts; voters are being exposed to a range of questionable online politicking — from fake accounts traced back to Iran to a viral video of a garbled Joe Biden speech clipped to highlight him saying “we can only re-elect Donald Trump” to another spliced to make it look like Trump was calling Covid-19 “a hoax.” The case for disinformation being the FEC’s worry? If it costs something to produce, it’s a case of money influencing American politics, and thus falls under its umbrella. But even Weintraub concedes the FEC may have its hands tied there. “Policing disinformation is a very tricky area for us as a government entity to get into,” she says. “I doubt if it would withstand First Amendment scrutiny if we were to say to the platforms or to broadcasters or anyone else, ‘You have to take that ad down because it contains inaccurate information’,” says Weintraub. “Perhaps the best we can do is to require solid disclosure to make sure everybody knows where the information is coming from.” Weintraub’s workaround on addressing they risks of what she calls “fraudulent news and propaganda,” for now at least, is to gently or not-so-gently encourage the big platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, to figure out their own ways of what addressing the issue. In August, Weintraub put together a session on that and related topics, and asked the social media companies to come, which many did. The quickest way to give the agency more teeth would be for Congress to pass a new law handing the FEC amped-up powers over online ads. A Senate bill called the Honest Ads Act, backed by a bipartisan trio of two Democrats, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mark Warner of Virginia, and South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, would address Russia-style threats by making clear that digital ads have to abide by the same rules as offline ones, but so far hasn’t gotten much traction. (A House version passed as part of a sweeping reform package adopted after Democrats took control of the chamber last year.) Klobuchar, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate committee with oversight of elections, says she’s lost hope that the current Congress will make meaningful changes to how the U.S. conducts elections. She points to a bill on requiring paper ballots which she worked on with Republican James Lankford of Oklahoma but that which was stopped in its tracks by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a long-standing foe of restrictions on campaign spending. “The only answer is to just hope we win big in the presidential election,” says Klobuchar. Critics say that Congress handing the FEC more powers is the only way to equip it to tackle online politics. “I’m going to be a little tongue-in-cheek here, but it’s kind of almost irrelevant if they’re ‘ready’” for the upcoming election, says Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, the advocacy group pushing for campaign finance reform. “They aren’t going to get anything done, in terms of any kind of enforcement action. And they don’t have the legislative authority to do almost anything at all on a lot of the online stuff.” Not everyone agrees that the FEC should be taking on a major overhaul of its approach to the Internet. Bradley Smith, a former Republican chairman of the FEC, serving on the commission from 2000 to 2005, says the calls to apply campaign-finance rules to the Internet often start from a place of “hysteria.” He points to the so-called microtargeting of online ads, a practice that Weintraub has argued highlights how dangerous the medium can be. There’s always been microtargeting, says Smith. “If you wanted to reach a certain type of Republican voter, you could advertise in ‘WaterSki Magazine,’” he says, adding, “If you see somebody waterskiing, you can almost bet your house that person is a Republican.” And so, argues Smith, while it might make sense for the FEC to offer some clarity about how its old rules apply online, it shouldn’t invent a new field of rules for the Internet. In the absence of new guidance, tech companies have been winging it, making up policies as new political tactics appear. In January, the Bloomberg campaign tried out a new tactic where it paid prominent Instagram celebrities to post parody text-message exchanges on their accounts meant to draw attention to his candidacy. Were they ads? The spots didn’t explicitly celebrate Bloomberg, and they hadn’t be placed through Instagram’s ad-buying platform. Eventually, Facebook, which owns Instagram, scrambled to tweak its rules to accommodate Bloomberg — allowing once-restricted “branded content” from politicians, as long as they are clearly marked as sponsored posts. At a conference in Washington shortly after Bloomberg rolled out the tactic, Katie Harbath, Facebook’s public policy director for global elections, pointed out that the FEC hadn’t taken meaningful action on the Internet in more than a dozen years. Said Harbath, ""There are always new things, like this branded content work, that we're having to rethink, and think about, 'What should the policies be around here?' — because there's no one else helping us to think about how we need to do that."" As much as she’d love to write new rules, Weintraub says, she doesn’t agree that platforms like Facebook are paralyzed unless the federal government tells them how to behave. “It’s easy for a platform to say, ‘Boy, it would be nice to get some more guidance from the FEC or from Congress,’ knowing that they’re not going to get that. It may be sincere, or it may be a convenient thing for them to say,” she says. And while Weintraub says she’d love the FEC to have a full enough slate of commissioners to do its business, that’s no guarantee that even then it will take action. “Obviously, we couldn’t make any progress over the last six months when we didn’t have a quorum,” she says. “But we honestly weren’t making a lot of progress before that either.”","As Campaigns Move Online, America’s Chief Watchdog Isn’t Following",2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/23/campaigns-move-online-fec-watchdog-141887,politico
"After the Senate suffered a crushing setback on efforts to pass a $1.6 trillion coronavirus rescue bill Sunday, Republicans reached for a familiar foe to blame: Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  “She’s the speaker of the House, not the speaker of the Senate. We don’t have one,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said angrily after a key procedural vote failed due to Democratic opposition. “We were doing just fine until that intervention.” As Senate leaders struggled to reach a deal Monday morning, Republicans continued to scapegoat Pelosi, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blasting the speaker during an early appearance on Fox News and accusing Pelosi of trying to blackmail Republicans with a wish-list of demands. Senior GOP aides were also shopping around Pelosi attack lines under the cloak of anonymity Monday morning. For most congressional Republicans, the blame-Pelosi playbook is a familiar comfort — an easy go-to as party leaders wrestle for the upper hand in negotiations. For over a decade, the GOP has poured millions of dollars into campaign ads decrying the California Democrat and her “San Francisco values” as all that’s wrong in America. And the coronavirus crisis has proved no exception. What’s less clear is if the blame game will work this time around. Although Pelosi is closely negotiating with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), she doesn’t actually have a vote in the Senate. Schumer is the one who leads his caucus and instructed Democrats to band together against the procedural vote after the two parties failed to reach a deal.  So far, President Donald Trump hasn’t joined the pile-on, instead choosing to attack his own public health experts’ calls for potentially long-term, strict isolation measures that he says are hampering the economy. “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,” Trump tweeted just before midnight Sunday. Only one congressional Republican, Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), had echoed similar frustrations by late Monday morning, ticking off a list of the economic impacts from the coronavirus thus far. “Which is worse, the illness or our 'fix'?” tweeted Hice. “Americans stand up to challenges. Don't succumb to fear! Trust in God. Protect yourself and others, and move forward!” The “boogeywoman” attack line on Pelosi has seemed to lose its potency in recent years. Democrats were able to sweep back into power in the House in 2018, with Pelosi at the helm, despite Republicans’ persistent efforts to paint every Democratic candidate as a Pelosi disciple. Trump’s ubiquitous, divisive presence may have also drowned out attacks on other political leaders. Senate Democrats were quick to blast the move, saying Republicans are only attacking the speaker because they don’t have an adequate rebuttal to Democratic accusations of a corporate “slush fund” being pushed by the GOP. Democrats worry that a massive pot of relief for distressed industries could be abused by corporations, and are pushing for more oversight and restrictions on the $500 billion “Exchange Stabilization Fund.” Democrats said it’s also ridiculous to insist that Pelosi, as the leader of the House, should just accept whatever deal the Senate agrees to and force that package through her chamber.  “That fact that Speaker Pelosi is interested — she should be. She should be more than interested, she should be at the table and involved in making a decision on this,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).  “It’s pretty obvious that if we’re going to pass this measure and do it with dispatch, we need to have cooperation on both sides of the rotunda, not just a bill acceptable to the Senate but to the House as well.” That’s not to say Pelosi hasn’t been heavily involved in the ongoing negotiations to pass the massive package. She has been in close contact with Schumer on the legislation, which would provide billions to keep industries and small businesses afloat while also expanding unemployment insurance, funding desperately needed hospital supplies and sending direct cash payments to Americans.  Pelosi has also taken steps to insulate herself from attacks that she’s standing in the way of bipartisan progress. Along the way, she’s emphasized her frequent and repeated contact with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to signal that efforts to reach a deal are ongoing. After a week back home in San Francisco, Pelosi flew back to Washington Saturday to huddle with Schumer and Mnuchin in person. For days, Pelosi had been demanding McConnell hammer out a deal with her, Schumer and McCarthy, a request McConnell repeatedly denied.  When the House crafted its second coronavirus relief bill earlier this month, McConnell mostly stayed out of the negotiations — and Republicans had hoped Pelosi would extend the same courtesy when the Senate began work on a third, but much bigger, emergency package. So when an initial procedural vote failed on Sunday, the GOP was quick to funnel their anger into attacking Pelosi for saying she would push ahead with her own bill. ""[Pelosi] cannot craft another bill. Time is of the essence,” said McCarthy. “You know what Mitch McConnell did? He did from the bottom up. He had Democrats and Republican senators together actually working out the bill. It was the leaders who came in and stopped this process.” But Democrats countered that Republicans shouldn't have moved ahead if they didn't have the votes. ""The majority leader was well aware of how the vote would go before it happened but he chose to go forward with it anyway even though negotiations are continuing,"" Schumer said on the floor. ""So who's playing games?""

"As Congress gets ready to spend up to $2 trillion to blunt the impact of coronavirus on the economy, the headline items are corporate bailouts and direct payments to individual Americans. Some of that proposed emergency spending is misguided. If we want to keep America at work, and ensure doors are reopened as soon as the crisis lets up, the relief packages should do much more to keep small businesses afloat — directly. The nation’s 30 million small businesses employ almost half of America’s private workforce, totalling 58.9 million people. The vast majority (88 percent) of small businesses have fewer than 20 employees. New businesses account for almost all net new job creation in America, and almost all of them are small businesses.  So in addition to spending taxpayer dollars on unemployment insurance and direct payments—measures that primarily help people already out of work—Congress should prioritize emergency wage support to guarantee workers won’t lose their jobs in the coming months in the first place. This action will provide a much better return on investment to America’s taxpayers than corporate bailouts, untargeted direct payments, and letting millions of Americans join the unemployment lines.  Our emergency wage support proposal is based on public policy that considers our short and long-term economic health and is similar to the United Kingdom’s government action last week to protect jobs. For any small business impacted by COVID-19, such as restaurants, hair salons and corner stores, the federal government would pay employees 80 percent of their annual salaries, up to $100,000 a year, directly through their employers with grants coming from the U.S. Treasury much as the United Kingdom is doing. These efforts should include independent contractors and workers in the “gig economy” also negatively impacted by COVID-19. The federal government would also offer no-interest bridge loans and loan guarantees for small businesses that agree to keep 90 percent of their workforce employed during the crisis. These loans could come from the treasury or banks with a government backed guarantee. Employers would have five years to pay these loans back and companies could use such loans to pay non-employee costs such as rent, supplies, input goods, and other operating costs. If the goal of emergency spending is to prevent massive and irreparable economic dislocation, this is the kind of response Congress needs to consider. The goal isn’t just to pump money into the economy, though it does that—the goal is to be sure the economy as we know it comes out the other side. This program would be much more effective than much of what the Senate is considering now, which is wage support for only two weeks and $350 billion in loans from the Small Business Administration. No one believes this crisis will be over in two weeks. In addition, the SBA’s flagship loan program currently lends in total $25 billion annually. It is unreasonable to expect the SBA could all of a sudden appropriately manage an emergency $350 billion loan program. Rather, it makes more sense to just give all qualifying small businesses a grant through the Treasury of 80 percent of their payroll.  The Senate is currently proposing to spend $1.8 trillion dollars on corporate bailouts, direct payments and unemployment insurance. We believe some of that money would be better invested in an emergency wage support program. Those not covered by emergency wage support and who need direct payments or unemployment insurance would still be eligible. But the goal, if possible, should be to avoid unemployment in the first place. Unemployment insurance was created 85 years ago during the Great Depression — we need to adopt 21st-century thinking for a different kind of crisis. Wage support would take the pressure off of businesses to stay open when it might be dangerous. Even if small businesses have to temporarily close due to COVID-19 social distancing, they can help people maintain their jobs and their professional relationships rather than facing the sudden dislocation of joblessness, and a return to an uncertain job market when the crisis passes.  If still employed, but not ""working,"" employees could use their extra time productively. Without having to worry about finding a job or what would happen when their unemployment benefits run out, they could pursue online learning, upskilling, strategic planning as a team for when they reopen, or even volunteer in their community.  Goldman Sachs surveyed small business owners across the USA and more than half predicted that under current conditions, they would be forced to close in less than three months. We can’t let that happen. Our commitment as a country to small businesses sets us apart from the rest of the world. Estimates point to unemployment of 20 million or more people very soon if we don’t figure out a way, such as emergency wage support, to keep people in their jobs. Goldman Sachs estimates that over 2.25 million people will apply for unemployment this coming week alone. Republicans should support this effort because they have always been allies of small businesses and of creating the market conditions that enable them to thrive. Democrats see the power of government to address such a crisis and could turn a critical social safety net into an engine of productivity and growth. Severe market disturbances require creative government solutions that keep small businesses running and their workers employed, instead of using precious federal funds to subsidize unemployment.   Though it would be new, and expensive, this is not an unprecedented approach — as the United Kingdom’s actions demonstrate. Surely, we can do the same in America, the country with the highest concentration of small businesses in the world. An Emergency Wage Support Act will keep our small businesses and their workers going and the communities who depend on them. That is truly the American Way.",One Big Idea for Congress: Pay Small Businesses to Pay Their Workers,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/03/23/congress-small-businesses-coronavirus-144011,politico
"U.S. lawmakers are moving to give a cash infusion to small businesses that have been hammered by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, but the industry is already sounding the alarm that it won't be enough. The $349 billion contained in the Senate version of the stimulus package — which stalled in Congress on Sunday — would guarantee private-sector loans to companies through the Small Business Administration, freeing up more funds for outfits struggling to keep their head above water as revenue evaporates. But small-business owners and trade groups warn that the money is probably not sufficient and that it's not likely to get to those most in need fast enough. Others wonder whether enough help can be distributed to a sector that's so vulnerable because so many businesses have no cash cushion. “I wish I had a crystal ball to say how long this is going to last,” said Maxine Turner, owner of Salt Lake City-based catering company Cuisine Unlimited. “I cringe when I hear three months. That makes me incredibly nervous because we don’t have the revenues, the rainy-day funds, to see us through three months.” Turner said she has already had to furlough about 80 percent of her company’s 50 employees after most of its revenue dried up in about a week, thanks to event cancellations and the closure of a hotel for which they provide catering services. “We’re not the only ones,” said Turner, whose company only operates on about a 3 percent margin. “I don’t know of a catering company, I don’t know of a restaurant who isn’t going through this same thing.” According to a 2018 U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey, one-third of businesses with fewer than 500 employees had no funds for unexpected expenses, with newer businesses, retailers and companies owned by women being the most likely to not have a financial buffer. “There is not an industry we haven’t heard from within our membership in talking to us about the devastating impact this is having on their business,” said Holly Wade, director of research and policy analysis for the National Federation of Independent Business. “The longer this drags out obviously the more devastating this will be for the small business community,” she said. “The business owners who we’ve heard from across the country, they are in immediate need of a cash infusion to help them get through this crisis.” The stimulus package would allow the government-backed loans to be forgiven if small businesses use them to keep workers on payroll, but many companies argue that the government should offer grants with no interest and no requirement to repay. The SBA itself is also offering low-interest loans through emergency programs, though not all 50 states have yet been declared a disaster area, which is necessary to make those funds available everywhere. Sam Taussig, head of global policy at financial technology lender Kabbage, says the amount of government money needed to help small businesses is at minimum $500 billion and probably more than $1 trillion. Kabbage, whose customers are small businesses, is pushing for SBA to allow fintechs and other lenders to help underwrite emergency loans originated by the government. “There are 30 million small businesses in America, and even if only 1 million need a loan, [SBA] would never be able to process all of that,” he said. Businesswoman Turner said the government should give grants to companies that have been affected the most and then offer low-interest SBA loans for the next hardest hit. The loan forgiveness program, she said, “still means that small businesses need to maintain employees.” “No small business is going to be able to maintain employees on their payroll if there’s no revenue coming in,"" she said. ""Let the revenue be generated and that in turn will bring the employees back in because I’ll need them.” Loan forgiveness could have other logistical difficulties, including whether there is enough funding, said Karen Dynan, who served as chief economist at the Treasury Department from 2014 to 2017. “It seems like a lot of money, but I’m not sure it’s enough money to cover payrolls for small businesses, and if it doesn’t, there are going to be all sorts of questions about who gets the forgiveness and who doesn’t,” she said. Dynan, now an economics professor at Harvard University, also said financial regulators should be looking for other ways to boost small businesses, which often fund their operations through personal credit cards or home equity lines. She suggested mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could make conditions easier for homeowners to take out cash when they refinance their mortgages. She praised Congress’ proposed move to expand the eligible group of lenders that can provide loans backed by the SBA, as existing lenders only have so much room to allocate toward small business credit. But she said that might take time to get up and running, as it requires approval from the Treasury Department. “Anything we can do to increase the speed would be helpful to try to support the small business sector,” she said. “Whether it’s enough of a step — I think it’s still going to take more time than we would want it to take.” She cited her experiences during the 2008 financial crisis when policymakers designed programs to prevent foreclosures. “All this focus was on what would be fair and what would prevent moral hazard and what would ensure that only deserving people got the money,” she said. “In the end, as well-intentioned as those efforts were, they just slowed things down.” The Federal Reserve on Monday also said it would be launching another emergency lending facility to boost lending to small- and medium-sized businesses, similar to ones it has started to keep financial markets from freezing up. The central bank didn’t give details on the program, but Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) has suggested that the Fed — with credit protection from the Treasury — could purchase low-interest small business loans from banks for an immediate boost to those companies, according to a proposal obtained by POLITICO. That idea is also being advocated by the Chamber. “That will have the quickest impact,” said Tom Sullivan, vice president of small business policy at the trade group. “We’re hoping that [Fed Chair] Jay Powell works quickly to allow more lenders to provide that capital.” Sullivan also argued that policymakers shouldn’t get bogged down in restrictions for help to small businesses. “I’m hopeful that there is a level of trust between policymakers and what they believe small business owners are doing and will do with regards to their employees,” he said. “They need money to keep their doors open.”","Small businesses, slammed by coronavirus, plead for quick help",2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/small-businesses-slammed-by-coronavirus-plead-for-quick-help-144069,politico

The full court said today that it will not rehear the case, despite a request from the Justice Department. Circuit Judge Barrington Parker said in a statement accompanying the ruling that Trump uses his account as an official mode of communication. He likened the replies to a town hall meeting held by public officials. “Twitter is not just an official channel of communication for the President; it is his most important channel of communication,” wrote Parker, who had been elevated to the 2nd Circuit by President George W.

"Senate Democrats are rushing to finish negotiations with the Trump administration on a massive $1.6 trillion-plus emergency rescue package as the coronavirus spreads and markets continue to dive. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke late into Sunday evening about the terms of the legislation and met again Monday morning, along with White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland, to restart talks. Upon leaving Schumer's office, Mnuchin appeared optimistic. ""We look forward to a big vote today,"" Mnuchin said. ""We knocked off a bunch of things on the list already, and we're closing out issues.""  The slew of meetings and conversations comes after a vote to move forward on the GOP’s package failed Sunday evening on the Senate floor, with Democrats denying Republicans the 60 votes needed. Democrats are arguing that the Republican proposal does not do enough to prioritize workers over corporations.   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will hold the same procedural vote Monday at noon, after originally planning for the vote at 9:45 a.m. shortly after the markets opened.   One of the outstanding issues for Democrats is the $500 billion “Exchange Stabilization Fund,” which is designed to assist industries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus, including $58 billion for airlines and cargo. The GOP proposal would mostly prevent companies that accept the money from buying back their own stock.   But that restriction could be waived by the Treasury Secretary — a source of significant contention for Democrats, who object to provisions that allow Mnuchin to withhold the names of the companies that receive federal money — as well as the amount — for up to six months at his discretion. Democrats are also arguing that the package doesn’t do enough to prevent layoffs and that a two-year time frame on executive compensation limits is not enough.   In addition, Democrats are pushing for unemployment provisions to last four months instead of three and include independent contractors, hundreds of billions for both hospitals and a “State Stabilization Fund” to assist states with loss of revenue and expanded provisions for more worker protections. A senior Republican aide said that Democrats were trying to add a host of unrelated measures to the coronavirus package, including expanding collective bargaining power for unions, increased fuel emission standards for airlines and more wind and solar tax credits. Democrats are accusing Republicans of doing the same. A senior Democratic aide said Republicans included a provision for extending an abstinence education program that was set to expire in May. Republicans argue that the proposal they put forward is bipartisan, and already includes significant concessions on unemployment insurance and $75 billion for hospitals. In addition to those provisions, the proposal allocates $350 billion for small businesses, and would cover an estimated 58 million U.S. workers and more than 30 million small businesses, according to Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).  The GOP package also includes $1,200 in direct cash payments to individuals, including to Americans with no taxable income. The payments would be phased out for individuals who earn more than $75,000. The negotiations come as the coronavirus has hit close to home for the Senate, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) becoming the first senator to test positive. In addition to Paul, Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) are all under self-quarantine. Meanwhile, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Monday that her husband has contracted the virus.   McConnell chastised Democrats Sunday evening for blocking the proposal from moving forward and accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) of interfering in the negotiations.  McConnell, Schumer, Pelosi, Mnuchin and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) met in McConnell’s office on Sunday, but Pelosi left the meeting saying that the House would draft its own bill.   The White House has called for final passage of the package by Monday, but it’s unclear if that goal remains feasible.",Senate scrambles to finish coronavirus package by end of day,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/senate-coronavirus-rescue-package-143799,politico
"The Federal Reserve on Monday announced aggressive new emergency measures to support the economy and ensure that credit flows to households and businesses as the country faces the prospect of a deep downturn from the coronavirus pandemic. The central bank is committing to buying as many U.S. government bonds and mortgage-backed securities as needed “to support smooth market functioning.” The announcement comes after Congress failed to reach agreement Sunday night on a massive stimulus package to provide direct support to consumers and small businesses, as well as to set aside funds to bail out larger companies. The stock market seemed poised to plunge when it opened Monday in reaction to the gridlock in Washington, but futures pared their losses after the central bank’s move. The Fed's actions — along with other lending programs, significant cash injections into funding markets and zero percent interest rates — make up the most extreme intervention in the economy by the central bank in its history of more than 100 years. The Fed is launching three emergency lending facilities, including two that will buy corporate debt. The third is a revival of an emergency program the central bank created during the 2008 financial crisis that will lend to banks against collateral that includes bundled student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and small-business loans. These facilities are designed to support $300 billion in new credit, and the Treasury Department will kick in $30 billion to help offset losses. The Fed also said it will soon start a program designed “to support lending to eligible small and medium-sized businesses, complementing efforts” by the Small Business Administration. “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support households, businesses, and the U.S. economy overall in this challenging time,” the central bank’s rate-setting committee said in a statement. “The coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world.” “Our nation’s first priority is to care for those afflicted and to limit the further spread of the virus,” it added. “While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions. Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.”",Fed announces vast new emergency effort to boost economy,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/fed-coronavirus-economy-143793,politico
"BERLIN — Now things are really serious. The news late Sunday that Chancellor Angela Merkel has gone into quarantine after a physician she recently saw tested positive for coronavirus has pushed the already-jittery German nation one step closer to nervous-breakdown territory. There’s no indication Merkel, 65, who was exposed when the doctor gave her a pneumococcus vaccine (in line with German government recommendations for people her age) has the virus. Still, if there’s one thing that’s given Germans solace amid the tumult in recent weeks, it’s that Merkel, the “forever chancellor” who has led the country through thick and thin for the past 15 years, is still at the helm. Even Merkel’s detractors acknowledge she’s a safe pair of hands in uncertain times, having led the country through the financial implosion of 2008-2009, the eurozone debt crisis that began in 2010 and the refugee influx of 2015. Merkel was Germany’s most popular politician before coronavirus hit and there’s little reason to expect her calm stewardship over the past couple of weeks has done anything but bolster Germans’ confidence in her. Though she remains in charge — Merkel’s spokesman said in a statement that she will continue to work from home — Germany (and Europe) now face the prospect of navigating the pandemic without her. And there’s plenty to do. In the coming days, Germany’s parliament is expected to rush through a series of emergency measures designed to keep the economy from cratering. At the center of the plan is a proposed supplementary budget worth more than €150 billion on top of the regular budget of €362 billion. In addition, the government is planning to clear the way for €400 billion in loans to struggling businesses and hundreds of billions more in credit guarantees for larger companies. The pandemic crisis has dried up business for thousands of firms, small and large, in recent weeks. “It is important to send a clear and strong signal,” Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said over the weekend. Scholz, a Social Democrat who is also vice chancellor, would likely take over Merkel’s responsibilities, at least on a temporary basis, if she were incapacitated. The decision would rest in the hands of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The government’s planned crisis measures underscore just how severe Berlin expects the economic impact of the coronavirus to become. The increased spending will force the government to break the biggest taboo in German politics by sacrificing the country’s balanced budget — the so-called schwarze Null, or “black zero.” Doing so will require the ruling coalition — which includes Merkel’s center-right Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats — to trigger an emergency clause in the constitution allowing the government to spend more than 0.35 percent of gross domestic product, which totaled €3.44 trillion in 2019. Merkel’s Cabinet is expected to approve the plans Monday, followed by a vote in the Bundestag on Wednesday. Lifting Germany’s so-called debt brake, however, requires a majority of MPs (355 of 709) to be present. Party leaders, including from the opposition Greens and Free Democrats, were scrambling over the weekend to ensure a quorum. Though much maligned abroad in recent years, Germany’s parsimony has arguably put it in a better position than any other country to weather the current storm. The country has recorded a budget surplus for the past five years. Given German debt yields are currently in negative territory (meaning investors are paying to hold the country’s bonds thanks to Germany’s solid credit history), Berlin can effectively borrow money for free. At least for now. As has happened in much of the rest of Europe — and the world at large — the German economy is grinding to a halt. Major manufacturers, including Volkswagen and Mercedes, have closed factories and sent workers home. Tourism and retail are at a standstill. Virtually no aspect of the economy outside the public sector and food production has been spared the current crisis. On Sunday, just before Merkel went into quarantine, she announced a further tightening of controls on Germans’ freedom of movement and mandatory closures for many non-essential businesses, including restaurants and cafés, which had remained opened during daylight hours. The government is betting the tougher rules — which stop short of an outright house arrest while discouraging people from leaving home — will save lives by slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Even so, the new regulations will deal a further blow to Europe’s biggest economy. As of Sunday, more than 24,000 people in Germany had contracted the virus. Though the pace of new infections has decelerated slightly over the past four days, the country is far from overcoming the crisis, health officials say. The number of coronavirus deaths in Germany so far is just under 100 but is expected to rise substantially in the coming weeks. Government-imposed shutdowns across Germany’s 16 Länder, or states, in recent days already forced the closure of most aspects of public life, including most shops as well as museums and hotels. Many economists are already predicting a deeper downturn for Germany than at the height of the Lehman Brothers crisis in 2009, when the economy shrank by nearly 5 percent in a single quarter. “It’s clear that economic activity in Germany is going to fall dramatically in the coming weeks,” Commerzbank economists said in a note to clients over the weekend. Trouble is, no one knows what happens after that. Commerzbank projects a decline in economic output of 3.5 percent in the first quarter and a further drop of 7.5 percent in the second quarter. But that’s likely a best-case scenario. On Monday, the Munich-based Ifo Institut, one of Germany’s most influential economic think tanks, predicted the economy could contract by as much as 21 percent this year, a decline that would put Europe’s largest economy well into depression territory. “The costs are expected to exceed anything known in Germany, from economic crises to natural disasters in recent decades,” Ifo President Clemens Fuest said. Former German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück, who led the effort to preserve the country’s banking system in the wake of the Lehman bankruptcy, said the coronavirus posed an even greater threat to the German economy in terms of its breadth. He encouraged the government to use the “high-caliber” weapons in its arsenal to stave off a collapse. “This crisis is much more existential than what we experienced in the financial crisis in 2008-2009,” he said, predicting a much deeper downturn than in 2009. “We shouldn’t kid ourselves.”",Germany forced to ponder coronavirus battle without Merkel,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/germany-forced-to-ponder-coronavirus-battle-without-merkel-143749,politico
"A bipartisan chorus of outrage has erupted over news that Senator Richard Burr (R-N.C.) sold up to $1.72 million in stock at a moment when he was receiving daily briefings on the coronavirus and at the same time publicly downplaying its potential threat. On the surface, the conflict between Burr’s public and private activity looks suspicious. While Burr’s activity should be condemned, the charge leveled by many critics—that he engaged in illegal insider trading—is more complicated than it first appears. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which polices the stock markets, needs to determine whether there is enough evidence to prove that Burr broke the law. From my experience investigating insider cases, proving that he broke the law won’t be easy, but there is more than enough evidence to warrant a serious investigation. As NPR reported on Thursday, in a private luncheon on Feb. 27, Burr told a nonpartisan group of businesses and organizations from North Carolina that the coronavirus is “more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history.” On the same day Burr made those statements, President Donald Trump publicly downplayed the threat posed by the virus, stating that “like a miracle, it will disappear.” Burr did not contradict the president’s remarks publicly. But two weeks earlier, on Feb. 13, he had sold between $628,000 and $1.72 million of his stock holdings in 33 transactions, including holdings in two major hotel chains. As ProPublica noted when it broke the story, Burr was receiving daily coronavirus briefings around this time, and U.S. intelligence reports from that period warned about a likely pandemic. Eleven days after Burr sold the stocks, the market began an extremely sharp decline and by Friday had lost approximately a third of its value. Even Trump allies Tucker Carlson and Charlie Kirk have joined Democrats to call for Burr to resign. That reaction was justified, because regardless of whether Burr’s actions meet the technical legal requirements of insider trading, his obligation was to warn the public rather than protect his own portfolio. But calls for Burr’s prosecution for insider trading are premature, because it won’t be an easy case to prove. The law governing it is relatively new and untested, and long experience shows that it’s very difficult to separate the kind of knowledge you might get in a congressional hearing from info that any close reader could get from the news. Insider trading is when someone learns of “material, nonpublic information” and uses that to trade stock. That means that the trader knew something the public didn’t know, which can sometimes give the trader a big advantage over the public. It sounds shocking but insider trading by senators and members of Congress was legal until the passage of the STOCK Act of 2012, which was enacted to prohibit members of Congress from “using nonpublic information derived from their official positions for personal benefit.” Ironically, Burr was one of only three senators to vote against the STOCK Act. It was passed after public reports that members of Congress profited off the Great Recession. For example, a day after receiving a private briefing on the collapsing economy and financial system from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, then-Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.) shorted the market by buying options that would rise if the market tanked. A few days later, after the market plunged, he sold his position and nearly doubled his money. Burr also panicked during that period. In 2008, after hearing the then-Treasury secretary speak, Burr reportedly told his wife to “go to the ATM” and “draw out everything it will let you take.” Burr’s stock sales last month look like the sort of activity the STOCK Act was intended to prohibit. But the statute is very new. It has been enforced only once, and only then in a case that involved a member of Congress acting on information specific to an individual company. Prior insider trading cases were against corporate insiders, not governmental “insiders” under the STOCK Act, so you could expect Burr, if he were prosecuted, to argue that the law should be struck down or narrowed. But even if the law held up, there would be challenges for any investigator probing Burr’s conduct. To prove Burr engaged in insider trading, the government would have to prove that he had information that—if the public knew it as well—would have caused a significant change in the price of stocks that he sold. That will involve an investigator closely looking at the details of the private briefings Burr received to find some piece of information that was not known by the public that was so important that it would have changed stock prices. It’s worth noting that despite Trump’s attempt to mislead the public, there was a lot of public information available at that time about the general threat of the coronavirus. It’s no surprise Burr now claims he “closely followed CNBC’s daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus at that time,” and relied “solely on public news reports.” Burr may also ultimately argue that the private information he had was not “material” because there was no way he would have known it would have caused a significant change in price in the particular stocks that he sold. Burr could make a plausible argument that he couldn’t have predicted that a recession would send the stock market tumbling. Nevertheless, there is more than enough here to warrant a full investigation by the SEC. Burr has self-reported to the Senate Ethics Committee, presumably to fend off an investigation by the SEC or Department of Justice. But an ethics committee probe should not be a substitute for an investigation by professionals at the SEC. Some have called for a criminal investigation by the Justice Department, which would face a higher bar because it would need to prove Burr’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Often, the SEC and DOJ work in parallel to investigate conduct as both a civil and criminal matter. When I investigated financial crimes like insider trading as a federal prosecutor, we frequently followed after the SEC began its own investigation. Given the hurdles faced by investigators, the SEC is a reasonable place to start. Since the report of Burr’s stock sales, Senators Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and James Inhofe (R-Okla.) have come under scrutiny for reportedly selling stock during the same period. Each of them have offered a better public explanation than Burr did. For example, Loeffler, a former executive at a major U.S. exchange, claims that her investment decisions were made by third parties without her knowledge or involvement. Given the intense public outcry over these stock sales, it is in the public interest for the SEC to look at all of this, including the trades by the other three senators. But unless the public statements by the other senators are false, the only senator who merits a serious, long-term investigation is Burr. Obstacles exist to holding Burr accountable legally, but his disturbing actions warrant more than an ethics committee review.",Why Burr’s Stock Sales Are Easier to Condemn than Prosecute ,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/23/richard-burr-stocks-trading-coronavirus-prosecute-142976,politico
"President Donald Trump spent the weekend vacillating between casting himself as an empathetic leader and wartime president as the coronavirus spreads through the United States.  But above all, he still wants credit. Credit for cutting off travel from China. Credit for giving up money to run for office. Credit for uniting the nation.  During three collective hours of briefings on Saturday and Sunday, the president extolled his administration’s “extraordinary mobilization in our war against the virus,” dropped superlatives while describing efforts to offset testing shortages and move a major economic stimulus bill on Capitol Hill and trumpeted a national emergency he declared over a week ago.  “There’s never been anything like we're doing on the Hill right now,” he told reporters in one of many laudatory passages. Even as he repeatedly offered comfort and hope to a nervous American public — ""no American is alone as long as we're united,” he said — Trump would fall back into familiar tropes from his campaign. He attacked the press. He decried the sacrifices he made as a rich person in choosing to run for office. The two weekend briefings offered a window into the challenges that lie ahead for Trump, as he tries to appease the country and appear in control while also keeping in check his personal grievances. The tone Trump strikes will be critical to whether he is reelected, as the coronavirus crisis is quickly becoming the biggest challenge of the president’s 3½ years in office. His daily briefings have essentially become stand-ins for his campaign rallies that are on hiatus until the coronavirus recedes — his way to communicate with the public and rally his base.  While the public’s approval of his handling of the virus jumped this past week, the ongoing challenges with testing and medical equipment — not to mention the virtual shutdown of the U.S. economy — pose problems that will be playing out for weeks, if not months. “During this event, candid and forceful truths will do us a lot more than sugarcoating false assurances, or only trying to present this only in the best light,” said Craig Fugate who ran the Federal Emergency Management Agency under President Barack Obama from 2009 until early 2017.  “I don’t care about your popularity,” Fugate added. “This isn’t about us. It’s about how many people we can save. This is brutal math right now. Can we keep the death toll as low as possible?” The president’s rhetoric this weekend belied the country’s ongoing inability to broadly test Americans for the coronavirus, almost one month after the first homegrown case appeared in California. Doctors, nurses and major medical groups spent the weekend begging for additional masks and protective equipment to keep health care workers safe as they treat an increasing number of infected patients, and local leaders and governors warned of potentially dire shortages at hospitals that lack enough beds and ventilators to treat the expected waves of new cases.  Trump tried to combat these complaints by announcing over the weekend that his administration intended to send thousands of masks, hospital gowns and respirators to hard-hit states, including New York, California and Washington, early this week. Two government ships are also making their way to New York and the West Coast to serve as extra hospital beds, the president said on Sunday night.  These announcements came after Trump and his top officials could not answer questions on Saturday and Sunday morning during the briefing and on various talk shows about the availability of new tests it hoped to unveil in coming weeks, or the time frame for the federal government to get crucial N95 masks to health care workers.  “It is a dynamic and fluid operation,” Peter Gaynor, head of FEMA said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” when pressed for an exact figure of the number of masks the government had. “The president appointed FEMA five days ago to manage federal operations. And since I have been here, we have been shipping continuously from federal warehouses and, again, connecting those governors that need supplies to those who have it in the commercial sector.” White House officials note they are working overtime to combat the coronavirus outbreak, freeing up billions in government funding, clamping down on travel and tweaking regulations to expand health care options and ease the shipping of supplies to states and cities. Trump and White House officials have argued that states and local public health leaders are also responsible for tracking down much-needed supplies. The federal government cannot solve all of these problems, officials have argued, and to assume so is a “socialist fantasy,” said one senior administration official. The president put it more diplomatically on Sunday night. He said the federal government was there to support states, not dictate strategy. Yet he made this argument while continuing to make himself the face of the administration’s response. Public health experts say the Trump administration is still playing catch-up after not responding aggressively in the early stages of the coronavirus. One former senior administration official said the U.S. government would have been in a much better situation if officials had started taking more assertive action in January or February. China reported its first death from the virus on Jan. 11. The White House argues that it was taking action then, citing the decision to bar most travel from China and declare a public health emergency on Jan. 31. But critics say the White House has not stuck to a clear and succinct message about how serious the outbreak is for the American public, and how it might be solved. Trump sent mixed signals over the weekend on potential drugs that could be used to treat this virus. He also touted the Defense Production Act — a law that allows the government to mandate that companies repurpose facilities in moments of crisis — yet his administration has yet to actually compel the production of health supplies, insisting companies are cooperating voluntarily. The shifting messaging — and debate over who deserves credit for what — only muddies the main takeaway, experts say. “We need to get out of the discussion of who said what, who did a good job and a bad job. Our outcome has to be to reduce the death toll. We get too hung up on who did what. That is a great topic for a future commission to review,” said Fugate, the former Obama FEMA administrator. “Everything now needs to be about what can we do differently tomorrow.”",Trump wants to defeat coronavirus — and make sure he gets credit,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/trump-wants-defeat-coronavirus-credit-143531,politico
"As the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. soared past 400 on Sunday, President Donald Trump reassured Americans that everything would be OK and that it would all be over soon. Even as he acknowledged the novel coronavirus as an invisible enemy that’s attacking more than 140 countries, the self-proclaimed wartime president predicted “a great victory” in America. “It’s gonna be a victory that, in my opinion, will happen much sooner than originally expected,” Trump said. In a 90-minute news conference with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Trump rattled off the number of supplies the federal government had sent to New York, California and Washington, where a combined 242 people have died from the virus. The list of materials included respirators, surgical masks, gowns, coveralls and gloves. The high volume of items being sent to some of the nation’s hot spots highlights the severity of the threat that the nation and the world face. Hospitals are warning of shortages of materials, including a lack of hospital beds and protective equipment. Meanwhile, governors across the country have closed schools, restaurants, bars and other venues in an effort to slow the spread of the virus, which has surged to beyond 33,000 cases in the U.S. Some leaders have gone so far as to order residents to shelter in place or meet a curfew. The threat has even infiltrated Congress, where three members have contracted the virus and several others are self-quarantining at home. Two congressmen and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky have tested positive in recent days. The disclosure of Paul’s diagnosis on Sunday quickly led to at least two Senate Republicans, Mitt Romney and Mike Lee of Utah, choosing to self-quarantine, leaving the GOP with a slim 48-47 majority. Trump said he believed the infected members would “all be fine” and mocked Romney, who crossed party lines earlier this year and supported his impeachment. “Romney’s in isolation?” Trump said. “Gee, that’s too bad.” The president told reporters he didn’t see any threats to a $1.6 trillion emergency rescue package, even if several Republican members were unable to vote on the legislation while they isolate themselves at home. “It’ll all work out,” he insisted, moments after a procedural vote on the bill failed. In a broad mix of remarks, Trump also argued that the country is “very united,” warned that the virus would’ve been “catastrophic” if not for the massive tax cuts he signed into law in 2017, claimed the presidency had personally cost him billions of dollars, complained that no one thanked him for refusing a presidential salary, predicted the economy would “skyrocket once this is over,” touted his Department of Veterans Affairs for having “the highest poll numbers in the history of the” VA and suggested that none of his predecessors could tell him anything life-saving if he sought their advice. “I have the best people in the world,” Trump said. “Look at the approval numbers on the job we’re doing. I think we’re doing an incredible job, so I don’t want to disturb them, bother them. I don’t think I’m gonna learn much. And, you know, I guess you could say there’s probably a natural inclination not to call. Now, if I felt that if I called, I’d learn something, and that would save one life — it would save one life, OK? — I would make the call in 10 minutes, but I don’t see that happening.” Trump said he has a great relationship with Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gavin Newsom of California, who are both Democrats. But he was critical of the news media, telling one reporter, “you asked a nasty question” and another that her question sounded like it was “100 percent wrong.” He also expressed optimism that a drug used to treat malaria could be a cure for the coronavirus, remarking that there were “tremendous signs it could work.” “Why should we be testing it in a test tube for a year and a half when we have thousands of people that are very sick?” Trump asked. “They’re very, very sick, and we can use it on those people and maybe make them better and in some cases maybe save their lives.” “We think it might work on this, based on evidence, based on very strong evidence. We’re gonna see. We’re gonna know sometime after Tuesday,” he added. “I don’t wanna get anybody overexcited, but I’m very excited by that, by the prospect of it.” Trump’s rhetoric on the drug is at odds with Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In an interview on Sunday morning on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Fauci said Trump had been “trying to bring hope to the people” by promoting the drug. “But my job is to prove definitively from a scientific standpoint that they do work,” he said, explaining their differing views. “I was taking a purely medical, scientific standpoint.”",Trump predicts victory over coronavirus ‘much sooner’ than expected,2020-03-22,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/trump-predicts-victory-coronavirus-143459,politico
"President Donald Trump said Sunday that as he tackles the current national crisis, he doesn’t want to “bother” his predecessors and doesn’t think he’s “going to learn much” from them.  In response to a reporter’s question on whether he would reach out to any former presidents (George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama or Jimmy Carter), Trump implied that wasn’t in the cards. “I think we're doing an incredible job. So I don't want to disturb them, bother them,” he said at the White House coronavirus task force briefing. “I don't think I'm going to learn much and, you know, I guess you could say that there's probably a natural inclination not to call.” The president instead pointed to his approval numbers on the job his administration is doing — 55 percent of respondents approve of Trump’s management, a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll found— and boasted having “the best people in the world.”  However, Trump said, if he felt that he would glean information that could save even just one life, he would “make the call in two minutes.” “But I don’t see that happening,” he finished.  There is ample precedent for a president asking former presidents to step in. Notably, Bush enlisted the help of Clinton and President George H.W. Bush in raising voluntary contributions in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina — just as they did to help victims of tsunami relief in 2004. Carter conducted diplomatic missions throughout his post-presidential years. America is contending with rising numbers of critically ill coronavirus patients and a shortage of emergency medical equipment. Governors, mayors and front-line health care workers have said they haven’t received meaningful amounts of federal aid. The Trump administration has been criticized for being too slow to respond to the threat, then thinking too much in the short term on potential solutions for the pandemic.  There have been at least 33,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States and over 400 deaths, according to a database from Johns Hopkins University. On Sunday, Trump did extensively cite one former president during his extended news briefing.

"Joe Biden delivered his first shadow briefing on the coronavirus Monday, faulting President Trump for giving false information about the pandemic, not taking it seriously enough and not moving faster. “Trump keeps saying that he’s a wartime president. Well, start to act like one,” Biden said, drawing attention to his own coronavirus response plan. “To paraphrase a frustrated President Lincoln writing to an inactive General McClellan during the Civil War, ‘if you don't want to use the army, may I borrow it?’” But as the atmospherics of Biden’s briefing showed, the former vice president is outgunned in the battle against Trump when it comes to getting his message out. Limiting his contact with the outside world due to the coronavirus contagion, Biden made his remarks via webcast from his recreation room-turned-broadcast studio in his Wilmington, Delaware, home. In contrast, Trump has commanded live national television coverage for his daily press briefings from the White House. Biden was still working out some small hiccups in getting accustomed to webcasting, not knowing for a few moments before he spoke that he was live and, briefly at one point, losing his place when his notes appeared out of order. None of that matters as much, though, as much as the difference between the message and tone of the former vice president when compared to the current president, Biden advisers say. Biden wants to appear measured, reassuring and calm to contrast with what they say is an erratic Trump, who 10 minutes before midnight blasted out a new message about the economy that he wrote in all capital letters on Twitter. “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!” Trump wrote at 11:50 p.m., before retweeting it 12 hours later following Biden’s speech. In a prebuttal to Biden’s criticisms, Trump’s campaign Monday accused the Democrat of “undermining Americans’ confidence in the federal government’s response to a global pandemic and preying upon Americans’ fears.” It also faulted Biden failing to “mention China once” as the cause of the pandemic. Biden brought up China in his remarks Monday by pointing out that he had warned Trump not to take the word of President Xi Jingping earlier this year when Trump was lauding the country’s response to the virus. “My point is not simply that the president was wrong. My point is that the mindset, that was slow to recognize the problem in the first place to treat it with the seriousness it deserved, is still too much a part of how the president is addressing the problem,” Biden said. “Let me be clear, Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response,” Biden said. “And I along with every American hope he steps up and starts to get this right.”",Biden to Trump: Start acting like ‘a wartime president’,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/biden-to-trump-start-acting-like-a-wartime-president-144195,politico
"President Donald Trump on Sunday night appeared to suggest he would soon consider relaxing federal guidelines meant to combat the coronavirus pandemic — even as senior administration officials promoted those measures as critical to preventing further loss of life and predicted a grim week ahead. ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" Trump wrote on Twitter shortly before midnight. ""AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!"" The president's message referred to the administration's ""15 Days to Slow the Spread"" initiative, announced last Monday, which urged Americans to practice social distancing; avoid gatherings of more than 10 people; work or attend school from home whenever possible; and abstain from eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts. At the White House coronavirus task force's daily press briefing Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence noted that the country was seven days into the effort and praised Americans' participation thus far.  ""With the cooperation, compassion, generosity, and prayers of the American people, we can slow the spread, we can protect the most vulnerable, and we can heal our land,"" Pence said. ""So let's do it, America.""  But while the guidance is helping ""flatten the curve"" of infected individuals within the United States, it has also contributed to a precipitous drop in economic activity.  Even more stringent directives issued by state and local authorities, such as large-scale ""shelter-in-place"" orders, have similarly spooked financial markets and provoked fears of an imminent recession. On Monday morning, Trump signaled growing skepticism regarding those health-related lockdowns, retweeting a handful of accounts that proposed Americans return to work in the near future and advocated for a resumption of daily life in the U.S.  ""The fear of the virus cannot collapse our economy that President Trump has built up,"" read a tweet shared by the president. ""We The People are smart enough to keep away from others if we know that we are sick or they are sick! After 15 days are over the world can begin to heal!"" In another post Trump retweeted, a Twitter user wrote that after 15 days, ""we keep the high risk groups protected as necessary and the rest of us go back to work.""  The president's social media activity came as Surgeon General Jerome Adams made a string of appearances on morning news shows, repeatedly cautioning that the coming days would prove among the most difficult in Americans' fight against the public health crisis. Adams is one of a number of senior administration officials who have argued that social distancing recommendations will need to be sustained, not slackened, to curb the swift spread of COVID-19, and cautioned that the its threat to Americans will last longer than initially thought. ""I want America to understand: This week, it's going to get bad,"" Adams told NBC's ""Today"" show, adding that ""we really, really need everyone to stay at home."" The increased availability of testing and the disease's rapid rate of transmission are expected to result in an eruption of new cases of COVID-19, which has already infected more than 35,000 people across all 50 states and produced at least 473 deaths. Because of limited testing capacity, experts agree the actual number of positive cases is much higher. ""As the nation's doctor, I'm here to help America understand how we need to respond to this,"" Adams said Monday, when pressed on Trump's weekend tweet previewing an impending ""decision"" on the administration's response efforts.  ""And where I come down is that every single day counts,"" the surgeon general continued. ""Every single second counts. And right now, there are not enough people out there who are taking this seriously."" In an interview last Wednesday with NBC, Adams acknowledged that 15 days of preventative measures is ""likely not going to be enough"" time to successfully halt the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S.  Pence, who is leading the administration's management of the outbreak, offered an even bleaker prediction a day earlier, saying that ""according to some of our modeling, we could well be dealing with coronavirus cases in the United States well into July."" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also offered an inconclusive response when asked last Friday how long Americans would have to remain socially distant.  ""I cannot see that all of a sudden, next week or two weeks from now, it's going to be over,"" he said. ""I don't think there's a chance of that. I think it's going to be several weeks."" And according to an internal report from the Department of Health and Human Services, produced last weekend and first reported on by The New York Times, the pandemic ""will last 18 months or longer and could include multiple waves of illness."" Those dire assessments clash with rising protests from some of the president’s conservative allies that the economic devastation wrought by ""social distancing"" could be ""worse"" than the coronavirus' human toll.  ""I think it is soon becoming time to have old and/or sick people take every precaution and healthy people go back to work forever changed [with] new habits in a grimmer reality,"" tweeted Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union.

"Half of Americans give President Donald Trump positive marks for his management of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a new survey, and his approval rating has seen a marginal improvement over the past month as the pandemic has worsened.  A Monmouth University poll released Monday reports that 50 percent of respondents believe Trump has done a ""good job"" dealing with the outbreak, while 45 percent say he has done a ""bad job."" Three percent of those surveyed said they had a mixed review of Trump's performance, and 1 percent did not have an opinion.  The president's net positive rating is starkly partisan, with 89 percent of Republicans, 48 percent of independents and 19 percent of Democrats assessing that he has done a ""good job"" handling the public health emergency.  Additionally, 46 percent of Americans now approve of the job Trump is doing as president — an increase from 44 percent in February. Trump's overall on-the-job rating was also sharply divided along partly lines, with 91 percent of Republicans, 44 percent of independents and 11 percent of Democrats approving. Still, both metrics likely represent good news for the White House, as Trump continues to battle criticism for his early dismissals of the coronavirus' threat to Americans and current refusal to mount a more sweeping federal response. The survey's results come after ABC News/Ipsos poll published Friday showed that 55 percent of Americans approved of Trump's handling of the rapidly spreading disease, up from a 43 percent approval rating of his efforts a week prior. The Monmouth University poll was conducted March 18-22, surveying 851 adults.

"Former campaign workers for Mike Bloomberg are suing the billionaire former presidential candidate for fraud, alleging in a nationwide class action lawsuit that as many as 2,000 employees were promised to be paid though the general election before he laid them off. Plaintiffs in the class action include two organizers who halted the interview process for other jobs to join the Bloomberg campaign, and another former organizer who postponed law school to work on Bloomberg’s 2020 effort.  The filing comes on the same day as another class action brought by a former Bloomberg field organizer that similarly argues the employees were tricked into taking jobs they were told would continue for a year.  The lawsuit by the three former workers in Georgia, Utah and Washington state, also filed in federal court in New York City, contends that the field organizers were fraudulently induced to accept jobs with the Bloomberg campaign based on the promise of guaranteed salaries though November. The ex-field staffers who filed the suit, Alexis Sklair, Nathaniel Brown, and Sterling Rettke, are represented by Peter Romer-Friedman of Gupta Wessler PLLC, and Ilann M. Maazel and David Berman of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady LLP. Bloomberg on Friday purged all of those workers in six battleground states and guaranteed they would be paid only through the first week of April, with their benefits expiring at the end of that month. The first big round of layoffs across the rest of the country happened earlier this month, with their pay lasting though March 31. Bloomberg hiring materials described as coming from headquarters promised work with “Team Bloomberg” though November, regardless of whether he became the Democratic nominee, provided that the aides working across the country were willing to relocate. Bloomberg’s team reiterated their plans to follow though — even if only in spirit — after the initial round of layoffs, when top campaign advisers indicated in emails and staff conference calls that they would be given priority on a planned Bloomberg super PAC. Instead, Bloomberg announced Friday that he had decided to transfer $18 million of his own money to the Democratic National Committee to help presumptive nominee Joe Biden. The campaign invited former field organizers to apply for jobs with the party through its “competitive process,” with no guarantee of a job. ""The Bloomberg campaign’s hiring managers understood that potential applicants for field staff positions like the plaintiffs would be motivated to work for Mike Bloomberg 2020 because of their interest in working on the general election to defeat Donald Trump,” the lawsuit states.  “Accordingly, the Mike Bloomberg 2020 hiring managers expressly promised field staff applicants for Mike Bloomberg 2020 that they would be employed by Mike Bloomberg 2020 to perform work on the primary campaign to elect Michael Bloomberg as the Democratic nominee and on the general election, regardless of whether Bloomberg won the nomination, and stated that the Bloomberg campaign would keep open and financially support its field offices through the general election campaign.”  Bloomberg aides were also told that the field offices in battleground states would remain open. The lawsuit notes that the layoffs come ""at a uniquely precarious time in the nation’s history."" Bloomberg spokespeople did not immediately comment on the lawsuit. But in a statement issued Friday, the campaign said the DNC Coordinated Campaign is hiring in the six battleground states. “And we will assist the DNC as much as we are able to, including by providing names of staff and working to help them onboard and grow their program as expediently as possible,” the spokesperson said. Attorney for one of the group of litigants said in a statement that while ""our clients would like to speak publicly about their experiences, they are potentially subject to a confidentiality and non-disparagement agreement with Mike Bloomberg 2020. We respectfully request that the Bloomberg campaign release our clients and the other field staffers from that agreement, even though it may not be enforceable.” Attorneys not working on the cases said such class action lawsuits are often combined.  Bloomberg field organizers were among the highest compensated in the election cycle, and enjoyed generous health benefits, in addition to $5,000 for relocation costs. While all of the field organizers are believed to have signed at-will contracts with the campaign, they argue in the lawsuit that they can bring these claims based on evidence that they were induced to sign on because of the longevity promises made to them.  The promise of sustained pay months after a campaign ends is exceedingly rare in politics. But in more than a dozen interviews with POLITICO, the former aides said it was key to their decision to join. Bloomberg quickly amassed a staff of thousands after launching in November, then ended his campaign after a feeble showing on Super Tuesday. Since news of their dismissal, scores of former Bloomberg staffers have been organizing online in preparation for taking legal action. They’ve established several chat and email groups to share their experiences, with many expressing deep frustrations about losing their pay and health care benefits in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.  Aside from the action filed Monday, there are believed to be other claims coming from other groups of ex-staffers. The lawsuit states that Sklair relocated from Charleston, S.C. to Savannah, Ga., to work as a field organizer for Bloomberg. Before joining the Bloomberg campaign, she was an organizer for Cory Booker’s presidential campaign.  At the time that Sklair accepted the job with Bloomberg, the lawsuit states, she had just been offered a position on a state Senate campaign in South Carolina that would have likely lasted throughout the general election. After taking the job with Bloomberg, she declined to move forward. Brown worked as an organizer for Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign and moved from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City, Utah to work for Bloomberg in January. He said he dropped out of advanced stages of the hiring process for a job as an organizer with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Rettke postponed applying for law school to work on Bloomberg’s bid.",Bloomberg sued by aides for stiffing them on yearlong pay promise,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/mike-bloomberg-aides-pay-lawsuits-144185,politico
"Four more governors on Monday moved to place restrictions on their states' residents in an effort to blunt the spread of coronavirus. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Witmer, a Democrat, took the most dramatic action, ordering residents to stay home except for essential outings and ordering non-essential businesses to tell employees not to report to work, effective at midnight Tuesday.  Witmer's order, which will remain in place for at least the next three weeks, comes as the governor noted the state went from having zero reported cases of the virus to more than 1,000 in under two weeks, though such an increase was somewhat expected as testing kits became more widely accessible. Republican Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts stopped short of ordering residents to stay inside, but both on Monday ordered all non-essential businesses in their states closed. Maryland’s restrictions go into place at 5 p.m., while Baker’s order takes effect beginning at noon on Tuesday and will extend until at least April 7.  Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers teased that his own shelter in place order would coming Tuesday, dubbing the initiative “Safer at Home.” In a string of tweets, Evers noted that the order would walk back his previous declaration that he would not be issuing a shelter-in-place order. Evers, a Democrat, said more details of his order would become available in the next day.  The flurry of measures announced Monday follow in the footsteps of eight other state leaders who have issued similar mandatory orders: Ohio, Louisiana and Delaware issued stay at home orders on Sunday, joining California, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut. Last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered all non-essential workers to stay home.  The new action in recent days has also despite a reluctance by President Donald Trump to mandate social distancing measures at the federal level, despite a number of state leaders pleading for the president to order fixes to what they've complained is a patchwork pattern of restrictions across the country.  Trump said Friday he would not be ordering any kind of shelter in place restrictions at the federal level, citing an unevenness in infections in different parts of the country. Rather than push for further social distancing, the president has begun to signal a growing skepticism to en-mass lockdowns the economic devastation they have caused throughout the country.",Five more governors announce new restrictions to curb coronavirus ,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/four-more-governors-announce-new-restrictions-to-curb-coronavirus-144240,politico

""Further tests will be carried out in the next few days."" A single negative test result does not necessarily mean a person is not carrying the virus, as the specimen might have been collected at a very early stage of the infection. The German chancellor is currently working from home in self-isolation after being informed late Sunday that a doctor who gave her a pneumococcal vaccination last Friday tested positive for the virus over the weekend.

"The Supreme Court on Monday issued its first opinions of the coronavirus-era without taking the bench — departing from long-standing tradition.  Instead, the court posted its rulings on four fully-argued cases online, with the justices forgoing the usual public reading of opinion summaries in the ornate courtroom across from the Capitol. Arguments that were set to take place Monday and through next week have been postponed indefinitely, due to concerns about the virus. In one of the four cases, the high court mustered near-unanimity to rule in favor of media giant Comcast in a discrimination lawsuit bought by owners of a network offering programming aimed at African American audiences.  In an opinion written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, the court ruled that plaintiffs in such cases must show that racial animus was an essential reason for treating a company or individual differently in a business transaction, and not simply that race played some role in the decision. “A plaintiff bears the burden of showing that race was a but-for cause of its injury,” Gorsuch wrote. All nine justices endorsed the bulk of Gorsuch’s opinion, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took exception to one footnote and emphasized that discrimination at any point in the contracting process should be actionable. Another ruling by the court Monday produced an unusual ideological alignment. Justice Elena Kagan, a Democratic appointee, joined with her five GOP-appointed colleagues to allow states to use a narrow definition of insanity when assessing whether a defendant should be held responsible for his or her crimes. Kagan wrote for the six-justice majority in the case, ruling that the State of Kansas did not have to absolve a murder defendant said to be unable to distinguish between right and wrong. “Defining the precise relationship between criminal culpability and mental illness involves examining the workings of the brain, the purposes of the criminal law, the ideas of free will and responsibility,"" Kagan wrote. “It is a project for state governance, not constitutional law,"" she added. Justices Stephen Breyer, Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented, with Breyer arguing that the court was ignoring “seven hundred years of Anglo-American legal history” by endorsing punishment for people who could not perceive that their actions were wrong. The court also issued a 7-2 decision Monday that gives federal appeals courts greater authority to review rulings by immigration courts and a Justice Department appeals panel that oversees those courts. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Gorsuch joined all of their Democratic-appointed colleagues in the decision favoring broad oversight of executive branch actions in immigration cases, while Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. In a fourth case, the justices said states are not subject to suits for copyright infringement under current law. However, they left open the question of whether Congress could retool the law to create such liability for states. The justices also announced Monday that when they hear arguments in a trio of cases about efforts to subpoena President Donald Trump’s financial records, they will hear not only from a personal lawyer for Trump but also from an attorney representing the official position of the U.S. government. Those cases were set to be argued next Tuesday but have been put off indefinitely due to the coronavirus crisis. The next scheduled arguments at the court are set for April 20, but whether those will take place as planned is unclear. Six of the justices are age 65 or over, which puts them at high risk of serious complications or death from the virus, heightening concerns about the court convening in person.","SCOTUS rulings land online, upending tradition",2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/supreme-court-rulings-online-coronavirus-144194,politico
"A growing number of lawmakers are pleading for Congress to start working — and voting — from home as millions of Americans are ordered to shelter in place to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Nearly 70 House Democrats on Monday sent a letter to their leadership in support of voting remotely amid the coronavirus crisis, an unprecedented step that comes as the virus has infected three members of Congress. Many lawmakers and aides of both parties privately fear that the virus could spread rapidly on Capitol Hill if the House decides to return from recess and put roughly 435 lawmakers in the same room to vote. The letter, led by Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), urges House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) — whose panel is reviewing the possibility of remote voting — to allow for a temporary rule change at a time of national emergency. “Congress should be no exception to adapting to this crisis,” the letter reads. “The House must adopt remote voting both to protect public health and to allow us to be the voices of our constituents.” The letter includes senior Democrats like House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), as well as several West Coast lawmakers, like Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna, Pete Aguilar and Barbara Lee, all of California. The pressure is also growing in the Senate, which remains in session this week as negotiators from both parties attempt to reach a nearly $2 trillion deal that would expand the nation’s ability to deal with the crisis, on both the public health and economic front. Two GOP senators on Monday came out publicly in support of voting remotely, one day after one of their colleagues, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), announced that he was positive for the virus. “I’m ready to support remote voting,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) tweeted on Monday. “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. It is time to bring the Senate into the 21st century.”  Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C) — who had previously been lukewarm on the idea of voting electronically — also changed his stance. “We should make this change before the Senate leaves town,” Graham tweeted on Monday. For Republicans, the threat of the virus could also pose a numbers problem: As of Monday, five GOP senators are sidelined from voting on the Senate floor because Paul is battling the infection and four others are self-quarantining after possible exposure. That further narrows the margins for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as he attempts to muscle a massive economic rescue package through the chamber in short order. Anxiety has been mounting in the Capitol, particularly after Paul’s diagnosis on Sunday. The Kentucky senator had been in the building, attending meetings, voting on the floor and even using the Senate gym as he awaited the results of his test. Paul said he had not been aware of specific exposure. But House and Senate leaders have warned that allowing members to vote remotely would be one of the biggest procedural changes to Congress in history — not to mention a massive and complicated undertaking that would take time to develop. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer has said that the House would “adjust our voting procedures” to comply with guidance from federal health agencies, which have strongly warned against all gatherings of more than 50 people. Democrats have considered ideas like holding the vote open longer to limit the number of lawmakers on the floor at one point. For the hidebound institution of Congress, that might be as far as lawmakers go, for now.",Push for remote voting grows as lawmakers fear coronavirus poised to spread,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/congress-remote-voting-coronavirus-144119,politico

"An appeals court declined today to review its previous decision that President Donald Trump can’t block critics on Twitter, over the objections of two judges appointed by Trump. A three-judge panel on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled in July that Trump’s practice of blocking critics from his @RealDonaldTrump account violates the First Amendment. The full court said today that it will not rehear the case, despite a request from the Justice Department. Circuit Judge Barrington Parker said in a statement accompanying the ruling that Trump uses his account as an official mode of communication. He likened the replies to a town hall meeting held by public officials. “Twitter is not just an official channel of communication for the President; it is his most important channel of communication,” wrote Parker, who had been elevated to the 2nd Circuit by President George W. Bush. But two Trump appointees — Judges Michael H. Park and Richard J. Sullivan — dissented today, saying Trump has the right to control who can interact with his ""personal"" account. “The First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech does not include a right to post on other people’s personal social media accounts, even if those other people happen to be public officials,” Park wrote in a dissent joined by Sullivan. DOJ can still appeal to the Supreme Court.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Monday afternoon that he was confident that negotiators will reach a deal soon.  “We’re very close to reaching a deal, very close and our goal is to reach a deal today and we’re hopeful, even confident, that we will meet that goal,"" Schumer said.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) delayed a key procedural vote to move forward on the emergency package, as Democrats continue to negotiate with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Democrats succeeded in blocking a similar procedural vote on Sunday.  But Republicans argued Democrats are stalling the proposal and are adding extraneous provisions onto the package that have nothing to do with the coronavirus outbreak, like fuel emission standards for airlines and more wind and solar tax credits.  ""Democrats won't let us fund hospitals or save small businesses until they get to dust off the Green New Deal,"" a visibly irritated McConnell said. ""This has got to stop. And today is the day it has to stop. The country is out of time."" Tensions on the Senate floor reached new heights Monday afternoon as lawmakers rushed to complete the deal, with Republicans berating Democrats for the delays.  ""I cannot believe objections to proceeding to this package,"" said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who worked on its small business provisions. ""Is this package perfect? No but that's why negotiations are going on ... Time is not on our side."" ""The country is burning and your side is playing political games,"" added Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). Schumer met again with Mnuchin and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland on Monday morning.  ""We look forward to a big vote today,"" Mnuchin said. ""We knocked off a bunch of things on the list already, and we're closing out issues."" The slew of meetings and conversations comes after a vote to move forward on the GOP’s package failed Sunday evening on the Senate floor, with Democrats denying Republicans the 60 votes needed. Democrats are arguing that the Republican proposal does not do enough to prioritize workers over corporations.  One of the outstanding issues for Democrats is the $500 billion “Exchange Stabilization Fund,” which is designed to assist industries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus, including $58 billion for airlines and cargo. The GOP proposal would mostly prevent companies that accept the money from buying back their own stock.  But that restriction could be waived by the Treasury Secretary — a source of significant contention for Democrats, who object to provisions that allow Mnuchin to withhold the names of the companies that receive federal money — as well as the amount — for up to six months at his discretion. Democrats are also arguing that the package doesn’t do enough to prevent layoffs and that a two-year time frame on executive compensation limits is not enough.  In addition, Democrats are pushing for unemployment provisions to last four months instead of three and include independent contractors, hundreds of billions for both hospitals and a “State Stabilization Fund” to assist states with loss of revenue and expanded provisions for more worker protections. While Republicans are accusing Democrats of adding unrelated provisions, Democrats are accusing Republicans of doing the same. A senior Democratic aide said Republicans included a provision for extending an abstinence education program that was set to expire in May as well as a provision that prevents nonprofits from receiving Small Business Administration funding. Republicans argue that the proposal they put forward is bipartisan, and already includes significant concessions on unemployment insurance and $75 billion for hospitals. In addition to those provisions, the proposal allocates $350 billion for small businesses, and would cover an estimated 58 million U.S. workers and more than 30 million small businesses, according to Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). The GOP package also includes $1,200 in direct cash payments to individuals, including to Americans with no taxable income. The payments would be phased out for individuals who earn more than $75,000. The negotiations come as the coronavirus has hit close to home for the Senate, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) becoming the first senator to test positive. In addition to Paul, Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) are all under self-quarantine. Meanwhile, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Monday that her husband has contracted the virus.  McConnell chastised Democrats Sunday evening for blocking the proposal from moving forward and accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) of interfering in the negotiations. McConnell, Schumer, Pelosi, Mnuchin and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) met in McConnell’s office on Sunday, but Pelosi left the meeting saying that the House would draft its own bill.  A draft of the House Democratic bill obtained by POLITICO goes far beyond Senate negotiators in some areas, including direct cash payments to individuals and families. The House bill would provide monthly — not one time — payments until the coronavirus crisis is officially over, with adults under specific income thresholds receiving $2,000 each and $1,000 per child. The bill would also expand popular tax credits for children and earned income that Democrats have been pushing for in the Senate talks. The House draft, which totals more than 1,100 pages with the final version expected to be even longer, covers a breadth of other areas including a drastic expansion of vote-by-mail programs, a top priority for Democrats. The White House has called for final passage of the Senate package by Monday, but it’s unclear if that goal remains feasible. Andrew Desiderio and Heather Caygle contributed to this story.

"House Democrats had billed Attorney General Bill Barr’s March 31 testimony as a crucial opportunity to unearth answers about President Donald Trump’s efforts to influence Justice Department decisions related to two former associates. Now the Judiciary Committee has postponed it indefinitely. The hearing is the latest to succumb to the lockdown on Capitol Hill, where only the Senate remains in session attempting to hammer out a massive coronavirus relief package. All matters not related to coronavirus have been effectively shelved. But the hearing with Barr, which had remained on the books despite clear indications that coronavirus concerns would force its postponement, had been viewed as a crisis-level moment for lawmakers until the pandemic swept the globe. Barr hadn’t appeared before the House Judiciary Committee in his 14-month stint as attorney general, and Democrats on the panel had pent-up questions about his handling of the report by special counsel Robert Mueller, as well as his role in the decision-making pertaining to the handling of a whistleblower report that set the stage for Trump’s impeachment for pressing Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals. And most recently, Barr had voiced exasperation at Trump over the president’s Twitter attack on prosecutors for recommending a harsh sentence for Roger Stone, a longtime Trump associate convicted for impeding the congressional investigation of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. “Due to overwhelming health and safety concerns, the @HouseJudiciary will postpone our March 31st oversight hearing with Attorney General Barr,” the panel’s chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), tweeted on Monday afternoon. “DOJ has made a commitment to rescheduling the hearing for when the crisis abates and the Committee is able to reconvene.” A Justice Department spokesman confirmed that the department had committed to rescheduling the hearing at a later date. The decision underscores the fact that nearly all inquiries and investigations led by Congress are on pause amid the coronavirus response, which has superseded nearly everything else in American life.  The hearing was announced on Feb. 12, just a week after the Senate acquitted Trump of two articles of impeachment accusing him of abuse of power and obstructing congressional investigations. Trump quickly embarked on an effort to push out of his orbit officials he viewed as having provided damaging information to lawmakers or those deemed insufficiently loyal to the president. That included the removal of the former U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., Jessie Liu, whom Trump nominated to a senior Treasury post, a nomination he subsequently withdrew. In a subsequent letter to the Justice Department, Nadler requested reams of documents and access to high-level witnesses that he said could speak to Trump’s influence on department decisions and whether politics had seeped into prosecutorial decisions. Nadler sought interviews with four Justice Department prosecutors who quit the Stone case after Barr overruled their decision to seek a sentence of more than seven years and suggested that the judge consider a lower penalty. Barr’s decision came just hours after Trump attacked the prosecutors in the case. Barr later told a television interviewer that he wished Trump would stop tweeting about Justice Department matters, a request that Trump repeatedly ignored in subsequent days.  Democrats also raised questions about Barr’s decision to tap U.S. attorneys across the country for special assignments related to some of the matters of particular interest to Trump. For example, they asked the Justice Department to interview John Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, who is leading a wide-ranging investigation into the origin of the FBI’s 2016 Trump-Russia investigation. It’s unclear whether the department provided documents at Nadler’s request. But those issues quickly faded as coronavirus became the nation’s foremost concern, sidelining all other public policy matters and congressional inquiries.",House Judiciary Committee postpones March 31 Barr hearing,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/house-judiciary-committee-postpones-barr-hearing-144522,politico
"Last August, President Donald Trump stood before workers in Western Pennsylvania where Shell Oil was building a new natural gas processing facility, and celebrated the nation’s shale boom. ""That’s our gold,” Trump declared. “That’s gold underneath our feet.""  For almost the entirety of his administration, Trump has bragged about U.S. “energy dominance” and the riches that oil and gas would bring to the country thanks to his administration’s full-throated support. Now, however, Trump’s dream of a golden, dominant energy industry is almost gone and, industry executives said, so is his full-throated support. The collapse of energy prices because of the coronavirus crisis, combined with Saudi and Russian refusals to curb production, has already forced the suspension of the Shell project that Trump touted in Western Pennsylvania. The crash is also estimated to knock out about half of all shale producers, according to analysts at Raymond James Inc., if prices remain at between $20 and $30 per barrel. (The price as of midday Monday was $22.73 per barrel by the standard West Texas Intermediate benchmark.) A price at that level would cost thousands of jobs and deal a serious blow to the vision of U.S. energy independence. ""There is no sugar coating it, U.S. oilfield activity will collapse with oil prices well below $30,"" on the WTI benchmark, said analyst Praveen Narra of Raymond James in a market update published on March 23. ""The pace of rig count declines is likely to occur at a pace we have not seen before.""  Worse, some industry executives say, Trump seems either not to recognize the threat or to be unwilling or unable to address it, touting instead his excitement over lower prices for consumers.  ""Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!"" Trump tweeted on March 9, as the domestic oil price fell by 25 percent.  In POLITICO interviews, half a dozen industry officials who have talked with White House officials in recent days described Trump as slow to comprehend the twin body blows a global pandemic and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia would have on an industry he has long supported. Oil prices at $20 a barrel threaten to rain destruction on an industry that has donated $1.8 million to Trump's re-election campaign and employs hundreds of thousands of people in states key to any hope to beat his eventual Democratic rival for the presidency. Already, Trump’s favorability is quite low in Texas – 45 percent in a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from early February, before the coronavirus crisis -- compared to other predominantly Republican states, and he similarly lags in next-door New Mexico, a Democratic-leaning state which he hopes to win. “The President wants lower gas prices to a point, but this well exceeds that point, and the administration knows this,” said Dan Eberhart, CEO of Canary LLC, a Denver-based oil services firm, and a major Republican donor who regularly speaks with senior White House officials. “The bigger worry for the administration from what I understand is helping an industry that consumers think produces fountains of gold. People that have spoken to the White House - myself included - are concerned that the administration doesn’t realize that the U.S. oil industry will eventually cease to exist at sub-$30 oil.” The White House declined to comment for this story.  So far, the energy sector has been the target for relatively little direct assistance through federal legislation compared to the transportation and financial services industries. But most industry executives said they can live with that if the administration exacts diplomatic pressure on Russia and Saudi Arabia to rein in production, a move that, if successful, could raise prices back up and put more cash in the industry’s coffers than a bailout. Oil prices began falling over the winter when Russia refused to enter a new agreement with Saudi Arabia and its fellow OPEC members to cut oil production to prop up prices. Saudi Arabia responded by saying it would lower its own prices and raise production in a bid to steal market share from Russia and bring it back to the negotiating table. Those moves represented a breakdown in the pact between the two nations that had kept their crude production in check over the past four years – a strategy that had paved the way for U.S. shale producers to move aggressively into the global market. When coronavirus started to hit in full force, global demand plunged, sending prices plummeting. Trump’s first shot at convincing Saudi Arabia that a flood of oil during a global pandemic could seriously hurt the U.S. economy came in a telephone call with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman on March 9, just as the Kingdom was starting to put its foot on the production gas pedal. A White House spokesman confirmed to POLITICO the two leaders talked, but gave no indication how the call went.  Two people with knowledge of the call told POLITICO that Trump told the Saudi leader that he was fine with the kingdom’s plans to produce more oil to try to squeeze Russia out of certain markets. He only asked that the coming flood of oil wouldn’t drive prices down far enough to hurt U.S. producers.  “Keep [prices] low, but keep it viable” for U.S. drillers to remain in business, was Trump’s message, according to a former senior administration official who was briefed on the call. “It wasn’t a difficult conversation. It was just, ‘Hey, want to make sure we’re on the same page here.’ Saudi said, ‘We gotcha.’” But the size of the resultant wave of oil, which caused prices to drop by more than 25 percent in the two weeks since the phone call, caught the administration off guard, the official said.  ""No one thought it would go quite this low,"" the person said. ""It was woah, we didn’t think it would get to this."" At a Thursday press conference, Trump again praised low gasoline prices as a stimulus to the economy, though he noted it would also damage the oil industry.  “It’s like a massive tax increase,” Trump said before correcting himself to mean a tax decrease. “That’s bigger than any tax increase — decrease that you could give. You know, we can give all these big tax cuts, but they’re paying so little for gasoline. But, on the other hand, it hurts a great industry and a very powerful industry.” That statement gave some in the industry a glass-half-full outlook. One lobbyist who requested anonymity to discuss relations with the White House said that Trump’s even mentioning a possible downside to the collapse in oil prices should be considered progress.  “That’s as close as he’s ever going to get to saying there’s a happy medium on oil prices,” the lobbyist said. “He’s beginning to understand.” Not everyone shared that view, however.  “ ‘This is a very powerful industry,’ ” quoted second long-time industry lobbyist who requested anonymity to speak candidly about his quarrels with the administration. “What the f--- does that mean? Do you understand that you’re seeing an inordinate amount of pressure on one of the largest resources in this country’s economy?” The only direct federal aid the administration has offered is a plan to expand the U.S. strategic reserve, which would provide a short-term surge in demand and boost in prices. The Department of Energy said it will buy 77 million barrels, an amount for which Senate Republicans offered $3 billion in an aid bill they offered Sunday but that failed to garner enough votes. But even that volume would be a relative drop in the bucket when Saudi Arabia is talking of increasing its own production by more than 3 million barrels per day.  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin’s proposal to spend another $20 billion on buying oil, floated on Thursday, was instantly dismissed as unrealistic as the country is already almost out of space to store it. By summer, oil companies may have to pay customers to take the oil off their hands, Mizuho bank energy analyst Paul Sankey wrote last week.  Instead, Trump will rely on his complicated relationships with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Russia – the crown prince known as MbS and Russian President Vladimir Putin – to try to preserve oil prices.  Trump might have some success in persuading Saudi Arabia to reduce production, but he has little hard leverage, said Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, senior oil analyst at Rystad Energy. The best option would be to remind the 34-year-old crown prince that Trump stuck by him even after the kingdom’s killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and imprisonment of Canadians sparked widespread condemnation. “The U.S. response to that was very mild in comparison with many other western nations who were quick to condemn it,” Rodriguez-Masiu said. “The U.S. was in particular silent.” The former senior administration official said that was, in fact, the administration's own understanding of its leverage in any future outreach to Saudi Arabia over the oil market war. “Among this administration, there’s a feeling of, ‘We stuck by you when no one else would,’ ” the former official said. “Who was there when you kidnapped Canadians? Who stuck with you with Jamal Khashoggi? Who stuck with you when you were an international pariah?’” Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has made the Mideast a key part of his White House portfolio, enjoys a good relationship with the Saudi crown prince. But the rest of the president’s team is largely untested, and industry officials openly doubt that he has the right people in place to wring concessions from two countries accustomed to hard-ball negotiations over oil drilling. The administration waited until last April to swear in retired Army General John P. Abizaid to the long-empty position of U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia. The National Security Council only recently chose Major General Miguel Correa to permanently handle matters pertaining to the Persian Gulf and North Africa, a hire the White House hasn’t formally announced yet.  In recent days, the State Department has stayed in contact with foreign governments to help calm the energy market, a senior department official said in call late Friday with reporters.  “We’ve been engaged, multiple parts of the U.S. government have been engaged, urging greater calm to the market when the economy is facing some real challenges,” the official said. When asked by POLITICO whether that diplomatic message gets muddied by Trump’s repeated praise for low gasoline prices, the official simply said “no” and declined to elaborate.  In this top-down administration, energy executives are counting on personal appeals to Trump to bolster their cause. But they aren’t sure how to make the approach. On March 19, industry representatives discussed with administration officials a draft letter asking Trump to redouble efforts to pressure Saudi Arabia to curb production, a person involved with the group told POLITICO. But staff at the State Department suggested sending the letter instead to Kushner instead, as the statement might be ""too blunt"" for the president, the person said.  At that point the companies threw the letter away, the person added. In the absence of action by Trump, some officials outside the administration are making their own overtures to influential industry figures outside the United States.  Ryan Sitton, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission, the entity that regulates oil and gas drilling, told POLITICO that he called OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo on Friday and talked to the cartel leader for an hour about how the oil crash was hurting the global economy. Sitton said Barkindo told him that he couldn’t take any official action until OPEC’s next meeting in June. “I might connect with the Saudi oil minister and the Russia oil minister,” Sitton continued. He also said he talked to White House officials, though he said the COVID-19 response was distracting them from the havoc in the energy industry. “They don’t have a lot of bandwidth,” Sitton said. “Yes, they know the energy industry is sharing in the crisis, but they’ve got a whole lot of areas that are bigger priorities right now. My objective is to find solutions so when the president does have the bandwidth to move on this we have some options for him to move positively.""",Oil execs to Trump: Whose side are you on?,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/donald-trump-oil-executives-144499,politico

"BRUSSELS — European governments have a brutal message to deliver: The coronavirus lockdown cannot go on too long or the consequences of economic meltdown could be even more deadly than the disease.  As countries across the world announce lockdowns and multibillion-euro bailouts, they know these can only offer short-term fixes. National leaders have one eye squarely on the calendar and are trying to calculate when they are going to have to tell people to get back to work, even if that will reignite infections and high death tolls. It is French President Emmanuel Macron who has most starkly expressed the challenges of balancing measures like self-isolation and social distancing against the imperative to keep the economy running. ""It is impossible to live — even in self-isolation — and to cure people, if we do not continue the economic activity that, quite simply, permits us to live in this country,” he said while chairing an ""economy task force"" dealing with the outbreak. Macron is also the most prominent voice to warn people that a vaccine is not imminent, and probably won't arrive until the end of 2021. The message is clear: It won't be possible for people to stay at home until then. It's an excruciating trade-off. On the one hand, social-distancing measures can minimize contagion and death tolls, but a deep economic depression will sap the government revenues that pay for public health services and utilities. Countries with uncollected waste, failing water supplies and intermittent power could prove as dangerous as the virus. The problem is that, as soon as the lockdowns end, the infections and deaths will soar again. ""It’s a very difficult balancing act,"" said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe director at EurasiaGroup, a political risk consultancy firm. ""It’s not clear that any government has a credible exit strategy."" Macron was the first EU leader to admit that nobody knows “how long we’ll have to keep this reduction of social contacts,"" he said Thursday. That’s because the extreme social distancing seen in Italy, Spain, France, Belgium and other EU countries will not make the pandemic disappear. It can only slow it in an attempt to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. Research from Imperial College London shows that epidemiologists and doctors believe even the most radical social-distancing measures can only provide temporary respite.  As soon as governments lift the measures, as China is doing now to save its economy, cases will explode again, said Christian Drosten, a German virologist who developed the coronavirus test and has advised the German government on containing the disease. “As a doctor trained in infectious disease epidemiology, I can only say the same thing that all my colleagues say too,” he said in a podcast. ""With the resurgence of public life, infections will resurge as well."" Experts agree that a vaccine will only be available in one year or even 18 months.  But maintaining social-distancing for that duration would be untenable, and likely result in a global depression. The OECD forecasts global growth will slow down to 2.4 percent in 2020 due to the pandemic, down from the 2.9 percent forecast last winter. Under a “longer lasting and more intensive coronavirus outbreak” spreading through the U.S. and Europe, global growth would drop to 1.5 percent. A study by Munich-based Ifo Institute published Monday estimates economic losses in Germany could range from from 7.2 percent of GDP for a two-month period of disruption to 20.6 percent under a worst-case scenario for a three-month outage. “Policymakers are actively shutting down large economies. That’s why the extent of the recession we’re looking at in the eurozone could be 10 percent of GDP, maybe even more,"" said Rahman.  At some point, it may simply become untenable to keep up mass restrictions.  In Modena, Italy, nine detainees lost their lives in a prison riot, some due to overdose, shortly after lockdown measures were imposed in the province. The revolts spread to other prisons in Venice, Milan, Bologna, Rome, Rieti, Naples, Meli, Palermo. Across Italy, the army is now being deployed to police the social-distancing measures. China has chosen to give up up on the most radical forms of containment and prioritize economic growth in the coming months.  ""What is happening in China now ... is that businesses are getting back to work,"" Drosten said. ""We have seen that the quarantine measures have caused so much economic pain that they have to be retracted/cut back."" ""What we are going to see now ... is that in the coming weeks and months it's going to explode again in China,"" he added. He cautioned that Beijing would likely try to keep any new surge under wraps. ""We will not see any more reliable case reports from China in the near future,"" he said, as Beijing ""wants the problem to be solved now in China. But of course it won't be solved."" For Europe, this means that governments will soon need to decide how to proceed — and to communicate that to their population.  In countries where the lockdowns are just beginning, the question of “what now” is being answered in a piecemeal manner. France is sending out a double message. Even as the government orders people to stay home, it is already issuing calls to go back to work and encouraging businesses to issue a one-off payment of up to €1,000 to those who do.  ""I invite all the federations, all the large companies ... to pay this premium of €1,000 euros totally tax-free to their employees,” Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said Friday. In Italy, the worst-hit country, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the lockdown — planned to end on March 25 — will be extended, but didn’t give an end-date. So far, production hasn't ground to a halt. After spontaneous strikes mushroomed in factories and shipyards as workers feared contagion, trade unions negotiated a safety protocol for workers with the government and employers. But the question has yet to be resolved. On Sunday the Italian government issued a new decree effective from today putting a halt to all ""nonessential"" economic activities, to further crack down on the spread of the virus. In response, trade unions are threatening a general strike as the list of permitted activities includes producing tractors and manufacturing tobacco products, activities they argue should not be considered essential. In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson is playing delaying tactics. “Our objective is to delay and flatten the peak of the epidemic by bringing forward the right measures at the right time, so that we minimize suffering and save lives,” he said last week. He later added that “we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks” and expect the first trials for a vaccine to start within a month. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, where meetings of more than two people were banned over the weekend, is also buying time: “There is still no therapy against the coronavirus nor a vaccine. As long as this is the case, there is only one thing we can do, and that is to slow down the spread of the virus, stretch it over the months and thus gain time,” she said in a highly unusual national address. So far, no government has communicated a long-term plan. Between an economic meltdown and accepting eye-watering fatality rates from the virus, there may be a third way. If testing becomes more widely available in the coming months, governments may find out that a large percentage of the population has already had an asymptomatic infection. That may be the moment when countries start lifting social distancing measures.  Drosten said he expects antibody tests — which show past infections against which the body has developed defenses — will become available “in the coming weeks.” The Imperial College London study offers another approach: A phase of alternating lockdowns and relaxations over a total period of two years, during which governments relax social distancing measures for about a month, every three months or so.  Sébastien Maillard, director of the Jacques Delors Institute in Paris, said he expects “a moment more of strict confinement, gradually back to a functional economy, and perhaps unfortunately later in the year we’d have to go back to social confinement until we get that vaccine.” Researchers warned that any periods of respite would be short. “Social distancing — plus school and university closure, if used — need to be in force for the majority of the two years of the simulation,” the study's authors wrote. This leaves governments with the same dilemma: They will need to prepare their populations for either a year or more under lockdown, or for massive deaths in the coming months. Neither is an easy sell. ""There will be a before and an after"" this pandemic, said Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton. ""Hopefully the human price will be limited. The economic price will be high."" Want more analysis from POLITICO? POLITICO Pro is our premium intelligence service for professionals.

"Republicans' top super PAC focused on Senate races is booking more than $67 million for TV ads this fall, a massive early investment in a core group of battleground states. The Senate Leadership Fund, which is run by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is reserving $67.1 million in TV ads across six Senate states — including McConnell's home state of Kentucky — starting the day after Labor Day and running through Election Day, according to details shared exclusively with POLITICO. The sum is more than double the amount the super PAC booked in its initial TV ad investment for the 2018 midterms and at least $25 million more than they initially booked in 2016. The ads were booked to run in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine and North Carolina, all states with Republican incumbents that are considered critical to the Senate majority. The initial investments did not include Alabama and Michigan, the two Democrat-held seats where Republicans are on offense. Additional investments in other Senate races are likely to come as the campaigns unfold. “Protecting our Republican Senate majority has become synonymous with ensuring a firewall against the Democrats’ far-left ambitions,"" Steven Law, the president of SLF, said in a statement. ""This initial investment won’t be our last, but it is more than double what we initially reserved in 2018, and it demonstrates we intend to hold the line.” The largest portion of the investment is in North Carolina, where SLF has booked $21.8 million in the race between first-term GOP Sen. Thom Tillis and Democrat Cal Cunningham. The state is likely to be among the most expensive in the country this fall, given its status as a presidential battleground that also includes competitive Senate, gubernatorial and House races. Democrats expended significant resources to boost Cunningham through the March primary, and SLF also spent nearly $3 million meddling in the primary on positive ads for his failed Democratic opponent. Iowa is the second-greatest investment, with $12.6 million booked in the race featuring first-term Republican Sen. Joni Ernst. Democrats have rallied around businesswoman Theresa Greenfield, though she faces several other candidates in a June primary. National Democrats have already been on the airwaves boosting Greenfield's image in the state. They are also spending in Arizona and Kentucky using state-based affiliates through Defend Arizona, which was active in the 2018 Senate race, and Keep Kentucky Great, a new organization created last week, according to a recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. Keep Kentucky Great will spend $10.8 million as McConnell, the majority leader, runs seeking a seventh term. Defend Arizona will spend $9.2 million in the special election between GOP Sen. Martha McSally, who was appointed to the Senate after losing in 2018, and Democrat Mark Kelly, the best-funded candidate in the country. In Maine, where Sen. Susan Collins is facing the toughest reelection of her career, SLF booked $7.2 million for the fall. And in Colorado, Democrats' top pickup target, SLF booked $5.5 million to defend first-term GOP Sen. Cory Gardner. Senate Majority PAC, Democrats' top outside group, has not yet booked its fall advertising, but has already been active in several Senate races.

"Half of Americans give President Donald Trump positive marks for his management of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a new survey, and his approval rating has seen a marginal improvement over the past month as the pandemic has worsened.  A Monmouth University poll released Monday reports that 50 percent of respondents believe Trump has done a “good job” dealing with the outbreak, while 45 percent say he has done a “bad job.” Three percent of those surveyed said they had a mixed review of Trump’s performance, and 1 percent did not have an opinion.  The president’s net positive rating is starkly partisan, with 89 percent of Republicans, 48 percent of independents and 19 percent of Democrats assessing that he has done a “good job” handling the public health crisis.  Additionally, 46 percent of Americans now approve of the job Trump is doing as president — an increase from 44 percent in February. Trump’s overall on-the-job rating was also sharply divided along partly lines, with 91 percent of Republicans, 44 percent of independents and 11 percent of Democrats approving. Still, both metrics likely represent good news for the White House, as Trump continues to battle criticism for his early dismissals of the coronavirus’ threat to Americans and current refusal to mount a more sweeping federal response. The survey’s results come after an ABC News/Ipsos poll published Friday showed that 55 percent of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the rapidly spreading disease, up from a 43 percent approval rating of his efforts a week prior. The Monmouth University poll was conducted March 18-22, surveying 851 adults. Its margin of sampling error is plus-or-minus 3.4 percentage points.",Poll: Half of Americans approve of Trump’s coronavirus response,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/poll-half-of-americans-approve-of-trumps-coronavirus-response-144197,politico
"Former campaign workers for Mike Bloomberg are suing the billionaire former presidential candidate for fraud, alleging in a nationwide class action lawsuit that as many as 2,000 employees were promised to be paid though the general election before he laid them off. Plaintiffs in the class action include two organizers who halted the interview process for other jobs to join the Bloomberg campaign, and another former organizer who postponed law school to work on Bloomberg’s 2020 effort.  The filing comes on the same day as another class action brought by a former Bloomberg field organizer that similarly argues the employees were tricked into taking jobs they were told would continue for a year.  The lawsuit by the three former workers in Georgia, Utah and Washington state, also filed in federal court in New York City, contends that the field organizers were fraudulently induced to accept jobs with the Bloomberg campaign based on the promise of guaranteed salaries though November. The ex-field staffers who filed the suit, Alexis Sklair, Nathaniel Brown, and Sterling Rettke, are represented by Peter Romer-Friedman of Gupta Wessler PLLC, and Ilann M. Maazel and David Berman of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady LLP. Bloomberg on Friday purged all of those workers in six battleground states and guaranteed they would be paid only through the first week of April, with their benefits expiring at the end of that month. The first big round of layoffs across the rest of the country happened earlier this month, with their pay lasting though March 31. Bloomberg hiring materials described as coming from headquarters promised work with “Team Bloomberg” though November, regardless of whether he became the Democratic nominee, provided that the aides working across the country were willing to relocate. Bloomberg’s team reiterated their plans to follow though — even if only in spirit — after the initial round of layoffs, when top campaign advisers indicated in emails and staff conference calls that they would be given priority on a planned Bloomberg super PAC. Instead, Bloomberg announced Friday that he had decided to transfer $18 million of his own money to the Democratic National Committee to help presumptive nominee Joe Biden. The campaign invited former field organizers to apply for jobs with the party through its “competitive process,” with no guarantee of a job. ""Thousands of people relied on that promise. They moved to other cities. They gave up school, jobs, and job opportunities. They uprooted their lives,"" the lawsuit states. ""But the promise was false. After Bloomberg lost the Democratic nomination, his campaign unceremoniously dumped thousands of staffers, leaving them with no employment, no income, and no health insurance.  ""And, worse still, the Bloomberg campaign did this during the worst global pandemic since 1918, in the face of a looming economic crisis. Now thousands of people who relied on the Bloomberg campaign’s promise are left to fend for themselves.""  Bloomberg aides were also told that the field offices in battleground states would remain open. A Bloomberg spokesperson issued a statement Monday saying the campaign paid its staff wages and benefits that were ""much more generous"" than any other campaign this year. They said staff worked 39 days on average, but they were also given several weeks of severance and healthcare through March. ""Given the current crisis, a fund is being created to ensure that all staff receive health care through April, which no other campaign has done,"" the spokesperson said. ""And many field staff will go on to work for the DNC in battleground states, in part because the campaign made the largest monetary transfer to the DNC from a presidential campaign in history to support the DNC’s organizing efforts.” Attorney for one of the group of litigants said in a statement that while ""our clients would like to speak publicly about their experiences, they are potentially subject to a confidentiality and non-disparagement agreement with Mike Bloomberg 2020. We respectfully request that the Bloomberg campaign release our clients and the other field staffers from that agreement, even though it may not be enforceable.” Attorneys not working on the cases said such class action lawsuits are often combined.  Bloomberg field organizers were among the highest compensated in the election cycle, and enjoyed generous health benefits, in addition to $5,000 for relocation costs.  While all of the field organizers are believed to have signed at-will contracts with the campaign, they argue in the lawsuit that they can bring these claims based on evidence that they were induced to sign on because of the longevity promises made to them.  The promise of sustained pay months after a campaign ends is exceedingly rare in politics. But in more than a dozen interviews with POLITICO, the former aides said it was key to their decision to join. Bloomberg quickly amassed a staff of thousands after launching in November, then ended his campaign after a feeble showing on Super Tuesday. Since news of their dismissal, scores of former Bloomberg staffers have been organizing online in preparation for taking legal action. They’ve established several chat and email groups to share their experiences, with many expressing deep frustrations about losing their pay and health care benefits in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.  Aside from the action filed Monday, there are believed to be other claims coming from other groups of ex-staffers. The lawsuit states that Sklair relocated from Charleston, S.C. to Savannah, Ga., to work as a field organizer for Bloomberg. Before joining the Bloomberg campaign, she was an organizer for Cory Booker’s presidential campaign.  At the time that Sklair accepted the job with Bloomberg, the lawsuit states, she had just been offered a position on a state Senate campaign in South Carolina that would have likely lasted throughout the general election. After taking the job with Bloomberg, she declined to move forward. Brown worked as an organizer for Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign and moved from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City, Utah to work for Bloomberg in January. He said he dropped out of advanced stages of the hiring process for a job as an organizer with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Rettke postponed applying for law school to work on Bloomberg’s bid.",Bloomberg sued by aides for stiffing them on yearlong pay promise,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/mike-bloomberg-aides-pay-lawsuits-144185,politico
"Five more governors on Monday moved to place restrictions on their states' residents in an effort to blunt the spread of coronavirus. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, took the most dramatic action, ordering residents to stay home except for essential outings and ordering non-essential businesses to tell employees not to report to work, effective at midnight Tuesday. Whitmer's order, which will remain in place for at least the next three weeks, comes as the governor noted the state went from having zero reported cases of the virus to more than 1,000 in under two weeks, though such an increase was somewhat expected as testing kits became more widely accessible. Republican Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts stopped short of ordering residents to stay inside, but both on Monday ordered all non-essential businesses in their states closed. Maryland’s restrictions go into place at 5 p.m., while Baker’s order takes effect beginning at noon on Tuesday and will extend until at least April 7. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers teased that his own shelter in place order would come Tuesday, dubbing the initiative “Safer at Home.” In a string of tweets, Evers noted that the order would walk back his previous declaration that he would not be issuing a shelter-in-place order. Evers, a Democrat, said more details of his order would become available in the next day. West Virginia, the last state in the country to report its first coronavirus case, unveiled its own shelter-in-place order Monday afternoon, with Gov. Jim Justice announcing the restrictions will go into effect on Tuesday at 8 p.m. The flurry of measures announced Monday follow in the footsteps of eight other state leaders who have issued similar mandatory orders: Ohio, Louisiana and Delaware issued stay at home orders on Sunday, joining California, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut. Last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered all non-essential workers to stay home. The new action in recent days comes amid reluctance by President Donald Trump to mandate social distancing measures at the federal level, despite a number of state leaders pleading for the president to order fixes to what they've complained is a patchwork pattern of restrictions across the country. Trump said Friday he would not be ordering any kind of shelter in place restrictions at the federal level, citing an unevenness in infections in different parts of the country. Rather than push for further social distancing, the president has begun to signal a growing skepticism to en-mass lockdowns the economic devastation they have caused throughout the country.",Five more governors announce new restrictions to curb coronavirus ,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/four-more-governors-announce-new-restrictions-to-curb-coronavirus-144240,politico
"A growing number of lawmakers are pleading for Congress to start working — and voting — from home as millions of Americans are ordered to shelter in place to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Nearly 70 House Democrats on Monday sent a letter to their leadership in support of voting remotely amid the coronavirus crisis, an unprecedented step that comes as the virus has infected three members of Congress. Many lawmakers and aides of both parties privately fear that the virus could spread rapidly on Capitol Hill if the House decides to return from recess and put roughly 435 lawmakers in the same room to vote. The letter, led by Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), urges House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) — whose panel is reviewing the possibility of remote voting — to allow for a temporary rule change at a time of national emergency. “Congress should be no exception to adapting to this crisis,” the letter reads. “The House must adopt remote voting both to protect public health and to allow us to be the voices of our constituents.” The letter includes senior Democrats like House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), as well as several West Coast lawmakers, like Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna, Pete Aguilar and Barbara Lee, all of California. The pressure is also growing in the Senate, which remains in session this week as negotiators from both parties attempt to reach a nearly $2 trillion deal that would expand the nation’s ability to deal with the crisis, on both the public health and economic front. Two GOP senators on Monday came out publicly in support of voting remotely, one day after one of their colleagues, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), announced that he was positive for the virus. “I’m ready to support remote voting,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) tweeted on Monday. “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. It is time to bring the Senate into the 21st century.”  Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C) — who had previously been lukewarm on the idea of voting electronically — also changed his stance. “We should make this change before the Senate leaves town,” Graham tweeted on Monday. For Republicans, the threat of the virus could also pose a numbers problem: As of Monday, five GOP senators are sidelined from voting on the Senate floor because Paul is battling the infection and four others are self-quarantining after possible exposure. That further narrows the margins for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as he attempts to muscle a massive economic rescue package through the chamber in short order. Anxiety has been mounting in the Capitol, particularly after Paul’s diagnosis on Sunday. The Kentucky senator had been in the building, attending meetings, voting on the floor and even using the Senate gym as he awaited the results of his test. Paul said he had not been aware of specific exposure. But House and Senate leaders have warned that allowing members to vote remotely would be one of the biggest procedural changes to Congress in history — not to mention a massive and complicated undertaking that would take time to develop. Some members have also raised security concerns with the prospects of voting electronically, especially if the system is created on a tight timeline with room for error. ""There is definitely a debate going on, certainly among the freshman, about what's the right thing for us to do. Is it for us to get on airplanes and get on vehicles and get down to Washington and vote in person?"" Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) said in an interview Monday. ""For me, while I think it’s interesting think about remote voting later on, I’m concerned about the security."" ""Everyone’s working at such a breakneck pace that anything we establish right now wouldn’t go through the vetting to actually do a very historical thing,"" Slotkin said. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer has said that the House would “adjust our voting procedures” to comply with guidance from federal health agencies, which have strongly warned against all gatherings of more than 50 people. Democrats have considered ideas like holding the vote open longer to limit the number of lawmakers on the floor at one point. For the hidebound institution of Congress, that might be as far as lawmakers go, for now.",Push for remote voting grows as lawmakers fear coronavirus poised to spread,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/congress-remote-voting-coronavirus-144119,politico
"President Donald Trump is broadcasting his growing impatience with public health measures meant to combat the coronavirus pandemic — even as senior administration officials are promoting those directives as critical to preventing further loss of life and predicting a grim week ahead. ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" Trump wrote on Twitter shortly before midnight on Sunday. ""AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!"" The president's message, which continued into Monday with a series of retweets, referred to the administration's ""15 Days to Slow the Spread"" initiative, announced last week.  The White House coronavirus task force has urged Americans to practice social distancing; avoid gatherings of more than 10 people; work or attend school from home whenever possible; and abstain from eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts. At the task force's daily press briefing on Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence noted that the country was seven days into the effort and praised Americans' participation thus far. ""With the cooperation, compassion, generosity, and prayers of the American people, we can slow the spread, we can protect the most vulnerable, and we can heal our land,"" Pence said. ""So let's do it, America.""  But while the guidance may be helping ""flatten the curve"" of infected individuals within the United States, it has also contributed to a precipitous drop in economic activity. Unemployment claims are surging across the nation, and forecasters are predicting a depression-level decline in second-quarter GDP. Even more stringent directives issued by state and local authorities, such as large-scale ""shelter-in-place"" orders, have similarly spooked financial markets and provoked fears of an imminent recession.  A number of states rolled out new orders on Monday, including Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, West Virginia and Wisconsin, while the mayor of Washington, D.C., announced she was deploying the national guard to prevent crowds from gathering to gawk at the cherry blossoms blooming along the Potomac River. On Monday morning, Trump promoted a very different approach, retweeting a handful of accounts that proposed Americans return to work in the near future and advocated for a resumption of daily life in the U.S.  ""The fear of the virus cannot collapse our economy that President Trump has built up,"" read a tweet shared by the president. ""We The People are smart enough to keep away from others if we know that we are sick or they are sick! After 15 days are over the world can begin to heal!"" In another post Trump retweeted, a Twitter user wrote that after 15 days, ""we keep the high risk groups protected as necessary and the rest of us go back to work.""  The president's social media activity came as Surgeon General Jerome Adams made a string of appearances on morning news shows, repeatedly cautioning that the coming days would prove among the most difficult in Americans' fight against the public health crisis. Adams is one of a number of senior administration officials who have argued that social distancing recommendations will need to be sustained, not slackened, to curb the swift spread of COVID-19, and cautioned that its threat to Americans will last longer than initially thought. ""I want America to understand: This week, it's going to get bad,"" Adams told NBC's ""Today"" show, adding that ""we really, really need everyone to stay at home."" The increased availability of testing and the disease's rapid rate of transmission are expected to result in an eruption of new cases of COVID-19, which has already infected more than 35,000 people across all 50 states and produced at least 473 deaths. Because of limited testing capacity, experts agree the actual number of positive cases is much higher. ""As the nation's doctor, I'm here to help America understand how we need to respond to this,"" Adams said Monday, when pressed on Trump's weekend tweet previewing an impending ""decision"" on the administration's guidelines.  ""And where I come down is that every single day counts,"" the surgeon general continued. ""Every single second counts. And right now, there are not enough people out there who are taking this seriously."" In an interview on Wednesday with NBC, Adams acknowledged that 15 days of preventative measures is ""likely not going to be enough"" time to successfully halt the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S.  Pence, who is leading the administration's management of the outbreak, made an even bleaker prediction a day earlier, saying that ""according to some of our modeling, we could well be dealing with coronavirus cases in the United States well into July."" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also offered an inconclusive response when asked on Friday how long Americans would have to remain socially distant.  ""I cannot see that all of a sudden, next week or two weeks from now, it's going to be over,"" he said. ""I don't think there's a chance of that. I think it's going to be several weeks."" According to an internal report from the Department of Health and Human Services, produced last weekend and first reported on by The New York Times, the pandemic ""will last 18 months or longer and could include multiple waves of illness."" Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said on Monday that Trump's weekend tweet hinting at a potential suspension of social distancing ""seems very counterproductive.""  ""The need for intense social distancing is very strong right now,"" Lipsitch said, noting that an abrupt end to the practice could eventually overwhelm health care providers. ""We should be thinking about not how bad it is now, but how bad it could be in three weeks,"" he added. ""It takes three weeks before you need intensive care if you're getting sick, so we have to act now to stop what's coming three weeks from now."" Those dire assessments clash with rising complaints from some of the president's top advisers and conservatives supporters that the economic devastation wrought by social distancing could prove more damaging than the coronavirus' human toll.  ""We can't shut in the economy. The economic cost to individuals is just too great,"" National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told Fox News in an interview on Monday.  ""The president is right: The cure can't be worse than the disease, and we're going to have to make some difficult trade-offs,"" Kudlow said, adding that he ""spoke to the president about this very subject"" late Sunday evening.  ""We'll be looking at a number of different things,"" he said. ""Let's give it another week."" ""I think it is soon becoming time to have old and/or sick people take every precaution and healthy people go back to work forever changed [with] new habits in a grimmer reality,"" tweeted Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. Fox News host Laura Ingraham expressed frustration with the uncertain time frame for the federal government's guidelines, writing that going back to work after 15 days ""will require new protocols"" including wearing personal protective equipment.  ""A global recession would be worse for our people than the Great Depression. Doctors provide medical treatment and cures—they should not be the determinative voices in policy making now or at the end of 15 days,"" Ingraham tweeted. ""Even another week of this will mean millions more out of work, massive damage to businesses big and small, rental incomes, families at every income level, horrific pain and suffering,"" she continued in another post. ""But if we knew this was almost over, recovery would be easier."" It is not only White House allies who have begun to warn of the consequences of a protracted period of social distancing. Wall Street power brokers, some public health experts and at least one Democratic governor on the front lines of the outbreak have suggested that the U.S. workforce should begin preparing for a return to normalcy.  Lloyd Blankfein, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, asserted that while ""extreme measures to flatten the virus 'curve'"" were reasonable to ""stretch out the strain"" on health care systems, ""crushing the economy, jobs and morale is also a health issue-and beyond."" ""Within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work,"" he tweeted. David Katz, the founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, encouraged a ""more surgical approach"" to counter the coronavirus, writing in a New York Times op-ed on Friday that resources should be focused on the especially vulnerable. The rest of Americans, meanwhile, would re-enter society and ""develop natural herd immunity to the virus"" while stabilizing the economy. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, the current epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., referenced Katz's theory on Monday. During his daily news conference, Cuomo emphasized the ""parallel tracks"" of securing public health and beginning ""to plan the pivot back to economic functionality.""  ""You can't stop the economy forever, so we have to start to think about, does everyone stay out of work? Should young people go back to work sooner?"" Cuomo said. ""You turned off the engine quickly,"" he added. ""How do you now start or begin to restart or plan the restart of that economic engine? Separate task, but something that we have to focus on.""

"The Senate reached a critical pressure point on Monday as Democrats tanked another procedural vote while they negotiate a nearly $2 trillion coronavirus economic rescue package.  The vote’s failure — which comes after four days of frenetic talks — further frustrated Senate Republicans and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has aggressively pushed for a deal by Monday. Every Democrat voted against moving forward on Monday’s procedural vote except Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.).  Despite the hurdles, Senate Democrats and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin still insisted Monday afternoon that they are nearing a deal on a package that would help blunt the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis. McConnell chastised Senate Democrats after the vote for delaying negotiations and said they were putting the Senate in a position that could delay a final vote until Friday or Saturday.  ""While people are losing their jobs, losing their income, and shutting down the economy, which we have had to do to deal with this public health crisis, they are fiddling around with Senate procedure that could, if one senator objected, take us all the way to the end of the week to solve this problem,"" McConnell said. ""I'm beginning to think our Democratic colleagues don't understand the procedures of the Senate."" Minutes after the Senate’s failed vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced from the speaker’s balcony that House Democrats are unveiling their own version on Monday. Pelosi said the Democrats’ package would focus on immediately helping people in need, through direct payments — like expanded unemployment insurance, the child tax credit, and earned income tax credit — and other measures, such as reducing student debt burdens and expanded food stability programs.  “We must be bold and forward looking in our thinking,” Pelosi said, describing the outbreak as “one of the most serious health and economic emergencies out nation has ever faced.” Asked about a House floor schedule, Pelosi said she “hoped” that the House would vote on a package this week.  ""That is a hope yes, but we'll see what the Senate does,” she said.  Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are rushing to finish negotiations with the Trump administration on the massive emergency rescue package. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Monday afternoon that he was confident that negotiators will reach an agreement soon.  “We’re very close to reaching a deal, very close and our goal is to reach a deal today and we’re hopeful, even confident, that we will meet that goal,"" Schumer said.  But Republicans argued Democrats are stalling the proposal and are adding extraneous provisions onto the package that have nothing to do with the coronavirus outbreak, like fuel emission standards for airlines and more wind and solar tax credits.  ""Democrats won't let us fund hospitals or save small businesses until they get to dust off the Green New Deal,"" a visibly irritated McConnell said. ""This has got to stop. And today is the day it has to stop. The country is out of time."" Tensions on the Senate floor reached new heights Monday afternoon as lawmakers rushed to complete the deal, with Republicans berating Democrats for the delays.  ""I cannot believe objections to proceeding to this package,"" said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who worked on its small business provisions. ""Is this package perfect? No but that's why negotiations are going on ... Time is not on our side."" ""The country is burning and your side is playing political games,"" added Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). Schumer met again with Mnuchin and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland on Monday morning.  ""We look forward to a big vote today,"" Mnuchin said. ""We knocked off a bunch of things on the list already, and we're closing out issues."" The slew of meetings and conversations comes after a vote to move forward on the GOP’s package failed Sunday evening on the Senate floor, with Democrats denying Republicans the 60 votes needed. Democrats are arguing that the Republican proposal does not do enough to prioritize workers over corporations.  One of the outstanding issues for Democrats is the $500 billion “Exchange Stabilization Fund,” which is designed to assist industries that have been hit hard by the coronavirus, including $58 billion for airlines and cargo. The GOP proposal would mostly prevent companies that accept the money from buying back their own stock.  But that restriction could be waived by the Treasury Secretary — a source of significant contention for Democrats, who object to provisions that allow Mnuchin to withhold the names of the companies that receive federal money — as well as the amount — for up to six months at his discretion. Democrats are also arguing that the package doesn’t do enough to prevent layoffs and that a two-year time frame on executive compensation limits is not enough.  In addition, Democrats are pushing for unemployment provisions to last four months instead of three and include independent contractors, hundreds of billions for both hospitals and a “State Stabilization Fund” to assist states with loss of revenue and expanded provisions for more worker protections. While Republicans are accusing Democrats of adding unrelated provisions, Democrats are accusing Republicans of doing the same. A senior Democratic aide said Republicans included a provision for extending an abstinence education program that was set to expire in May as well as a provision that prevents nonprofits from receiving Small Business Administration funding. Republicans argue that the proposal they put forward is bipartisan, and already includes significant concessions on unemployment insurance and $75 billion for hospitals. In addition to those provisions, the proposal allocates $350 billion for small businesses, and would cover an estimated 58 million U.S. workers and more than 30 million small businesses, according to Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). The GOP package also includes $1,200 in direct cash payments to individuals, including to Americans with no taxable income. The payments would be phased out for individuals who earn more than $75,000. The negotiations come as the coronavirus has hit close to home for the Senate, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) becoming the first senator to test positive. In addition to Paul, Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) are all under self-quarantine. Meanwhile, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Monday that her husband has contracted the virus.  McConnell has also accused Pelosi of interfering in the negotiations. McConnell, Schumer, Pelosi, Mnuchin and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) met in McConnell’s office on Sunday, but Pelosi left the meeting saying that the House would draft its own bill.  A draft of the House Democratic bill obtained by POLITICO goes far beyond Senate negotiators in some areas, including direct cash payments to individuals and families. The House bill would provide monthly — not one time — payments until the coronavirus crisis is officially over, with adults under specific income thresholds receiving $2,000 each and $1,000 per child. The bill would also expand popular tax credits for children and earned income that Democrats have been pushing for in the Senate talks. The House draft, which totals more than 1,100 pages with the final version expected to be even longer, covers a breadth of other areas including a drastic expansion of vote-by-mail programs, a top priority for Democrats. The White House has called for final passage of the Senate package by Monday, but it’s unclear if that goal remains feasible. Andrew Desiderio and Heather Caygle contributed to this story.

"The 2008 financial crisis reshaped American politics, birthing a politics of outrage in the Tea Party on the right and an enduring strain of progressive populism on the left. The coronavirus is already on a similar trajectory, triggering massive prospective bailouts and other policy proposals that stand to rewire the Republican and Democratic parties for a generation — or longer. Last week, Republicans joined Democrats — and in some cases got in front of them — in calling for direct payments to Americans to help cope with the economic fallout from the pandemic. The Trump administration, after laboring for years to repeal Obamacare, said it was considering creating a special enrollment period for the program due to the coronavirus. When Donald Trump himself suggested the government could take equity stakes in private companies that receive federal aid, it was a Democratic governor, Colorado’s Jared Polis, who accused the president of being a socialist. The immediate effects of the pandemic on blurring the parties’ ideological distinctions have been acute — and the virus’ toll still remains far from reaching its peak. “It’s crazy,” said Kelly Dietrich, founder of the National Democratic Training Committee, which trains candidates across the country. “Up is down, north is south.” Or as Mike Madrid, a longtime Republican strategist in California, put it, “It’s kind of nuts.” He said, “We are in for extraordinary change.” Over the weekend, Republicans and Democrats neared a deal on a rescue package that could cost at least $1.6 trillion, the most expensive such package in U.S. history. Bipartisan support for such a measure has been heralded by Democrats as an endorsement of expansive government intervention — in large part because elements of the spending, including $250 billion in direct payments to Americans, are now a priority of Republicans. Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a former Agriculture secretary in the Obama administration, said in an email that the “song of ‘government is the problem not the solution’ and the ‘era of big government is over’ may not be [an] underlying theme from this point forward.” And former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said “some of the issues that are being proposed and voted on now are going to become the norm in our political system, both with Republicans and Democrats.” He predicted that new normal including paid sick leave, and even guaranteed income of some kind. “In other words,” Richardson said, “the era of big government is back, and both parties are going to embrace it to resolve problems. And [the change] is caused by the virus.” Republicans, too, see this shift unfolding. As negotiations over a rescue picked up in Washington last week, it was Republicans pressing for direct cash assistance to Americans, irritating progressive Democrats who feared the GOP was out-flanking the Democratic Party on the left. As the two sides maneuvered, Sal Russo, a former Ronald Reagan aide and Tea Party Express co-founder, recalled the speeches he gave years ago about the esteem of the federal government swelling amid the New Deal and through the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, before eroding in recent generations. Now, he said, “You’ve got the federal government … doing good deeds again. Russo predicted Congress will “get excessive” in its coronavirus response. But he said most Americans will see its involvement positively and that “this may be a boost for the role of the federal government.” “In some ways,” he said, “the promoters of big government should hope Trump is a hero.” The prospect of upheaval isn’t an abstract notion. The 9/11 terrorist attacks — and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that resulted from them — spurred an anti-interventionist movement that led to Barack Obama’s nomination in 2008 and still resonates within the Democratic Party. The financial disaster in 2008 conceived not only the Tea Party, but an Occupy Wall Street movement that shifted the national conversation around economic inequality and the “1 percent” — catalyzing the rise of the populist progressive wing of the Democratic Party. But unlike many past crises, the coronavirus pandemic has caused turmoil in the economy, public health and politics all at once. The death toll is rising. The stock market is in freefall. The virus has consumed Trump’s presidency and his re-election prospects, and it has all but frozen the Democratic presidential primary in time. “Parties go back and forth, and they change somewhat,” said Ron Kaufman, the Republican National Committee treasurer and a former adviser to George H.W. Bush. “And this is going to be a big change.” Kaufman said the longer-lasting effect of the pandemic may not be a sustained appetite to spend, but an eventual “sea change” politically as fiscal conservatives attempt to reconcile debt from the coronavirus response. “That will change our foreign policy viewpoint, it will change our military viewpoint … It’s going to change how we look at our place in the world,” Kaufman said. The effect of the pandemic, he said, is that “both parties are going to have to – we’re going to have to come to the left and they’re going to have to come to the right a little bit.” That the parties are coming together at all on major legislation is, of itself, a remarkable turn from the intransigence that has defined Washington since Trump won election in 2016 and Democrats regained control of the House two years later. Joe Lieberman, the former Connecticut senator, described the current landscape in Washington as an “extremely partisan time, ideologically divided time in our government — worse than 2008 and 2009 by far, I’m afraid.” Still, Republicans and Democrats are “coming together to get things done,” he said, adding that “if it works — which I hope and believe it will, if they do enough quickly enough — maybe there won’t be a dominant counter-reaction among Democrats or Republicans left or right.” Yet already, the pandemic has emboldened Democrats’ calls for more comprehensive health care and employee benefits, with the crisis laying bare not only shortcomings within the nation’s health care system, but the precariousness of Americans’ financial condition. Retirement accounts have been ravaged and unemployment claims are soaring. David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said the pandemic has exposed “just that the current state of affairs just leaves so many Americans living right on the edge of disaster, and we’d heard these studies for years.” “This just bears this out,” he said. “It tells you what an unstable status quo we’re living in to start … That is something that might reframe politics for a long time.” Progressive Democrats, anticipating a recession and high rates of unemployment, are preparing to use the coronavirus pandemic to draw their party to the left on economic policy, attempting to broaden support for a Green New Deal as a way to spur employment while decarbonizing the economy. And they are watching party leaders closely in negotiations for the rescue package — and demanding constraints on corporations that receive federal aid, as well as guarantees for the working class. Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the liberal political action committee Democracy for America, said “We’re in a moment right now where obviously one of the long-term impacts of the coronavirus is likely to be a complete restructure of our economy.” If there is a time for that, this would appear to be it. Three members of Congress have tested positive for the coronavirus. Democratic primaries are being postponed, and the likely nominee, Joe Biden, has been reduced to a character on a livestream. “What we’re seeing now,” said Madrid, the Republican strategist, is representative democracy’s “inability to deal with societal fragmentation.” In the same way that the music, food and media industries have been upended during the past 20 years, he said, broad cultural shifts are “just now hitting the last social institution, which is representative government.” The country will soon “find other ways of voting and engaging civically,” Madrid said. The coronavirus, he said, may be “the accelerant.”",‘Extraordinary change’: How coronavirus is rewiring the Republican and Democratic parties,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/coronavirus-rewiring-republican-democratic-parties-141298,politico

"Last August, President Donald Trump stood before workers in Western Pennsylvania, where Shell Oil was building a new natural gas processing facility, and celebrated the nation’s shale boom. ""That’s our gold,” Trump declared. “That’s gold underneath our feet."" For almost the entirety of his administration, Trump has bragged about U.S. “energy dominance” and the riches that oil and gas would bring to the country thanks to his administration’s full-throated support. Now, however, Trump’s dream of a golden, dominant energy industry is almost gone and, industry executives said, so is his full-throated support. The collapse of energy prices because of the coronavirus crisis, combined with Saudi and Russian refusals to curb production, has already forced the suspension of the Shell project that Trump touted in Western Pennsylvania. The crash is also estimated to knock out about half of all shale producers, according to analysts at Raymond James Inc., if prices remain at between $20 and $30 per barrel. (The price as of midday Monday was $22.73 per barrel by the standard West Texas Intermediate benchmark.) A price at that level would cost thousands of jobs and deal a serious blow to the vision of U.S. energy independence. ""There is no sugar-coating it, U.S. oilfield activity will collapse with oil prices well below $30,"" on the WTI benchmark, said analyst Praveen Narra of Raymond James in a market update published on March 23. ""The pace of rig count declines is likely to occur at a pace we have not seen before."" Worse, some industry executives say, Trump seems either not to recognize the threat or to be unwilling or unable to address it, touting instead his excitement over lower prices for consumers. ""Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!"" Trump tweeted on March 9, as the domestic oil price fell by 25 percent. In POLITICO interviews, half a dozen industry officials who have talked with White House officials in recent days described Trump as slow to comprehend the twin body blows a global pandemic and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia would have on an industry he has long supported. Oil prices at $20 a barrel threaten to rain destruction on an industry that has donated $1.8 million to Trump's reelection campaign and employs hundreds of thousands of people in states key to any hope to beat his eventual Democratic rival for the presidency. Already, Trump’s favorability is quite low in Texas — 45 percent in a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from early February, before the coronavirus crisis — compared to other predominantly Republican states, and he similarly lags in next-door New Mexico, a Democratic-leaning state which he hopes to win. “The president wants lower gas prices to a point, but this well exceeds that point, and the administration knows this,” said Dan Eberhart, CEO of Canary LLC, a Denver-based oil services firm, and a major Republican donor who regularly speaks with senior White House officials. “The bigger worry for the administration from what I understand is helping an industry that consumers think produces fountains of gold. People that have spoken to the White House - myself included - are concerned that the administration doesn’t realize that the U.S. oil industry will eventually cease to exist at sub-$30 oil.” The White House declined to comment for this story. So far, the energy sector has been the target for relatively little direct assistance through federal legislation, compared to the transportation and financial services industries. But most industry executives said they can live with that if the administration exacts diplomatic pressure on Russia and Saudi Arabia to rein in production, a move that, if successful, could raise prices back up and put more cash in the industry’s coffers than a bailout. Oil prices began falling over the winter when Russia refused to enter a new agreement with Saudi Arabia and its fellow OPEC members to cut oil production to prop up prices. Saudi Arabia responded by saying it would lower its own prices and raise production in a bid to steal market share from Russia and bring it back to the negotiating table. Those moves represented a breakdown in the pact between the two nations that had kept their crude production in check over the past four years — a strategy that had paved the way for U.S. shale producers to move aggressively into the global market. When the coronavirus started to hit in full force, global demand plunged, sending prices plummeting. Trump’s first shot at convincing Saudi Arabia that a flood of oil during a global pandemic could seriously hurt the U.S. economy came in a telephone call with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman on March 9, just as the kingdom was starting to put its foot on the production gas pedal. A White House spokesperson confirmed to POLITICO the two leaders talked, but gave no indication how the call went. Two people with knowledge of the call told POLITICO that Trump told the Saudi leader that he was fine with the kingdom’s plans to produce more oil to try to squeeze Russia out of certain markets. He only asked that the coming flood of oil not drive prices down far enough to hurt U.S. producers. “Keep [prices] low, but keep it viable” for U.S. drillers to remain in business, was Trump’s message, according to a former senior administration official who was briefed on the call. “It wasn’t a difficult conversation. It was just, ‘Hey, want to make sure we’re on the same page here.’ Saudi said, ‘We gotcha.’” But the size of the resultant wave of oil, which caused prices to drop by more than 25 percent in the two weeks since the phone call, caught the administration off guard, the official said. ""No one thought it would go quite this low,"" the person said. ""It was, woah, we didn’t think it would get to this."" At a Thursday press conference, Trump again praised low gasoline prices as a stimulus to the economy, though he noted it would also damage the oil industry. “It’s like a massive tax increase,” Trump said before correcting himself to mean a tax decrease. “That’s bigger than any tax increase — decrease that you could give. You know, we can give all these big tax cuts, but they’re paying so little for gasoline. But, on the other hand, it hurts a great industry and a very powerful industry.” That statement gave some in the industry a glass-half-full outlook. One lobbyist who requested anonymity to discuss relations with the White House said that Trump’s even mentioning a possible downside to the collapse in oil prices should be considered progress. “That’s as close as he’s ever going to get to saying there’s a happy medium on oil prices,” the lobbyist said. “He’s beginning to understand.” Not everyone shared that view, however. “‘This is a very powerful industry,’” quoted a second longtime industry lobbyist who requested anonymity to speak candidly about his quarrels with the administration. “What the f--- does that mean? Do you understand that you’re seeing an inordinate amount of pressure on one of the largest resources in this country’s economy?” The only direct federal aid the administration has offered is a plan to expand the U.S. strategic reserve, which would provide a short-term surge in demand and boost in prices. The Department of Energy said it will buy 77 million barrels, an amount for which Senate Republicans offered $3 billion in an aid bill they offered Sunday but which failed to garner enough votes. But even that volume would be a relative drop in the bucket when Saudi Arabia is talking of increasing its own production by more than 3 million barrels per day. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin’s proposal to spend another $20 billion on buying oil, floated on Thursday, was instantly dismissed as unrealistic as the country is already almost out of space to store it. By summer, oil companies may have to pay customers to take the oil off their hands, Mizuho bank energy analyst Paul Sankey wrote last week. Instead, Trump will rely on his complicated relationships with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Russia — the crown prince known as MBS and Russian President Vladimir Putin — to try to preserve oil prices. Trump might have some success in persuading Saudi Arabia to reduce production, but he has little hard leverage, said Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, senior oil analyst at Rystad Energy. The best option would be to remind the 34-year-old crown prince that Trump stuck by him even after the kingdom’s killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and its imprisonment of Canadians sparked widespread condemnation. “The U.S. response to that was very mild in comparison with many other Western nations who were quick to condemn it,” Rodriguez-Masiu said. “The U.S. was in particular silent.” The former senior administration official said that was, in fact, the administration's own understanding of its leverage in any future outreach to Saudi Arabia over the oil market war. “Among this administration, there’s a feeling of, ‘We stuck by you when no one else would,’ ” the former official said. “Who was there when you kidnapped Canadians? Who stuck with you with Jamal Khashoggi? Who stuck with you when you were an international pariah?’” Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has made the Mideast a key part of his White House portfolio, enjoys a good relationship with the Saudi crown prince. But the rest of the president’s team is largely untested, and industry officials openly doubt that he has the right people in place to wring concessions from two countries accustomed to hardball negotiations over oil drilling. The administration waited until last April to swear in retired Army General John P. Abizaid to the long-empty position of U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia. The National Security Council only recently chose Major General Miguel Correa to permanently handle matters pertaining to the Persian Gulf and North Africa, a hire the White House hasn’t formally announced yet. In recent days, the State Department has stayed in contact with foreign governments to help calm the energy market, a senior department official said in call late Friday with reporters. “We’ve been engaged, multiple parts of the U.S. government have been engaged, urging greater calm to the market when the economy is facing some real challenges,” the official said. When asked by POLITICO whether that diplomatic message gets muddied by Trump’s repeated praise for low gasoline prices, the official simply said “no” and declined to elaborate. In this top-down administration, energy executives are counting on personal appeals to Trump to bolster their cause. But they aren’t sure how to make the approach. On March 19, industry representatives discussed with administration officials a draft letter asking Trump to redouble efforts to pressure Saudi Arabia to curb production, a person involved with the group told POLITICO. But staff at the State Department suggested sending the letter instead to Kushner instead, as the statement might be ""too blunt"" for the president, the person said. At that point the companies threw the letter away, the person added. In the absence of action by Trump, some officials outside the administration are making their own overtures to influential industry figures outside the United States. Ryan Sitton, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission, the entity that regulates oil and gas drilling, told POLITICO that he called OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo on Friday and talked to the cartel leader for an hour about how the oil crash was hurting the global economy. Sitton said Barkindo told him that he couldn’t take any official action until OPEC’s next meeting in June. “I might connect with the Saudi oil minister and the Russia oil minister,” Sitton continued. He also said he talked to White House officials, though he said the Covid-19 response was distracting them from the havoc in the energy industry. “They don’t have a lot of bandwidth,” Sitton said. “Yes, they know the energy industry is sharing in the crisis, but they’ve got a whole lot of areas that are bigger priorities right now. My objective is to find solutions so when the president does have the bandwidth to move on this we have some options for him to move positively.""",Oil execs to Trump: Whose side are you on?,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/oil-execs-to-trump-whose-side-are-you-on-145927,politico
"How/where are you celebrating your birthday and with whom? “A few birthdays ago, my friends and I came together to make a comical birthday song. We planned to perform it live this year with some special musical guests. However, due to COVID-19 precautions, we’re changing plans: We’re still performing music, but now launching an online effort: #SongsfortheSoul. Music is a powerful healer, especially in times of need, so I’m inviting everyone to perform a song at home and share video of their performance online with #SongsfortheSoul. I will post more information and release my own video today at 5:30 p.m. EDT on Twitter (@StevenOlikara) and Instagram (@stevenolikara). Make sure to tune in! And not to worry if you’re not a musician -- just sing or lip-sync part of a song that moves you and share it with us using the hashtag.” How did you get your start in your career? “As my birthday plans suggest, I was a musician and radio DJ in Milwaukee before I became a political entrepreneur and founded the Millennial Action Project. The most profound lesson that I discovered from playing in a wide array of bands was the power of pluralism in our diverse democracy. People coming together with different influences, cultures and perspectives didn’t dilute our music -- it made our art more dynamic, creative and visionary. In this era of polarization, that’s the revolutionary spirit we need in our politics. That’s why I created MAP. We’re building a new generation of political bridge-builders -- focused on young elected leaders in Congress and states -- to strengthen our democracy and take on generational issues that our political system has ignored for far too long, from combating climate change to creating a more functional and honest government.” What’s an interesting book/article you’re reading during coronavirus social distancing? And why? “‘Leadership: In Turbulent Times,’ by Doris Kearns Goodwin. It’s an incisive read on how four U.S. presidents navigated the extraordinary crises they lived through. The book’s stories are a useful guide to understand how leaders can summon our better angels in moments of great challenge.” What’s a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn’t get enough attention? “There is a rising wave of millennial lawmakers, not yet on the media’s radar, who are refusing to look at issues through a traditional left vs. right lens and instead are building unlikely coalitions using a future vs. past frame. These post-partisan efforts have led to a wave of successes, from passing gerrymandering reform in states to securing congressional authorization and funding for the CDC to research gun violence as a public health issue.” How’s the Trump presidency going? “Chaotic.” What’s a fun fact that people in Washington might not know about you? “I mentioned my wide array of bands in Milwaukee -- perhaps the most interesting was playing in an Eastern European klezmer folk band.

"Team Trump is rushing to rewrite the early narrative about the president’s response to coronavirus.  Faced with endless video clips of Donald Trump downplaying the escalating outbreak, Trump aides and allies are working furiously to instead highlight the president’s recent actions and comments. Their effort comprises three tactics: Blanket supporters with detailed timelines of every action the Trump administration took. Amplify praise of those actions. And forcefully push back against anyone who criticizes those actions. Just over seven months from the November election, Trump’s aides and allies realize the president’s campaign for a second term has been completely transformed in a matter of weeks. It will now come down to his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his response to a devastated economy, according to seven people familiar with the situation, including four who speak directly with the president. “The president and his performance is the campaign. It’s the only thing that matters,” said Scott Jennings, who worked for President George W. Bush and is close to the Trump White House. “There is nothing to do if you are the sitting president of the United States but to get it right. If you get it right, what better argument for reelection than this unprecedented crisis?” The Trump campaign had wanted to focus on a long list of other issues as the president launched a general election race against Democrat Joe Biden: the president’s impeachment acquittal, Biden’s acuity and overseas actions by Biden’s son, Hunter.  Instead, it has shifted almost entirely to rehabilitating Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “The watchword from here has to be action,” said a Republican who speaks to Trump. “Checks on the way. Treatments being tried. Travel bans in place. Information conveyed, in real time.” Trump allies who were confident about the president’s reelection prospects just weeks ago — thanks to a strong economy and record stock market — have begun to fret as they see him being blamed by state and local leaders, members of Congress and public health officials for failing to quickly test patients and distribute masks, ventilators and other supplies. The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at nearly 50,000 by the end of Tuesday with more than 600 deaths — and the worst has yet to come. Already, Trump critics are blasting Trump for his handling of the crisis. Priorities USA, the Democrats’ leading super PAC, is launching a $6 million ad campaign on Tuesday in the battleground states of Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Republicans for the Rule of Law, conservatives who oppose Trump, aired its first ad on coronavirus last week. Still, there’s some indication the Trump team’s efforts are working. Fifty-five percent of Americans approve of his management of the coronavirus outbreak, compared to 43 percent who disapprove, according to a ABC/Ipsos poll released late last week. The numbers were nearly reversed the week before when 43 percent approved and 54 percent disapproved. Trump has been fighting back through his now-daily news conferences at the White House, boasting his administration has done an “extraordinary” and “incredible job” while falling back on a familiar tactic of blaming the media. Trump allies said the campaign had no choice but to do what it always does when a crisis engulfs the presidency, from impeachment to the threat of war with Iran: quickly and quietly follow the president’s lead — pushing out new talking points, buying new Facebook ads and lining up voices to defend the president forcefully. “I think the president's people are adjusting their campaign very quickly,” said a Republican who is a friend of the president. The Trump campaign and RNC have scrapped MAGA campaign rallies and other events, shifting training and other events online, including last week’s national day of action and national week of training. But their main task these days is coronavirus. They‘ve been sending rapid-response emails to reporters, firing off emails and text messages to millions of supporters, issuing daily talking points to surrogates, posting social media messages and booking surrogates on TV and radio, according to a RNC official. “The American people have seen President Trump respond to this crisis with bold leadership and decisive action, and he will emerge from this with a strong record of results, putting him in a stronger position than any Democrat candidate,” RNC National Press Secretary Mandi Merritt said. The Trump campaign’s rapid response team has churned out hundreds of tweets in recent weeks — noting that Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York praised Trump, blasting congressional Democrats for holding up an economic rescue package, accusing the “liberal media” of spreading lies for reporting on Trump’s infamous “hoax“ comment at a rally less than a month ago — when the president called Democrats‘ criticism of his coronavirus response “their new hoax,” likening it to impeachment and the Russia investigation. “They want to try to control that narrative as much as possible,” said a Republican who speaks to Trump. “It’s irresponsible to do anything else.”  The campaign also released a detailed list of nearly 80 actions by the Trump administration to fight the virus since Jan. 6, a week after China reported the discovery of the coronavirus to the World Health Organization. “President Trump is fighting for Americans every day!” it wrote in a recent post. “His second coronavirus relief law provides free testing to all Americans, and makes sure families, workers, and businesses impacted by the Chinese virus are taken care of.” Conservative groups, including America First Policies, which supports Trump’s policies, and Tea Party Patriots, are amplifying Trump’s message and actions and fact-checking the media through media appearances and social media, the groups said. Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, said Americans can tell Trump took the coronavirus situation seriously because his administration announced restrictions on travel from China in late January. “That was a sign that President Trump was taking the potential threat the coronavirus posed to America very seriously,” she said. “At the time, many Americans kind of scoffed at that drastic action and yet now worldwide we’re seeing that same exact action happening in country after country worldwide.” Trump supporters hope they can counter statements from the president himself during the same period dismissing the threat. A week before the travel restrictions, Trump said “we have it totally under control. ... It’s going to be just fine.” Just a day before the travel move, Trump said the “very little problem” was under control and maintained “we think it’s going to have a very good ending for it.” Several Trump allies said the president and his campaign must convey that the economy will rebound from coronavirus in part because it had a strong foundation due to the president‘s actions over the last three years. “For our campaign, it will be key to convey to the people that America entered this crisis with enormous advantages and economic momentum,” one of the Republicans said. The campaign is also attempting to drag Biden into coronavirus, though it doesn’t appear to have garnered much attention — accusing him of “plagiarizing” Trump‘s plan to combat the coronavirus, defending China (where the virus first emerged) and confusing this virus with Ebola, which the Obama administration fought while Biden was vice president.  “Joe Biden sows fear and division as President Trump conveys optimism and hope,” the campaign wrote in one email. Michael Caputo, who served as a campaign adviser in 2016, said he worries Biden can blame Trump for his response to coronavirus while having to take no responsibility himself because he’s not in office. “They can criticize him for every move he makes,” he said of Biden’s team. An outside adviser said he has urged the campaign to return to discussing other issues, including Joe and Hunter Biden, to take the attention off Trump’s response to coronavirus and the tanking economy. “I don’t think those issues will ever be gone,” the person said.",Trump’s new 2020 reality: Nothing matters but his coronavirus response,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/trump-coronavirus-campaign-reelection-145007,politico
"To America’s democratic socialists, the coronavirus pandemic means one glaringly obvious thing: America doesn’t have enough democratic socialism.  Bernie Sanders has contended that the virus would be more easily contained if we had a single-payer health insurance system. In a speech about the pandemic, Sanders said, “Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right.” Sanders’ top surrogate on Twitter, campaign speechwriter David Sirota, says single-payer is a matter of national defense: “Coronavirus is a national security threat to America. The corporate-run, for-profit healthcare system is exacerbating that threat. @BernieSanders ' Medicare for All plan is a weapon to combat the threat.” The pandemic is not just about public health or the economy to socialists, but capitalism itself. Said Naomi Klein on the “Intercepted” podcast: “This crisis — and not only the pandemic but the economic crisis that has been set off and that we’re still in the grips of, the crashed oil prices and the political crisis, all of it — is laying bare the extreme injustices and inequalities of our economic and social system.” For those, such as Jacobin’s Branko Marcetic, who haven’t accepted that the Democratic primary is effectively over, the crisis shows it has “never been clearer why the nation needs a political revolution of the type Bernie Sanders advocates.” Yet that was not clear to primary voters in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, who voted to bury Bernie’s revolution in overwhelming numbers in the middle of a pandemic.  Still, do the socialists have a point? Is there something about the pandemic that will, over the course of the next several months, persuade more Americans to embrace their agenda? The evidence for that is thin. It’s true that the devastation of coronavirus is prompting people all over the world to question what needs to happen for our planet to be livable. Socialists certainly have an opportunity to contribute to that conversation. But to most voters, a pandemic does not make it clearer than ever that it is time for a revolution. It only makes it clearer than ever that we need leaders who know how to prevent pandemics. And democratic socialists have yet to convince the public they know how to manage a government as well as they can criticize one. Some democratic socialists see the Republicans’ surprisingly eager embrace of massive government stimulus as a sign that the winds have shifted in their favor. On Thursday, Sanders’ press secretary Briahna Joy Gray said in a campaign video that “people who have long opposed Bernie’s ‘Medicare for All’ plan and his New Deal-style social programs now support a suite of solutions to the corona crisis which could accurately be described as ‘socialist.’” But we are not seeing a bipartisan consensus for socialism. We are seeing a bipartisan consensus for a robust Keynesian stimulus in response to a sudden economic crisis.  That’s not nothing in these polarizing times. In 2009, when Barack Obama began his presidency with a near-trillion dollar stimulus proposal to blunt the impact of the global market crash, most congressional Republicans insisted the “Recovery Act” was egregiously wasteful spending that would fail to jump-start the economy.  For Republicans to sing such a different tune now is a tacit admission that, 11 years ago, they were wrong. In other words, Obama’s stimulus—which some on the left, such as The Week’s Ryan Cooper, still deride as “a conservative, timid attempt to restore the pre-crisis status quo”—has set a critical precedent: that the solution for economic crises is sizable and speedy stimulus from our government is no longer up for debate. But temporary stimulus is not socialism, which at least one democratic socialist understands. Writing in Jacobin, Peter Frase critiqued the proposal from Republican Senator Mitt Romney to cut $1,000 checks for every American: “The fact that cutting checks is suddenly such a popular idea across the political spectrum demonstrates how much the Left has shifted what’s considered possible over the past decade. But it also shows us a ruling class and a political order that is desperately trying to find a stopgap measure to prevent social collapse, in the vain hope of returning to ‘normal’ in short order.” Frase expressed hope that any such stimulus would provide a political opening to push for broadly socialistic proposals, including “free health care.” Many socialists are now insisting that the pandemic makes the case for single-payer open and shut. But it’s not. Despite Sanders’ claim that America is uniquely disadvantaged, at least two European single-payer countries—Italy and Spain—are being devastated by coronavirus; Italy’s death toll is at 3,400 and rising, and Spain just breached 1,000. Each country has widely praised health care systems. But there was nothing about having a government-run health insurance program that ensured an expansive testing regime, sufficient inventory of ventilators or hospital beds, or aggressively enforced social distancing policies. That doesn’t mean single-payer in Spain and Italy somehow made their pandemic worse. America has a largely private health care system, yet is suffering from similar mistakes. To channel the technocratic spirit of Michael Dukakis, this crisis isn’t about ideology. It’s about competence.  Consider this: Who is the political figure earning the most trust from the public in this colossal disaster? New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Long known as a pragmatist at best, a soulless Machiavellian at worst, Cuomo has attracted vocal left-wing primary opposition in his past two reelection campaigns. But he is winning plaudits even from his critics with his commanding crisis management news conferences. Rebecca Fishbein, a progressive writer for Jezebel, confessed, “Help, I Think I'm In Love With Andrew Cuomo???” She explained, “He is the only one telling me what to do, where I can and cannot go (anywhere), who I can and cannot see (everyone), who I can and cannot listen to (President Trump, Bill de Blasio)…”  The New York Times’ Ben Smith heaped praise as well: “Mr. Cuomo holds news conferences filled with facts and (accurate) numbers almost every day. He explains systems and challenges and decision-making with a command that Mr. Trump lacks … But the governor’s great strength has always been his capacity to bend the bureaucracy to his will, and he has done that in recent days: pushing to get tests running in state labs, nudging the mayor to shut schools, coordinating a tristate shutdown of most commerce.” Cuomo has read the room better than Sanders and his fellow socialists. As ideologues, democratic socialists see a crisis and immediately move to exploit the crisis in order to advance their ideology. But most people, in the middle of a crisis, just want their leaders to address the crisis, not exploit it. Not being a governor, Sanders isn’t in a position to bend any bureaucracy to his will. Nevertheless, he made the odd choice Sunday night of hosting an online coronavirus briefing from Vermont, while his Senate colleagues took an important procedural vote on an economic relief package, and are frantically trying to negotiate a compromise. Beyond being distanced from the legislative action, Sanders was also distanced from expertise. The livestream didn’t include any public health experts offering wisdom on how to contain the spread of the virus, but instead featured congressional “Squad” members Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib and collectively, they largely focused on economic solutions to the crisis. Of course, stripping ideology out of politics is not possible, nor desired. Sound philosophy guides effective political action. Moreover, the maxim “never let a crisis go to waste” is not heresy; important social change is often enacted during the response to crises. Socialists need not abandon their socialism when proposing measures to help people in need.  But socialists who want to be trusted with the keys to the White House should spend far less time blasting hot takes about the imminent demise of late-stage capitalism, and more time showing an interest in the nuts and bolts of effective crisis response. A deadly virus is ravaging countries with and without single-payer systems, so maybe this isn’t the best time to insist that a single-payer system is a pandemic panacea. You can shelve that debate for another day, and focus on how to make our existing public health agencies ramp up on testing, now. Compare the coronavirus response plans from Sanders and Joe Biden. Sanders’ plan has three prongs, the first of which is “Empower Medicare to Lead Health Care Response.” Sanders eyes tasking Medicare with providing “universal emergency health care coverage for all,” and of course, once you do that, you’re halfway to establishing Sanders’ end goal of “Medicare for All.” The other two prongs cover a wide range of economic proposals, such as strict conditions on government loans to corporations, which include requiring the installation of workers on corporate boards, fundamentally altering the nature of corporate governance. Sanders would also prevent pharmaceutical companies from earning any profits with the drugs they produce to combat coronavirus, requiring “that the medicines that they manufacture for this crisis will be sold at cost.” That’s a step toward nationalization of the pharmaceutical industry. Sanders touches on measures to stop the spread of the virus, but he does not go in much detail. Biden’s plan digs into what the bureaucracy can actually do. For example, he would have the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention establish “at least 10 mobile testing sites and drive-through facilities per state” and use “sentinel surveillance programs” to “offer tests not only to those who ask but also to those who may not know to ask.” Both Sanders and Biden call for more personal protective equipment, but only Biden’s plan directs the CDC to create “real-time dashboards” to track “supply chain information” to best allocate available personal protective equipment resources. And while Sanders turned to the Squad for his livestream, Biden tapped his adviser Ronald Klain—who managed the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola virus—to appear in an online video detailing the campaign’s plan. (Sanders’ livestream attracted 780,000 views on Twitter, while the Klain video got more than 4 million.) The coronavirus crisis is a stark reminder that we need government leaders who know how to govern. In case there was any doubt before, reality TV stars should not be assumed to know the basics of public health policy. But neither can ideological movement leaders, even if one used to be a mayor more than 30 years ago.","No, Coronavirus Isn’t Proof We Need Socialism",2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/24/coronavirus-socialism-sanders-144490,politico
"Wall Street is facing a grim question as stock prices plunge on most days with no end in sight: Is it time to shut the market down for a while? The debate over whether to pause market trading has intensified over the last two weeks, as much of the economy has ground to a halt to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Uncertainty about the depth of the sudden economic slump and the government's response have caused the value of stocks and other financial instruments to gyrate wildly. Stock plunges this month have triggered four mandatory breaks amid a punishing series of trading runs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed another 3 percent on Monday and has fallen more than 30 percent over the last month as the crisis unfolded, with companies losing billions of dollars in market value. Even lawmakers have started suggesting it's time for Wall Street to press pause to help calm the waters. ""Maybe close a day or two,"" Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said on MSNBC on Thursday, raising concerns about so-called short-sellers — those who bet on stocks to fall — taking advantage of the declining market. ""It's not an industry that we have to have."" The Trump administration and regulators have tried to tamp down speculation that trading should be shut down temporarily until the implications of the crisis become clearer, arguing that the markets are functioning as they should amid the regular trading halts, known as ""circuit breakers,"" sparked by dramatic drops in stock prices. ""We don't want to be doing that,"" President Donald Trump said Monday at a White House press briefing, dismissing the need to shut down the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. But every passing day has made the prospect of a halt in trading seem more urgent. If keeping markets open is ""a sign of confidence for people,"" as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week, the deep plunges in stock prices have to undermine that confidence. Tech entrepreneur and former PayPal executive Max Levchin has argued that it might be time to close the markets for a week or two. ""Get everyone’s minds to focus on social distancing, expanding testing capacity, vaccine finding ... instead of worrying about the utter collapse of their 401(k),"" he said on Twitter. Mnuchin conceded that while he wanted the markets to stay open, at least the possibility loomed that trading hours might need to be shortened. That brought a sharp rebuke from New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunningham, who said in a television interview that reducing or closing trading was not under consideration — a sentiment she made clear to multiple administration officials, including Mnuchin. Yet with cases of the virus spreading, the New York Stock Exchange this week is operating without its signature trading floor and moved to fully electronic trading. ""We look forward to the day when we reopen the Floor and welcome back to 11 Wall Street all of the trading floor community, who are so important to the markets we operate,"" Cunningham said Monday. ""Until then, our bell continues to ring and our markets remain open for business."" The possibility of a market closure underscores the grave outlook for the global economy and the almost complete lack of knowledge of how bad things can get. The markets have shut down before, including during moments of national crisis. Stock trading shut down for several days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. ""We had a brief closure after 9/11, but that was because people could not physically get to the trading floors and the [New York Stock Exchange] was near Ground Zero,"" said former SEC Commissioner Annette Nazareth. ""Now virtually all the markets are electronic."" But even though much of the market can function without traders on a physical trading floor or even in the office, the prospect of the job being done remotely has also raised concerns. ""It's a fair point to say, do we really want people going into all these offices and trying to trade or alternatively do we want people making million- and billion-dollar decisions while they're distracted with whatever news is going on, or their kid hopping on their lap?"" said Tyler Gellasch, executive director of Healthy Markets and a former SEC official. Still, in television interviews and media briefings in recent days, Mnuchin has been pressed repeatedly about whether it's time to halt trading. Last week, he said ""everybody wants to keep it open"" after talking to banks and the New York Stock Exchange, which has warned it could compound market anxiety. ""Americans should know that we are going to do everything to make sure that they have access to their money at their banks, to the money in their 401(k)s and to the money in stocks,"" he said. Onetime SEC officials are skeptical the shutdown will happen. Former SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar said he couldn't foresee anything closing trading absent a problem with market infrastructure. The stock market closing would limit people's ability to sell securities and get cash, he said. ""And then it has broad implications,"" said Piwowar, now executive director at the Milken Institute's Center for Financial Markets. ""The financial markets are very much linked. ... There are many trading strategies that involve trading in one market and hedging in another one.” Gellasch said closing the market wouldn't stop the securities from changing in value — large financial firms can keep assessing that and trading financial instruments among themselves — but it will prevent millions of Americans from accessing their assets when they may need them most. ""The health crisis is what's collapsing restaurants, hotels, and airlines today and will be driving the likely business loans and mortgage crisis in the months and years to come,"" Gellasch said. ""This crisis isn't about the stock market going wild. It's about the economy shutting down. And shutting down the stock market isn't going to fix it.""",The unthinkable: Is it time to shut down the stock market?,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/time-shut-down-stock-market-145573,politico
"My town, Seattle, has fancied itself the city of the future since 1962, when it erected a flying saucer on stilts called the Space Needle and staged the Century 21 Exposition. The rise of several eras’ defining technology companies—Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon—cemented the notion. Now that aspiration has come true in a way none of those jet-age dreamers could have imagined or wanted: Seattle became the point of the pandemic spear, the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in America. Washington State, with less than a fifth California’s population, has had more confirmed coronavirus cases (2,221 as of Monday, 1,170 of them in Seattle and surrounding King County) and more than three times as many deaths (110; 87 of them in and around Seattle).  Last week, the tally of confirmed cases in New York, with its far larger and denser population, vastly overtook Seattle’s total. But most other American cities are still days or weeks away from where we are on the curve. Our experience here, as the U.S. metropolis that has been weathering COVID-19 longest, can still tell people and policymakers elsewhere something about what to expect and how to deal with it. It won’t be pretty, even after you get used to empty store shelves and restaurants, gyms and other public establishments being closed. Be prepared for field hospitals, triage plans and campaigns to fabricate hospital protective gear from hardware store materials. But resilient souls may also find solace and renewal in the quiet and solitude of a lockdown, a reconnection with nature and loved ones.  *** If anyone should have been prepared for such a catastrophe, Seattleites should have. For decades, we’ve been told we should stash away emergency supplies of food, water and other essentials against the megaquake that, if it arrives on the schedule of the last 40 major Cascadia earthquakes, could strike anytime now. But still we were caught short, and packed into the supermarkets and big boxes at unhealthy proximity, cleaning the shelves of spaghetti, canned tuna, sanitizers and toilet paper. The crowds grew so thick that Seattle’s Costco store laid out shipping crate queues and began metering entry.  And if any place had the expertise and experience needed to prepare for a pandemic, it should have been Seattle, home to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a leading public health investor and innovator, the University of Washington’s cutting-edge schools of medicine and public health, and a slew of other biomedical research centers. These institutions swung into action, some as early as December, when the epidemic loomed. One UW team developed and distributed an early test for the virus; last week Kaiser Permanente’s Seattle research center launched the first human trials of a prospective vaccine. But the UW researchers found themselves stymied by red tape, cross-purposes confusion and sclerotic supply channels at the federal level; unable to get speedy FDA approval for their test, they seized on a regulatory loophole to deploy it.   Even here, for all the depth of local medical infrastructure, stocks of the most basic protective gear—gloves, gowns, eye covering and especially masks—were quickly depleted. “We have health care workers wearing bandannas at this point,” Dr. Scott Lindquist, Washington State’s chief epidemiologist, told The Seattle Times on Friday. “Our warehouse is empty. Literally, we don’t have any [equipment] to be given out.” Unable to obtain face shields, experts at the Seattle-area headquarters of Providence Health’s six-state hospital network created a prototype out of hardware and craft-store materials, then assembled 20 administrative staffers to build 500 copies.  Governor Jay Inslee announced Friday that more supplies, including 1.6 million of the coveted N95 masks, were expected soon from federal stockpiles—but, as state and medical officials nationwide have discovered, counting on federal help can be an exercise in disappointment. On March 17, in an effort to bolster Washington’s access to aid and its flexibility to respond to COVID-19, Inslee formally asked President Donald Trump to declare a “major disaster” in Washington. Over the weekend, Trump said he would—but that he would send the Navy hospital ship Mercy, which Inslee also requested, to Los Angeles instead. Here, as elsewhere, everyone from private practitioners to hospitals and first-response agencies has struggled to get test kits and trembled at the prospective consequences of not being able to test quickly and widely. About two weeks ago Jeffrey O’Connor, a family practitioner in Spokane, received eight test kits. “We used them right away, doing all our testing in people’s cars. One came back positive.” No more kits arrived—nor masks or other safety gear. O’Connor wound up buying a construction face shield at a hardware store. Fortunately, Spokane, like Seattle, set up a drive-through test site, where he now sends patients, and which has identified more cases. He’s hopeful that it will keep up with the need. “It’s not real bad in Spokane yet,” O’Connor says wistfully—a sentiment shared by many on the epidemic’s fringes. “Only about 20 cases. But a month from now it’s going to be like Seattle. We’re just waiting for the epidemic to come here.” Meanwhile, the state’s medical services are making accommodations that would have seemed unthinkable a few months ago. On March 17, Inslee ordered a stop to all elective surgeries and other non-urgent medical procedures. Medical providers were already drastically altering and redirecting their operations, in ways that may endure after the pandemic passes. “We’ve moved almost exclusively to tele-health—doing pretty much everything online,” says one Seattle primary-care physician, speaking anonymously because he did not have authorization from the network he belongs to. “That’s actually worked out pretty well. … There are people who need to be seen … but an awful lot of stuff can be handled by video chat.”  But local officials and providers face bigger, grimmer questions about health-care delivery. They’ve begun planning how to apportion critical care if, or when, COVID-19 overwhelms their resources: Who gets a precious ventilator, and who, unlikely to survive anyway, gets morphine? Such triage was the stuff of battlefields until the coronavirus struck Wuhan and Milan. Likewise tent hospitals. Or, as one ball-dribbling neighbor told KUOW-FM radio while a big white tent rose on a soccer field just north of Seattle, “Honestly, the first thing we thought was ‘Zombie apocalypse movie.’ That’s the only time you see a field hospital.” Seattle’s King County is erecting just such a hospital to provide 200 of the 3,000 additional hospital beds it expects to need. It’s also bought a motel (with suitable ventilation to prevent recirculating viruses) for emergency housing for homeless patients, and is shopping for more. *** For all the medical challenges, Seattle would seem better positioned than many locales to weather the epidemic’s economic effects. Its huge technology sector is relatively resilient against local shocks and amenable to working from home. Its largest employer, Amazon, is scrambling to meet demand and trying to hire 100,000 more warehouse workers as even more shopping shifts online. Amazon’s shares rose 11 percent last week and 3 percent on Monday, even as the wider market tanked. The state’s $20 billion agriculture and food processing industry is also cushioned against market shocks; people have to eat. Nevertheless, unemployment has surged faster here than in the rest of the country. In the last week that’s been reported, ending March 14, unemployment claims rose by a third nationwide. In the same period they more than doubled in Washington state and more than tripled in Seattle. Local employers’ use of SharedWork, a state program that helps them reduce workers’ hours without cutting pay or laying them off, grew by 500 percent. The state Employment Security Department received about 560,000 phone calls last Monday and Tuesday, 18 times the usual volume; its website had more than eight times normal traffic. Other states following in Washington’s wake have many more job losses to look forward to. But, for all those downsides, and for all the supermarket jostling and hoarding, the coronavirus crisis has sparked a surge in community spirit and volunteerism around here.  Providence also declared a “100 Million Mask Challenge,” offering kits containing enough medical-grade materials to make 100 masks (which are not the same as face shields) to volunteers who would sew them up. Following what it calls an “overwhelming response,” Providence announced first that all its kits had gone out, then that it wouldn’t need more because “local manufacturing companies have stepped up to rapidly produce masks and face shields for us on a large scale.” Do-it-yourself couriers deliver groceries and pharmaceuticals to quarantined residents. Earlier this month, the local blood bank put out a desperate call for donations; with schools and offices closed and blood drives nixed, supplies were dangerously low. A few days later it told would-be donors “thanks anyway”; a flood of donations had topped the bank back up—a bracing contrast to the 1980s AIDS crisis, when fearful donors stayed away. Two weeks ago, the Southeast Seattle Tool Library, a volunteer-run tool-lending service based in a public housing development in Seattle’s most racially and economically diverse district, closed to avoid becoming an infection vector. “Volunteers and members”—the residents who depend on the library— “both urged us to stay open,” says its director, Susan Keill. Its board reconsidered and devised a safe, no-contact tool-dispensing protocol. This Wednesday the tool library will reopen, so Seattleites can still put their forced confinement to use fixing up their houses. The “we’re all in this together” crisis spirit shows in broader, less tangible ways as well. Newcomers to town routinely complain about “the Seattle chill”—the locals’ notorious reserve and aloofness, their way of looking past rather than at strangers. Now a switch seems to have flipped. “People are smiling!” says one longtime resident who grew up in an African culture that was anything but chilly. Deprived of so many other forms of social contact, we now smile and say hello to each stranger we pass, as though each might be the last person we see. Whatever private sorrows and anxieties people bear, the public mood of the city has changed for the mellower. Reported crime dropped by 15 percent in the first week of March and 30 percent in the second week, largely due to declining property crime. That echoes the first time Seattle went into lockdown, a general strike in 1919, when police reports fell by half.  Until recently Seattleites griped endlessly about life’s hectic pace and surging costs, the dizzily changing cityscape and above all the traffic—the downsides of a boomtown. Goodbye, boom. Goodbye, traffic. “I’m marveling at my reunion with a place I deeply miss,” says poet/painter Rajaa Gharbi, another longtime resident, “a quieter, more humble city, a Seattle that seemed to be ruled and governed by the flower pallets of its front yards, when steel highrises looked like second thoughts.” Seattleites seem to have internalized the shelter-in-place message that is just starting to get through in some less-affected areas. We shudder at pictures of spring-break crowds frolicking blithely on Florida beaches. “As of last Friday, people were still packing the beaches at Kailua and Asian tourists were very much in evidence,” reports Seattle author Michael Gruber, newly returned from Hawaii. “Cases on Oahu are doubling every two days now, but not to worry! I flew back to Seattle and when I went out for milk the next morning, [the local food co-op] made us put on rubber gloves to tickle the tomatoes.” Exceptions still happen. On Friday I saw two street-repair workers huddling closely enough over a survey tripod to tap hardhats. But images of hyper-vigilance are more common. At a city park, eight friends sat in a circle on the grass, carefully maintaining six-foot separation. Masks and respirators are increasingly visible—usually on younger people, even though they are least endangered by the virus. “I am embarrassed to be loving it,” says single mother Alyse Schregoncost of her forced homestay, playing dress-up and taking long walks in the park with her two young daughters. “But feeling guilty about it—I have a flexible job that is almost certain to be there when I get back.” With virtually all the other places people go to meet up and get out of the house closed, parks have become the new bars, gyms, coffeeshops, museums, dance clubs and movie houses. One, Green Lake Park, a 2.8-mile loop around the namesake lake, has gotten too crowded on sunny afternoons for the prescribed six-foot social distancing, prompting fears it may be closed. On Friday, Seattle and King County did close all playgrounds, picnic shelters, ballfields and “other areas where essential social distancing guidelines are difficult to achieve.” They banned park gatherings, team sports, even pickup games. The Washington Trails Association, which usually advocates for more hiking, now urges against through-hiking the popular Pacific Crest Trail, which runs along the state’s mountain spine. It fears hikers will cluster at hostels and campgrounds and spread the virus to the remote communities where they re-provision. Washington state has likewise closed its park campgrounds and picnic areas. That stops short of the complete state-parks closure Oregon instituted on Monday after users continued swarming popular sites. But such total closures threaten an unwanted consequence: Barred from meeting and relaxing outdoors, people may gather covertly, and more dangerously, indoors. “Our parks and open spaces can provide an important break in these stressful times,” King County Executive Dow Constantine said, explaining his decision to keep them open. Fortunately, the city and the mountains and forests around it have enough parks and trails to accommodate the many thousands seeking refuge and release. Even as he labors to reduce the epidemic’s human and economic toll, Seattle Port Commissioner Fred Felleman sees several environmental upsides to these COVID-forced changes in habits and venues, starting with a marked drop in greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. “People are learning how to attend meetings remotely,” he notes, with all the attendant cost savings and impact reductions, and this shift “is likely to persist post-pandemic.” And they are “getting to spend more time in nature rather than in stores, bars and restaurants. While I’m very sympathetic that this has been devastating to our service economy, it could better connect people to the planet and instill a sense of why it’s important to protect it.” In the meantime, however, he has some less lofty advice for other policymakers facing the pandemic: “If you’re going to make a mistake, overreact. To be accused of under-reacting and putting people in danger is much worse.”",Letter From Your City’s Future,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/24/coronavirus-seattle-dispatch-future-144876,politico
" BRUSSELS — Coronavirus is forcing governments to conjure up survival skills — not just for their citizens, but for democracy itself. Faced with unprecedented disruption to the decision-making machinery of government — including travel bans, and social-distancing restrictions on large meetings — officials in capitals worldwide have scrambled to adopt new working methods, including meetings by videoconference, and remote voting by ministers and parliaments. Many legislatures, including the European Parliament, have already canceled all but the most essential meetings and debates until further notice — an acceptance, however reluctant, of the enormous logistical obstacles they now confront. But there are also worries of potentially dangerous breakdowns in checks and balances, as well as concerns that authoritarian-minded leaders could exploit public fear over the pandemic to weaken democratic institutions at a time of vulnerability. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is now pushing for legislation that would give him sweeping emergency powers to rule the country by decree for an extended period — prompting criticism from human rights officials. But even in capitals where such power-grabs are unlikely, the imposition of states of alarm or emergency — as exist now in many EU countries — has led some officials to conclude that new mechanisms may be needed to safeguard the role of lawmakers, and to preserve democratic scrutiny of the executive authorities. On Sunday, President of the Italian Senate Elisabetta Casellati issued an extraordinary statement, insisting that the parliament was still in business and calling on Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and his government to strengthen consultation with the Senate, as well as the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. ""The centrality of Parliament can never fail, especially when government measures limit citizens' personal freedoms and activities essential to the country's economy,"" Casellati said. ""It is therefore essential that the prime minister and the government establish a systematic link, which has never been implemented, with the presidents of the chambers regarding any regulatory initiative relating to the coronavirus emergency."" In Italy and elsewhere, however, it's far from clear governments whether will indeed continue functioning as normal as all branches of government come under unprecedented pressure. Political leaders, like everyone else, face personal danger of infection. Prince Albert of Monaco, as well as the first ladies of Canada and Spain, have already tested positive for the virus. On Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel went into self-isolation, raising fears that Europe could face part of the crisis without its most seasoned leader on the front line. Some governments, like the U.K., have raced to clarify succession plans. In Washington, at least five Republican senators are sidelined because they were infected or exposed to the coronavirus, potentially imperiling passage of emergency legislation to support the U.S. economy, and highlighting the risk of government paralysis as elected officials tasked with responding to the crisis fall ill. The U.S. has yet to come up with a Plan B to keep the Congress running, even as the Trump administration has sought new powers for the Justice Department to request indefinite detentions without trial during emergencies — highlighting the worries about executive overreach while legislatures struggle to function. The absence of the five Republican senators has cut the majority control of President Donald Trump's party to just one vote — 48 to 47 — and left them a solid dozen short of the 60 votes needed to overcome various procedural hurdles that must be cleared before legislation like the giant €1.8 trillion stimulus bill can be adopted by a simple majority. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, have urged a change to the standing rules to allow senators to vote from outside the chamber during a crisis. But changing the rules itself requires a two-thirds supermajority. Around the world, other governments are already taking extraordinary steps — some of which could permanently alter how those in power take decisions, hastening the acceptance of new technologies previously regarded as insecure or inappropriate for official business. Last week, the EU's College of Commissioners held its weekly meeting by teleconference for the first time. On Wednesday, during an extraordinary session of the Spanish Congress, deputies will be able to vote remotely on two decrees related to labor and agricultural policy as well as on urgent measures to respond to the pandemic and the economic fallout. And on Thursday, the 27 heads of state and government on the European Council will convene by videoconference, after scrapping their regularly-scheduled summit in Brussels, with the agenda narrowed to focus only on the crisis. The frantic efforts to keep government functioning reflect two equally vital imperatives — a need for government action, including emergency economic measures, in response to the crisis; and an acute desire to reassure citizens, businesses and financial markets that the authorities are in control — even if they were woefully unprepared for the outbreak. In some cases, however, officials are discovering that it is far more difficult than expected to set aside long-established rules that mandate in-person meetings or votes, often with a minimum number of participants required for a quorum. On Friday, EU ambassadors reached a deal on a plan that would suspend formal meetings of the Council of the EU for 30 days, allowing ministers to meet instead by videoconference. EU countries will then take formal decisions using a streamlined ""written procedure"" — a longstanding mechanism by which national capitals vote remotely on policy proposals. ""It's critical for our business continuity,"" a senior EU official said. ""We cannot just run away and say, 'OK, we'll come back after the crisis.'"" But what was expected to be a swift tweak to the rules, given the crisis, turned into more than two days of debate, which covered the practical limitations of videoconferences — including an inability to provide interpretation into all EU languages — as well as the legal, philosophical and even psychological ramifications of foregoing the in-person negotiations that are a hallmark of the EU decision-making process. ""These rules of procedure are there not just because we are rule fetishists,"" the EU official said. ""They are there because they are addressing some very real concerns and those concerns are about protecting the rights of member states."" The ambassadors shied away from a more far-reaching change that would have afforded videoconference meetings formal status. The top concerns were practical, and also related to the legal implications of the move. ""Because it's about lawmaking, we have to do it right,"" a senior ambassador said. A second senior ambassador portrayed the 30-day change as a moderate contingency measure. ""We are not going from meetings to kind of intergalactic video chats,"" the ambassador said. ""We still have all the structures, and the written procedure."" EU ambassadors representing the bloc's member countries continue to meet face to face but, to comply with social distancing, the size of delegations has been sharply curtailed. Ambassadors are limited to at most two advisers and sometimes none. Also, meetings are being held in the largest rooms at the Council of the EU to create distance between participants. At least the EU reached a decision, with capitals officially affirming the new plan on Monday. In Chile last week, an effort to adopt new rules to allow remote voting failed because not enough deputies supported the change. Across the Western world, parliaments are wrestling with similar questions. Graziano Delrio, the leader of the Democratic Party in Italy's Chamber of Deputies, has urged that plans be made to allow tele-voting. This week, the parliament is due to hold a hearing by videoconference with Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri, but it's not clear Italian conservatives will ever allow remote voting. In Spain, nearly all parliamentary work unrelated to the coronavirus has been stopped, despite a declaration earlier this month by the president of the Spanish Congress of Deputies, Meritxell Batet, who said, ""The Congress doesn't close."" But Spain is allowing remote voting, which it had previously limited only to deputies who received advance permission to be absent for strict reasons, including pregnancy or serious illness. In Canada, parliament effectively shut itself down for five weeks — a decision that was a bit less dramatic than it seemed given that it was already scheduled to be on recess for three of those weeks. In the U.K., parliament is carrying on — just with fewer parliamentarians. There are currently no plans for the House of Commons to stop meeting until March 31, when a pre-planned Easter recess begins, although the opposition Labour Party has called for that date to be brought forward by a week. Some MPs are nonetheless staying away, with last Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions session one of the most thinly-attended anyone in Westminster can remember. Scrutiny of government continues via the select committee system and in circumstances where MPs cannot attend, committee chairs are taking questions over text or email to put to witnesses. Still, as any journalist will tell you, asking questions by email is not the same as posing them in person. And reporters too face new obstacles to scrutinizing people in power. Daily press briefings with the British prime minister’s spokesperson in Downing Street became conference calls starting Monday. In that sense, the U.K. is just a bit behind the European Commission, which shifted to remote-only daily news conferences last Thursday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his recent daily news conferences on coronavirus might need to be done by remote, though he tried to reassure reporters they could still participate “I see your anxiety,"" Johnson, himself a former journalist, told them. ""I will absolutely ensure everybody gets to ask questions.” In Germany, lawmakers on Monday were close to changing a requirement that more than half of all MPs be present in person for many important votes, to limit chances of spreading the virus within the government. The current rules raised the prospect that at least 355 members of the Bundestag would need to be present in the chamber to push through emergency measures this week, at a time when German citizens have been ordered to practice social distancing by limiting meetings to just two people and with large gatherings banned. Without a change, many lawmakers were expected to watch the debate from their offices and enter the chamber only to vote. But on Monday, political group leaders reportedly reached a deal requiring only a quarter of MPs to be present. In France, the two-chamber parliament on Sunday voted to formally declare a health emergency. The National Assembly, the lower house, was nearly empty when the final decision was taken largely by proxy votes, to avoid a crowd. The bill grants the government the power to “decide, by decree, and upon the recommendation of the minister of health, general measures limiting freedoms to curtail movement and crowds"" and also empowers the minister to ""proceed with requisitions of of any goods and services necessary to fight against the sanitary disaster.” Elections have also been called into doubt by the virus. A second round of French local polls has been postponed, as have presidential primary elections in several U.S. states. But Poland is pressing ahead with plans for a presidential election in May — even as opposition politicians complain it won't be fair as they can't campaign effectively due to coronavirus restrictions, giving advantage to the incumbent, Andrzej Duda.

"The U.S. Postal Service could be gone by June unless Congress immediately delivers billions of dollars to counteract the impact of the coronavirus crisis, a House committee chairwoman warned Monday night. ""Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,"" said Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) in a statement. Maloney, who was joined in the statement by Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), indicated that the Postal service has seen a ""drastic"" reduction in mail volume and could shutter by the summer without intervention, a collapse that could, among other things, jeopardize access to mail-order prescription drugs for millions of Americans, especially in rural communities. A Postal Service shutdown would also affect the ability of voters to cast ballots by mail. Maloney and Connolly noted that the House's $2.5 trillion coronavirus relief package would send $25 billion to the Postal Service in emergency funding and eliminate the Postal Service's $11 billion debt. The measure would reset the Postal Service's borrowing limit to $15 billion and eliminate an annual $3 billion borrowing cap. The measure would also require the agency to prioritize medical deliveries.  The House bill would also allow the Postal Service to create ""temporary delivery points"" and establish flexible staffing procedures if the coronavirus impacts its operations.  The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 turned the Postal Service into an independent agency within the U.S. government that was primarily responsible for funding itself, something that has become harder since the internet era led to a dramatic drop in the volume of mail. Beyond that, the Postal Service has been required since 2006 to pay at least $5.5 billion annually to pre-fund retiree benefits.

"President Donald Trump is hanging big hopes for defeating the coronavirus on a drug trial starting soon in New York, touting the potential benefits of an experimental combination that is only in the early stages of research. That therapy “probably is looking very, very good,” and the trial could start as early as Tuesday, Trump said at a Monday night press briefing on the coronavirus. Two clinical trials are set to begin in the state as early as this week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Monday morning ahead of the president's briefing. Cuomo and Trump have clashed in recent weeks over the federal response to the pandemic and states’ needs, but Trump on Monday pointed to New York’s upcoming trials as evidence that swift progress was being made against the virus that has infected nearly 40,000 people in the country so far. New York, now considered the U.S. epicenter of the outbreak, has reported nearly 21,000 known cases. “We are dealing there well together,” Trump said of Cuomo on Monday night, later adding that the governor “has been working very hard."" One New York trial would combine the antibiotic zithromax and the decades-old drug hydroxychloroquine, originally developed to fight malaria. The president has named-checked the drug in recent press conferences as a promising option for treating patients who contract the virus, despite research being in the early stages. “At my direction, the federal government is working to help obtain large quantities of chloroquine,” Trump said. The Cuomo administration said Sunday that it had acquired 750,000 doses of chloroquine and 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic version, along with 10,000 doses of zithromax. Bioethicists and policy experts have warned against overpromising on chloroquine, which is also used against lupus and arthritis, because it's not yet clear how effective it is against the coronavirus and its side effects could be serious. The second trial could begin as early as this week to test infusing a serum from recovered Covid-19 patients into current patients to boost their immunity to the virus, Cuomo said. “It’s only a trial, it’s a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the New York State Department of Health has been working on this with some of New York’s best health care agencies,” Cuomo said at a morning news conference. “We think it shows promise, and we’re going to be starting that this week.” State health officials said they will begin recruiting a pool of recovered patients to donate their plasma, which contains antibodies against the coronavirus, for the serum in the coming days. New York officials stressed that the drug therapy and serum trials are not “clinical therapies” and are unlikely to cure Covid-19 patients. But, they said, the trials could shorten the duration of incubation, lower viral loads and have other, more nuanced benefits. The plasma technique, first used in the 1890s, is still occasionally employed in critical situations — Chinese scientists have used it in the current pandemic as well. But it has had a mixed record: In a trial using plasma against the Ebola virus, 31 percent of participants died, compared to 38 percent who died while receiving only supportive care, with researchers reporting that the technique ""was not associated with a significant improvement in survival."" The FDA is “working expeditiously to facilitate the development and availability of convalescent plasma as a potential treatment option for COVID-19 to those patients who are in greatest need,” spokesperson Michael Felberbaum said.

"Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) is being sued after selling shares in a hotel company while possessing confidential information about the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Alan Jacobson, a shareholder in Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, sued Burr in federal court on Monday, alleging that the senator used private information to motivate a mass liquidation of his assets. It is illegal for senators to use nonpublic information in conducting securities exchanges. Burr came under fire after ProPublica reported last week that he had sold between $628,000 and $1.72 million worth of his stock holdings in mid-February — while he was still publicly reassuring the country that the United States was amply prepared for the growing coronavirus outbreak. Among the shares he sold were an up to $150,000 stake in Wyndham, whose stock suffered a market-value cut of more than two-thirds since mid-February. Burr was also in the hot seat after NPR reported that he had warned wealthy members of an exclusive social club about the major disruptions to the nation’s economic and daily life that would come from the growing outbreak. As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Burr is privy to much of the nation’s classified information on threats to national security. The coronavirus pandemic has devastated the travel industry, from cruises to airlines to hotels. Wyndham was no exception — the company’s stock sold at $59.96 on Feb. 19 but has dropped precipitously, to $25.03 on Monday. “Senator Burr owed a duty to Congress, the United States government, and citizens of the United States, including Plaintiff, not to use material nonpublic information that he learned by virtue of his duties as a United States Senator in connection with the sale or purchase of any security,” said Jacobson’s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. “Had Plaintiff and the market known of the material nonpublic information in Senator Burr’s possession regarding COVID-19, and on which Senator Burr traded, Wyndham’s stock price on February 13, 2020 would have been substantially lower,” the suit continued. “Senator Burr and his wife sold up to $150,000 of Wyndham stock on that date, and therefore he and his wife pocketed up to $150,000 in illegal insider trading proceeds at Plaintiff’s expense.” Jacobson argued he had suffered harm because he kept his shares while they were trading at artificially inflated prices due to the lack of public knowledge on the coming economic devastation from coronavirus. Burr asked the Senate Ethics Committee on Friday to review his stock sales and maintained that he “relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks.” He denied using information that was not public regarding the coronavirus outbreak. Burr is planning to retire at the end of 2022 His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday night about the lawsuit.",Shareholder suit accuses Sen.

"The chairman of the House Rules Committee is recommending against bringing lawmakers back to Washington to vote on the nearly $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. Instead, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) is suggesting the chamber pass the bill by unanimous consent or a voice vote. The recommendation — made public in a letter and a report sent to Democrats Monday night — comes as the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the country and the Capitol. Two members of the House — Reps. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Mario Diaz Balart (R-Fla.) — have tested positive for the virus, with McAdams recently in the hospital. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) also has the virus, and roughly a dozen more lawmakers are in quarantine. “Clearly, the quickest and likely best path forward is for Congress to pass that measure by unanimous consent or by voice vote. Short of that, there are a few difficult options that we can consider utilizing,” McGovern wrote in a letter to his colleagues. Notably, the report — which was commissioned by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — suggests that remote voting is not a viable option at the moment. Remote voting would be “one of the biggest rule changes in the last century, in one of the most critical institutions in our country,” the report says. The idea of remote voting also faces significant logistical and legal challenges.  “Although off-the-shelf products exist to allow a Member to videoconference their vote, for example, they have not been tested under the sort of pressure they would face from enemy states or other bad actors trying to force the system offline or prevent individual Members from accessing it,” the report says. “Such a system has to be extensively tested, not used for the first time on must-pass legislation.” House leadership needs to decide quickly how it will consider the Senate’s coronavirus legislation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday evening that he would work through the night to hatch an agreement with the Trump administration. Mobile voting is unpopular in both the Democratic and Republican leadership, but has gained in popularity in the rank and file. Just hours before the report came out, more than 70 Democrats sent a letter to McGovern pushing for a temporary change in House rules to allow members to vote remotely. The letter did not raise the idea of voting via unanimous consent or voice vote. “Unfortunately, during such circumstances, requiring members to vote in person may pose public health risks or even be physically impossible for persons under quarantine,” the Democrats, led by California Rep. Katie Porter, wrote. “We need to provide a mechanism through which Congress can act during times of crisis without having to assemble in one place.”  The report suggests other options Democratic leaders have at their disposal. They can call lawmakers back and hold the vote open for an extended period of time. They can institute “paired” voting, which is a relatively complex system that allows lawmakers to hatch an agreement with another member. They can reset the quorum necessary to vote. Or they can, under the current rules, change the quorum. The report does suggest one potential rule change: allowing proxy voting. In this scenario, a member would allow a colleague to vote on their behalf. Voting by unanimous consent has its limits: all it would take is one of the current 430 House members to object to passing the bill unanimously to derail the vote and force a chunk of the chamber back to Washington. In addition, some lawmakers are worried about the optics of voting on the biggest recovery package in American history via voice vote.  Congressional leaders have already informally discussed ways to appease members who want to weigh in — including the idea of allowing lawmakers to record how they would vote on the package in the Congressional Record. Another idea being floated if they can’t get agreement from all sides is to bring just enough members back to establish a quorum — ensuring that enough of the lawmakers would vote in favor of the package for it to pass.  Even with the potential hiccups, McGovern’s recommendation isn’t exactly a surprise. House leaders in both parties have been on the receiving end of an increasing pressure campaign from anxious lawmakers who are worried about returning to the Capitol.  Not only are the logistics a nightmare for members in many districts, with both airlines and Amtrak operating on significantly reduced schedules. But with coronavirus spreading in the Capitol among lawmakers and staff, many members are wary of catching it themselves.  Pelosi quickly shot down the idea of remote voting both in private meetings and at her public news conference when Democrats started raising the idea two weeks ago. But as the virus spread across the country, infecting relatives, friends and even colleagues, some Democrats continued to pressure the speaker to reconsider the idea.  On a caucus call last week, Pelosi announced McGovern would study the different ways lawmakers could vote on the third package of coronavirus relief funding, possibly without returning to Washington. The idea has since been the topic of private leadership calls and senior Democrats have also reached out to Republican leaders to gauge the appetite on the GOP side. A Republican aide confirmed the discussions Monday.   “It’s a possibility but no decision has been made yet,” the GOP aide said.  House Democrats are expected to discuss the idea further on a conference call Tuesday afternoon.  Melanie Zanona contributed to this report.

"Forecasts of doom for the American economy are quickly turning from gray to pitch black. As Congress haggles over a multitrillion-dollar coronavirus rescue package, analysts are warning the U.S. could be facing a prolonged depression rather than the kind of short recession and swift bounce back that President Donald Trump and his top aides expect. And they’re raising questions about whether current government efforts to cushion the economy from the damage will be anywhere near enough. Across Wall Street and the economic world, forecasters are quickly ramping up their predictions of massive job losses and declines in economic activity by as much as an annualized 50 percent in the second quarter of the year. They’re offering estimates unseen since the Great Depression that began in 1929 and continued for a brutal decade, reshaping governments and economies across the globe. Morgan Stanley economists on Monday said they now expect a 30.1 percent annualized decline in gross domestic product in the second quarter, the worst quarterly performance in 74 years. The firm’s estimates assume the virus peaks in April and May before growth starts to recover. But if the peak comes later and economic disruption continues in the second half of the year, they wrote, U.S. growth for even the entire year will be down to levels last seen in the early 1930s. The rescue package now being debated in Washington would involve at least $1.6 trillion of government spending, representing just a few weeks of lost economic activity. But the hit will almost certainly be vastly larger than that, analysts say, requiring multiple congressional interventions in order to come close to offsetting the fastest economic shutdown in American history. The Federal Reserve stepped into the breach on Monday with strong action to prop up wobbly credit markets. And they promised efforts to aid small and midsize businesses that are failing in large numbers, a main street lending program that could multiply the power of the congressional spending package. But that did not ease fears in the stock market, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3 percent to 18,591.93 — the lowest since November 2016. It remains unclear whether the Fed’s actions will be up and running fast enough to ensure that when government officials do flip the lights back on, a functional economy will be capable of a swift bounce back. “A $1.5 trillion stimulus package sounds like a lot, and it is,” LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder said in a note to clients. “But given the unemployment rate might be headed to double digits and many impacted businesses won’t survive through the spring without some help, it probably won’t be enough.” Economists are now mostly just debating how deep and lasting the economic downturn will be. “The U.S. economy has entered recession as the COVID-19 outbreak and public health efforts to combat it have led to a sharp contraction in economic activity,” Gus Faucher, chief economist at the PNC Financial Group, wrote in a research note. “Restrictions on movement throughout the country have led consumers to pull back on their spending, with restaurants, hotels, movie theaters, entertainment venues, sports leagues, and many retail establishments closed. The airlines are rapidly cutting capacity, and U.S. auto manufacturers have stopped production.” The coronavirus crisis essentially knocked out the strongest pillars of the U.S. economy: consumer confidence and spending. It has also driven a once high-flying stock market into bear market territory, making Americans feel less wealthy and less apt to spend. Manufacturing was already in recession when the virus hit and will likely fall further into negative territory as factories are shuttered and workers kept at home. State jobless claims are already spiking in record numbers. On Thursday, economists expect the largest national jobless claims number in American history, a figure Goldman Sachs estimates could hit 2.25 million new filings in a single week. That would smash the all-time record of close to 700,000 hit in 1982. Some estimates are far higher than that, perhaps up to 5 million. Job losses that will show up in the Labor Department’s April jobs report released in early May could hit 5 million to 10 million or more, wiping out all the gains from 2018, 2019 and the first two months of 2020. That’s led to complaints from across the economic world that just as the government is far behind in battling the spread of the coronavirus, it is also mounting a woefully inadequate economic response. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard says the jobless rate could hit 30 percent in the second quarter with a 50 percent annualized drop in GDP during the quarter. And the longer Washington waits to send direct aid to individuals and families who have lost their incomes and to small business that cannot meet payrolls, the worse things will look when the coronavirus crisis eventually ends. “The longer it takes, the deeper the ongoing slowdown will be,” said Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson. “Fed data shows that 40% of US households would not be able to come up with $400 for an emergency expense and data from 2019 shows that 53% of US households don’t have any emergency savings.” The word “depression” is seeping into more and more financial forecasts, as economists abandon earlier hopes that the virus spread could be halted by April and workers could go back to their jobs and shoppers back into stores. “At this point, the most optimistic outcome for the domestic economy appears to be a temporary dip into negative akin to the contraction of 2001 with the worst case being a prolonged depression-like scenario similar to that experienced in 1929,” Stifel Chief Economist Lindsey M. Piegza said in a note on Monday. The darkening scenarios have kicked off debates both in Washington and in Europe about how long economies can afford to remain in lockdown. Tough decisions are ahead on the potential cost in lives of reopening America more quickly versus the cost to the economy and general human well-being of keeping people stuck in their homes for weeks or months to come. Economists note that prolonged recessions and certainly a depression would also cost lives and widespread misery. “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,” Trump said at a press briefing Monday evening, repeating what he wrote on Twitter shortly before midnight on Sunday. “At the end of the 15-day period, we will make a decision as to which way we want to go, where we want to go, the timing.” Trump again expressed frustration with the economic downturn and pledged to revisit all the current stay-at-home orders. “The hardship will end. It will end soon. Normal life will return, and our economy will rebound very, very strongly,” he said. But few economists now believe that even the giant rescue package working its way through Washington will do enough to offset damage that’s already been done to the U.S. economy — a cost that’s mounting by the day. “Disruption will take the form of a depression-like set of shocks that will require a significant intervention by the federal government into economic and social life for the foreseeable future,” RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas wrote on Monday. The latest moves by the Fed and other government institutions “are just the latest in a series of actions that are likely to continue throughout this year and likely next in response to the global public health emergency caused by the Covid-19 virus.”",Fears mount of a coronavirus-induced depression,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/great-depression-coronavirus-induced-calamity-145304,politico
"Rattled health officials are trying to fight off ascendant voices around Donald Trump pressing the president to restart the economy as soon as Monday to stem severe business and job losses. The prospect of resuming typical business so soon has horrified these public health leaders, who see the debate as premature amid a crisis that the administration is just beginning to wrangle, according to eight people with knowledge of the administration's discussions about its coronavirus guidelines.  Health experts are contending the fallout will be worse if the White House declares victory now, only to have the virus resurface weeks or months from now. The government, they argue, has yet to definitively answer key questions that would dictate how to reactivate the economy: Do those who recover from coronavirus become immune? How do underlying health conditions affect the severity of the virus? And, most important, how widely has it spread?  Others have stressed the political risks facing Trump and his reelection campaign if the outbreak worsens significantly, warning that it would be catastrophic if the virus made a comeback closer to the November election — especially after Trump declared himself a “wartime” president and assured the public that his administration was in control.  “It is way too early to even consider rolling back any guidelines,"" said Howard Koh, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and former top Obama administration public health official. “With cases and deaths rising by the day, the country must double down, not lighten up, on social distancing and related measures.” It’s a battle that will intensify in the coming days as the country approaches the end of a 15-day period of extreme social distancing, which the White House launched on March 15.  At a White House briefing Monday night, Trump seemed adamant that the economy would come back to life “very soon,” insisting that the government can fight the viral spread while also going to work — “we can do them both at the same time.” “Our country wasn’t built to be shut down,” Trump said during a Monday night briefing. “America will again and soon be open for business. … a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting, a lot sooner.” The change in tone comes as a growing faction of people in the White House have started to worry that weeks of economic shutdown will wreak financial havoc.  Administration officials like senior adviser Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have spent the past few days fielding calls from technology, finance and energy CEOs. These executives have made the case that companies need a clear, concrete date from the White House as to when stores, restaurants and schools can reopen to give the markets and employers a sense of certainty amid the unpredictable spread of the coronavirus. “To use the analogy of a war, we send kids off to fight a war, and there are deaths associated with it. There will be deaths associated with this,” said Stephen Moore, an informal economic adviser to the Trump administration, who regularly speaks with Trump economic officials. “We are looking at no great options.” “What is clearly not a viable option is to keep the economy shut down for the next seven to 10 weeks,” he added. “People will lose their life savings, and the unemployment rate will go to 35 percent.” The internal debate is uniting strange bedfellows from the economic world, with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, trade adviser Peter Navarro, The Wall Street Journal editorial board and the former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, all calling for a quick return to the workplace. Powerful Trump advisers have joined the chorus, including Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a conservative government accountability group, and Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host. Not all of Trump’s closest allies agree. Some have advocated for Trump to be as severe as necessary to slow the coronavirus spread.  “Try running an economy with major hospitals overflowing, doctors and nurses forced to stop treating some because they can’t help all, and every moment of gut-wrenching medical chaos being played out in our living rooms, on social media, and shown all around the world,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally, tweeted on Monday. “There is no functioning economy unless we control the virus.” Any lifting of restrictions would happen gradually, people familiar with the discussions said, given the uncertainty about how case counts nationwide could grow over the next several weeks and widespread concerns about hospital capacity.  One option would be for the White House to offer guidance that huge swathes of the country return to business as usual, while hard hit states like New York and Washington remain under a greater lockdown, said three people briefed on the White House’s internal discussions.  Trump touched on the idea during his briefing.  “We can start thinking about as an example, parts of our country are very lightly affected,” he said, citing Nebraska and Idaho as examples. And even before the end of the 15-day period, Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the government’s coronavirus task force, said there will soon be new guidance for some first responders and critical infrastructure workers.  “Even if they've been exposed to someone with coronavirus, as long as they don't have symptoms, [these employees] would be able to return to work immediately, wear a mask for two weeks, but otherwise return to the important roles that they play in all our communities,” Pence told reporters during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  Still, governors and local leaders will have the ultimate authority over states and cities and the extent to which businesses remain shut down, argued one person familiar with the White House talks, setting up a potential showdown between federal and state officials. Top administration health officials, including coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx, have warned that case numbers are likely to spike in the coming days as testing ramps up. Outside public health experts, meanwhile, emphasize that lags in testing results and reporting mean the government’s data is already about a week behind the reality on the ground. That’s made it difficult for officials to know how much of an impact the past couple weeks of nationwide social distancing have had on the virus’ spread. ""I can tell you for sure, from a public health standpoint and experience with other outbreaks, we know we are clearly having an effect,"" said Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, during a White House briefing on Sunday. ""But we can't quantitate it for you accurately."" Fauci, a veteran of six presidential administrations, has emerged as a key vessel for health officials’ more cautious views, said one person close to the Health and Human Services Department, due to the broad respect he enjoys inside and outside the administration and his willingness to contradict Trump in public. As the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Fauci has openly advocated for tough distancing measures, reasoning that it’s worth potentially overreacting if it means avoiding a worst-case public health scenario. That blunt approach has sparked speculation that Fauci could fall out of favor or be sidelined by the president, especially after giving a series of candid interviews detailing his relationship with Trump.  But Fauci’s job is not seen as in immediate danger, given his role as one of the few widely trusted officials leading the coronavirus response. “The president worries most about the stock market,” said the person close to HHS. “You want to see a fall in the stock market? Fire Tony Fauci, watch what happens.” The showdown between Trump's economic advisers and public health officials has been building for weeks, as the stock market plummeted and confirmed coronavirus cases climbed, prompting a cascade of restrictions that have disrupted American life and threatened to plunge the nation into a depression. ""You're going to see a clash between the economists and the public health guys, no doubt about it,"" said one person with knowledge of the debate.  A former HHS official described the situation as a debate between two ""horrendous"" paths — one that could dramatically remake the economy for the worse by maintaining the current harsh restrictions, and another that could exact a human toll ""that will be unacceptable to Americans"" if the virus continues spreading for months on end. ""This is like managing a wildfire,"" the former official said. ""There are controlled burns going on right now. The other alternative is just to let the fire run through.""","Health officials want Trump to ‘double down, not lighten up’ restrictions",2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/coronavirus-economy-trump-restart-145222,politico
"The U.S. is cutting aid to Afghanistan by $1 billion and will cut even more unless the country’s feuding political leaders can resolve their differences and form a government that can implement a peace deal with the Taliban. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the decision Monday after he briefly visited Kabul to try ending the dispute between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and former Afghan chief executive Abdullah Abdullah, who are clashing over the results of their country’s presidential election last fall. Pompeo later reportedly met with a Taliban representative in Qatar.  In a statement, Pompeo said Ghani and Abdullah had informed him that they were “unable to agree on an inclusive government” despite what the chief U.S. diplomat described as an urgent need for one.  “The United States is disappointed in them and what their conduct means for Afghanistan and our shared interests,” Pompeo said, adding that “this leadership failure poses a direct threat to U.S. national interests.”  The announced aid cuts may appear harsh, given how much Afghanistan continues to rely on U.S. assistance since American troops overthrew the Taliban regime there following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.  But in many ways, the cuts are part of a pattern for the administration of President Donald Trump: It relies more on sticks than carrots, and it has been willing to impose sanctions, tariffs and other penalties on allies as well as adversaries in pursuit of what it says is the U.S. interest.  In Trump’s view, and that of a growing, bipartisan crowd in Washington, the U.S. interest includes withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan.  Pompeo added that “the U.S. government will initiate a review of the scope of our cooperation with Afghanistan.” Aside from the initial $1 billion aid cut, “we are prepared to reduce by another $1 billion in 2021,” he said.  Five months after the voting took place, Ghani was declared the winner of the September presidential election. But Abdullah alleged there was major fraud in the polls and has been unwilling to concede. Abdullah has started trying to form a parallel government. He also has the backing of some ethnic militia leaders. “We have made clear to the leadership that we will not back security operations that are politically motivated, nor support political leaders who order such operations or those who advocate for or support parallel government,” Pompeo said. Afghan officials either could not immediately be reached or did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Afghan political infighting has complicated U.S. efforts to start implementing a peace agreement with the Taliban reached in late February.  The deal envisions a U.S. troop pullout in tandem with the Taliban meeting certain conditions. Those conditions include Taliban talks with the Afghan government and upholding a promise not to let terrorist groups use Afghan soil to plot external terrorist attacks.  But Afghan officials, including Ghani, have long been skeptical of the U.S. talks with the Taliban, and have been frustrated at being left out through much of the process. They’re particularly angry over provisions in the deal that require the release of some 5,000 Taliban prisoners.  Pompeo chided Ghani and Abdullah for “failing to establish an inclusive national team to participate in intra-Afghan negotiations or take practical steps to facilitate prisoner releases by both sides as a confidence-building measure to reach a political settlement and achieve a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire.”  He also noted that the U.S. was still “proceeding with the conditions-based withdrawal of our forces in accordance with the U.S.-Taliban agreement.”  Pompeo also offered some salve for the wound, saying the United States may “revisit the reviews initiated today” if the Afghan leaders come to a political agreement.  He further insisted that the U.S. isn’t fully abandoning its partnership with Kabul, noting that, for instance, it plans to give $15 million to help Afghanistan combat the coronavirus pandemic.

"Democrats are following through on their threat to go rogue with their own stimulus plan, unveiling a more than 1,400-page bill Monday night, packed with policy differences compared to the proposal Senate Republicans laid out. After the GOP’s latest measure tanked twice during test votes in the Senate, House Democrats wrote a competing proposal to save the country from economic destruction at the hands of the coronavirus. The House measure would boost emergency funds for agencies, mandate ""green"" rules for airlines, eliminate a payroll tax suspension, kick in additional help for hospitals, schools and food banks, and more. Here's what House Democrats have included in their bill and how it contrasts with the latest proposal from Senate Republicans: Democrats want to further plump the direct payments that would go out to Americans under the bill, proposing $1,500 per person, instead of the $1,200 on the table under the Senate measure laid out Sunday. Unlike the latest plan from Senate Republicans, however, higher earners would have to pay back part or all of the assistance over three years if their taxable income is $75,000 or more for a single filer or $150,000 or more for couples filing jointly. The money would be available to anyone with a tax ID number, and to retirees and people who are unemployed, rather than just to people who file taxes for 2019 or get Social Security. Health care providers and community health centers would receive about $150 billion, while hospitals would get an additional $80 billion in low-interest loans. The proposal is more in line with industry requests, compared to the $75 billion Senate Republicans have offered. The House bill would also waive treatment costs, abandon certain barriers to accessing medicines and provide safety protections for health workers. The unemployed would get an extra $600 per week on top of state or federal benefits in order to replace 100 percent of lost wages. The measure would also extend paid sick leave benefits to cover individuals, such as health care workers and first responders, who were cut out of Congress’ second coronavirus response. House Democrats want to go much bigger in sending emergency money to federal agencies, proposing hundreds of billions more than the $242 billion Senate Republicans have pitched, according to a Democratic aide. The White House, meanwhile, has made a narrowly tailored request for $46 billion. If airlines are going to get billions of dollars in loans under the bill, Democrats say they need to cut their carbon emissions in half by 2050. The House’s measure would also kick in $1 billion to help develop sustainable fuels for planes and create a program for the government to buy less-efficient aircraft, à la “cash-for-clunkers.” The two stimulus drafts emerging from both chambers present markedly different stimulus tax plans, with House Democrats omitting the payroll tax suspension included in the Senate GOP bill. The Democratic plan would also expand health insurance premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act and beef up the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit and the Dependent Care Credit. Taxpayers could make early withdrawals from their retirement funds without having to pay the usual 10 percent penalty during the coronavirus crisis, and required minimum withdrawals would be suspended for 2020. Health insurance premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act would be expanded. The House bill goes much further than the Senate measure when it comes to limiting executive pay and stock buybacks, as well as imposing lobbying restrictions. For example, the House package would bar such corporations from lobbying the federal government — a move sure to arouse anger on K Street among Democratic and Republican lobbyists alike. Companies would get credits against payroll taxes for giving employees any kind of sick or family medical leave, not just for coronavirus-related reasons. Businesses would get to deduct losses from this year, last year and 2018 from their taxes for any of the last five years. The Senate bill includes a similar “carry back” provision. The House did not include provisions allowing faster write-offs for restaurant and retail business investments or bigger deductions for business interest, both of which are in the Senate bill. Airlines would receive about $40 billion in grants through the House package, as well as up to $21 billion for unsecured loans and loan guarantees for a total of $61 billion in aid. Senate Republicans have proposed $58 billion in loans and guarantees, plus a holiday from paying fuel tax. House Democrats would give the Defense Department an $8 billion emergency boost, including $500 million for purchases made under the Defense Production Act. The Senate GOP bill would provide the Pentagon with a $10 billion hike. Democrats are pitching $500 billion in grants and interest-free loans to small businesses, including $300 billion in forgivable loans to cover short-term payroll costs. That compares to $300 billion in loans for small businesses in the Senate bill. While hundreds of internet providers have already promised they will not cut off service to households and small businesses while the coronavirus rages, the bill would ensure it’s illegal to do so. Consumer debt payments would be suspended and the Federal Reserve would have to establish a program to reimburse creditors for lost revenue. The central bank would also have to support state and local bond markets, in addition to providing direct loans to small businesses. The bill includes an extra $450 million boost to food banks, as well as whatever funds are “necessary” to account for more people in need of food stamps. Senate Republicans had proposed about $15.6 billion in food stamp assistance. Hospitals would qualify for tax credits for charity care they provide and for creating or expanding facilities to handle the coronavirus patient load. Governmental employers, including public universities, would get tax credits for mandated worker leave due to the coronavirus. The FTC and top lawyers at the state level would get more power to go after people and companies that price-gouge during the pandemic. Besides spending $1.5 billion to help low-income households pay water bills, the House legislation would ban utility providers from cutting off service during the crisis. Democrats are calling for $60 billion in emergency assistance to go out for education initiatives, about three times the amount the Senate bill contains. That total includes $30 billion to help K-12 schools, as well as $10 billion for colleges and universities. By doing away with a mandate that the FCC sell off the T-band, the plan Democrats are pushing would make winners out of first responders in the ongoing fight over auctioning the spectrum they use for emergency communications.

"Joe Biden doesn’t occupy a political office, isn’t a great orator and is basically stuck in his house. It’s not much of a platform for projecting leadership during the coronavirus crisis.  That was laid bare Monday as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee gave his first coronavirus shadow briefing webcast. Biden’s been outgunned by President Donald Trump and outshone by some of the nation’s governors, among them New York’s Andrew Cuomo, whose crisis response efforts are drawing rave reviews. The former vice president was staid and somber, even as his remarks were marred by a few minor real-time snafus and slip-ups. The lighting in his newly converted home studio was subpar. The webcast time, 10:30 a.m., came an hour earlier than Biden had originally said the day before — ensuring a relatively small audience for a candidate who hadn’t shown his face in nearly a week. It wasn’t riveting TV. And the speech barely made a blip. “The problem is Joe Biden doesn’t have a bully pulpit,” said George Arzt, a veteran Democratic consultant who has counted Cuomo among his clients. Without the trappings of office, Biden has faded from the national stage as the coronavirus contagion chews through news cycle after news cycle. And without the actual authority that accompanies public office, he can’t make dramatic moves to muster the power of the government to make sweeping decisions that affect millions. It’s left him straining to remain relevant amid Trump’s daily briefings — carried live on cable television each afternoon. Add in the national media’s inherent geographical bias for its home base of New York — where Cuomo and even New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio have occupied oversize roles in national coverage — and it’s left Biden struggling to break through. “For Biden, the other difficulty is wedging himself into that,” Arzt said. “And you can’t easily wedge yourself into a crisis situation, other than say what you would do as president or say the president isn’t doing enough. But he could look very political.” Trump’s campaign has accused Biden of just that, as well as undermining the president, who has gained ground in the polls since he started daily White House press briefings. But Biden campaign advisers reject the criticism, saying that Trump’s news conferences do more harm than good to the president, and the country. Biden lauded Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, who has won plaudits for his steady-as-he-goes leadership and serving as a foil to a sometimes erratic Trump. “New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s briefings are a lesson in leadership,” Biden said Monday. “Republicans and Democrats all are rising to the moment, putting aside politics to do what has to be done. But they’re looking to the federal government for more help.” Cuomo was one of seven governors Biden singled out for praise, attempting to put a bipartisan sheen on his remarks by including three Republicans. Yet even there, he had a minor stumble, mistakenly calling Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker “Charlie Parker.”  Few who watched Biden’s briefing saw it as equivalent counterprogramming to Monday’s White House briefing, which featured the president, Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General William Barr and White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx, among others. Most other times, that briefing has featured Anthony Fauci, the highly respected director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Accustomed to speaking from behind a lectern, Biden decided to have one placed in the middle of his new home studio — an awkward fit amid the backdrop of bookshelves and personal pictures framed beneath a living room table lamp. There were hiccups that showed the telltale signs of a 77-year-old candidate adjusting to a campaign that’s gone completely online in a matter of days. At the start of the webcast, Biden wasn’t sure when he was live. A few minutes in, his teleprompter appeared to have broken as he tried, but failed, to gesture beneath the camera shot for an unseen aide to hand him notes. “The lectern in a living room look was really odd — nobody would do that in real life, so it shouldn't be done on social,” said Kevin Cate, former media strategist for one of Biden’s past opponents, Tom Steyer. “Vice President Biden can do regular addresses, but they should look more like what the Obama White House did, seated and direct to camera,” Cate said. “Social media craves authenticity and engagement, so they should also lean into interactive and engaging live formats.” But echoing the Biden campaign, Cate said he believes the political damage done to the president from his own misleading statements and distortions at his news conferences far outweigh any Biden stumble. One Biden adviser added that people are seeing that Trump “puts the bully in bully pulpit.” Biden advisers point out that Biden’s take-the-fight-to-Trump message has prevailed in the Democratic primaries and he won’t stray from a measured and moderate message that brought him to the precipice of clinching the Democratic nomination for president. “It’s a balance. We are holding the president accountable without inciting panic but being fact-based about it with the approach the vice president is always going to take,” a senior campaign adviser said. “We’ve been very clear about these places where the president failed to live up to this moment, and how the late response to this is one of the factors that has complicated a lot of these things. The vice president is a responsible actor and so the campaign is a responsible actor.”  Trump’s Monday news briefing offered a contrast in style with Biden, as the president took more than an hour’s worth of questions from reporters. Cuomo, too, takes questions from reporters at his briefings. In both cases, the exchanges with the two executives reveal much about their thinking, and add a dose of drama that makes the news conferences engaging to watch. Biden, at home, was unable to do the same Monday. While Trump has enjoyed majority support recently for his handling of the coronavirus his overall approval rating remains surprisingly low, said Patrick Murray, a Monmouth University pollster, whose survey released Monday showed Trump with 46 percent approval and 48 percent disapproval. That’s just a net 4-point shift in Trump’s favor from its national survey last month. “Historically speaking, when we enter a crisis like this, you see a big bump for the president, a real rallying around the flag,” Murray said. “What we’re seeing is an unusually small rally-around-the-flag levels of support.” Murray said “where the numbers have really gone up is with governors. Their approval numbers are in the 70s.” Bruce Gyory, a New York Democratic consultant, said Cuomo has thrived in the crisis precisely where Trump fails, by being consistent and calm and not picking fights with the press. “Even though Cuomo hasn’t become anti-Trump rhetorically, he has become the anti-Trump in capital letters by his conduct,” Gyory said. As for Biden, he said, he has little choice but to cede some of the political space to Cuomo and other governors. “Biden is smart to get out there,” Gyory said. “He can be patient about the issue coming back to him. Because if I were a Republican, I would be worried not about Biden or Cuomo’s daily briefing, it would be the public reaction to Trump.”",Biden goes in search of a bully pulpit,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/biden-delaware-coronavirus-2020-145234,politico
"Senate negotiations over the $1.6 trillion coronavirus stimulus package are hung up partly by a partisan tug-of-war over how to help farmers and ranchers impacted by the outbreak and provide more food assistance for low-income Americans. Senate Democrats blocked the stimulus plan twice on Monday as they seek a 15 percent increase in funding for the $60 billion a year Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, in exchange for provisions that would expand the Trump administration’s ability to send direct payments to cattle ranchers and other farmers, according to aides familiar with the negotiations. The provisions would restore tens of billions of dollars to an obscure Depression-era financial institution used for stabilizing the farm economy, as well as raise the Agriculture Department’s annual borrowing limit for the program from $30 billion to $50 billion. President Donald Trump used the institution, known as the Commodity Credit Corporation, to fund the trade bailout for farmers targeted by retaliatory tariffs in 2018 and last year. Senate Democrats are wary of creating an even bigger “slush fund” for the Trump administration to dole out payments to agricultural producers without guardrails, according to a Democratic aide. The aide said there’s a “general mistrust” of how USDA designed the trade mitigation program, which critics said unfairly benefited wealthier farmers and the multinational meatpacking giant JBS over smaller producers. The debate spilled over to the Senate floor on Monday, with Republicans from major cattle-producing states like Kansas, Nebraska and North Dakota accusing Democrats of suddenly backing down from a previously bipartisan agreement to help the agriculture industry, which had already been reeling from Trump’s trade war with China. “We were told by our Democratic colleagues that they wanted to make certain the money couldn’t just be spent on the livestock side,” Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) said. “And so … we changed the language to make certain that the secretary of agriculture could use CCC funds not only for livestock producers but also the crop side of agriculture.” “They’re objecting to it,” Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who spearheaded the effort to boost aid to cattle producers, said of the Democrats. “I urge my colleagues to get on board and support our farmers, our ranchers and our food supply. Support rural America.” Senate Agriculture ranking member Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who contends USDA has unfairly distributed trade aid, responded that there is bipartisan interest in making sure all segments of the agriculture industry benefit from the stimulus, as well as increasing the amount of food assistance for low-income Americans. “I understand the concerns about livestock. But about half of the country’s receipts are what we broadly call specialty crops,” Stabenow said, referring to products like nuts, fruits and vegetables. She added that Michigan tart cherry growers haven’t received any help from the administration’s trade bailout for farmers, despite unfair practices by competitors overseas. The latest version of Senate Republicans’ stimulus plan released on Sunday included more than $15 billion for food stamps — but Democrats and anti-hunger advocates said it only accounted for previously enacted SNAP changes and the anticipated rise in claims as businesses close and workers are laid off. The provision allowing USDA to borrow more money to support farmers was also left out of the House Democrats’ competing stimulus package, a draft of which was circulated Monday afternoon. The legislation did include extra assistance for small and mid-sized dairy producers. It’s not the first time the obscure CCC has tripped up high-stakes spending talks: House Democrats last year tried to freeze funding for the trade bailout ahead of a government shutdown deadline, saying there should be a “robust debate” on the cost of Trump’s trade war and greater transparency. But they backed down following complaints from farm-state members on both sides of the aisle. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has repeatedly said USDA won’t offer any more direct aid in 2020, arguing that the effort was meant to offset trade disruptions but wasn’t intended to be a commodity price support program. On the other hand, top lawmakers have called for more bailout funds in 2020 even before the coronavirus started spreading rapidly in the U.S., citing years of low prices and other long-term headwinds in the industry. And even Trump had hinted that there would be another bailout later this year. Spokespeople for USDA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.","Food stamps, farm aid stall Senate stimulus talks",2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/food-stamps-farm-aid-stall-senate-145293,politico
"On Sunday morning, a group of former military and intelligence officers were staged at a small airport on a Honduran island, loading up a plane that would whisk Americans back home amid the raging coronavirus pandemic. It wasn't a clandestine CIA operation, but it was a real life, movie-scene-worthy moment for 144 Americans and Canadians who were stranded on the island Roatan, desperate to get home during an out-of-control global pandemic. The lengths to which this small group stuck in a Central American country went to get home — going so far as to hire a private security firm — is just one storyline among thousands spread across the globe, as travelers overwhelmed airports and the State Department tried to repatriate Americans, while others have ended up stuck in foreign countries. One of the rescued Americans, Annie Perlick, a neonatal ICU nurse from Boston on vacation for a scuba trip, discovered she was about to be stranded when Honduras shut down its borders on March 15. Perlick tried the U.S. embassy and reached out to the senators from her home state with no luck. She purchased commercial airline tickets for later this week, as she watched flights being canceled left and right. ""It was an overwhelming sense of confusion, skepticism, misinformation, fear and frustration,"" Perlick told POLITICO. Then she heard about Global Guardian, a private security firm, which had begun to arrange a flight out of Roatan for several clients — including an entertainment company and law firm. Ultimately, Global Guardian, based in McLean, Va., ferried 144 people out of the country on a McDonnell-Douglas MD-80, a model that used to be in heavy rotation for airlines. But not before its CEO Dale Buckner, a 24-year Army special forces veteran, found himself giving instructions for how many pets passengers could bring on an airplane. ""There will be no alcohol. It'll be soft drinks only,"" Buckner told the passengers. Buckner said his firm typically works with corporate clients and ""high net worth"" families, and has evacuated roughly 2,000 of people — some by by air and some over land — from those categories over the last few weeks. When the company heard about others that were desperate to get home, Buckner made a few tweaks to its business model. Working with the Honduran government, U.S. embassy and FAA, they figured out how to take a disparate group of stranded people and essentially operate like an airline, except that all of its people on the ground were former military, law enforcement or intelligence types, as Buckner put it. It worked, after Buckner arranged conference calls with skeptical passengers. Now, he says, they're looking to repeat it with more flights in Honduras and elsewhere. ""I've never seen the world shut down at this scale, where airspace and borders are closed,"" Buckner said in an interview. ""This is unique, a black swan. So of course we, being in this business, are going to really ramp up."" Global Guardian charged $1,324 per passenger — somewhat more than typical airfare for a one-way commercial flight from Honduras to the U.S., but less than the State Department is charging for its ongoing repatriation flights from Morocco. Buckner said they created a ""financial waterfall"" price model where the more seats they filled on the plane, the less each individual passenger would have to pay. Buckner acknowledged that the pandemic offers a chance to make money for companies like his, saying it should be ""a very profitable event for us. We're in the emergency response business,"" he said. ""But we're not ripping people off. We're not gouging people."" The State Department has been taking on evacuations largely on a case-by-case basis, working to arrange charter flights out of different countries including Guatemala, Morocco and Peru where it’s been difficult or impossible for citizens to buy commercial tickets back home. The military has been involved in the efforts as well and has brought home Americans using its aircraft, according to several reports. A senior State Department official told reporters Monday that the U.S. government has bought home more than 5,000 citizens from 17 countries, but that there are around 13,500 more asking for help. In some cases, Americans have chosen to take matters into their own hands by, for example, crossing over the border from Guatemala into southern Mexico to get onto airline flights still flying.",How a private security firm helped 144 stranded North Americans leave Honduras on a jet,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/private-security-firm-north-americans-honduras-145224,politico
"RICHMOND, Va.—I'm an ER doctor in central Virginia, and just a few weeks ago, I would have told you that after 15 years’ experience, I’m ready for anything, including the coronavirus. “Looking forward to going in and kicking butt, like our kids on game day, but with a lot more personal protective equipment,” I recently texted one of my sports-mom friends. Now, however, I’m not feeling so confident. Being an ER doctor as our country braces for the impact of Covid-19 feels like standing on the shore and watching a tsunami approach. I work nights in a small community emergency department, and as the only physician in the entire hospital, it’s up to me to handle whatever comes through the door. I’m scared. And the reason isn’t just this disease, it’s the equipment we need—and don’t have—to fight this fight. Last week, just days after they announced the first two Covid-19 cases in my home state of Virginia, I asked where we keep our stocks of N95 masks. These aren’t the more common soft, surgical masks; N95 masks are harder, tighter around your nose and mouth, and constructed to filter out 95 percent of airborne particles. I have a small supply of N95 masks in my ER, but if we were hit with a sudden wave of suspected Covid-19 patients, I wanted to know where to get more. The answer was that they are locked in a manager’s office and can only be accessed during nightshift by calling hospital security. I’m not surprised they’re under lock and key, given concerns about theft and hoarding. Already, there has been at least one case in Richmond of someone bursting into an ER waiting room, grabbing a box of masks, and fleeing. The dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment in front-line hospitals like mine isn’t scaring just me—it’s scaring my physician friends around the country, with shortages of N95 masks, gowns, goggles and gloves being reported in states from New York to Washington. This is the equipment that gets wrapped together as “PPE,” an acronym unfamiliar to most people but a standard—and critical—term for any front-line health care worker. When a patient comes in with an infectious disease, PPE is what lets you keep being a doctor instead of becoming the next patient, and maybe the next statistic. This week, we received the same warning that emergency department teams everywhere are hearing: Once this disease arrives in force, our PPE supply will not last. To preserve them, we are being asked to wear masks only when treating suspected Covid-19 patients, and those masks should be the less-safe surgical masks—they'll block droplets, but not invisible, aerosolized virus. In other words, surgical masks will work if someone coughs or sneezes in the room, but not if I’m doing a procedure like intubating, in which I’m close enough to inhale aerosolized particles. Right now, we’re being told we should use N95s only for procedures on known COVID patients who put us at the absolute highest risk of exposure. When we do use an N95, we’re supposed to store it to be re-used indefinitely until it’s either soiled or gets fluid on it from a positive Covid-19 patient. In the worst-case scenario, the CDC is telling us we can put a bandana over our face. I’ve seen the pictures of Chinese health care workers in protective ensembles that are far more elaborate than anything I have available. I’ve read the New England Journal of Medicine study that detected coronavirus in aerosols for up to three hours, and I know I really need to be wearing an N95 mask, not just a surgical mask, to protect me from aerosolized spread. I know two emergency room doctors like me have already fallen ill and are in critical condition — one in his 70s in New Jersey and one in his 40s — roughly my age — in Washington state. Both are in the ICU fighting for their lives. I can’t help but feel that we should have been better prepared. Even during the Ebola scare—for a disease that barely appeared on American shores—we used head-to-toe impermeable garb that left not one single inch of skin exposed. Despite the fact that a U.S. citizen was more likely to die from a vending machine falling on them than from Ebola, we did serious drills on how to don and doff these spaceman-like suits. I remember having to get checked off on my donning and doffing proficiency before I was allowed to be responsible for any potential Ebola patients. Now, if we still have these wonder suits in our hospitals, they are not being brought out. Why are we comparatively so much less frightened about the coronavirus, which is more ubiquitous and has already killed significantly greater numbers of people? ER docs are fighting a war, but we are not young, impressionable soldiers who will blindly stumble into battle unprepared. The more dire the circumstance, the more critically we question possible paths forward. The current path we are on is not sitting well with me, or many of my colleagues. Here’s why. First of all, we question how safe it is to protect ourselves only around patients with symptoms. We know asymptomatic people are spreading the virus — as early as three days before showing symptoms. For now, in Virginia, my patients with head injuries and heart attacks are much less likely to have asymptomatic Covid-19 than patients in New York or California, but that might not be true for long. Soon the virus will be widespread enough for us to have a high index of suspicion for Covid in anyone, whether they have respiratory symptoms or not. We already might be at that point; we just don’t know it because of the paucity of testing. A colleague recently saw a patient triaged as “headache.” Only after he got close enough to put a stethoscope on her chest did she divulge that it was sinus pressure accompanied by fevers, cough and exposure to a family member who recently returned from Europe. We need enough PPE to wear a mask with every patient regardless of complaint. Secondly, real life in the ER is nowhere near as neat and clear as the algorithms our public health officials are creating. While I’m trying to risk-stratify patients to know what level of protection I’m supposed to use according to the latest algorithm, I’m simultaneously navigating inefficient computer systems, fielding questions from three different people, trying to get to the multitude of patients waiting for me, and watching EMS crews bring even more patients through the door. As my colleague learned with his headache patient, patients don’t always give the full story when they’re triaged. Also, the virus won’t always wait for the highest risk interactions like intubating and suctioning to take the opportunity to spread. We shouldn’t wait until we intubate or suction to wear N95s. Furthermore, the Covid-19 test is not always completely reliable. Just like the flu test, there are going to be false negatives. Thirdly, board certified emergency physicians are too precious a resource—just 39,000 of us for the entire country—to be gambling with their health. In small hospitals like mine, physician groups are small and staffing is slim with limited backup. Trust me, with our expertise in making fast decisions and rapidly directing flow, you want veteran ER doctors on the front lines protecting you, not quarantined, ill or dead. Without enough PPE, it’s a matter of when, not if we go down. Physicians from other specialties will take our place, but they will not have the same skills. The ophthalmologists, orthopedists, or nephrologists who will replace us in the ER will do their best, but with no disrespect to our friendly eye, bone and kidney specialists, are they really the doctors you want to see when you arrive in the ER with a suspected coronavirus infection? The demoralizing reality I face is that more PPE might not be coming. So last week I went to my local hardware store and bought myself a face shield. I’m posting on social media, along with other doctors and nurses on the front lines, using the hashtag #GetMePPE. It’s crazy to be a physician shopping in a hardware store for medical equipment. Meanwhile, I’m losing sleep over the predicament of having no good course of action. Do I use masks with every patient to protect myself from asymptomatic spread and risk running out of masks entirely? When the PPE runs out, do I keep going in, like a firefighter charging into a burning building in a Speedo and flip-flops? The deaths of Italian doctors Robert Stella and Marcello Natali, who valiantly kept working without PPE, are a terrifying warning. Will I come to a point where I have to make a decision about saving my family or saving my patients? I worry about my two teenage sons and my parents in their 70s. My family didn’t sign up to take this risk. In an attempt to protect them, I’ve set up a decontamination zone in my laundry room—when I come home after my shift, I go straight to the laundry room, strip and leave all work paraphernalia there before setting foot in the rest of the house and hugging my kids. Last night I cried as I made the decision that, if it comes to a shelter-in-place situation, my sons will stay with other family members, not with me. There is nothing harder for a mother. The public support for us as we deal with these challenges is humbling. Suddenly ER doctors are heroes. I have never in my career been thanked and praised so much for doing my job. However, if my colleagues and I are going to have a fighting chance to protect our citizens, we need more than words of encouragement. Last week, President Donald Trump called for construction companies to donate masks. New legislation signed Wednesday will let U.S. manufacturers sell N95 masks made for industrial uses to hospitals without fear of liability. On Thursday, the president signed the Defense Production Act, to give the federal government authority to harness industrial production, but has not yet forced any companies to produce equipment. In Virginia, distilleries have started making hand sanitizer; dentists and schools are providing their own medical supplies to health care facilities. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam activated our National Guard to be on call to help transport supplies that health care facilities need. This isn’t enough. This past weekend, Virginia’s Health and Human Resources Secretary Daniel Carey warned us that “this will not be solved without a national solution.” Without more serious action to provide the armor we need on your front line—not just now, but for months, maybe years, as long as this virus is sweeping through an unimmunized population—this disease will be picking off health care workers one by one. Please don’t let me be one of them.",‘Like Standing on the Shore and Watching a Tsunami Approach’,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/23/covid-doctor-ppe-143943,politico
"As the corona crisis expands into both the greatest public health challenge of our age and what will surely be one of the greatest economic ones as well, leadership at the federal level has been much criticized. This past week, however, one thing became clear: Donald Trump may be exactly the president we need now. This is not a testament to his leadership during the crisis or praise of his skills as a chief executive. His administration has not to date covered itself in glory. Homeland security experts have been rightly critical of his administration’s response on multiple fronts, ranging from failure to prepare a comprehensive testing regime to refusing to use the powers of the federal government to coordinate the state-by-state responses. He has seemed indifferent at times and less than urgent about what is needed. But last week, something shifted as the full scale of the challenge the virus presents sunk in, together with the recognition that significant loss of life is not out of the question and economic wreckage is now certain. And, now, the newly scared Trump is prepared to do what he does best: Spend gobs and gobs of money.  As most recognize, Trump was never an ideological Republican; he was an opportunistic one. He embraced the core of the Republican Party as a path to power, and the GOP slowly embraced back, especially as he created a conduit to deregulation and the appointment of Federalist Society-vetted judges. The distractions of Russia-gate and the impeachment turned him into a boogeyman for the left and a hero-by-default for the right. But at core, Trump remained in it for himself.  One thing that Trump has always been able and willing to do is spend other people’s money for his own personal gain. Some of that gain has been financial; much of it has been reputational. And if there is one thing the United States now needs more than ever at a rate barely contemplated ever before is for the federal government to spend and spend and then spend some more. Cancel everything. Bail out everyone. And Trump will lead the charge, or at least take credit for not standing in its way. This is not meant to be facetious. From 1929 to 1933, the Hoover administration adamantly stood against bailouts and spending while the economy unraveled and unemployment soared to 25 percent. The incoming Franklin D. Roosevelt administration initially cut budget spending in the belief that a balanced budget was needed to fight the Depression. FDR quickly realized that only massive spending on an unprecedented scale could stem the damage. In 2008-09, it took months for Congress and the White House to agree to financial bailouts and then a stimulus package totaling about $800 billion that was still inadequate. Today, within a week of recognizing the crisis, Congress is working on multiple bills that amount to over $2 trillion in the form of direct checks to Americans, interest-free, forgivable loans to small businesses provided they do not fire their workers, and bailouts for decimated airline, hospitality and other industries. In addition, the Federal Reserve is utilizing its almost unlimited balance sheet to shore up banks, municipal bonds and money market funds.   Via Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Trump has been making clear to Congress, to House speaker and nemesis Nancy Pelosi and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he wants to go even bigger and bolder, including more paid sick leave, a payroll tax holiday and student loan debt deferrals. Having dear-leadered themselves into a Trump bear hug, congressional Republicans who might otherwise balk at these measures have nowhere to go and nothing to fall back on. Having ignored ballooning deficits for the past few years, they already were on weak ground arguing for fiscal discipline, but the vestiges of their free-market ideology are no match for this current crisis.  Trump was never a budget hawk and has never touted the line that government shouldn’t spend the way most of his party has. But as president pre-corona, he was largely amenable to traditional Republican Party prescripts about cutting social spending, maintaining a robust defense budget and paring back the federal bureaucracy along with tax cuts for corporations. Post-corona, he is morphing into something rather different. He is embracing spend baby spend, and that is precisely what we need. Senator Bernie Sanders, who will not get the Democratic nomination, would have endorsed all of this. In a crisis, we are all socialists, and given that Trump never cared what he was, becoming that is painless. Think about this: When Andrew Yang was advocating universal basic income and a check to all Americans in the bygone era of two months ago, he was dismissed as a diverting oddity whose policies existed only in policy-wonk la-la land. Sometime in the next weeks, his plans will become a reality as the government starts mailing everyone money. What was unthinkable is now happening. Student loan forgiveness was denounced as encouraging moral hazard. Now we will have at a minimum deferred payments and there is talk of a much more radical remediation. Payments to people to stay on payroll and not work during a business downturn. Check. No foreclosures in times of duress? Check. The only thing not yet being contemplated is universal health care, but when the unemployment rate soars above 10 percent on its way to 20 percent if the current measures don’t work, that will be on the table as well. And you can be sure Trump will embrace it and claim that’s what he wanted all along.  The losers here, and that is putting it mildly, are the free-market Republicans who have sold their souls to Trump and now have no principles left to stand on. They will revive their mantras about cutting spending and impending fiscal disaster at some point in the next months. But the traditional GOP argument that everything we are now doing couldn’t and shouldn’t be done will in fact be done. Trump is not an ideology; he is not a platform; he is an id that will do what it takes to survive. And for now, that means unleashing the greatest surge of government spending that the country has ever seen, even including wartime.  Should we get through this without total collapse, Trump could well find the ticket to his reelection, as he may well take credit for anything short of the apocalypse. And frankly, if we get through with an economy wounded but not destroyed, perhaps some credit will be due. But the Republican Party will be decimated ideologically. Either way, and regardless of whether our response to this virus in shutting down everything will prove more deadly to our society than the actual lethality of the disease, what we need right now is to spend more than we ever have and have ever believed possible at lightning speed. And Trump is just the man for that job.",Trump Is Actually the President We Need Right Now,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/23/trump-president-need-right-now-141906,politico
"As government work slows and non-essential workers are sent home to prevent the spread of COVID-19, money is getting tighter — and many in the national security community are wondering whether their security clearances could be on the line as a result. The U.S. national security apparatus has played a key role in the coronavirus response, monitoring how the disease has affected closed societies like China, Iran and North Korea while working to prevent the virus from spreading inside the nation’s intelligence and defense agencies themselves.  But the disruption of normal government operations as agencies implement “social distancing” policies could leave federal contractors and their employees without a paycheck, potentially jeopardizing their ability to hold or maintain a security clearance if they start to miss payments and incur debt. Clearance holders or applicants who have debt are considered more vulnerable to bribery or coercion, and financial irresponsibility is generally considered to be indicative of irresponsibility in other areas.  Senior national security officials are now reassuring lawmakers and the workforce, however, that clearance-holders won’t be penalized for financial difficulties incurred through no fault of their own. In a March 13 letter to Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.), obtained by POLITICO, Dale Cabaniss — who subsequently resigned as director of the Office of Personnel Management for unrelated reasons — indicated that financial hardships imposed by efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus would generally not reflect negatively on clearance-holders and applicants.  Cabaniss cited federal guidelines that direct agencies to consider whether an applicant’s financial difficulties stemmed from circumstances beyond their control, and whether the applicant made a good-faith effort to meet their financial obligations anyway.  “While this guidance specifically does not apply to national security eligibility determinations, Federal personnel security policy separately considers the financial challenges some employees may experience due to no fault of their own,” Cabaniss wrote.  Warner had asked Cabaniss and acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell to pledge that security clearances would not be affected by the efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus. ODNI didn’t reply, but National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina issued a statement on the subject on Monday.  “During this time of unexpected challenges to our nation as a result of COVID-19, we are acutely aware of the potential for economic hardship on security clearance holders,” Evanina wrote. “It is imperative that we ensure trusted security clearance holders, or applicants, who may suffer financial hardship as a result of the virus, are not unduly penalized because of circumstances beyond their control.” Evanina also cited federal guidelines that encourage a “whole person concept” approach when vetting personnel for clearances. Echoing Cabaniss, Evanina emphasized that a clearance-holder’s debt may be mitigated if the conditions that led to it were largely outside of their control and the person acted responsibly under the circumstances. Evanina added that he would “notify departments and agencies for their attention” to that guideline. Mark Zaid, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer specializing in national security, said “any financial difficulties” can cause security clearance problems. But he said “there is always mitigation,” adding that clearance-holders were in a similar position during the 2008 financial crisis.  “So long as they're not acting irresponsibly, the coronavirus crisis will be taken into account,” Zaid said.",Intelligence community wrestles with a security threat: Coronavirus hardship,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/intelligence-community-security-threat-coronavirus-144992,politico
"The Democratic National Committee insists its July convention is going forward as planned — even as Democrats across the country are increasingly skeptical it will happen. “There are no plans to cancel the convention and we are not considering a rules change at this time,” Xochitl Hinojosa, the DNC’s communications director, said Monday after news reports that the party is in the process of devising backup plans. “Contingency planning is a routine part of preparations for any convention.” Hinojosa’s statement came the same day an International Olympic Committee member, Dick Pound, told USA Today Sports that the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games will be postponed. The Olympics were scheduled to begin in late July, shortly after the DNC’s July 13-16 gathering. There are nearly four months until the convention, many Democrats note. But planned walk-throughs of the convention site in Milwaukee have been delayed, according to multiple Democratic sources, and many convention organizing staffers are working from home. “Given what the experts are saying, delegates may end up on a phone call” selecting their nominee, Bob Mulholland, a DNC member from California, said in a text message. “Push 1 for Sanders, push 2 for Biden, push 3 for Bloomberg and push 8 for Yang, etc.” Still, Mulholland said of the convention’s prospects, “It is full speed ahead until a staffer yells ‘Iceberg.’” The DNC's steady-as-she-goes posture stands in contrast to some of its own state parties. Wisconsin Democratic Party officials said they're busy trying to figure out all the digital tools they need to be virtual for their state convention in June, just a month before the national convention in the state.  Democrats could pursue a range of options if a traditional convention is not possible, including postponing the gathering or changing the rules to allow delegates to vote remotely. If the convention had to be canceled, said Matt Bennett of the center-left group Third Way, the alternative could be relatively straightforward. Think video meetings, absentee voting and “a bunch of speeches that are televised from studios.” But he said that even if Democratic Party officials were considering altering the convention, they could not hint at that until a decision is made, for fear of scaring off donors and other attendees. “If the DNC even intimated that they’re not having a convention, then we’re not having a convention,” he said. “I think it’s truly up in the air.” Behind the scenes, the DNC has made some moves that acknowledge the precarious situation, including researching what are the bare minimum of procedures that must occur — either in Milwaukee or virtually — in order to officially nominate a candidate, according to one official familiar with the conversations.  Questions about the convention were reignited on Monday, when Katie Peters, communications director of the Democratic National Convention Committee, said the DNC is “exploring a range of contingency options to ensure we can deliver a successful convention without unnecessary risk to public health.” Shortly after issuing that statement, officials cast that posture as no different from what they've been saying for weeks, long before the coronavirus pandemic fully took hold. Two weeks ago, the DNC’s convention committee said “every convention necessitates developing a number of contingency plans to provide for a variety of scenarios.” The Republican National Committee has been similarly insistent that its convention is going according to plan, especially given that it doesn't begin until Aug. 24.  The Democratic convention is also more complicated than the Republican one because of the state of the ongoing primary. Joe Biden is almost certain to become the nominee, and any large changes to the convention would likely have to be signed off on by his campaign. People involved in convention planning have begun referring some questions to the Biden campaign.  Yet Bernie Sanders has not dropped out of the race, and Biden has yet to secure the delegates necessary to claim the nomination outright. The Biden campaign declined to comment on the state of the convention. Meanwhile, the electorate is in seclusion, and the presidential campaign has been reduced to flickers on a livestream.",DNC insists its convention is on — but many Democrats aren't buying it,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/dnc-insists-democratic-convention-on-144714,politico
"A Justice Department lawyer urged a federal appeals court Monday to give President Donald Trump’s White House broad leeway to pull journalists’ press passes for conduct the president or his aides deem unprofessional — even though opinions seem to differ widely about how to define that term in the Trump era. The case argued before a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals stems from an altercation in the Rose Garden last July between Playboy‘s White House reporter Brian Karem and former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka following a summit for social media influencers. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham on Aug. 16, 2019, suspended Karem’s so-called hard pass for 30 days, saying he acted unprofessionally and disturbed ""decorum"" by insulting guests and challenging Gorka to a fight. In September, a federal judge restored Karem’s pass in a preliminary ruling that said the journalist did not receive sufficient notice of the rules governing his conduct. Justice Department attorney James Burnham said the White House wasn’t required to have a formal policy in order to take action over behavior that was beyond the pale. “Every credentialed White House reporter, including Mr. Karem, knows perfectly well that they are not permitted to engage in unprofessional behavior on the White House grounds,” Burnham said. “There has always been an enforceable requirement that reporters with hard passes behave in a professional manner.” Burnham, who argued the case in the district court and was recently named as a counselor to Attorney General William Barr, said Karem’s position that he’s entitled to know all specific rules in advance would mean reporters couldn’t be punished for sexually harassing White House staff, shouting racial epithets or even for mooning the president unless the White House made public rules barring such acts. “That’s clearly incorrect,” Burnham said during arguments that took place by telephone conference call as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. He complained that Karem was claiming “one free shot at any egregiously unprofessional conduct that the White House has not expressly prohibited beforehand.” Karem’s lawyer, Ted Boutrous, said Trump encourages a “carnival-like” environment at White House events that leaves considerable ambiguity about what kind of behavior by reporters is fair game. “This unruly, raucous, circus-like atmosphere … President Trump, for better or worse, creates that sort of atmosphere,” Boutrous said. At times, the differences between the two sides were stark. While Boutrous said letting the White House ban a reporter over his comments posed “a real First Amendment danger,” Burnham disagreed.  “This is just not a First Amendment case,” the Justice Department lawyer said. Burnham also hammered away at Karem’s defenses of his conduct, particularly his claim that offering to have “a long conversation” with Gorka was a genuine invitation to have a discussion in nearby Lafayette Park. “That is an utterly preposterous explanation for what Mr. Karem engaged in here,” Burnham said, However, the judges did not seem particularly troubled by Karem’s actions, which the district court found not obviously outrageous in the context of the freewheeling event. Judge Nina Pillard seemed most squarely in Karem’s corner, lambasting Burnham for arguing that the reporter wasn’t entitled to prior notice of what kinds of behavior could lead to suspension of his credentials. “Mr. Karem had a press pass. And the notion that the standard for taking it away when the only basis was speech by Mr. Karem and the whole area is obviously you know a First Amendment-protected area, that the authority there would not have to be announced in advance, I just find that astounding,” said Pillard, an appointee of President Barack Obama. “I mean: Of course, it has to be announced in advance.” Pillard also said she found it curious that there was no indication other White House reporters had ever had their passes pulled for “unprofessional” behavior.  “Isn’t it relevant that nobody who has shouted at the president or jostled another journalist or done things that one might under your reading see as clearly unprofessional, has ever had [a] press pass suspended?” she asked. Burnham said those sorts of actions were “categorically different” than insulting White House guests. “None of the other reporters who didn’t have their questions answered felt like they needed to insult the gathered guests,” he said. Judge Sri Srinivasan was somewhat harder to read, expressing concern that letting Karem escape with no consequence might mean that reporters were free to engage in any behavior that wasn’t illegal, no matter how disruptive, offensive or inappropriate. He asked what the White House could do if a reporter was “screaming and yelling ad nauseam, laced with profanity and epithets.” Boutrous said the Secret Service could take action against anyone who seemed like a threat and the White House could temporarily remove someone from an event if his or her behavior was bizarre. In addition, the White House could give a reporter a formal warning or call the person’s editor to complain.  “That’s how it’s always been done,” he said, but suspension of a reporter’s pass went too far in the absence of a clear rule, clearly violated. During the episode last July, Karem unsuccessfully shouted a question at the president as he left the event. Guests at the event then began taunting him, prompting him to shout: “This is a group of people who are eager for demonic possession.”  Gorka then ran out of the crowd toward the press section, declaring: “You’re not a journalist. You’re a punk!” Karem then suggested taking the conversation “outside,” as a Secret Service agent stepped forward with apparent concern the two men might come to blows.  In response to another hypothetical from Srinivasan on Monday, Burnham took a sweeping position that the White House could suspend a reporter over just about any threat to fight a White House guest, even if the threat seemed to be in jest and followed a similar comment from the guest. “The gray zone is fair game,” Burnham insisted. The telephone arguments — which ran to about 70 minutes, more than double the allotted time — went off largely without incident. However, they were delayed briefly by difficulty getting Burnham on the line. The third judge on the panel, David Tatel, was extremely difficult to hear on the audio feed streamed via the internet. The case is the first fight over White House credentialing to reach the powerful appeals court in more than 40 years. In 1977, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the First Amendment required that Nation Magazine reporter Robert Sherrill be given a clear basis for denial of a White House pass and an opportunity to challenge the refusal. The court also said the White House needed to articulate “an explicit and meaningful standard” for who was entitled to such passes.",Court grapples with White House’s right to suspend press passes,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/court-white-house-press-passes-144848,politico
"Corporations that receive coronavirus relief loans would be banned from lobbying the federal government under a new proposal backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. House Democrats drafted the bill, the text of which is circulating on K Street and was obtained by POLITICO, even as Pelosi also negotiated with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer this weekend on a separate package that McConnell is trying to pass through the upper chamber. A procedural vote to advance the Senate bill on Monday afternoon failed. While McConnell’s bill includes some restrictions on how much companies that receive coronavirus relief loans, Pelosi’s proposal goes much further. House Democrats’ bill would ban corporations from paying bonuses to their executives or paying any compensation to fired executives until the corporations repay their coronavirus relief loans to the federal government. The bill would also ban corporations receiving relief loans from buying back their own stock or paying out dividends to shareholders. And it would bar such corporations from lobbying the federal government, in a move sure to arouse anger on K Street among Democratic and Republican lobbyists alike. McConnell’s bill, in contrast, only prohibits businesses that receive coronavirus relief funds from giving raises for two years to employees who make more than $425,000 a year. It also bans such companies from paying severance packages to employees who make more than $425,000 that are worth more than twice what the employee made last year. Pelosi’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither the bank bailouts of 2008 nor the rescue of General Motors and Chrysler the following year banned the companies receiving aid from retaining Washington lobbyists. General Motors, Chrysler and banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo continued to lobby the federal government after being bailed out, according to disclosure filings. The lobbying provision in House Democrats' bill could also face questions about whether it violates corporations’ First Amendment right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. “Lobbying is, to some extent, considered First Amendment activity, and there are limits on the ability of government to condition the receipt of money on a relinquishment of First Amendment rights,” Rick Pildes, a New York University law professor who specializes in constitutional law, wrote in an email to POLITICO. “Since the businesses are under the gun and might have little choice in reality but to accept the money, the unconstitutional conditions issue would arise in a particularly sharp form.” Robert Kelner, a Washington lawyer who's advised clients on lobbying law, said corporations wishing to challenge the provision would have a strong case if it became law. “I think this would almost certainly be challenged in court, and there’s a very good likelihood the Supreme Court would strike it down,” Kelner said.",Pelosi proposal would ban corporations receiving coronavirus aid from lobbying,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/pelosi-coronavirus-relief-lobbying-144779,politico
"LONDON — U.K. police will be given the power to enforce strict new government rules about when people can leave their homes, Boris Johnson said Monday night as the government tries to halt the spread of coronavirus. British people will only be allowed to leave their homes to shop for basic goods, to exercise once a day, to receive care or help a vulnerable person and to travel to essential work, the U.K. prime minister said during an address to the nation from No. 10 Downing Street. Police will be given powers to issue fines and disperse gatherings, he added. All shops selling non-essential goods, libraries, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship will close and no more than two people will be allowed to gather in public. All social events including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies will be stopped, apart from funerals.

"The Senate seems about to burst.  Normally staid lawmakers were angrily clashing on the Senate floor Monday and the chamber remains deadlocked over an emergency package to rescue the economy from the coronavirus pandemic. The Senate has failed twice in two days to move forward on a massive $1.6 trillion-plus economic stimulus amid objections from Democrats, causing tempers to flare among senators who are becoming increasingly agitated and restless over the frustratingly slow pace, while more Americans are getting sick and losing their jobs.  Just after noon on Monday, the usually mild-mannered Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) erupted when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) sought to block her from speaking while he sought clarity on the Senate’s voting schedule for the day. It prompted Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) to blurt out, “This is bullshit.” Collins apparently agreed.  “Here we are facing an enemy that is invisible, but equally devastating to the health of our people and to the health of our economy,” Collins said. “And yet, unbelievably, the Democratic leader objected to my even being able to speak this morning. Is that what we've come to?”  Collins confronted Schumer separately in front of his desk and pointed her finger at him. “You are objecting to my speaking? This is appalling,” she could be heard telling Schumer.  In the meantime, Schumer kept objecting to Republicans seeking recognition on the Senate floor, prompting jeers from the GOP side of the aisle. He eventually relented and consented to the Senate taking two procedural votes by voice, which sped up the process only slightly. The episode marked a rare moment on the Senate floor: an actual debate, with senators interrupting each other while others sat back at their desks and hissed under their breath. It was a reflection of the magnitude of the crisis and the rising pressure caused by the rapid spread of a virus that has already infected one of their own, Sen. Rand Paul, and continues to ravage the U.S. economy and roil global financial markets. Throughout the afternoon, Republicans were lining up to speak on the Senate floor one by one, angrily chastising Schumer for continuing to block procedural votes over what Democrats see as an irresponsible corporate bailout being proposed by Republicans. Cotton harangued senators by name over their objections to the GOP-authored coronavirus bill, including Democratic senators whose states are “bankrupt.”  Despite the clashes, Senate Democrats and Trump administration officials insist they are “very close” to a deal and were engaged in active negotiations as of Monday afternoon. But that didn’t stop senators from sniping at each other with open hostility. The acrimony persisted even as senators acknowledged that the issues they were confronting were among the most serious any of them have ever faced, and that responding to the coronavirus crisis demands bipartisanship.  “The country is burning, and your side wants to play political games,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said at one point, gesturing to Democrats.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), too, was livid in his opening remarks, accusing Schumer of treating the coronavirus crisis like a “juicy political opportunity.” Democrats were continuing to block procedural votes to speed up the legislative process, preventing the coronavirus package from moving forward as talks dragged into a fourth day.  McConnell said Democrats were seeking to add unrelated poison-pill provisions to the legislative package; Schumer said Republicans were trying to do the same, and that Democrats would continue to block further action until he reaches an agreement with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been running point for the White House on the congressional negotiations.  “We are working on all of these items in good faith, as we speak, and we hope and expect to conclude negotiations today,” Schumer said. “Leader McConnell continues to set arbitrary vote deadlines when the matter of real importance is the status of the bipartisan negotiations.”  Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who has expressed frustration in recent days that the Senate was still convening in person as the number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. rises above 30,000, said the tensions on the Senate floor in that moment were being “reflected” in homes all across the country.  Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), known for his folksy demeanor and dry humor, later poked fun at the seeming absurdity of what had transpired on the Senate floor.  “You know what the American people are thinking right now? They're thinking that the brain is an amazing organ. It starts working in a mother's womb, and it doesn’t stop working until you get elected to Congress,” he said, later adding: “This country was founded by geniuses, but it's being run by a bunch of idiots.”",‘This is bulls---’: Bitterness takes over Senate as lawmakers clash on rescue,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/senate-coronavirus-rescue-package-144233,politico
"The White House Correspondents Association on Monday said a reporter who was at the White House multiple times over the last two weeks is suspected to have coronavirus, according to an email from the organization.  The reporter was at the White House on March 9, 11, 16 and 18, and the WHCA is encouraging all journalists present at the White House during those days to ""review public health guidance, consult their medical professionals and take the appropriate next steps.""  The WHCA has contacted the individual's news organization and the office of the White House physician. ""We ask again that all members who can stay home or work remotely please do so. Please do not come to the White House if you do not have a workspace or an assigned seat on that day. And please DO NOT come into the White House if you are feeling at all ill,"" the statement said. A number of news organizations have confirmed that some of their employees contracted the virus. And the WHCA has issued new protocol for White House journalists, cutting the number of available press room seats in half — leaving a half-empty briefing room as President Donald Trump addresses the nation about the pandemic.  On Monday, shortly after the organization announced that a journalist might have the virus, the WHCA issued even stricter guidelines, cutting the seats from 25 to 14 reporters. The new orders, working to comply with social distancing guidelines in a cramped work space, have thinned the press room as reporters sit with empty seats between them.  Even Trump had something to say about the briefing room last Thursday, telling reporters they were still ""sitting too close.""  ""We should really get rid of another 75 to 80 percent of you,"" Trump added as he appeared to needle reporters, suggesting he'd prefer to only have ""two or three"" reporters that he likes in the room.  Officials have also begun checking the temperature of reporters before they enter the White House briefing room, and periodically throughout the day. If a reporter registers an elevated reading, he or she is asked to leave the grounds.  The organization also announced Sunday that it was postponing its annual dinner set to take place in April.

"Former campaign workers for Mike Bloomberg are suing the billionaire former presidential candidate for fraud, alleging in a nationwide class action lawsuit that as many as 2,000 employees were promised to be paid through the general election before he laid them off. Plaintiffs in the class action include two organizers who halted the interview process for other jobs to join the Bloomberg campaign, and another former organizer who postponed law school to work on Bloomberg’s 2020 effort.  The filing comes on the same day as another class action brought by a former Bloomberg field organizer that similarly argues the employees were tricked into taking jobs they were told would continue for a year.  The lawsuit by the three former workers in Georgia, Utah and Washington state, also filed in federal court in New York City, contends that the field organizers were fraudulently induced to accept jobs with the Bloomberg campaign based on the promise of guaranteed salaries through November. The ex-field staffers who filed the suit, Alexis Sklair, Nathaniel Brown, and Sterling Rettke, are represented by Peter Romer-Friedman of Gupta Wessler PLLC, and Ilann M. Maazel and David Berman of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady LLP. Bloomberg on Friday purged all of those workers in six battleground states and guaranteed they would be paid only through the first week of April, with their benefits expiring at the end of that month. The first big round of layoffs across the rest of the country happened earlier this month, with their pay lasting through March 31. Bloomberg hiring materials described as coming from headquarters promised work with “Team Bloomberg” through November, regardless of whether he became the Democratic nominee, provided that the aides working across the country were willing to relocate. Bloomberg’s team reiterated their plans to follow through — even if only in spirit — after the initial round of layoffs, when top campaign advisers indicated in emails and staff conference calls that they would be given priority on a planned Bloomberg super PAC. Instead, Bloomberg announced Friday that he had decided to transfer $18 million of his own money to the Democratic National Committee to help presumptive nominee Joe Biden. The campaign invited former field organizers to apply for jobs with the party through its “competitive process,” with no guarantee of a job. ""Thousands of people relied on that promise. They moved to other cities. They gave up school, jobs, and job opportunities. They uprooted their lives,"" the lawsuit states. ""But the promise was false. After Bloomberg lost the Democratic nomination, his campaign unceremoniously dumped thousands of staffers, leaving them with no employment, no income, and no health insurance.  ""And, worse still, the Bloomberg campaign did this during the worst global pandemic since 1918, in the face of a looming economic crisis. Now thousands of people who relied on the Bloomberg campaign’s promise are left to fend for themselves.""  Bloomberg aides were also told that the field offices in battleground states would remain open. A Bloomberg spokesperson issued a statement Monday saying the campaign paid its staff wages and benefits that were ""much more generous"" than any other campaign this year. They said staff worked 39 days on average, but they were also given several weeks of severance and healthcare through March. ""Given the current crisis, a fund is being created to ensure that all staff receive health care through April, which no other campaign has done,"" the spokesperson said. ""And many field staff will go on to work for the DNC in battleground states, in part because the campaign made the largest monetary transfer to the DNC from a presidential campaign in history to support the DNC’s organizing efforts.” Attorney for one of the group of litigants said in a statement that while ""our clients would like to speak publicly about their experiences, they are potentially subject to a confidentiality and non-disparagement agreement with Mike Bloomberg 2020. We respectfully request that the Bloomberg campaign release our clients and the other field staffers from that agreement, even though it may not be enforceable.” Attorneys not working on the cases said such class action lawsuits are often combined.  Bloomberg field organizers were among the highest compensated in the election cycle, and enjoyed generous health benefits, in addition to $5,000 for relocation costs.  While all of the field organizers are believed to have signed at-will contracts with the campaign, they argue in the lawsuit that they can bring these claims based on evidence that they were induced to sign on because of the longevity promises made to them.  The promise of sustained pay months after a campaign ends is exceedingly rare in politics. But in more than a dozen interviews with POLITICO, the former aides said it was key to their decision to join. Bloomberg quickly amassed a staff of thousands after launching in November, then ended his campaign after a feeble showing on Super Tuesday. Since news of their dismissal, scores of former Bloomberg staffers have been organizing online in preparation for taking legal action. They’ve established several chat and email groups to share their experiences, with many expressing deep frustrations about losing their pay and health care benefits in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.  Aside from the action filed Monday, there are believed to be other claims coming from other groups of ex-staffers. The lawsuit states that Sklair relocated from Charleston, S.C. to Savannah, Ga., to work as a field organizer for Bloomberg. Before joining the Bloomberg campaign, she was an organizer for Cory Booker’s presidential campaign.  At the time that Sklair accepted the job with Bloomberg, the lawsuit states, she had just been offered a position on a state Senate campaign in South Carolina that would have likely lasted throughout the general election. After taking the job with Bloomberg, she declined to move forward. Brown worked as an organizer for Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign and moved from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City, Utah to work for Bloomberg in January. He said he dropped out of advanced stages of the hiring process for a job as an organizer with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

"A half-dozen governors on Monday moved to place restrictions on their states' residents in an effort to blunt the spread of coronavirus as the number of cases across the country continues to swell.  Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Jim Justice of West Virginia took the most dramatic action, ordering residents to stay home except for essential outings and ordering non-essential businesses to tell employees not to report to work. Republican Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, along with Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, stopped short of ordering residents to stay inside, but all three on Monday ordered all non-essential businesses in their states closed. Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, meanwhile, teased that his own shelter-in-place order would come Tuesday, dubbing the initiative “Safer at Home.” In a string of tweets, Evers noted that the order would walk back his previous declaration that he would not be issuing a shelter-in-place order. Evers, a Democrat, said more details of his order would become available in the next day. The flurry of measures announced on Monday follow in the footsteps of eight other state leaders who have issued similar mandatory orders: Ohio, Louisiana and Delaware issued stay-at-home orders on Sunday, joining California, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut. Last week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York ordered all non-essential workers to stay home. Whitmer's order, which goes into effect at midnight Tuesday and will remain in place for at least the next three weeks, comes as the governor noted that Michigan went from having zero reported cases of the virus to more than 1,000 in under two weeks, though such an increase was somewhat expected as testing kits became more widely accessible. Maryland’s restrictions went into place at 5 p.m. Monday, while Baker’s order takes effect beginning at noon on Tuesday and will extend until at least April 7. In West Virginia, the last state in the country to report its first coronavirus case, Justice said the shelter-in-place order would go into effect on Tuesday at 8 p.m. In addition to Northam’s mandate for non-essential businesses to be shuttered, effective at midnight Wednesday, he also closed schools in Virginia for the remainder of the academic year, extending an initial two-week closure.  Northam joined other states in the capital region in his order, leaving the District of Columbia as the only government in the region without similar orders. On Friday, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser extended the city’s ban on mass gatherings and ordered the closure of parks and schools. In a news briefing on Monday afternoon, she urged residents to stay home, but said she would not be issuing a stay-at-home order.  “We have basically closed down the District, so the gathering places where D.C. residents can go have been shut down,” she said, adding that the city was “continuously” reviewing other types of businesses that don’t adhere to the social-distancing principles pushed by health officials. Hogan on Monday also defended his decision not to issue a stay-at-home order, as well as his edict‘s being labeled as less restrictive. Maryland’s guidelines “are somewhat more restrictive than other states that are calling it shelter in place,” the governor said in an interview on CNN. Hogan, who chairs the National Governors Association, said that debates over the severity of states’ restrictions were mostly “semantics,” pointing to some shelter-in-place states still allowing workers to go to their jobs and adding that at least for Maryland, “we just believe the actions we're taking will be more effective.” In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott has resisted a statewide shelter-in-place order in favor of letting local leaders make those decisions, but on Monday he requested a presidential declaration of a major disaster from President Donald Trump. In a letter to the president, Abbott said he had concluded that the coronavirus threat in Texas was so great that federal assistance was necessary to combat its spread.  “Texas is all-in on our response to COVID-19 and we need Washington’s financial assistance as provided for under the law to support our efforts to limit the spread of this virus,” he wrote.  The new action in recent days comes amid reluctance by Trump to mandate social-distancing measures at the federal level, despite a number of state leaders pleading for the president to order fixes to what they've complained is a patchwork pattern of restrictions across the country. Trump said on Friday he would not be ordering any kind of shelter-in-place restrictions at the federal level, citing an unevenness in infections in different parts of the country. Rather than push for further social distancing, the president has begun to signal a growing skepticism to en masse lockdowns because of the economic devastation they have caused throughout the country.",Half-dozen more governors announce new restrictions to curb coronavirus ,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/four-more-governors-announce-new-restrictions-to-curb-coronavirus-144240,politico
"A growing number of lawmakers are pleading for Congress to start working — and voting — from home as millions of Americans are ordered to shelter in place to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Nearly 70 House Democrats on Monday sent a letter to their leadership in support of voting remotely amid the coronavirus crisis, an unprecedented step that comes as the virus has infected three members of Congress. Many lawmakers and aides of both parties privately fear that the virus could spread rapidly on Capitol Hill if the House decides to return from recess and put roughly 435 lawmakers in the same room to vote. The letter, led by Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), urges House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) — whose panel is reviewing the possibility of remote voting — to allow for a temporary rule change at a time of national emergency. “Congress should be no exception to adapting to this crisis,” the letter reads. “The House must adopt remote voting both to protect public health and to allow us to be the voices of our constituents.” The letter includes senior Democrats like House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), as well as several West Coast lawmakers, like Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna, Pete Aguilar and Barbara Lee, all of California. The pressure is also growing in the Senate, which remains in session this week as negotiators from both parties attempt to reach a nearly $2 trillion deal that would expand the nation’s ability to deal with the crisis, on both the public health and economic front. Two GOP senators on Monday came out publicly in support of voting remotely, one day after one of their colleagues, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), announced that he was positive for the virus. “I’m ready to support remote voting,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) tweeted on Monday. “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. It is time to bring the Senate into the 21st century.”  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C) — who had previously been lukewarm on the idea of voting electronically — also changed his stance. “We should make this change before the Senate leaves town,” Graham tweeted on Monday. For Republicans, the threat of the virus could also pose a numbers problem: As of Monday, five GOP senators are sidelined from voting on the Senate floor because Paul is battling the infection and four others are self-quarantining after possible exposure. That further narrows the margins for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as he attempts to muscle a massive economic rescue package through the chamber in short order. Anxiety has been mounting in the Capitol, particularly after Paul’s diagnosis on Sunday. The Kentucky senator had been in the building, attending meetings, voting on the floor and even using the Senate gym as he awaited the results of his test. Paul said he had not been aware of specific exposure. But House and Senate leaders have warned that allowing members to vote remotely would be one of the biggest procedural changes to Congress in history — not to mention a massive and complicated undertaking that would take time to develop. Some members have also raised security concerns with the prospects of voting electronically, especially if the system is created on a tight timeline with room for error. ""There is definitely a debate going on, certainly among the freshman, about what's the right thing for us to do. Is it for us to get on airplanes and get on vehicles and get down to Washington and vote in person?"" Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) said in an interview Monday. ""For me, while I think it’s interesting think about remote voting later on, I’m concerned about the security."" ""Everyone’s working at such a breakneck pace that anything we establish right now wouldn’t go through the vetting to actually do a very historical thing,"" Slotkin said. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer has said that the House would “adjust our voting procedures” to comply with guidance from federal health agencies, which have strongly warned against all gatherings of more than 50 people. Democrats have considered ideas like holding the vote open longer to limit the number of lawmakers on the floor at one point. For the hidebound institution of Congress, that might be as far as lawmakers go, for now.",Push for remote voting grows as lawmakers fear coronavirus poised to spread,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/congress-remote-voting-coronavirus-144119,politico
"President Donald Trump on Monday said he planned to pull the U.S. economy out of its coronavirus-induced slumber in a matter of weeks, and refused to commit to following the advice of his handpicked health experts — many of whom have warned that it will be a matter of months before it will be safe to reopen the country again — when reassessing guidelines for social isolation. “Our country wasn’t built to be shut down. This is not a country that was built for this,” Trump insisted to reporters during a White House press briefing with his coronavirus task force on Monday evening, predicting that “America will again and soon be open for business. Very soon. A lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting.” The president complained that he didn’t want to let the “cure” to the fast-spreading pandemic — social isolation that has prompted the shuttering of businesses across the country and cratered the economy — to be worse than the disease itself. He even claimed, without evidence, that the economic downturn caused by continuing the social distancing recommendation could result in more deaths “than anything we are talking about with respect to the virus.” Trump very strongly hinted that he planned to ease federal guidance on social distancing at the end of his administration’s “15 Days to Slow the Spread” initiative, which ends next Monday, despite an expected explosion of reported cases as tests for coronavirus become more widely available. Current guidance instructs Americans across the country to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people; work or attend school from home whenever possible; and abstain from eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts. But in more than a dozen states with higher concentrations of cases, governors have issued mandatory shelter-in-place directives or ordered all non-essential businesses closed. Health experts are in agreement that social isolation is imperative to blunting the spread of the disease, and on Monday, health officials cast the coming week as the most critical yet for the effort to “flatten the curve” of infected individuals and prevent resource-strapped health care systems from becoming overwhelmed. They also maintain that the fallout will be worse if the White House declares victory now, only to have the virus resurface in coming weeks or months . But Trump went back and forth in his press briefing, arguing that he could reopen the country while keeping an eye on the most at-risk populations, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. “We can do both things” at once, Trump insisted repeatedly, though he declined to offer a concrete date for lifting the current social-distancing suggestions.  The current guidance has contributed to a precipitous drop in economic activity. Unemployment claims are surging across the nation, and forecasters are predicting a depression-level decline in second-quarter GDP. Even more-stringent directives issued by state and local authorities, such as large-scale shelter-in-place orders, have similarly spooked financial markets and provoked fears of an imminent recession. Trump has repeatedly sought to reassure Americans that the economy will bounce back swiftly once the virus abates. But his own health experts remain unsure of when that will be, and in the meantime both Congress and the Federal Reserve have scrambled to cushion the blow to the economy, responses that Trump cheered on Monday. Already, there are more than 43,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus across all 50 states and at least 500 dead, according to a Johns Hopkins University database. Because of limited testing capacity, experts agree the actual number of positive cases is much higher. Still, Trump leaned on several dubious arguments to support his position. He fell back on a widely panned comparison between the fatality rates of coronavirus and the common flu, the latter of which can kill tens of thousands of Americans a year. He also repeated a similarly criticized comparison of coronavirus to the number of Americans killed in car crashes annually. Experts have called both attempts to draw parallels with coronavirus instances of false equivalency.  Then Trump asserted that economic downturns could be fatal in their own right.  “People get tremendous anxiety and depression, and you have suicides over things like this, when you have terrible economies. You have death,“ the president argued, adding — without evidence — that “probably ... definitely, it would be in far greater numbers than the numbers we“re talking about with regard to the virus.“ Trump began broadcasting his growing impatience with public health measures meant to combat the pandemic — even as public health officials have offered contradictory forecasts — on Twitter over the weekend, a shift that continued throughout the day on Monday. “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,” the president wrote on Twitter shortly before midnight on Sunday. “AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!” He then spent much of the morning retweeting posts that proposed Americans return to work in the near future and that advocated for a resumption of daily life in the U.S. The president’s stark disagreement with medical experts on whether the White House’s 15-day effort would be extended was on public display Monday, even before the White House briefing. Earlier in the day, Surgeon General Jerome Adams made a string of appearances on morning news shows, repeatedly cautioning that the coming days would prove among the most difficult in Americans’ fight against the public health crisis. Adams is one of a number of senior administration officials who have argued that social-distancing recommendations will need to be sustained, not slackened, to curb the swift spread of Covid-19, and cautioned that its threat to Americans would last longer than initially thought. “I want America to understand: This week, it’s going to get bad,” Adams told NBC’s “Today” show, adding that “we really, really need everyone to stay at home.” “As the nation’s doctor, I’m here to help America understand how we need to respond to this,” Adams said on Monday, when pressed on Trump’s weekend tweet previewing an impending “decision” on the administration’s guidelines. “And where I come down is that every single day counts,” the surgeon general continued. “Every single second counts. And right now, there are not enough people out there who are taking this seriously.” At Monday’s briefing, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House‘s coronavirus response coordinator, tiptoed around the subject. She demurred when asked whether she shared the president’s confidence about a diminishing need for broad social-distancing restrictions, and instead stressed the importance of a “granular” and “geographically targeted” approach to social distancing. “We went out with a very blunt force. I mean, we have to all be honest, we had to do that because we weren‘t sure where the virus was and where it is going,” Birx acknowledged, explaining that the next seven days would allow the administration to capture important data about the outbreak and its response. “I think over this week, we‘re concentrated on figuring out exactly where the virus is and making projections about where it‘s going and the impact of our mitigation pieces.”  She continued: “We‘ve learned this in tackling epidemics around the world: You have to focus the resources, and the intervention, and the structural prevention intervention in the area where the virus is circulating. Otherwise, people never understand why you‘re doing this and they don‘t have any virus.”  Birx pushed back when asked whether she thought Trump‘s public restlessness about the tight restrictions in place could result in people taking them less seriously, instead arguing that people might adhere more closely to their knowing they might be in place for only another week. Asked whether any doctors had backed his plan to ease social-distancing restrictions, Trump appeared to contend that it was imprudent to leave decisions that could have an economic impact solely up to scientists. He also dodged questions about whether he would listen to his health experts‘ advice. “If it were up to the doctors, they may say let's keep it shut down, let's shut down the entire world,” Trump told reporters Monday night, citing the global reach of the virus. “So let's shut down the entire world and when we shut it down, that would be wonderful and let's keep it shut for a couple of years. You know, we can't do that and you can't do that with the country, especially the number one economy anywhere in the world by far. Number one economy in the world. You can't do that.” While he said the advice of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Birx was “very important to me,” he added that “I’ll be listening to other experts,” as well.  “We have a lot of people that are very good at this, and ultimately it‘s a balancing act,” he said. “But the expression we can do two things at one time and we‘ve got an incredible country and that we have to keep it that way, and that includes not just economics, that also includes life and death. We have to keep it that way.” Fauci, for his part, offered an inconclusive response when asked on Friday how long Americans would have to remain socially distant. “I cannot see that all of a sudden, next week or two weeks from now, it’s going to be over,” he said. “I don’t think there‘s a chance of that. I think it’s going to be several weeks.” Fauci was not present during Monday‘s briefing, despite becoming one of the major public faces of the White House response. Trump told reporters that Fauci was in a private meeting of the task force. And Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration’s management of the outbreak, made a similarly bleak prediction this weekend, saying that “according to some of our modeling, we could well be dealing with coronavirus cases in the United States well into July.“ According to an internal report from the Department of Health and Human Services, produced last weekend and first reported on by The New York Times, the pandemic “will last 18 months or longer and could include multiple waves of illness.” Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said on Monday that Trump’s weekend tweet hinting at a potential suspension of social distancing “seems very counterproductive.” “The need for intense social distancing is very strong right now,” Lipsitch said, noting that an abrupt end to the practice could eventually overwhelm health care providers. “We should be thinking about not how bad it is now, but how bad it could be in three weeks,” he added. “It takes three weeks before you need intensive care if you’re getting sick, so we have to act now to stop what’s coming three weeks from now.” Those dire assessments clash with rising complaints from some of the president’s top advisers and conservative supporters that the economic devastation wrought by social distancing could prove more damaging than the coronavirus’ human toll. “We can’t shut in the economy. The economic cost to individuals is just too great,” Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, told Fox News in an interview on Monday. “The president is right: The cure can’t be worse than the disease, and we’re going to have to make some difficult trade-offs,” Kudlow said, adding that he had spoken to Trump “about this very subject” late Sunday evening. “We'll be looking at a number of different things,” he said. “Let’s give it another week.” Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, tweeted:“I think it is soon becoming time to have old and/or sick people take every precaution and healthy people go back to work forever changed [with] new habits in a grimmer reality.” Fox News host Laura Ingraham expressed frustration with the uncertain time frame for the federal government’s guidelines, writing that going back to work after 15 days would “require new protocols,” including wearing personal protective equipment. “A global recession would be worse for our people than the Great Depression,” Ingraham tweeted. “Doctors provide medical treatment and cures — they should not be the determinative voices in policy making now or at the end of 15 days.” “Even another week of this will mean millions more out of work, massive damage to businesses big and small, rental incomes, families at every income level, horrific pain and suffering,” she continued in another post. “But if we knew this was almost over, recovery would be easier.” It is not only White House allies who have begun to warn of the consequences of a protracted period of social distancing. Wall Street power brokers, some public health experts and at least one Democratic governor on the front lines of the outbreak have suggested that the U.S. workforce should begin preparing for a return to normalcy. Lloyd Blankfein, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, asserted that while “extreme measures to flatten the virus ‘curve’” were reasonable to “stretch out the strain” on health care systems, “crushing the economy, jobs and morale is also a health issue — and beyond.” “Within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work,” he tweeted. David Katz, the founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, encouraged a “more surgical approach” to counter the coronavirus, writing in a New York Times op-ed on Friday that resources should be focused on the especially vulnerable. The rest of Americans, meanwhile, would re-enter society and “develop natural herd immunity to the virus” while stabilizing the economy. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, the current epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., referenced Katz’s theory on Monday. During his daily news conference, Cuomo emphasized the “parallel tracks” of securing public health and beginning “to plan the pivot back to economic functionality.” “You can’t stop the economy forever, so we have to start to think about, does everyone stay out of work? Should young people go back to work sooner?” Cuomo said. “You turned off the engine quickly,” he added. “How do you now start or begin to restart or plan the restart of that economic engine? Separate task, but something that we have to focus on.” Arthur Allen contributed to this report.",‘Our country wasn’t built to be shut down’: Trump pushes back against health experts,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/trump-coronavirus-lockdown-skepticism-143800,politico

" BRUSSELS — Coronavirus is forcing governments to conjure up survival skills — not just for their citizens, but for democracy itself. Faced with unprecedented disruption to the decision-making machinery of government — including travel bans, and social-distancing restrictions on large meetings — officials in capitals worldwide have scrambled to adopt new working methods, including meetings by videoconference, and remote voting by ministers and parliaments. Many legislatures, including the European Parliament here, have already canceled all but the most essential meetings and debates until further notice — an acceptance, however reluctant, of the enormous logistical obstacles they now confront. But there are also worries of potentially dangerous breakdowns in checks and balances, as well as concerns that authoritarian-minded leaders could exploit public fear over the pandemic to weaken democratic institutions at a time of vulnerability. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is now pushing for legislation that would give him sweeping emergency powers to rule the country by decree for an extended period — prompting criticism from human rights officials. But even in capitals where such power-grabs are unlikely, the imposition of states of alarm or emergency — as exist now in many EU countries — has led some officials to conclude that new mechanisms may be needed to safeguard the role of lawmakers, and to preserve democratic scrutiny of the executive authorities. On Sunday, President of the Italian Senate Elisabetta Casellati issued an extraordinary statement, insisting that the parliament was still in business and calling on Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and his government to strengthen consultation with the Senate, as well as the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. ""The centrality of Parliament can never fail, especially when government measures limit citizens' personal freedoms and activities essential to the country's economy,"" Casellati said. ""It is therefore essential that the prime minister and the government establish a systematic link, which has never been implemented, with the presidents of the chambers regarding any regulatory initiative relating to the coronavirus emergency."" In Italy and elsewhere, however, it's far from clear governments whether will indeed continue functioning as normal as all branches of government come under unprecedented pressure. Political leaders, like everyone else, face personal danger of infection. Prince Albert of Monaco, as well as the first ladies of Canada and Spain, have already tested positive for the virus. On Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel went into self-isolation, raising fears that Europe could face part of the crisis without its most seasoned leader on the front line. Some governments, like the U.K., have raced to clarify succession plans. In Washington, at least five Republican senators are sidelined because they were infected or exposed to the coronavirus, potentially imperiling passage of emergency legislation to support the U.S. economy, and highlighting the risk of government paralysis as elected officials tasked with responding to the crisis fall ill. The U.S. has yet to come up with a Plan B to keep the Congress running, even as the Trump administration has sought new powers for the Justice Department to request indefinite detentions without trial during emergencies — highlighting the worries about executive overreach while legislatures struggle to function. The absence of the five Republican senators has cut the majority control of President Donald Trump's party to just one vote — 48 to 47 — and left them a solid dozen short of the 60 votes needed to overcome various procedural hurdles that must be cleared before legislation like the giant €1.8 trillion stimulus bill can be adopted by a simple majority. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, have urged a change to the standing rules to allow senators to vote from outside the chamber during a crisis. But changing the rules itself requires a two-thirds supermajority. Around the world, other governments are already taking extraordinary steps — some of which could permanently alter how those in power take decisions, hastening the acceptance of new technologies previously regarded as insecure or inappropriate for official business. Last week, the EU's College of Commissioners held its weekly meeting by teleconference for the first time. On Wednesday, during an extraordinary session of the Spanish Congress, deputies will be able to vote remotely on two decrees related to labor and agricultural policy as well as on urgent measures to respond to the pandemic and the economic fallout. And on Thursday, the 27 heads of state and government on the European Council will convene by videoconference, after scrapping their regularly-scheduled summit in Brussels, with the agenda narrowed to focus only on the crisis. The frantic efforts to keep government functioning reflect two equally vital imperatives — a need for government action, including emergency economic measures, in response to the crisis; and an acute desire to reassure citizens, businesses and financial markets that the authorities are in control — even if they were woefully unprepared for the outbreak. In some cases, however, officials are discovering that it is far more difficult than expected to set aside long-established rules that mandate in-person meetings or votes, often with a minimum number of participants required for a quorum. On Friday, EU ambassadors reached a deal on a plan that would suspend formal meetings of the Council of the EU for 30 days, allowing ministers to meet instead by videoconference. EU countries will then take formal decisions using a streamlined ""written procedure"" — a longstanding mechanism by which national capitals vote remotely on policy proposals. ""It's critical for our business continuity,"" a senior EU official said. ""We cannot just run away and say, 'OK, we'll come back after the crisis.'"" But what was expected to be a swift tweak to the rules, given the crisis, turned into more than two days of debate, which covered the practical limitations of videoconferences — including an inability to provide interpretation into all EU languages — as well as the legal, philosophical and even psychological ramifications of foregoing the in-person negotiations that are a hallmark of the EU decision-making process. ""These rules of procedure are there not just because we are rule fetishists,"" the EU official said. ""They are there because they are addressing some very real concerns and those concerns are about protecting the rights of member states."" The ambassadors shied away from a more far-reaching change that would have afforded videoconference meetings formal status. The top concerns were practical, and also related to the legal implications of the move. ""Because it's about lawmaking, we have to do it right,"" a senior ambassador said. A second senior ambassador portrayed the 30-day change as a moderate contingency measure. ""We are not going from meetings to kind of intergalactic video chats,"" the ambassador said. ""We still have all the structures, and the written procedure."" EU ambassadors representing the bloc's member countries continue to meet face to face but, to comply with social distancing, the size of delegations has been sharply curtailed. Ambassadors are limited to at most two advisers and sometimes none. Also, meetings are being held in the largest rooms at the Council of the EU to create distance between participants. At least the EU reached a decision, with capitals officially affirming the new plan on Monday. In Chile last week, an effort to adopt new rules to allow remote voting failed because not enough deputies supported the change. Across the Western world, parliaments are wrestling with similar questions. Graziano Delrio, the leader of the Democratic Party in Italy's Chamber of Deputies, has urged that plans be made to allow tele-voting. This week, the parliament is due to hold a hearing by videoconference with Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri, but it's not clear Italian conservatives will ever allow remote voting. In Spain, nearly all parliamentary work unrelated to the coronavirus has been stopped, despite a declaration earlier this month by the president of the Spanish Congress of Deputies, Meritxell Batet, who said, ""The Congress doesn't close."" But Spain is allowing remote voting, which it had previously limited only to deputies who received advance permission to be absent for strict reasons, including pregnancy or serious illness. In Canada, parliament effectively shut itself down for five weeks — a decision that was a bit less dramatic than it seemed given that it was already scheduled to be on recess for three of those weeks. In the U.K., parliament is carrying on — just with fewer parliamentarians. There are currently no plans for the House of Commons to stop meeting until March 31, when a pre-planned Easter recess begins, although the opposition Labour Party has called for that date to be brought forward by a week. Some MPs are nonetheless staying away, with last Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions session one of the most thinly-attended anyone in Westminster can remember. Scrutiny of government continues via the select committee system and in circumstances where MPs cannot attend, committee chairs are taking questions over text or email to put to witnesses. Still, as any journalist will tell you, asking questions by email is not the same as posing them in person. And reporters too face new obstacles to scrutinizing people in power. Daily press briefings with the British prime minister’s spokesperson in Downing Street became conference calls starting Monday. In that sense, the U.K. is just a bit behind the European Commission, which shifted to remote-only daily news conferences last Thursday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his recent daily news conferences on coronavirus might need to be done by remote, though he tried to reassure reporters they could still participate “I see your anxiety,"" Johnson, himself a former journalist, told them. ""I will absolutely ensure everybody gets to ask questions.” In Germany, lawmakers on Monday were close to changing a requirement that more than half of all MPs be present in person for many important votes, to limit chances of spreading the virus within the government. The current rules raised the prospect that at least 355 members of the Bundestag would need to be present in the chamber to push through emergency measures this week, at a time when German citizens have been ordered to practice social distancing by limiting meetings to just two people and with large gatherings banned. Without a change, many lawmakers were expected to watch the debate from their offices and enter the chamber only to vote. But on Monday, political group leaders reportedly reached a deal requiring only a quarter of MPs to be present. In France, the two-chamber parliament on Sunday voted to formally declare a health emergency. The National Assembly, the lower house, was nearly empty when the final decision was taken largely by proxy votes, to avoid a crowd. The bill grants the government the power to “decide, by decree, and upon the recommendation of the minister of health, general measures limiting freedoms to curtail movement and crowds"" and also empowers the minister to ""proceed with requisitions of of any goods and services necessary to fight against the sanitary disaster.” Elections have also been called into doubt by the virus. A second round of French local polls has been postponed, as have presidential primary elections in several U.S. states. But Poland is pressing ahead with plans for a presidential election in May — even as opposition politicians complain it won't be fair as they can't campaign effectively due to coronavirus restrictions, giving advantage to the incumbent, Andrzej Duda.

"The European Commission on Monday urged Europe's telecoms giants including Deutsche Telekom and Orange to share reams of people's mobile data from across the region to help predict the spread of the coronavirus. In a conference call with telecoms executives, Thierry Breton, Europe's internal market commissioner, called on the companies to hand over anonymized and aggregated data from people’s mobile phones to track how the virus was spreading, according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The draft plans would allow the Commission — and not the carriers — to manage how the data was used, and give EU officials control over so-called metadata on hundreds of millions of people’s mobile phones. That represents a significant step for Brussels as it would make the EU executive liable for any hefty fines if the digital information was hacked or misused. Speaking to POLITICO, Breton confirmed the request to carriers, adding that the Commission needed such aggregated metadata to track the spread of the virus and determine where people's need for medical supplies was the most pressing. “We will select one big operator by country,” Breton said. ""We want to be very fast and follow this on a daily basis."" The Commission insisted the operation would respect the bloc's privacy rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, and e-privacy legislation. The European Data Protection Supervisor would also be involved, the EU executive added.  When Breton first hinted at the project last week, a Commission official said the data would not be used to track whether people are complying with national containment measures. Governments in Italy, Spain, Germany, France and many other capitals have gone into lockdown in past days to fight the global pandemic, urging citizens to stay at home. It is not clear when Brussels would be able to create such a database of anonymized mobile phone information when countries are scrambling to combat the coronavirus which has now infected more than 370,000 people worldwide, leaving more than 16,000 dead. In recent weeks, mobile operators have started to share anonymized data with EU governments in response to the spread of COVID-19. Carriers involved in the discussions with the Commission said Breton's request would likely include providing the same type of data, and would have to respect the region's tough privacy rules. Breton's discussions were with chief executives of Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Vodafone and GSMA, the industry trade body. Mats Granryd, head of GSMA, said his association “and its members are doing everything they can to help the global fight against COVID-19."" He added that his members would work with the Commission, national authorities and international groups to use data to fight the crisis, but added any agreement would comply with European privacy standards. Still, two industry executives expressed doubts over how Brussels would ensure the data remained anonymized and securely protected. Since taking over at the Commission, Breton, the French official and former chief executive at the country's former telecoms monopoly, has been vocal about the need for Europe to create its own region-wide pool of data to compete with the United States and China. One executive, who spoke with POLITICO, cautioned that Brussels’ new plan could be part of the Commission’s broader strategy on data, and questioned which operators would be willing to sign up. “Brussels doesn’t want to waste this crisis,” said the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions. By aiming to pool large amounts of European mobile data, the Commission is following in the footsteps of national agencies, many of which are already working with carriers to track the spread of the virus through such anonymized digital information. In Norway, local researchers saw a 60 percent decline in people traveling between cities after a countrywide lockdown was introduced — figures that were taken from people's mobile phone data provided by Telenor, the national carrier. Yet as the crisis has continued, countries such as Spain and Poland have gone a step further by creating smartphone apps, which offer an even greater ability to track and monitor people’s movements compared to anonymized mobile data. In the U.K., an app is in the works but has not yet launched. Despite the Commission's demands for mobile data, its efforts to combat COVID-19 may be short-lived. Researchers, academics and telecoms executives say that as the coronavirus crisis has spread so quickly, the usefulness of such anonymized mobile phone metadata is quickly coming to an end. As people enter lockdown, often not able to travel beyond their neighborhoods, such digital information does not offer much insight because it is not granular enough to track people's localized movements. ""It's definitely not a silver bullet,"" said Linus Bengtsson, co-founder of Flowminder, a nonprofit organization that has developed its open-source tools to analyze people's mobile data. Mobile data to track diseases ""has always been a very sexy topic,"" he said. ""But it's only one piece of the puzzle."" Want more analysis from POLITICO?

"President Donald Trump on Tuesday sought to signal that he and Dr. Anthony Fauci are on the same page when it comes to combating the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States — making light of a perceived slight by the nation's top infectious disease expert and thanking him for recent complimentary remarks. The president's latest efforts at a show of unity with Fauci comes after a series of interviews, news reports and at least one conspicuous absence have hinted at heightened frustration with the career public health official. Fauci, who has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for three-and-a-half decades, has quickly become one of the most public faces of the government's coronavirus response. Trump on Tuesday morning seemed eager to reaffirm Fauci's standing within the administration amid the latest bout of palace intrigue. He retweeted a short clip of the NIAID chief's appearance on conservative media personality Mark Levin's talk show, during which Fauci described Trump as an incessantly inquisitive leader who heeds scientific counsel. ""Thank you Tony!"" the president wrote in an accompanying message. Trump even made reference on social media to Fauci's meme-worthy ""facepalm"" at a White House coronavirus task force briefing on Friday, sharing a post by a Twitter user who declared that ""Dr. Fauci is all of us."" The viral moment, which saw Fauci stifle a chuckle and apparently react dismissively to Trump's branding of the State Department as the ""deep state department,"" was among the inciting incidents that have sparked new speculation regarding his relationship with the president.  In that same White House briefing last week and another news conference on Saturday, the two men offered conflicting assessments of possible pharmaceutical treatments for the coronavirus, with Trump striking an optimistic tone and Fauci emphasizing the need for further clinical trials. Then, in an interview with Science Magazine published on Sunday, Fauci acknowledged the difficulties of fact-checking the commander in chief in real time, remarking that ""I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down."" On Monday, The New York Times reported that Trump's and some White House advisers' patience with Fauci had ""started to wear thin,"" but noted that the president has afforded the doctor ""more leeway to contradict him than he has other officials"" given the physician's credibility among journalists and the broader public. But when Trump arrived hours later at the White House's daily briefing, Fauci — normally a regular presence at the televised sessions with reporters — was not by the president's side. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence explained that Fauci was instead attending a meeting of the coronavirus task force. But to many observers, his exclusion from the briefing represented yet another indication of escalating tensions with the White House. At the same time, Trump demonstrated a greater willingness on Monday to potentially break with the advice of public health experts by suggesting he might attempt to restart the American economy after the administration's recommended 15-day period of social distancing. Asked whether Fauci, who has championed preventative measures throughout the federal response, sides with the president, Trump answered, in part: ""He doesn’t not agree.""

"Team Trump is rushing to rewrite the early narrative about the president’s response to coronavirus.  Faced with endless video clips of Donald Trump downplaying the escalating outbreak, Trump aides and allies are working furiously to instead highlight the president’s recent actions and comments. Their effort comprises three tactics: Blanket supporters with detailed timelines of every action the Trump administration took. Amplify praise of those actions. And forcefully push back against anyone who criticizes those actions. Just over seven months from the November election, Trump’s aides and allies realize the president’s campaign for a second term has been completely transformed in a matter of weeks. It will now come down to his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his response to a devastated economy, according to seven people familiar with the situation, including four who speak directly with the president. “The president and his performance is the campaign. It’s the only thing that matters,” said Scott Jennings, who worked for President George W. Bush and is close to the Trump White House. “There is nothing to do if you are the sitting president of the United States but to get it right. If you get it right, what better argument for reelection than this unprecedented crisis?” The Trump campaign had wanted to focus on a long list of other issues as the president launched a general election race against Democrat Joe Biden: the president’s impeachment acquittal, Biden’s acuity and overseas actions by Biden’s son, Hunter.  Instead, it has shifted almost entirely to rehabilitating Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “The watchword from here has to be action,” said a Republican who speaks to Trump. “Checks on the way. Treatments being tried. Travel bans in place. Information conveyed, in real time.” Trump allies who were confident about the president’s reelection prospects just weeks ago — thanks to a strong economy and record stock market — have begun to fret as they see him being blamed by state and local leaders, members of Congress and public health officials for failing to quickly test patients and distribute masks, ventilators and other supplies. The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at nearly 50,000 by the end of Tuesday with more than 600 deaths — and the worst has yet to come. Already, Trump critics are blasting Trump for his handling of the crisis. Priorities USA, the Democrats’ leading super PAC, is launching a $6 million ad campaign on Tuesday in the battleground states of Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Republicans for the Rule of Law, conservatives who oppose Trump, aired its first ad on coronavirus last week. Still, there’s some indication the Trump team’s efforts are working. Fifty-five percent of Americans approve of his management of the coronavirus outbreak, compared to 43 percent who disapprove, according to a ABC/Ipsos poll released late last week. The numbers were nearly reversed the week before when 43 percent approved and 54 percent disapproved. Trump has been fighting back through his now-daily news conferences at the White House, boasting his administration has done an “extraordinary” and “incredible job” while falling back on a familiar tactic of blaming the media. Trump allies said the campaign had no choice but to do what it always does when a crisis engulfs the presidency, from impeachment to the threat of war with Iran: quickly and quietly follow the president’s lead — pushing out new talking points, buying new Facebook ads and lining up voices to defend the president forcefully. “I think the president's people are adjusting their campaign very quickly,” said a Republican who is a friend of the president. The Trump campaign and RNC have scrapped MAGA campaign rallies and other events, shifting training and other events online, including last week’s national day of action and national week of training. But their main task these days is coronavirus. They‘ve been sending rapid-response emails to reporters, firing off emails and text messages to millions of supporters, issuing daily talking points to surrogates, posting social media messages and booking surrogates on TV and radio, according to a RNC official. “The American people have seen President Trump respond to this crisis with bold leadership and decisive action, and he will emerge from this with a strong record of results, putting him in a stronger position than any Democrat candidate,” RNC National Press Secretary Mandi Merritt said. The Trump campaign’s rapid response team has churned out hundreds of tweets in recent weeks — noting that Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York praised Trump, blasting congressional Democrats for holding up an economic rescue package, accusing the “liberal media” of spreading lies for reporting on Trump’s infamous “hoax“ comment at a rally less than a month ago — when the president called Democrats‘ criticism of his coronavirus response “their new hoax,” likening it to impeachment and the Russia investigation. “They want to try to control that narrative as much as possible,” said a Republican who speaks to Trump. “It’s irresponsible to do anything else.”  The campaign also released a detailed list of nearly 80 actions by the Trump administration to fight the virus since Jan. 6, a week after China reported the discovery of the coronavirus to the World Health Organization. “President Trump is fighting for Americans every day!” it wrote in a recent post. “His second coronavirus relief law provides free testing to all Americans, and makes sure families, workers, and businesses impacted by the Chinese virus are taken care of.” Conservative groups, including America First Policies, which supports Trump’s policies, and Tea Party Patriots, are amplifying Trump’s message and actions and fact-checking the media through media appearances and social media, the groups said. Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, said Americans can tell Trump took the coronavirus situation seriously because his administration announced restrictions on travel from China in late January. “That was a sign that President Trump was taking the potential threat the coronavirus posed to America very seriously,” she said. “At the time, many Americans kind of scoffed at that drastic action and yet now worldwide we’re seeing that same exact action happening in country after country worldwide.” Trump supporters hope they can counter statements from the president himself during the same period dismissing the threat. A week before the travel restrictions, Trump said “we have it totally under control. ... It’s going to be just fine.” Just a day before the travel move, Trump said the “very little problem” was under control and maintained “we think it’s going to have a very good ending for it.” Several Trump allies said the president and his campaign must convey that the economy will rebound from coronavirus in part because it had a strong foundation due to the president‘s actions over the last three years. “For our campaign, it will be key to convey to the people that America entered this crisis with enormous advantages and economic momentum,” one of the Republicans said. The campaign is also attempting to drag Biden into coronavirus, though it doesn’t appear to have garnered much attention — accusing him of “plagiarizing” Trump‘s plan to combat the coronavirus, defending China (where the virus first emerged) and confusing this virus with Ebola, which the Obama administration fought while Biden was vice president.  “Joe Biden sows fear and division as President Trump conveys optimism and hope,” the campaign wrote in one email. Michael Caputo, who served as a campaign adviser in 2016, said he worries Biden can blame Trump for his response to coronavirus while having to take no responsibility himself because he’s not in office. “They can criticize him for every move he makes,” he said of Biden’s team. An outside adviser said he has urged the campaign to return to discussing other issues, including Joe and Hunter Biden, to take the attention off Trump’s response to coronavirus and the tanking economy. “I don’t think those issues will ever be gone,” the person said.",Trump works to rewrite narrative on coronavirus response,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/trump-coronavirus-campaign-reelection-145007,politico

"FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor said the Trump administration on Tuesday would formally implement the Defense Production Act to secure medical equipment sorely needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic. ""So, just a little while ago my team came in, and we're actually going to use the DPA for first time today,"" Gaynor told CNN in an interview. Gaynor said triggering the act would help access ""about 60,000 test kits,"" and added that the administration would insert ""DPA language"" into the mass contracts for the federal government's order of 500 million personal protective masks.  President Donald Trump last week invoked the DPA as the administration broadened its response to the public health crisis, but he has resisted actually activating the statute — insisting that governors bear more responsibility for obtaining potentially life-saving supplies and arguing that the private sector would pitch in to furnish equipment voluntarily.  Meanwhile, state and local authorities have called for more forceful federal intervention as they struggle to get their hands on ventilators, hospital beds and other necessities before health care systems are overwhelmed by the rapidly spreading outbreak. Gaynor said on Tuesday that the administration ""wanted to be thoughtful about not upsetting, you know, the balance,"" and ensure that ""we can get it out to the market and the federal government not consume it all."" ""So we're going to use it, we're going to use it when we need it, and we're going to use it today,"" he said.

"OTTAWA — Justin Trudeau’s emergency economic decisions are taking shape in a virtual war room in which the prime minister is plotting Canada’s coronavirus response by teleconference. Out of these meetings, the Trudeau government is expected to introduce new legislation on Tuesday that will give Finance Minister Bill Morneau more powers over taxation and spending without the need for parliamentary approval. Trudeau started working remotely after his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, tested positive for COVID-19 on March 12. From self-isolation at his home, Trudeau has been holding phone calls with advisers, including officials from his own team and the Privy Council Office, “pretty much all day every day,” a government official tells POLITICO. Morneau has been a regular on the calls advising Trudeau, with the finance minister bringing forward recommendations based on information that has come up through the public service, the insider said. Teleconferencing itself has been an adjustment. The official said, for instance, the more-technical exchanges ahead of last week's aid announcement had to be done by phone without the visual aid of charts and graphs. The behind the scenes details provide offer a glimpse at the conditions in which Trudeau’s decisions have been made — as well as a peek at the process informing his economic calls. The prime minister has been working from his home office in the physical presence of only his three young children — no staffers and no ministers have been in the house. An inside look at the work also reveals some of the people advising the prime minister as he tries to address the rapid advance of an economic crisis. For example, the official said many of Morneau’s recommendations to Trudeau have come via input from the Finance Department’s deputy minister, Paul Rochon, and its associate deputy minister, Ava Yaskiel. The official said ideas and analysis from different departments across the government are flowing into the Finance Department on Morneau’s request. They are then turned into policy options ready for possible implementation. The official said the key people with input into the recommendations have included such officials as Rochon and Yaskiel, deputy ministers from other departments, key policy experts and Privy Council Clerk Ian Shugart. Other officials said to be driving their departments' answers to questions from Morneau and Trudeau have included deputy health minister Stephen Lucas, deputy employment minister Graham Flack and Canada Revenue Agency commissioner Bob Hamilton. Economic decisions, the official said, are also brought before Trudeau’s cabinet and the ministers on his government’s Covid-19 cabinet committee, which is chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. For instance, the official said in the lead-up to Trudeau’s multibillion-dollar economic announcement last week the prime minister held multiple phone discussions with some of these officials — including Shugart and Rochon — in the virtual war room. The aid package featured C$27 billion in support for workers and businesses and another C$55 billion in tax deferrals to help keep money moving in the economy for a few extra months. There are parliamentary checks on some of Trudeau’s emergency economic measures, which must be passed by MPs before implementation. The House of Commons will reconvene Tuesday with 32 MPs representing all parties to vote on parts of the aid package. MPs will also consider legislation that would give Morneau the authority to make tax changes without the need for parliamentary approval. Trudeau, as it happens, won’t be present Tuesday in the House. His 14-day period of self-isolation is only due to lift closer to the end of week.",Inside Trudeau's virtual war room: Where Canada's economic response is decided by teleconference,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/justin-trudeau-coronavirus-teleconference-146174,politico
"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to announce a bipartisan agreement Tuesday on a nearly $2 trillion emergency stimulus package to confront the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. But as those negotiations were continuing late into the night on Monday, President Donald Trump was sending mixed signals over whether he would ultimately support the imminent deal — even as both sides projected confidence amid heated partisan sniping on the Senate floor. “We expect to have an agreement tomorrow morning. There are still a few little differences. Neither of us think they are in any way going to get in the way of a final agreement,” Schumer said after his sixth meeting of the day with Mnuchin just after midnight. The Senate Democratic leader also said the Treasury chief, who has been running point on the negotiations for the White House, called Trump late Monday night to give him an update, adding: “[H]e seemed very happy with that.” The Senate could hold an initial procedural vote as early as Tuesday afternoon. On his way into Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office for a meeting, Mnuchin said he had spoken with Trump twice so far Tuesday morning, and had been on a conference call to update congressional Republicans. ""We're looking forward to closing a bipartisan deal today,"" Mnuchin said, flanked by incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. ""The president wants us to get this done today."" Eric Ueland, the White House’s legislative affairs liaison, reiterated Tuesday morning that they do not have a final agreement but are drafting legislative text to present to committee leaders.  “There are issues that remain to be discussed between Republicans, Democrats, the administration,” Ueland told reporters as he entered the Capitol.  “I’m hopeful we can get this right in the next several hours, so that Congress can be in a position to be able to act today,"" Ueland said, though he noted: ""Everybody seemed to expect a vote in the past few days up here on the Hill.""  Stocks soared as trading opened Tuesday morning, with the Dow Jones Industrial average spiking more than 1,000 points, as investors eye an imminent deal. On the other side of the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was also projecting confidence that a deal could be clinched on Tuesday. “I think there is real optimism that we could get something done in the next few hours,” she said during an interview on CNBC, saying Senate Democrats did a “great job” in the negotiations. Still, Trump took to Twitter late Monday night to harangue Democrats over their demands. “Republicans had a deal until Nancy Pelosi ]rode into town from her extended vacation. The Democrats want the Virus to win? They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies,” Trump tweeted. “They want Open Borders & Green New Deal. Republicans shouldn’t agree!” And early Tuesday morning, the president again chastised Democrats — but later appeared supportive of the deal, urging the Senate to act immediately. “Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!” Trump wrote. Mnuchin insisted that Trump was looped into the discussions, and said Trump’s initial tweets slamming Democrats were only related to House Democrats’ separate bill, which includes several provisions that Republicans were objecting to. Schumer was seeking added protections for workers in the final version of the bill, in addition to a so-called “Marshall Plan” for U.S. hospitals, which could soon be overrun with coronavirus patients. The New York Democrat also extracted a key concession from Mnuchin: strict oversight over a $500 billion fund designed to lend money to corporations that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, according to three sources. Democrats had criticized the initial proposal as a “slush fund” that provided no mechanisms for accountability and allowed the Trump administration to withhold details about which companies received such loans. During her CNBC interview, Pelosi said the fund would be overseen by an inspector general and a congressional panel. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Rules Committee, is recommending that the House pass the Senate’s emergency package by unanimous consent or a voice vote, which would allow lawmakers to remain in their home districts. Notably, Pelosi said Tuesday that she is aiming to pass the Senate bill by unanimous consent. House Democrats will convene on a conference call on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the path forward. McConnell (R-Ky.) had been pushing hard for a vote by Monday, but Senate Democrats over a two-day period defeated two procedural motions on the bill, citing ongoing negotiations between Schumer and Mnuchin. Republicans bitterly attacked their Democratic counterparts on the Senate floor Monday, accusing them of playing political games while the economy and global financial markets remain in a free-fall. The coronavirus has already hit the Senate, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announcing on Sunday that he tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, several other senators decided to self-quarantine due to their close interactions with Paul and other individuals who tested positive. Paul’s diagnosis — in addition to Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s (D-Minn.) announcement Monday that her husband contracted the virus — underscored the urgency for Congress to approve a rescue package, with several senators expressing wariness over the fact that the chamber was still convening daily despite federal recommendations against large gatherings.

"Twitter said it will not take action against politicians’ tweets on the origins of the coronavirus outbreak unless they pose a “clear incitement” of physical harm, indicating it plans to largely stay on the sidelines of an intensifying blame game between U.S. and Chinese leaders.  “Official government accounts engaging in conversation about the origins of the virus and global public conversation about potential emergent treatments will be permitted, unless the content contains clear incitement to take a harmful physical action,” Twitter’s public safety arm tweeted late Monday. The announcement arrives as the rapid spread of the virus — first identified in Wuhan, China — has ignited a global war of words on and off social media over its origin. President Donald Trump and other Republican officials have repeatedly referred to the outbreak as a “Chinese virus,” stoking warnings among Democrats that the rhetoric will incite violence against Asian Americans. Meanwhile, Chinese officials have suggested without evidence that the illness may have originated in the United States, angering Republican lawmakers.  Trump has also repeatedly promoted unproven treatments for Covid-19, including an anti-malarial drug that his own health officials caution needs much more testing to determine whether it is safe and effective.

"FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor said the Trump administration on Tuesday will formally implement the Defense Production Act to secure medical equipment sorely needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic. ""So, just a little while ago my team came in, and we're actually going to use the DPA for first time today,"" Gaynor told CNN. The FEMA Administrator said triggering the act would help access ""about 60,000 test kits,"" and added that the administration would insert ""DPA language"" into the mass contracts for the federal government's order of 500 million personal protective masks. Gaynor later stressed on Fox & Friends that the law would be used narrowly as ""leverage."" Federal delays in rolling out widespread testing have sparked criticism from state officials who have said they are woefully underprepared to handle the unfurling pandemic. One testing kit serves roughly 300 to 400 patients. President Donald Trump last week invoked the DPA as the administration broadened its response to the public health crisis, but he has resisted actually activating the statute — insisting that governors bear more responsibility for obtaining potentially life-saving supplies and arguing that the private sector would pitch in to supply needed equipment voluntarily. Meanwhile, state and local authorities have called for more forceful federal intervention as they struggle to get their hands on ventilators, hospital beds and other necessities before health care systems are overwhelmed by the rapidly spreading outbreak. When the federal government invokes the DPA, private manufacturers are required to fill federal orders for medical equipment before any other. But implementing the law does not do anything to increase production of these items, which increasingly are in short supply. Even amid a push to expand the nation's testing capacity, for instance, there are looming shortages of key materials needed to run tests. Trump has alternately said state officials have been given everything they need, particularly for testing, and that they need to provide some essential supplies — like protective masks — themselves. State leaders, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, have railed against the approach, urging the president to “do more.”  Cuomo said Sunday that his administration had overpaid to secure desperately needed masks. Trump referenced possible price gouging on necessary equipment in a Monday press conference, telling reporters, “We will not allow anyone to exploit Americans for profit.” Gaynor appeared to take a softer approach to invoking the act in his appearance on Fox & Friends. ""We ask every governor — if you can find it, buy it. We are ready to use the Defense Production Act,"" he said. ""If we need as it leverage, we have it as leverage now."" Gaynor told CNN that the administration ""wanted to be thoughtful about not upsetting, you know, the balance,"" and ensure that ""we can get it out to the market and the federal government not consume it all."" Though the president had delayed invoking the act, HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in late February that his department could use the measure to procure a range of necessary personal protective equipment. “We’ve spoken of procuring at least 300 million N95 masks,” he told reporters on Feb. 28. “We need additional gowns — the Tyvek gowns, as well as gloves,” he added. The president's executive order directed Azar to work with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and other officials to determine top priorities and allocate resources.

"President Donald Trump on Tuesday sought to signal that he and Dr. Anthony Fauci are on the same page when it comes to combating the rapid spread of the coronavirus in the United States — making light of a perceived slight by the nation's top infectious disease expert and thanking him for recent complimentary remarks. The president's latest stabs at a show of unity with Fauci come after a series of interviews, news reports and at least one conspicuous absence have hinted at heightened frustration with the career public health official. Fauci, who has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for 3½ decades, has become one of the most widely recognized and respected faces of the federal government's response to the novel coronavirus. On Tuesday morning, Trump seemed eager to reaffirm Fauci's standing within the administration amid the latest bout of palace intrigue. He retweeted a short clip of the NIAID chief's appearance on conservative media personality Mark Levin's Fox News talk show, during which Fauci described Trump as an incessantly inquisitive leader who heeds scientific counsel. ""Thank you Tony!"" the president wrote in an accompanying message. Trump even made reference on social media to Fauci's meme-worthy ""facepalm"" at a White House coronavirus task force briefing on Friday, sharing a post by a Twitter user who declared, ""Dr. Fauci is all of us."" The viral moment, which saw Fauci stifle a chuckle and apparently react dismissively to Trump's branding of the State Department as the ""Deep State Department,"" was among the inciting incidents that have sparked new speculation regarding his relationship with the president.  In that same White House briefing last week and another news conference on Saturday, the two men offered conflicting assessments of possible pharmaceutical treatments for the coronavirus, with Trump striking an optimistic tone and Fauci emphasizing the need for further clinical trials. Then, in an interview with Science magazine published on Sunday, Fauci acknowledged the difficulties of fact-checking the commander in chief in real time, remarking, ""I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down."" On Monday, The New York Times reported that Trump and some White House advisers' patience with Fauci had ""started to wear thin,"" but noted that the president has afforded the doctor ""more leeway to contradict him than he has other officials"" given Fauci's credibility among journalists and the broader public. But when Trump arrived hours later at the White House daily news briefing, Fauci — normally a regular presence at the televised sessions with reporters — was not by the president's side. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence explained that Fauci was instead attending a meeting of the coronavirus task force. To many observers, however, his exclusion from the briefing represented yet another indication of escalating tensions with the White House. At the same time, Trump demonstrated a greater willingness on Monday to break with the advice of public health experts by suggesting he might attempt to restart the American economy after the administration's recommended 15-day period of social distancing. Asked whether Fauci, who has championed preventative measures throughout the federal response, sides with the president, Trump answered, in part: ""He doesn't not agree."" In lieu of a traditional task force briefing on Tuesday, Trump will partake in a virtual coronavirus town hall on Fox News.

"A congressionally mandated commission is recommending women should be eligible for the draft, a move that comes five years after the Pentagon opened all combat roles to women. “This is a necessary and fair step, making it possible to draw on the talent of a unified Nation in a time of national emergency,” the commissioners wrote in the 255-page report, obtained by POLITICO. The 11-member commission’s final report, which was required by the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, was briefed to the Pentagon on Monday and will be presented to the White House and congressional staffers Tuesday. The report does not require action, but its recommendations pave the way for lawmakers to move to include women in the draft more than 100 years after Congress passed the Military Selective Service Act in 1917. While no one has been conscripted into the U.S. military in more than 40 years, the act requires all American men to register for the draft when they turn 18. Men who fail to register can be fined, imprisoned and denied services such as federal student loans. A Pentagon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The recommendation comes five years after then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter formally rescinded the Pentagon’s combat exclusion policy that had prevented women from serving in combat roles. Today, more than 224,000 women serve on active duty, and at least 30 women completed the U.S. Army Ranger School as of August 2019, according to the report. While it's not clear that Congress will immediately take up legislation to allow women to register for the Selective Service, the report gives lawmakers a mandate to do so. In 2017, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) offered an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have required women register for the draft, but the proposal was dropped from the bill. At the time, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), then-chairman of the Armed Services Committee, argued the amendment was getting ahead of the mandated review. A proposal to expand the draft to include women was first introduced in 2016 by then-Rep. Duncan Hunter, a vocal opponent of women serving in combat, in an unusual episode during negotiations over the annual defense policy bill. Hunter offered the amendment as a dare, and voted against his own proposal. Today, the public’s opinion on including women in the draft is mixed, with 53 percent supporting the change and 38 percent opposing in a 2017 survey cited by the commission. The commission heard from many people who “fervently” believed women should not be required to register for the draft. Some expressed concerns that including women would damage their ability to perform their “unique status in society” as wives, mothers and caregivers. Others raised concerns over the possible risks to women posed by combat roles, saying women are more likely to be injured in training. Some asserted that integrating female conscripts would have a significant impact on military readiness “due in large part to natural physical differences between men and women that have practical consequences for the lethality of gender-integrated fighting units,” according to the report. But calls to expand the draft to women have been growing in recent years. In a 2019 case, a federal judge in Texas ruled that an all-male draft was unconstitutional in response to a lawsuit brought forward by the National Coalition for Men. Experts argue that allowing women to participate in the draft will enable the military to access to a wider talent pool, as well as allow women to share in a fundamental civil obligation. “It’s insulting to suggest America’s mothers and wives and daughters couldn’t contribute, whether the need were rebuilding levees after a natural disaster or repelling an invasion from our shores,” Kori Schake, director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, told the commission. “America’s daughters should be slotted into service as their physical and emotional suitability proves capable of, just like America’s sons.”","Women should be eligible for the draft, commission recommends",2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/women-draft-eligibility-146254,politico
"A leading coronavirus vaccine candidate might be made available to some health care workers this fall, the CEO of the company that makes the shot told financiers. The comment by Moderna CEO Stephane Bancels reflects the urgent need to protect front-line workers against the growing pandemic. But numerous vaccine experts have cautioned about the risks of rushing a vaccine to the public. By the fall the FDA would at best have only initial data on the vaccine’s safety and its ability to produce antibodies and shape an immune response. The vaccine by then might have been tested in a few hundred people who probably wouldn’t have been exposed to the disease. An SEC filing published on Monday quoted Bancels as telling Goldman Sachs officers that while the vaccine is unlikely to be commercially available for at least 12 to 18 months, under an emergency FDA authorization it “could be available to some people, possibly including healthcare professionals, in the fall of 2020.” FDA’s decision to provide an emergency use authorization could depend on the severity of the coronavirus outbreak at that time, the proportion of hospitalized or dying patients, and any vaccine safety and efficacy data that's available, Penny Heaton, CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute, told POLITICO. “They would have to move forward very cautiously,” said Heaton. One risk of vaccinating large numbers of people before a vaccine has been tested thoroughly is “immune enhancement,” in which the vaccine combines with viral components to cause an allergic reaction or a more severe infection. Immune enhancement has occurred with past vaccines, including other experimental coronavirus vaccines when tested in animals. However, Moderna officials and the NIH scientists they work with say they are confident their vaccine will not prompt this side effect. Moderna created its gene-based vaccine in the laboratory using synthetic chemistry methods that allow it to move extremely fast. However, its technology has not been tested in any epidemic, and there is currently no licensed coronavirus vaccine in the world. A Chinese company using a different technique has also started testing a vaccine, and a few of some 20-35 other vaccine candidates are close on Moderna's heels in the United States and Europe. At an online meeting hosted by the FDA and the European Medicine Agency last week to discuss joint approaches to coronavirus vaccine, regulators committed to keeping a sharp eye out for immune enhancement, said Peter Marks, FDA’s top regulator for vaccines, in a release. The company and FDA declined to comment further on Bancel’s statement. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is working with Moderna on its vaccine, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Health care workers might get coronavirus shots this fall, vaccine company CEO says",2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/health-care-workers-coronavirus-vaccine-146208,politico
"Congressional negotiators signaled Tuesday morning that they are likely hours away from clinching a bipartisan agreement on a nearly $2 trillion emergency stimulus package to confront the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic — capping five days of frenetic talks that have consumed a mostly empty Capitol. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to announce an agreement later Tuesday, while President Donald Trump pushes for an immediate vote. The sudden shift on Capitol Hill — with both sides declaring they have moved beyond partisan politics — comes after a breakdown in talks in Monday that led to raucous exchanges and bitter sniping on the Senate floor. “Today we can make all of the Washington drama fade away,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday morning, declaring that negotiators were “on the 5-yard line.” Trump was sending mixed signals over whether he would ultimately support the imminent deal, but on Tuesday morning he pushed for an immediate vote. Mnuchin, who has been running point on the negotiations with Schumer, said he was keeping the president in the loop and that negotiators made significant progress on Monday, even as partisan squabbling broke out on the Senate floor. “We're still working and were working when they were on the floor yesterday, beating the living crap out of everybody,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said. “Now we've got a piece of legislation that really protects health care workers."" Schumer and Mnuchin met in person six times on Monday, and their final meeting wrapped up around midnight. The Senate could hold an initial procedural vote as early as Tuesday afternoon if McConnell and Schumer can reach a time agreement. Both sides were huddling with their legislative staff to review final details, and said they expect to unveil a broad deal within several hours with a vote taking place later Tuesday. On his way into McConnell's office for a meeting, Mnuchin said he had spoken with Trump twice so far Tuesday morning, and had been on a conference call to update congressional Republicans. “We're looking forward to closing a bipartisan deal today,” Mnuchin said, flanked by incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. “The president wants us to get this done today.” Asked if they had reached a deal in principle, Mnuchin declined to comment but said: “We’ve met with Mitch McConnell, we’ve met with Chuck Schumer, again we’re working through the smallest of issues and everybody’s turning around language.” Eric Ueland, the White House’s legislative affairs liaison, reiterated Tuesday morning that they do not have a final agreement but are drafting legislative text to present to committee leaders.  “I’m hopeful we can get this right in the next several hours, so that Congress can be in a position to be able to act today,"" Ueland said, though he noted: ""Everybody seemed to expect a vote in the past few days up here on the Hill."" Stocks soared as trading opened Tuesday morning, with the Dow Jones Industrial average spiking more than 1,000 points, as investors eye an imminent deal. On the other side of the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was also projecting confidence that a deal could be clinched on Tuesday. “I think there is real optimism that we could get something done in the next few hours,” she said during an interview on CNBC, saying Senate Democrats did a “great job” in the negotiations. Still, Trump took to Twitter late Monday night to harangue Democrats over their demands. “Republicans had a deal until Nancy Pelosi rode into town from her extended vacation. The Democrats want the Virus to win? They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies,” Trump tweeted. “They want Open Borders & Green New Deal. Republicans shouldn’t agree!” And early Tuesday morning, the president again chastised Democrats — but later appeared supportive of the deal, urging the Senate to act immediately. “Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!” Trump wrote. Mnuchin insisted that Trump was looped into the discussions, and said Trump’s initial tweets slamming Democrats were only related to House Democrats’ separate bill, which includes several provisions that Republicans were objecting to. Schumer was seeking added protections for workers in the final version of the bill, in addition to a so-called “Marshall Plan” for U.S. hospitals, which could soon be overrun with coronavirus patients. The New York Democrat also extracted a key concession from Mnuchin: strict oversight over a $500 billion fund designed to lend money to corporations that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, according to three sources. Democrats had criticized the initial proposal as a “slush fund” that provided no mechanisms for accountability and allowed the Trump administration to withhold details about which companies received such loans. During her CNBC interview, Pelosi said the fund would be overseen by an inspector general and a congressional panel. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Rules Committee, is recommending that the House pass the Senate’s emergency package by unanimous consent or a voice vote, which would allow lawmakers to remain in their home districts. Notably, Pelosi said Tuesday that she is aiming to pass the Senate bill by unanimous consent. House Democrats will convene on a conference call on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the path forward. McConnell had been pushing hard for a vote by Monday, but Senate Democrats over a two-day period defeated two procedural motions on the bill, citing ongoing negotiations between Schumer and Mnuchin. Republicans bitterly attacked their Democratic counterparts on the Senate floor Monday, accusing them of playing political games while the economy and global financial markets remain in a free-fall. The coronavirus has already hit the Senate, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announcing on Sunday that he tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, several other senators decided to self-quarantine due to their close interactions with Paul and other individuals who tested positive. Paul’s diagnosis — in addition to Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s (D-Minn.) announcement Monday that her husband contracted the virus — underscored the urgency for Congress to approve a rescue package, with several senators expressing wariness over the fact that the chamber was still convening daily despite federal recommendations against large gatherings.

Nearly 1,400 Hasting scientists have signed a letter demanding that Trump use the DPA and other federal powers to secure supplies and cover Covid-19 treatments. “It should be a war mentality, and the government should be the leader,” Solomon told POLITICO.

Some American manufacturers have privately expressed concerns that it’s more difficult to ramp up production of medical equipment without clear guidance from the federal government outlining what materials are needed — and where. But other manufacturers are moving forward with plans to begin churning out medical equipment even without federal orders. Bill Ford, the head of Ford Motor Company, said Tuesday his company is “going as fast as we can” to make medical supplies through four projects: working with GE to make ventilators; working with 3M to make air purifying respirators; and working in-house to 3-D print face shields and N95 masks. “We’re doing it on our own,” Ford told NBC News’ ""Today."" “Obviously the White House has put a call out for companies to help, but frankly we were doing this, getting all this in motion before that.” Though the president had delayed invoking the DPA, HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in late February that his department could use the measure to procure a range of necessary personal protective equipment. “We’ve spoken of procuring at least 300 million N95 masks,” he told reporters on Feb. 28. “We need additional gowns — the Tyvek gowns, as well as gloves,” he added.

FDA and HHS referred questions about the process to FEMA. The coronavirus crisis isn’t the first time the White House has struggled with the DPA. In 2018, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, backed by the coal industry, presented a plan to Trump that would have used the DPA and other emergency laws to force utilities to buy coal from struggling U.S. miners. But the plan ran aground at the White House due to opposition from members of the National Security Council and National Economic Council, who questioned the move’s legality and impacts on electricity bills.

Fauci went on to criticize members of the media who he accused of seeking to drive a wedge between himself and the president by posing probing questions intended to expose their diverging views on matters of public health. He asserted that ”fundamentally, at the core,” no such discrepancies exist, and called those lines of inquiry ”really unfortunate.” ”The idea of just pitting one against the other is just not helpful,” Fauci said. ”I wish that would stop and we’d look ahead at the challenge we have to pull together to get over this thing.” As concerns continue to mount over the president’s opinion of Fauci and other government health officials, the White House opted to forgo its traditional task force briefing on Tuesday, and Trump will instead partake in a virtual coronavirus town hall on Fox News.

"Wall Street is facing a grim question as stock prices plunge on most days with no end in sight: Is it time to shut down the market for a while? The debate over whether to pause market trading has intensified over the past two weeks, as much of the economy has ground to a halt to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Uncertainty about the depth of the sudden economic slump and the government's response have caused the value of stocks and other financial instruments to gyrate wildly. Stock plunges this month have triggered four mandatory breaks amid a punishing series of trading runs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed another 3 percent on Monday and has fallen more than 30 percent over the past month as the crisis unfolded, with companies losing billions of dollars in market value. Even lawmakers have started suggesting it's time for Wall Street to press pause to help calm the waters. ""Maybe close a day or two,"" Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said on MSNBC on Thursday, raising concerns about so-called short-sellers — those who bet on stocks to fall — taking advantage of the declining market. ""It's not an industry that we have to have."" The Trump administration and regulators have tried to tamp down speculation that trading should be shut down temporarily until the implications of the crisis become clearer, arguing that the markets are functioning as they should amid the regular trading halts, known as ""circuit breakers,"" sparked by dramatic drops in stock prices. ""We don't want to be doing that,"" President Donald Trump said Monday at a White House news briefing, dismissing the need to shut down the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. But every passing day has made the prospect of a halt in trading seem more urgent. If keeping markets open is ""a sign of confidence for people,"" as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week, the deep plunges in stock prices have to undermine that confidence. Tech entrepreneur and former PayPal executive Max Levchin has argued that it might be time to close the markets for a week or two. ""Get everyone’s minds to focus on social distancing, expanding testing capacity, vaccine finding ... instead of worrying about the utter collapse of their 401(k),"" he said on Twitter. Mnuchin conceded that while he wanted the markets to stay open, at least the possibility loomed that trading hours might need to be shortened. That brought a sharp rebuke from New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunningham, who said in a television interview that reducing or closing trading was not under consideration — a sentiment she made clear to multiple administration officials, including Mnuchin. Yet with cases of the virus spreading, the NYSE this week is operating without its signature trading floor and moved to fully electronic trading. ""We look forward to the day when we reopen the Floor and welcome back to 11 Wall Street all of the trading floor community, who are so important to the markets we operate,"" Cunningham said Monday. ""Until then, our bell continues to ring and our markets remain open for business."" The possibility of a market closure underscores the grave outlook for the global economy and the almost complete lack of knowledge of how bad things can get. The markets have shut down before, including during moments of national crisis. Stock trading shut down for several days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. ""We had a brief closure after 9/11, but that was because people could not physically get to the trading floors and the [NYSE] was near ground zero,"" former SEC Commissioner Annette Nazareth said. ""Now, virtually all the markets are electronic."" But even though much of the market can function without traders on a physical trading floor or even in the office, the prospect of the job being done remotely has also raised concerns. ""It's a fair point to say, do we really want people going into all these offices and trying to trade, or alternatively, do we want people making million- and billion-dollar decisions while they're distracted with whatever news is going on, or their kid hopping on their lap?"" said Tyler Gellasch, executive director of Healthy Markets and a former SEC official. Still, in television interviews and media briefings in recent days, Mnuchin has been pressed repeatedly about whether it's time to halt trading. Last week, he said ""everybody wants to keep it open"" after talking to banks and the NYSE, which has warned it could compound market anxiety. ""Americans should know that we are going to do everything to make sure that they have access to their money at their banks, to the money in their 401(k)s and to the money in stocks,"" he said. Onetime SEC officials are skeptical the shutdown will happen. Former SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar said he couldn't foresee anything closing trading absent a problem with market infrastructure. The stock market closing would limit people's ability to sell securities and get cash, he said. ""And then it has broad implications,"" said Piwowar, now executive director at the Milken Institute's Center for Financial Markets. ""The financial markets are very much linked. ... There are many trading strategies that involve trading in one market and hedging in another one.” Gellasch said closing the market wouldn't stop the securities from changing in value — large financial firms can keep assessing that and trading financial instruments among themselves — but it will prevent millions of Americans from accessing their assets when they may need them most. ""The health crisis is what's collapsing restaurants, hotels, and airlines today and will be driving the likely business loans and mortgage crisis in the months and years to come,"" Gellasch said. ""This crisis isn't about the stock market going wild. It's about the economy shutting down. And shutting down the stock market isn't going to fix it.""",The unthinkable: Is it time to shut down the stock market?,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/time-shut-down-stock-market-145573,politico
"My town, Seattle, has fancied itself the city of the future since 1962, when it erected a flying saucer on stilts called the Space Needle and staged the Century 21 Exposition. The rise of several eras’ defining technology companies—Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon—cemented the notion. Now that aspiration has come true in a way none of those jet-age dreamers could have imagined or wanted: Seattle became the point of the pandemic spear, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus pandemic in America. Washington state, with less than a fifth California’s population, has had more confirmed coronavirus cases (2,221 as of Monday, 1,170 of them in Seattle and surrounding King County) and more than three times as many deaths (110; 87 of them in and around Seattle).  Last week, the tally of confirmed cases in New York, with its far larger and denser population, vastly overtook Seattle’s total. But most other American cities are still days or weeks away from where we are on the curve. Our experience here, as the U.S. metropolis that has been weathering COVID-19 longest, can still tell people and policymakers elsewhere something about what to expect and how to deal with it. It won’t be pretty, even after you get used to empty store shelves and restaurants, gyms and other public establishments being closed. Be prepared for field hospitals, triage plans and campaigns to fabricate hospital protective gear from hardware store materials. But resilient souls may also find solace and renewal in the quiet and solitude of a lockdown, a reconnection with nature and loved ones.  *** If anyone should have been prepared for such a catastrophe, Seattleites should have. For decades, we’ve been told we should stash away emergency supplies of food, water and other essentials against the megaquake that, if it arrives on the schedule of the last 40 major Cascadia earthquakes, could strike anytime now. But still, we were caught short and packed into the supermarkets and big boxes at unhealthy proximity, cleaning the shelves of spaghetti, canned tuna, sanitizers and toilet paper. The crowds grew so thick that Seattle’s Costco store laid out shipping crate queues and began metering entry.  And if any place had the expertise and experience needed to prepare for a pandemic, it should have been Seattle, home to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a leading public health investor and innovator; the University of Washington’s cutting-edge schools of medicine and public health; and a slew of other biomedical research centers. These institutions swung into action, some as early as December, when the epidemic loomed. One UW team developed and distributed an early test for the virus; last week Kaiser Permanente’s Seattle research center launched the first human trials of a prospective vaccine. But the UW researchers found themselves stymied by red tape, cross-purposes confusion and sclerotic supply channels at the federal level; unable to get speedy federal approval for their test, they seized on a regulatory loophole to deploy it.   Even here, for all the depth of local medical infrastructure, stocks of the most basic protective gear—gloves, gowns, eye covering and especially masks—were quickly depleted. “We have health care workers wearing bandannas at this point,” Dr. Scott Lindquist, Washington state’s chief epidemiologist, told The Seattle Times last week. “Our warehouse is empty. Literally, we don’t have any [equipment] to be given out.” Unable to obtain face shields, experts at the Seattle-area headquarters of Providence Health’s six-state hospital network created a prototype out of hardware and craft-store materials, then assembled 20 administrative staffers to build 500 copies.  Governor Jay Inslee announced Friday that more supplies, including 1.6 million of the coveted N95 masks, were expected soon from federal stockpiles—but, as state and medical officials nationwide have discovered, counting on federal help can be an exercise in disappointment. On March 17, in an effort to bolster Washington’s access to aid and its flexibility to respond to COVID-19, Inslee asked President Donald Trump to declare a “major disaster” in Washington. Over the weekend, Trump said he would—but that he would send the Navy hospital ship Mercy, which Inslee also requested, to Los Angeles instead. Here, as elsewhere, everyone from private practitioners to hospitals and first-response agencies has struggled to get test kits and trembled at the prospective consequences of not being able to test quickly and widely. About two weeks ago, Jeffrey O’Connor, a family practitioner in Spokane, received eight test kits. “We used them right away, doing all our testing in people’s cars. One came back positive.” No more kits arrived—nor masks or other safety gear. O’Connor wound up buying a construction face shield at a hardware store. Fortunately, Spokane, like Seattle, set up a drive-through test site, where he now sends patients, and which has identified more cases. He’s hopeful that it will keep up with the need. “It’s not real bad in Spokane yet,” O’Connor says wistfully—a sentiment shared by many on the outbreak's fringes. “Only about 20 cases. But a month from now, it’s going to be like Seattle. We’re just waiting for the epidemic to come here.” Meanwhile, the state’s medical services are making accommodations that would have seemed unthinkable a few months ago. On March 17, Inslee ordered a stop to all elective surgeries and other nonurgent medical procedures. Medical providers were already drastically altering and redirecting their operations, in ways that may endure after the pandemic passes. “We’ve moved almost exclusively to telehealth—doing pretty much everything online,” says one Seattle primary-care physician, speaking anonymously because he did not have authorization from the network he belongs to. “That’s actually worked out pretty well. … There are people who need to be seen … but an awful lot of stuff can be handled by video chat.”  But local officials and providers face bigger, grimmer questions about health care delivery. They’ve begun planning how to apportion critical care if, or when, COVID-19 overwhelms their resources: Who gets a precious ventilator, and who, unlikely to survive anyway, gets morphine? Such triage was the stuff of battlefields until the novel coronavirus struck Wuhan and Milan. Likewise tent hospitals. Or, as one ball-dribbling neighbor told KUOW-FM radio while a big white tent rose on a soccer field just north of Seattle, “Honestly, the first thing we thought was ‘Zombie apocalypse movie.’ That’s the only time you see a field hospital.” Seattle’s King County is erecting just such a hospital to provide 200 of the 3,000 additional hospital beds it expects to need. It’s also bought a motel (with suitable ventilation to prevent recirculating viruses) for emergency housing for homeless patients, and is shopping for more. *** For all the medical challenges, Seattle would seem better positioned than many locales to weather the pandemic's economic effects. Its huge technology sector is relatively resilient against local shocks and amenable to working from home. Its largest employer, Amazon, is scrambling to meet demand and trying to hire 100,000 more warehouse workers as even more shopping shifts online. Amazon’s shares rose 11 percent last week and 3 percent on Monday, even as the wider market tanked. The state’s $20 billion agriculture and food processing industry is also cushioned against market shocks; people have to eat. Nevertheless, unemployment has surged faster here than in the rest of the country. In the last week that’s been reported, ending March 14, unemployment claims rose by a third nationwide. In the same period they more than doubled in Washington state and more than tripled in Seattle. Local employers’ use of SharedWork, a state program that helps them reduce workers’ hours without cutting pay or laying them off, grew by 500 percent. The state Employment Security Department received about 560,000 phone calls last Monday and Tuesday, 18 times the usual volume; its website had more than eight times normal traffic. States following in Washington’s wake have many more job losses to look forward to. But, for all those downsides, and for all the supermarket jostling and hoarding, the coronavirus crisis has sparked a surge in community spirit and volunteerism around here.  Providence also declared a “100 Million Mask Challenge,” offering kits containing enough medical-grade materials to make 100 masks (which are not the same as face shields) to volunteers who would sew them up. Following what it calls an “overwhelming response,” Providence announced first that all its kits had gone out, then that it wouldn’t need more because “local manufacturing companies have stepped up to rapidly produce masks and face shields for us on a large scale.” Do-it-yourself couriers deliver groceries and pharmaceuticals to quarantined residents. Earlier this month, the local blood bank put out a desperate call for donations; with schools and offices closed and blood drives nixed, supplies were dangerously low. A few days later it told would-be donors “thanks anyway”; a flood of donations had topped the bank back up—a bracing contrast to the 1980s AIDS crisis, when fearful donors stayed away. Two weeks ago, the Southeast Seattle Tool Library, a volunteer-run tool-lending service based in a public housing development in Seattle’s most racially and economically diverse district, closed to avoid becoming an infection vector. “Volunteers and members”—the residents who depend on the library— “both urged us to stay open,” says its director, Susan Keiff. Its board reconsidered and devised a safe, no-contact tool-dispensing protocol. On Wednesday, the tool library will reopen, so Seattleites can still put their forced confinement to use fixing up their houses. The “we’re all in this together” crisis spirit shows in broader, less tangible ways as well. Newcomers to town routinely complain about “the Seattle chill”—locals’ notorious reserve and aloofness, their way of looking past rather than at strangers. Now, a switch seems to have flipped. “People are smiling!” says one longtime resident who grew up in an African culture that was anything but chilly. Deprived of so many other forms of social contact, we now smile and say hello to each stranger we pass, as though each might be the last person we see. Whatever private sorrows and anxieties people bear, the public mood of the city has changed for the mellower. Reported crime dropped by 15 percent in the first week of March and 30 percent in the second week, largely because of declining property crime. That echoes the first time Seattle went into lockdown, a general strike in 1919, when police reports fell by half.  Until recently, Seattleites griped endlessly about life’s hectic pace and surging costs, the dizzily changing cityscape and above all the traffic—the downsides of a boomtown. Goodbye, boom. Goodbye, traffic. “I’m marveling at my reunion with a place I deeply miss,” says poet/painter Rajaa Gharbi, another longtime resident, “a quieter, more humble city, a Seattle that seemed to be ruled and governed by the flower pallets of its front yards, when steel highrises looked like second thoughts.” Seattleites seem to have internalized the shelter-in-place message that is just starting to get through in some less-affected areas. We shudder at pictures of spring-break crowds frolicking blithely on Florida beaches. “As of last Friday, people were still packing the beaches at Kailua and Asian tourists were very much in evidence,” reports Seattle author Michael Gruber, recently returned from Hawaii. “Cases on Oahu are doubling every two days now, but not to worry! I flew back to Seattle and when I went out for milk the next morning, [the local food co-op] made us put on rubber gloves to tickle the tomatoes.” Exceptions still happen. On Friday, I saw two street-repair workers huddling closely enough over a survey tripod to tap hardhats. But images of hyper-vigilance are more common. At a city park, eight friends sat in a circle on the grass, carefully maintaining six-foot separation. Masks and respirators are increasingly visible—usually on younger people, even though they are least endangered by the virus. “I am embarrassed to be loving it,” says single mother Alyse Schregoncost of her homestay, playing dress-up and taking long walks in the park with her two young daughters. “But feeling guilty about it—I have a flexible job that is almost certain to be there when I get back.” With virtually all the other places people go to meet up and get out of the house closed, parks have become the new bars, gyms, coffee shops, museums, dance clubs and movie houses. One, Green Lake Park, a 2.8-mile loop around the namesake lake, has gotten too crowded on sunny afternoons for the prescribed six-foot social distancing, prompting fears it may be closed. On Friday, Seattle and King County closed all playgrounds, picnic shelters, ballfields and “other areas where essential social distancing guidelines are difficult to achieve.” They banned park gatherings, team sports, even pickup games. The Washington Trails Association, which usually advocates for more hiking, now urges against through-hiking the popular Pacific Crest Trail, which runs along the state’s mountain spine. It fears hikers will cluster at hostels and campgrounds and spread the virus to the remote communities where they re-provision. Washington state has likewise closed its park campgrounds and picnic areas. That stops short of the complete state-parks closure Oregon instituted on Monday after users continued swarming popular sites. But such total closures threaten an unwanted consequence: Barred from meeting and relaxing outdoors, people may gather covertly, and more dangerously, indoors. “Our parks and open spaces can provide an important break in these stressful times,” King County Executive Dow Constantine said, explaining his decision to keep them open. Fortunately, the city and the mountains and forests around it have enough parks and trails to accommodate the many thousands seeking refuge and release. Even as he labors to reduce the pandemic’s human and economic tolls, Seattle Port Commissioner Fred Felleman sees several environmental upsides to these COVID-19-forced changes in habits and venues, starting with a marked drop in greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. “People are learning how to attend meetings remotely,” he notes, with all the attendant cost savings and impact reductions, and this shift “is likely to persist post-pandemic.” And they are “getting to spend more time in nature rather than in stores, bars and restaurants. While I’m very sympathetic that this has been devastating to our service economy, it could better connect people to the planet and instill a sense of why it’s important to protect it.” In the meantime, however, he has some less lofty advice for other policymakers facing the pandemic: “If you’re going to make a mistake, overreact. To be accused of under-reacting and putting people in danger is much worse.”",Letter From Your City’s Future,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/24/coronavirus-seattle-dispatch-future-144876,politico
"The U.S. Postal Service could be gone by June unless Congress immediately delivers billions of dollars to counteract the impact of the coronavirus crisis, a House committee chairwoman warned Monday night. ""Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,"" Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. Maloney, who was joined in the statement by Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), indicated the Postal service has seen a ""drastic"" reduction in mail volume and could shutter by the summer without intervention, a collapse that could, among other things, jeopardize access to mail-order prescription drugs for millions of Americans, especially in rural communities. A Postal Service shutdown would also affect the ability of voters to cast ballots by mail. Maloney and Connolly noted the House's $2.5 trillion coronavirus relief package would send $25 billion to the Postal Service in emergency funding and eliminate the Postal Service's $11 billion debt. The measure would reset the Postal Service's borrowing limit to $15 billion and eliminate an annual $3 billion borrowing cap. The measure would also require the agency to prioritize medical deliveries.  The House bill would also allow the Postal Service to create ""temporary delivery points"" and establish flexible staffing procedures if the novel coronavirus affects its operations.  The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 turned the Postal Service into an independent agency within the U.S. government that was primarily responsible for funding itself, something that has become harder since the internet era led to a dramatic drop in the volume of mail. Beyond that, the Postal Service has been required since 2006 to pay at least $5.5 billion annually to pre-fund retiree benefits.

"Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) is being sued after selling shares in a hotel company while possessing confidential information about the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Alan Jacobson, a shareholder in Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, sued Burr in federal court on Monday, alleging that the senator used private information to motivate a mass liquidation of his assets. It is illegal for senators to use nonpublic information in conducting securities exchanges. Burr came under fire after OpenSecrets and ProPublica reported last week that he had sold between $628,000 and $1.72 million worth of his stock holdings in mid-February — while he was still publicly reassuring the country that the United States was amply prepared for the growing coronavirus outbreak. Among the shares he sold were an up to $150,000 stake in Wyndham, whose stock suffered a market-value cut of more than two-thirds since mid-February. Burr was also in the hot seat after NPR reported that he had warned wealthy members of an exclusive social club about the major disruptions to the nation’s economic and daily life that would come from the growing outbreak. As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Burr is privy to much of the nation’s classified information on threats to national security. The coronavirus pandemic has devastated the travel industry, from cruises to airlines to hotels. Wyndham was no exception — the company’s stock sold at $59.96 on Feb. 19 but has dropped precipitously, to $25.03 on Monday. “Senator Burr owed a duty to Congress, the United States government, and citizens of the United States, including Plaintiff, not to use material nonpublic information that he learned by virtue of his duties as a United States Senator in connection with the sale or purchase of any security,” said Jacobson’s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. “Had Plaintiff and the market known of the material nonpublic information in Senator Burr’s possession regarding COVID-19, and on which Senator Burr traded, Wyndham’s stock price on February 13, 2020 would have been substantially lower,” the suit continued. “Senator Burr and his wife sold up to $150,000 of Wyndham stock on that date, and therefore he and his wife pocketed up to $150,000 in illegal insider trading proceeds at Plaintiff’s expense.” Jacobson argued he had suffered harm because he kept his shares while they were trading at artificially inflated prices due to the lack of public knowledge on the coming economic devastation from coronavirus. Burr asked the Senate Ethics Committee on Friday to review his stock sales and maintained that he “relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks.” He denied using information that was not public regarding the coronavirus outbreak. Burr is planning to retire at the end of 2022 His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday night about the lawsuit.",Shareholder suit accuses Sen.

"Democrats are following through on their threat to go rogue with their own stimulus plan, unveiling a more than 1,400-page bill Monday night, packed with policy differences compared to the proposal Senate Republicans laid out. After the GOP’s latest measure tanked twice during test votes in the Senate, House Democrats wrote a competing proposal to save the country from economic destruction at the hands of the coronavirus. The House measure would boost emergency funds for agencies, mandate ""green"" rules for airlines, eliminate a payroll tax suspension, kick in additional help for hospitals, schools and food banks, and more. Here's what House Democrats have included in their bill and how it contrasts with the latest proposal from Senate Republicans: Democrats want to further plump the direct payments that would go out to Americans under the bill, proposing $1,500 per person, instead of the $1,200 on the table under the Senate measure laid out Sunday. Unlike the latest plan from Senate Republicans, however, higher earners would have to pay back part or all of the assistance over three years if their taxable income is $75,000 or more for a single filer or $150,000 or more for couples filing jointly. The money would be available to anyone with a tax ID number, and to retirees and people who are unemployed, rather than just to people who file taxes for 2019 or get Social Security. Health care providers and community health centers would receive about $150 billion, while hospitals would get an additional $80 billion in low-interest loans. The proposal is more in line with industry requests, compared to the $75 billion Senate Republicans have offered. The House bill would also waive treatment costs, abandon certain barriers to accessing medicines and provide safety protections for health workers. The unemployed would get an extra $600 per week on top of state or federal benefits in order to replace 100 percent of lost wages. The measure would also extend paid sick leave benefits to cover individuals, such as health care workers and first responders, who were cut out of Congress’ second coronavirus response. House Democrats want to go much bigger in sending emergency money to federal agencies, proposing hundreds of billions more than the $242 billion Senate Republicans have pitched, according to a Democratic aide. The White House, meanwhile, has made a narrowly tailored request for $46 billion. If airlines are going to get billions of dollars in loans under the bill, Democrats say they need to cut their carbon emissions in half by 2050. The House’s measure would also kick in $1 billion to help develop sustainable fuels for planes and create a program for the government to buy less-efficient aircraft, à la “cash-for-clunkers.” The two stimulus drafts emerging from both chambers present markedly different stimulus tax plans, with House Democrats omitting the payroll tax suspension included in the Senate GOP bill. The Democratic plan would also expand health insurance premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act and beef up the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit and the Dependent Care Credit. Taxpayers could make early withdrawals from their retirement funds without having to pay the usual 10 percent penalty during the coronavirus crisis, and required minimum withdrawals would be suspended for 2020. Health insurance premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act would be expanded. Warning that fallout from the coronavirus could destroy the U.S. Postal Service by June, House Democrats have included $25 billion in emergency funding to keep mail service going, plus language that would wipe out the federal carrier’s current $11 billion debt. The bill would also force the mail service to prioritize medical deliveries. The House bill goes much further than the Senate measure when it comes to limiting executive pay and stock buybacks, as well as imposing lobbying restrictions. For example, the House package would bar such corporations from lobbying the federal government — a move sure to arouse anger on K Street among Democratic and Republican lobbyists alike. Companies would get credits against payroll taxes for giving employees any kind of sick or family medical leave, not just for coronavirus-related reasons. Businesses would get to deduct losses from this year, last year and 2018 from their taxes for any of the last five years. The Senate bill includes a similar “carry back” provision. The House did not include provisions allowing faster write-offs for restaurant and retail business investments or bigger deductions for business interest, both of which are in the Senate bill. Airlines would receive about $40 billion in grants through the House package, as well as up to $21 billion for unsecured loans and loan guarantees for a total of $61 billion in aid. Senate Republicans have proposed $58 billion in loans and guarantees, plus a holiday from paying fuel tax. House Democrats would give the Defense Department an $8 billion emergency boost, including $500 million for purchases made under the Defense Production Act. The Senate GOP bill would provide the Pentagon with a $10 billion hike. Democrats are pitching $500 billion in grants and interest-free loans to small businesses, including $300 billion in forgivable loans to cover short-term payroll costs. That compares to $300 billion in loans for small businesses in the Senate bill. While hundreds of internet providers have already promised they will not cut off service to households and small businesses while the coronavirus rages, the bill would ensure it’s illegal to do so. Consumer debt payments would be suspended and the Federal Reserve would have to establish a program to reimburse creditors for lost revenue. The central bank would also have to support state and local bond markets, in addition to providing direct loans to small businesses. The bill includes an extra $450 million boost to food banks, as well as whatever funds are “necessary” to account for more people in need of food stamps. Senate Republicans had proposed about $15.6 billion in food stamp assistance. Hospitals would qualify for tax credits for charity care they provide and for creating or expanding facilities to handle the coronavirus patient load. Governmental employers, including public universities, would get tax credits for mandated worker leave due to the coronavirus. The FTC and top lawyers at the state level would get more power to go after people and companies that price-gouge during the pandemic. Besides spending $1.5 billion to help low-income households pay water bills, the House legislation would ban utility providers from cutting off service during the crisis. Democrats are calling for $60 billion in emergency assistance to go out for education initiatives, about three times the amount the Senate bill contains. That total includes $30 billion to help K-12 schools, as well as $10 billion for colleges and universities. By doing away with a mandate that the FCC sell off the T-band, the plan Democrats are pushing would make winners out of first responders in the ongoing fight over auctioning the spectrum they use for emergency communications.

"Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Tuesday made light of President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, using the occasion to recall one of Trump's previous clashes with scientific recommendations. ”Please do not take medical advice from a man who looked directly at a solar eclipse,” Clinton wrote on Twitter, a reference to an August 2017 eclipse during which Trump briefly looked at the sun without protective eye gear.  Though experts warn looking directly into the sun during an eclipse without eye protection can lead to vision damage, and the president eventually put on a pair of special glasses to watch the eclipse’s peak, he appeared to first glance up at the sun without them as cameras rolled and an aide shouted “Don’t look!”  Clinton has repeatedly taken potshots at her former 2016 rival in interviews and tweets -- criticizing his policies toward Russia and weighing in at fraught political moments, like last year's impeachment hearings. Her latest swipe comes as Trump has begun to chafe at the advice of public health experts, who warn that relaxing social distancing strictures prematurely could have catastrophic consequences. During White House press briefings on the administration's response to the outbreak, which has infected more than 43,000 individuals and killed more than 500 in the U.S. alone, Trump has routinely been corrected by his health officials on everything from the timeline for a coronavirus vaccine to the efficacy of drugs to treat the illness.  In recent days, Trump has taken to mentioning specific medicines as potential cures for the virus, including the anti-malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Research on the combination is still in the early stages, though a drug trial is set to start soon in New York. Clinton also weighed in Tuesday on Trump's remarks about how he was weighing the damage to the economy wrought by efforts to fight the virus against the advice of epidemiologists. “It's incredible that this has to be said: Letting thousands of people needlessly suffer and die is wrong,” Clinton wrote. “It's also not a recipe for rescuing the economy.""",Hillary Clinton mocks Trump's science cred,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/hillary-clinton-mocks-donald-trump-coronavirus-146368,politico
"A federal judge has resoundingly rejected a bid by President Donald Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen to be released early from his three-year prison sentence. Cohen has been seeking a sentence reduction since last year, arguing that prosecutors were refusing to accept his cooperation because doing so would implicate Trump in crimes. The former Trump personal lawyer and fixer also made a series of entreaties to Congress to try to bolster his credibility as a whistleblower and lighten his sentence, most famously at a widely-viewed House hearing in February 2019. More recently, Cohen’s attorney argued that his client was at risk because of the coronavirus outbreak. However, U.S. District Court Judge William Pauley on Tuesday turned down the request and gave Cohen a tongue-lashing for refusing to come to terms with the gravity of the tax fraud, campaign finance and false statement charges Cohen pleaded guilty to about a year-and-a-half ago.  “Ten months into his prison term, it’s time that Cohen accept the consequences of his criminal convictions for serious crimes that had far reaching institutional harms,” Pauley wrote in a two-page order. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to separate cases brought by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan and special counsel Robert Mueller's team.  One of the cases included run-of-the-mill tax evasion charges as well as more spectacular allegations that Cohen orchestrated illegal campaign contributions in 2016 by arranging payments of hush money to two women to suppress stories about alleged sexual affairs with Trump. The president has denied the affairs. In the other case, Cohen admitted to making false statements to Congress in a bid to minimize Trump’s ongoing involvement in pursuing a real estate development project in Russia at the height of the 2016 campaign. Trump dismissed Cohen’s admissions as lies designed to win favorable treatment from prosecutors. “He's lying, very simply, to get a reduced sentence,” Trump said in November 2018. In the new ruling, Pauley said only prosecutors can make a motion to shorten a sentence under the provision Cohen cited. The judge, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, also scoffed at Cohen’s suggestion that he’d been useful to investigators. “Cohen made material and false statements in his post-sentencing proffer sessions,” wrote Pauley. “Unable to articulate how he advanced any investigation or prosecution, Cohen and his surrogates make extravagant allegations that the Department of Justice — from the Attorney General down to line prosecutors — acted in bad faith. Those ad hominem attacks lack any substance and do not trigger the right to a remedy or a hearing before this Court.” Pauley also dismissed Cohen’s claim of virus-related danger as yet another effort to worm his way into the headlines. “That Cohen would seek to single himself out for release to home confinement appears to be just another effort to inject himself into the news cycle,” the judge wrote.

"One of the Democratic Party's main 2020 super PACs is attacking President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus outbreak with new TV ads airing in four key swing states. The new ad from Priorities USA Action, which plans to spend $6 million on TV and digital ads condemning Trump’s response to Covid-19, began running in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida on Tuesday and features Trump quotes juxtaposed against a graph showing the number of positive coronavirus tests in America. At the end of the ad, footage plays of Trump saying, during a Rose Garden press conference at the White House, “I don’t take responsibility at all."" The ad marks a new front in the political battle over government response to the coronavirus. There has been relatively little TV advertising on the pandemic so far, with some scattered ads showing up in the Kentucky Senate race and the West Virginia governor's race so far. In a statement, Priorities USA chairman Guy Cecil said Trump had ""repeatedly misled the American people and exposed us to unnecessary danger."" The series of ads targeting Trump’s handling of the coronavirus are part of a $150 million commitment from Priorities USA to run ads slamming Trump on health care in Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona ahead of the Democratic National Convention in July. The PAC's coronavirus ad campaign comes amid a lull among the Democratic candidates on the airwaves. As several states’ primaries remain in flux, neither Bernie Sanders nor Joe Biden has purchased TV or radio airtime since the March 17 elections in Florida and Arizona.  Priorities USA is also out with a second TV ad highlighting Biden’s experience in the executive branch along with two other digital ads with similar themes are also out on the airwaves in battleground states.",Priorities USA begins $6 million blitz of anti-Trump coronavirus ads,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/democratic-super-pac-anti-trump-coronavirus-ads-146267,politico

"OTTAWA — Justin Trudeau’s emergency economic decisions are taking shape in a virtual war room in which the prime minister is plotting Canada’s coronavirus response by teleconference. Trudeau started working remotely after his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, tested positive for Covid-19 on March 12. From self-isolation at his home, Trudeau has been holding phone calls with advisers, including officials from his own team and the Privy Council Office, “pretty much all day every day,” a government official tells POLITICO. Finance Minister Bill Morneau has been a regular on the calls advising Trudeau, with the finance minister bringing forward recommendations based on information that has come up through the public service, the insider said. Teleconferencing itself has been an adjustment. The official said, for instance, the more-technical exchanges ahead of last week's aid announcement had to be done by phone without the visual aid of charts and graphs. The behind the scenes details provide offer a glimpse at the conditions in which Trudeau’s decisions have been made — as well as a peek at the process informing his economic calls. The prime minister has been working from his home office in the physical presence of only his three young children — no staffers and no ministers have been in the house. An inside look at the work also reveals some of the people advising the prime minister as he tries to address the rapid advance of an economic crisis. For example, the official said many of Morneau’s recommendations to Trudeau have come via input from the Finance Department’s deputy minister, Paul Rochon, and its associate deputy minister, Ava Yaskiel. The official said ideas and analysis from different departments across the government are flowing into the Finance Department on Morneau’s request. They are then turned into policy options ready for possible implementation. The official said the key people with input into the recommendations have included such officials as Rochon and Yaskiel, deputy ministers from other departments, key policy experts and Privy Council Clerk Ian Shugart. Other officials said to be driving their departments' answers to questions from Morneau and Trudeau have included deputy health minister Stephen Lucas, deputy employment minister Graham Flack and Canada Revenue Agency commissioner Bob Hamilton. Economic decisions, the official said, are also brought before Trudeau’s cabinet and the ministers on his government’s Covid-19 cabinet committee, which is chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. For instance, the official said in the lead-up to Trudeau’s multibillion-dollar economic announcement last week the prime minister held multiple phone discussions with some of these officials — including Shugart and Rochon — in the virtual war room. The aid package featured C$27 billion in support for workers and businesses and another C$55 billion in tax deferrals to help keep money moving in the economy for a few extra months. There are parliamentary checks on some of Trudeau’s emergency economic measures, which must be passed by MPs before implementation. The House of Commons reconvened Tuesday with a couple of dozen MPs representing all parties to vote on parts of the aid package. Out of the virtual war room meetings, the Trudeau government appeared poised to propose new legislation on Tuesday to give Morneau more powers over taxation and spending for an extended period without the need for parliamentary approval. But a draft of the bill that circulated Monday evening caused an uproar and forced the Liberals to back away from the plan. Trudeau, as it happens, wasn't present Tuesday in the House. His 14-day period of self-isolation is only due to lift closer to the end of week.",Inside Trudeau's virtual war room: Where Canada's economic response is decided by teleconference,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/justin-trudeau-coronavirus-teleconference-146174,politico
"Congressional negotiators signaled Tuesday morning that they are likely hours away from clinching a bipartisan agreement on a nearly $2 trillion emergency stimulus package — capping five days of frenetic talks over a response to the coronavirus pandemic. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to announce an agreement later Tuesday, while President Donald Trump pushes for an immediate vote. The sudden shift on Capitol Hill — with both sides declaring they have moved beyond partisan politics — comes after a breakdown in talks on Monday that led to raucous exchanges and bitter sniping on the Senate floor. “Today we can make all of the Washington drama fade away,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday morning. Just before noon, Schumer said the negotiations were “on the 2-yard line” and said there were no remaining disagreements that couldn’t be resolved over the next few hours. “There are lots of good things here,” Schumer said. “In the last few days we have made huge progress in achieving these goals.” Trump was sending mixed signals over whether he would ultimately support the imminent deal, but on Tuesday morning he pushed for an immediate vote. Mnuchin, who has been running point on the negotiations with Schumer, said he was keeping the president in the loop and that negotiators made significant progress on Monday, even as partisan squabbling broke out on the Senate floor. “We're still working and were working when they were on the floor yesterday, beating the living crap out of everybody,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said. “Now we've got a piece of legislation that really protects health care workers."" Schumer and Mnuchin met in person six times on Monday, and their final meeting wrapped up around midnight. The Senate could hold an initial procedural vote as early as Tuesday afternoon if McConnell and Schumer can reach a time agreement. Both sides were huddling with their legislative staff to review final details, and said they expect to unveil a broad deal within several hours with a vote taking place later Tuesday. On his way into McConnell's office for a meeting, Mnuchin said he had spoken with Trump twice so far Tuesday morning, and had been on a conference call to update congressional Republicans. “We're looking forward to closing a bipartisan deal today,” Mnuchin said, flanked by incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. “The president wants us to get this done today.” Asked if they had reached a deal in principle, Mnuchin declined to comment but said: “We’ve met with Mitch McConnell, we’ve met with Chuck Schumer, again we’re working through the smallest of issues and everybody’s turning around language.” Eric Ueland, the White House’s legislative affairs liaison, reiterated Tuesday morning that they do not have a final agreement but are drafting legislative text to present to committee leaders.  “I’m hopeful we can get this right in the next several hours, so that Congress can be in a position to be able to act today,"" Ueland said, though he noted: ""Everybody seemed to expect a vote in the past few days up here on the Hill."" Stocks soared as trading opened Tuesday morning, with the Dow Jones Industrial average spiking more than 1,000 points, as investors eye an imminent deal. On the other side of the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was also projecting confidence that a deal could be clinched on Tuesday. “I think there is real optimism that we could get something done in the next few hours,” she said during an interview on CNBC, saying Senate Democrats did a “great job” in the negotiations. Still, Trump took to Twitter late Monday night to harangue Democrats over their demands. “Republicans had a deal until Nancy Pelosi rode into town from her extended vacation. The Democrats want the Virus to win? They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies,” Trump tweeted. “They want Open Borders & Green New Deal. Republicans shouldn’t agree!” And early Tuesday morning, the president again chastised Democrats — but later appeared supportive of the deal, urging the Senate to act immediately. “Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!” Trump wrote. Mnuchin insisted that Trump was looped into the discussions, and said Trump’s initial tweets slamming Democrats were only related to House Democrats’ separate bill, which includes several provisions that Republicans were objecting to. Schumer was seeking added protections for workers in the final version of the bill, in addition to a so-called “Marshall Plan” for U.S. hospitals, which could soon be overrun with coronavirus patients. The New York Democrat also extracted a key concession from Mnuchin: strict oversight over a $500 billion fund designed to lend money to corporations that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, according to three sources. Democrats had criticized the initial proposal as a “slush fund” that provided no mechanisms for accountability and allowed the Trump administration to withhold details about which companies received such loans. During her CNBC interview, Pelosi said the fund would be overseen by an inspector general and a congressional panel. And Schumer later said the bill includes “unemployment insurance on steroids,” giving Americans four months worth of their income if they are furloughed or lose their job. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Rules Committee, is recommending that the House pass the Senate’s emergency package by unanimous consent or a voice vote, which would allow lawmakers to remain in their home districts. Notably, Pelosi said Tuesday that she is aiming to pass the Senate bill by unanimous consent. House Democrats will convene on a conference call on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the path forward. Pelosi later emphasized that if the Senate approves the package on Tuesday, the House could quickly follow suit as long as no lawmaker objects. McConnell had been pushing hard for a vote by Monday, but Senate Democrats over a two-day period defeated two procedural motions on the bill, citing ongoing negotiations between Schumer and Mnuchin. Republicans bitterly attacked their Democratic counterparts on the Senate floor Monday, accusing them of playing political games while the economy and global financial markets remain in a free-fall. The coronavirus has already hit the Senate, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announcing on Sunday that he tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, several other senators decided to self-quarantine due to their close interactions with Paul and other individuals who tested positive. Paul’s diagnosis — in addition to Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s (D-Minn.) announcement Monday that her husband contracted the virus — underscored the urgency for Congress to approve a rescue package, with several senators expressing wariness over the fact that the chamber was still convening daily despite federal recommendations against large gatherings.

"FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor said the Trump administration on Tuesday will formally implement the Defense Production Act to secure medical equipment sorely needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic. ""So, just a little while ago my team came in, and we're actually going to use the DPA for first time today,"" Gaynor told CNN. The FEMA Administrator said triggering the act would help access ""about 60,000 test kits,"" and added that the administration would insert ""DPA language"" into the mass contracts for the federal government's order of 500 million personal protective masks. Gaynor later stressed on Fox & Friends that the law would be used narrowly as ""leverage."" Federal delays in rolling out widespread testing have sparked criticism from state officials who have said they are woefully underprepared to handle the unfurling pandemic. One testing kit serves roughly 300 to 400 patients. President Donald Trump last week invoked the DPA as the administration broadened its response to the public health crisis, but he has resisted actually activating the statute — insisting that governors bear more responsibility for obtaining potentially life-saving supplies and arguing that the private sector would pitch in to supply needed equipment voluntarily. Meanwhile, state authorities and health experts have called for more forceful federal intervention as they struggle to get their hands on ventilators, hospital beds and other necessities before health care systems are overwhelmed by the rapidly spreading outbreak. “Even the most conservative political theories recognize that governments do sometimes have to take directive actions and markets alone cannot solve these problems,” said Mildred Solomon, president of the bioethics-focused Hastings Center. Nearly 1,400 bioethicists and health leaders have signed a letter organized by Hastings demanding that Trump use the DPA and other federal powers to secure supplies and cover Covid-19 treatments. “It should be a war mentality, and the government should be the leader,” Solomon told POLITICO. When the federal government invokes the DPA, private manufacturers are required to fill federal orders for medical equipment before any other. But implementing the law does not do anything to increase production of these items, which increasingly are in short supply. Even amid a push to expand the nation's testing capacity, for instance, there are looming shortages of key materials needed to run tests. Trump has alternately said state officials have been given everything they need, particularly for testing, and that they need to provide some essential supplies — like protective masks — themselves. State leaders, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, have railed against the approach, urging the president to “do more.” Cuomo said Sunday that his administration had overpaid to secure desperately needed masks. Trump referenced possible price gouging on necessary equipment in a Monday press conference, telling reporters, “We will not allow anyone to exploit Americans for profit.” Gaynor appeared to take a softer approach to invoking the act in his appearance on ""Fox & Friends."" ""We ask every governor — if you can find it, buy it. We are ready to use the Defense Production Act,"" he said. ""If we need as it leverage, we have it as leverage now."" Gaynor told CNN that the administration ""wanted to be thoughtful about not upsetting, you know, the balance,"" and ensure that ""we can get it out to the market and the federal government not consume it all."" Some American manufacturers have privately expressed concerns that it’s more difficult to ramp up production of medical equipment without clear guidance from the federal government outlining what materials are needed — and where. But other manufacturers are moving forward with plans to begin churning out medical equipment even without federal orders. Bill Ford, the head of Ford Motor Company, said Tuesday his company is “going as fast as we can” to make medical supplies through four projects: working with GE to make ventilators; working with 3M to make air purifying respirators; and working in-house to 3-D print face shields and N95 masks. “We’re doing it on our own,” Ford told NBC News’ ""Today."" “Obviously the White House has put a call out for companies to help, but frankly we were doing this, getting all this in motion before that.” Though the president had delayed invoking the DPA, HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in late February that his department could use the measure to procure a range of necessary personal protective equipment. “We’ve spoken of procuring at least 300 million N95 masks,” he told reporters on Feb. 28. “We need additional gowns — the Tyvek gowns, as well as gloves,” he added. The president's executive order directed Azar to work with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and other officials to determine top priorities and allocate resources. FDA and HHS referred questions about the process to FEMA. The coronavirus crisis isn’t the first time the White House has struggled with the DPA. In 2018, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, backed by the coal industry, presented a plan to Trump that would have used the DPA and other emergency laws to force utilities to buy coal from struggling U.S. miners. But the plan ran aground at the White House due to opposition from members of the National Security Council and National Economic Council, who questioned the move’s legality and impacts on electricity bills.

"President Donald Trump on Tuesday sought to signal that he and Dr. Anthony Fauci are on the same page when it comes to combating the rapid spread of the coronavirus in the United States — making light of a perceived slight by the nation’s top infectious disease expert and thanking him for recent complimentary remarks. The president’s latest stabs at a show of unity with Fauci come after a series of interviews, news reports and at least one conspicuous absence have hinted at heightened frustration with the career public health official. Fauci, who has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for 3½ decades, has become one of the most widely recognized and respected faces of the federal government’s response to the novel coronavirus. On Tuesday morning, Trump seemed eager to reaffirm Fauci’s standing within the administration amid the latest bout of palace intrigue. He retweeted a short clip of the NIAID chief’s appearance on conservative media personality Mark Levin’s Fox News talk show, during which Fauci described Trump as an incessantly inquisitive leader who heeds scientific counsel. “Thank you Tony!” the president wrote in an accompanying message. Trump even made reference on social media to Fauci’s meme-worthy “facepalm” at a White House coronavirus task force briefing on Friday, sharing a post by a Twitter user who declared, “Dr. Fauci is all of us.” The viral moment, which saw Fauci stifle a chuckle and apparently react dismissively to Trump’s branding of the State Department as the “Deep State Department,” was among the inciting incidents that have sparked new speculation regarding his relationship with the president.  In that same White House briefing last week and another news conference on Saturday, the two men offered conflicting assessments of possible pharmaceutical treatments for the coronavirus, with Trump striking an optimistic tone and Fauci emphasizing the need for further clinical trials. Then, in an interview with Science magazine published on Sunday, Fauci acknowledged the difficulties of fact-checking the commander in chief in real time, acknowledging, “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down.” On Monday, The New York Times reported that Trump and some White House advisers’ patience with Fauci had “started to wear thin,” but noted that the president has afforded the doctor “more leeway to contradict him than he has other officials” given Fauci’s credibility among journalists and the broader public. But when Trump arrived hours later at the White House daily news briefing, Fauci — normally a regular presence at the televised sessions with reporters — was not by the president’s side. Although Trump and Vice President Mike Pence explained that Fauci was attending a meeting of the coronavirus task force, to many observers, his exclusion from the briefing represented yet another indication of the White House’s displeasure. As concerns continue to mount over the president’s opinion of Fauci and other government health experts, the White House opted to forgo its traditional task force briefing on Tuesday, with Trump instead partaking in a virtual coronavirus town hall on Fox News. Among the slate of administration officials the network told POLITICO would participate, Fauci was not listed. Meanwhile, Trump has demonstrated a greater willingness to break with the advice of public health experts by suggesting he might attempt to restart the American economy after the administration’s recommended 15-day period of social distancing. Asked on Monday whether Fauci, who has championed preventative measures throughout the federal response, sides with the president, Trump answered, in part, “He doesn’t not agree.” Fauci also attempted to deescalate tensions in an interview on Tuesday with a local Washington radio station, arguing that Trump is working to perform a “delicate balancing act” taking into account the duel threats to Americans’ safety and the nation’s financial welfare. “We’re under very intense discussions right now about what the most appropriate timeline is, and if we do modify it, how do we modify it,” he said. Fauci went on to criticize members of the media who he accused of seeking to drive a wedge between himself and the president by posing probing questions intended to expose their diverging views on matters of public health. He asserted that “fundamentally, at the core,” no such discrepancies exist, and called those lines of inquiry “really unfortunate.” “The idea of just pitting one against the other is just not helpful,” Fauci said. “I wish that would stop and we’d look ahead at the challenge we have to pull together to get over this thing.”",Trump signals unity with Fauci amid talk of tension,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/donald-trump-anthony-fauci-coronavirus-tension-146035,politico
"Team Trump is rushing to rewrite the early narrative about the president’s response to coronavirus.  Faced with endless video clips of Donald Trump downplaying the escalating outbreak, Trump aides and allies are working furiously to instead highlight the president’s recent actions and comments. Their effort comprises three tactics: Blanket supporters with detailed timelines of every action the Trump administration took. Amplify praise of those actions. And forcefully push back against anyone who criticizes those actions. Just over seven months from the November election, Trump’s aides and allies realize the president’s campaign for a second term has been completely transformed in a matter of weeks. It will now come down to his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his response to a devastated economy, according to seven people familiar with the situation, including four who speak directly with the president. “The president and his performance is the campaign. It’s the only thing that matters,” said Scott Jennings, who worked for President George W. Bush and is close to the Trump White House. “There is nothing to do if you are the sitting president of the United States but to get it right. If you get it right, what better argument for reelection than this unprecedented crisis?” The Trump campaign had wanted to focus on a long list of other issues as the president launched a general election race against Democrat Joe Biden: the president’s impeachment acquittal, Biden’s acuity and overseas actions by Biden’s son Hunter.  Instead, it has shifted almost entirely to rehabilitating Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “The watchword from here has to be action,” said a Republican who speaks to Trump. “Checks on the way. Treatments being tried. Travel bans in place. Information conveyed, in real time.” Trump allies who were confident about the president’s reelection prospects just weeks ago — thanks to a strong economy and record stock market — have begun to fret as they see him being blamed by state and local leaders, members of Congress and public health officials for failing to quickly test patients and distribute masks, ventilators and other supplies. The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at nearly 50,000 by the end of Tuesday with more than 600 deaths — and the worst has yet to come. Already, Trump critics are blasting Trump for his handling of the crisis. Priorities USA, the Democrats’ leading super PAC, is launching a $6 million ad campaign on Tuesday in the battleground states of Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Republicans for the Rule of Law, conservatives who oppose Trump, aired its first ad on coronavirus last week. Still, there’s some indication the Trump team’s efforts are working. Fifty-five percent of Americans approve of his management of the coronavirus outbreak, compared with 43 percent who disapprove, according to a ABC/Ipsos poll released late last week. The numbers were nearly reversed the week before when 43 percent approved and 54 percent disapproved. Trump has been fighting back through his now-daily news conferences at the White House, boasting his administration has done an “extraordinary” and “incredible job,” while falling back on a familiar tactic of blaming the media. Trump allies said the campaign had no choice but to do what it always does when a crisis engulfs the presidency, from impeachment to the threat of war with Iran: quickly and quietly follow the president’s lead — pushing out new talking points, buying new Facebook ads and lining up voices to defend the president forcefully. “I think the president's people are adjusting their campaign very quickly,” said a Republican who is a friend of the president. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have scrapped MAGA campaign rallies and other events, shifting training and other events online, including last week’s national day of action and national week of training. But their main task these days is coronavirus. They‘ve been sending rapid-response emails to reporters, firing off emails and text messages to millions of supporters, issuing daily talking points to surrogates, posting social media messages and booking surrogates on TV and radio, according to a RNC official. “The American people have seen President Trump respond to this crisis with bold leadership and decisive action, and he will emerge from this with a strong record of results, putting him in a stronger position than any Democrat candidate,” RNC National Press Secretary Mandi Merritt said. The Trump campaign’s rapid response team has churned out hundreds of tweets in recent weeks — noting that Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York praised Trump, blasting congressional Democrats for holding up an economic rescue package, accusing the “liberal media” of spreading lies for reporting on Trump’s infamous “hoax“ comment at a rally less than a month ago — when the president called Democrats‘ criticism of his coronavirus response “their new hoax,” likening it to impeachment and the Russia investigation. “They want to try to control that narrative as much as possible,” said a Republican who speaks to Trump. “It’s irresponsible to do anything else.”  The campaign also released a detailed list of nearly 80 actions by the Trump administration to fight the virus since Jan. 6, a week after China reported the discovery of the coronavirus to the World Health Organization. “President Trump is fighting for Americans every day!” it wrote in a recent post. “His second coronavirus relief law provides free testing to all Americans, and makes sure families, workers, and businesses impacted by the Chinese virus are taken care of.” Conservative groups, including America First Policies, which supports Trump’s policies, and Tea Party Patriots, are amplifying Trump’s message and actions and fact-checking the media through media appearances and social media, the groups said. Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, said Americans can tell Trump took the coronavirus situation seriously because his administration announced restrictions on travel from China in late January. “That was a sign that President Trump was taking the potential threat the coronavirus posed to America very seriously,” she said. “At the time, many Americans kind of scoffed at that drastic action and yet now worldwide we’re seeing that same exact action happening in country after country worldwide.” Trump supporters hope they can counter statements from the president himself during the same period dismissing the threat. A week before the travel restrictions, Trump said “we have it totally under control. ... It’s going to be just fine.” Just a day before the travel move, Trump said the “very little problem” was under control and maintained “we think it’s going to have a very good ending for it.” Several Trump allies said the president and his campaign must convey that the economy will rebound from coronavirus in part because it had a strong foundation due to the president‘s actions over the past three years. “For our campaign, it will be key to convey to the people that America entered this crisis with enormous advantages and economic momentum,” one of the Republicans said. The campaign is also attempting to drag Biden into coronavirus, though it doesn’t appear to have garnered much attention — accusing him of “plagiarizing” Trump‘s plan to combat the coronavirus, defending China (where the virus first emerged) and confusing this virus with Ebola, which the Obama administration fought while Biden was vice president.  “Joe Biden sows fear and division as President Trump conveys optimism and hope,” the campaign wrote in one email. Michael Caputo, who served as a campaign adviser in 2016, said he worries Biden can blame Trump for his response to coronavirus while having to take no responsibility himself because he’s not in office. “They can criticize him for every move he makes,” he said of Biden’s team. An outside adviser said he has urged the campaign to return to discussing other issues, including Joe and Hunter Biden, to take the attention off Trump’s response to coronavirus and the tanking economy. “I don’t think those issues will ever be gone,” the person said.",Trump works to rewrite narrative on coronavirus response,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/trump-coronavirus-campaign-reelection-145007,politico
"Forecasts of doom for the American economy are quickly turning from gray to pitch black. As Congress haggles over a multitrillion-dollar coronavirus rescue package, analysts are warning the U.S. could face a prolonged depression rather than the kind of short recession and swift bounce back that President Donald Trump and his top aides expect. And they’re raising questions about whether current government efforts to cushion the economy from the damage will be anywhere near enough. Across Wall Street and the economic world, forecasters are quickly ramping up their predictions of massive job losses and declines in economic activity by as much as an annualized 50 percent in the second quarter of the year. They’re offering estimates unseen since the Great Depression that began in 1929 and continued for a brutal decade, reshaping governments and economies across the globe. Morgan Stanley economists on Monday said they now expect a 30.1 percent annualized decline in gross domestic product in the second quarter, the worst quarterly performance in 74 years. The firm’s estimates assume the virus peaks in April and May before growth starts to recover. But if the peak comes later and economic disruption continues in the second half of the year, they wrote, U.S. growth for even the entire year will be down to levels last seen in the early 1930s. The rescue package being debated in Washington would involve at least $1.6 trillion of government spending, representing just a few weeks of lost economic activity. But the hit will almost certainly be vastly larger than that, analysts say, requiring multiple congressional interventions to come close to offsetting the fastest economic shutdown in American history. The Federal Reserve stepped into the breach on Monday with strong action to prop up wobbly credit markets. And it promised efforts to aid small and midsize businesses that are failing in large numbers, a main street lending program that could multiply the power of the congressional spending package. But that did not ease fears in the stock market, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3 percent to 18,591.93 — the lowest since November 2016. It remains unclear whether the Fed’s actions will be up and running fast enough to ensure that when government officials do flip the lights back on, a functional economy will be capable of a swift bounce back. “A $1.5 trillion stimulus package sounds like a lot, and it is,” LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder said in a note to clients. “But given the unemployment rate might be headed to double digits and many impacted businesses won’t survive through the spring without some help, it probably won’t be enough.” Economists are now mostly just debating how deep and lasting the economic downturn will be. “The U.S. economy has entered recession as the COVID-19 outbreak and public health efforts to combat it have led to a sharp contraction in economic activity,” Gus Faucher, chief economist at the PNC Financial Group, wrote in a research note. “Restrictions on movement throughout the country have led consumers to pull back on their spending, with restaurants, hotels, movie theaters, entertainment venues, sports leagues, and many retail establishments closed. The airlines are rapidly cutting capacity, and U.S. auto manufacturers have stopped production.” The coronavirus crisis essentially knocked out the strongest pillars of the U.S. economy: consumer confidence and spending. It has also driven a once high-flying stock market into bear market territory, making Americans feel less wealthy and less apt to spend. Manufacturing was already in recession when the virus hit and will likely fall further into negative territory as factories are shuttered and workers kept at home. State jobless claims are already spiking in record numbers. On Thursday, economists expect the largest national jobless claims number in American history, a figure Goldman Sachs estimates could hit 2.25 million new filings in a single week. That would smash the all-time record of close to 700,000 hit in 1982. Some estimates are far higher than that, perhaps up to 5 million. Job losses that will show up in the Labor Department’s April jobs report released in early May could hit 5 million to 10 million or more, wiping out all the gains from 2018, 2019 and the first two months of 2020. That’s led to complaints from across the economic world that just as the government is far behind in battling the spread of the novel coronavirus, it is also mounting a woefully inadequate economic response. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said the jobless rate could hit 30 percent in the second quarter with a 50 percent annualized drop in GDP during the quarter. And the longer Washington waits to send direct aid to individuals and families who have lost their incomes and to small business that cannot meet payrolls, the worse things will look when the coronavirus crisis ends. “The longer it takes, the deeper the ongoing slowdown will be,” said Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson. “Fed data shows that 40 percent of U.S. households would not be able to come up with $400 for an emergency expense, and data from 2019 shows that 53 percent of U.S. households don’t have any emergency savings.” The word “depression” is seeping into more and more financial forecasts, as economists abandon earlier hopes that the virus spread could be halted by April and workers could go back to their jobs and shoppers back into stores. “At this point, the most optimistic outcome for the domestic economy appears to be a temporary dip into negative akin to the contraction of 2001 with the worst case being a prolonged depressionlike scenario similar to that experienced in 1929,” Stifel chief economist Lindsey M. Piegza said in a note on Monday. The darkening scenarios have kicked off debates both in Washington and Europe about how long economies can afford to remain in lockdown. Tough decisions are ahead on the potential cost in lives of reopening America more quickly versus the cost to the economy and general human well-being of keeping people stuck in their homes for weeks or months to come. Economists note that prolonged recessions and certainly a depression would also cost lives and widespread misery. “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,” Trump said at a news briefing Monday evening, repeating what he wrote on Twitter shortly before midnight on Sunday. “At the end of the 15-day period, we will make a decision as to which way we want to go, where we want to go, the timing.” Trump again expressed frustration with the economic downturn and pledged to revisit all the current stay-at-home orders. “The hardship will end. It will end soon. Normal life will return, and our economy will rebound very, very strongly,” he said. But few economists now believe that even the giant rescue package working its way through Washington will do enough to offset damage that’s already been done to the U.S. economy — a cost that’s mounting by the day. “Disruption will take the form of a depression-like set of shocks that will require a significant intervention by the federal government into economic and social life for the foreseeable future,” RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas wrote on Monday. The latest moves by the Fed and other government institutions “are just the latest in a series of actions that are likely to continue throughout this year and likely next in response to the global public health emergency caused by the Covid-19 virus.”",Fears mount of a coronavirus-induced depression,2020-03-23,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/23/great-depression-coronavirus-induced-calamity-145304,politico

"President Donald Trump on Tuesday sought to signal that he and Dr. Anthony Fauci are on the same page when it comes to combating the rapid spread of the coronavirus in the United States — making light of a perceived slight by the nation’s top infectious disease expert and thanking him for recent complimentary remarks. The president’s latest stabs at a show of unity with Fauci come after a series of interviews, news reports and at least one conspicuous absence have hinted at heightened frustration with the career public health official. Fauci, who has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for 3½ decades, has become one of the most widely recognized and respected faces of the federal government’s response to the novel coronavirus. On Tuesday morning, Trump seemed eager to reaffirm Fauci’s standing within the administration amid the latest bout of palace intrigue. He retweeted a short clip of the NIAID chief’s appearance on conservative media personality Mark Levin’s Fox News talk show, during which Fauci described Trump as an incessantly inquisitive leader who heeds scientific counsel. “Thank you Tony!” the president wrote in an accompanying message. Trump even made reference on social media to Fauci’s meme-worthy “facepalm” at a White House coronavirus task force briefing on Friday, sharing a post by a Twitter user who declared, “Dr. Fauci is all of us.” The viral moment, which saw Fauci stifle a chuckle and apparently react dismissively to Trump’s branding of the State Department as the “Deep State Department,” was among the inciting incidents that have sparked new speculation regarding his relationship with the president.  In that same White House briefing last week and another news conference on Saturday, the two men offered conflicting assessments of possible pharmaceutical treatments for the coronavirus, with Trump striking an optimistic tone and Fauci emphasizing the need for further clinical trials. Then, in an interview with Science magazine published on Sunday, Fauci acknowledged the difficulties of fact-checking the commander in chief in real time, acknowledging, “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down.” On Monday, The New York Times reported that Trump and some White House advisers’ patience with Fauci had “started to wear thin,” but noted that the president has afforded the doctor “more leeway to contradict him than he has other officials” given Fauci’s credibility among journalists and the broader public. But when Trump arrived hours later at the White House daily news briefing, Fauci — normally a regular presence at the televised sessions with reporters — was not by the president’s side. Although Trump and Vice President Mike Pence explained that Fauci was attending a meeting of the coronavirus task force, to many observers, his exclusion from the briefing represented yet another indication of the White House’s displeasure. As concerns continue to mount over the president’s opinion of Fauci and other government health experts, the White House opted to forgo its traditional task force briefing on Tuesday, with Trump instead partaking in a virtual coronavirus town hall on Fox News. Among the slate of administration officials the network told POLITICO would participate, Fauci was not listed. Meanwhile, Trump has demonstrated a greater willingness to break with the advice of public health experts by suggesting he might attempt to restart the American economy after the administration’s recommended 15-day period of social distancing. Asked on Monday whether Fauci, who has championed preventative measures throughout the federal response, sides with the president, Trump answered, in part, “He doesn’t not agree.” Fauci also attempted to deescalate tensions in an interview on Tuesday with a local Washington radio station, arguing that Trump is working to perform a “delicate balancing act” taking into account the dual threats to Americans’ safety and the nation’s financial welfare. “We’re under very intense discussions right now about what the most appropriate timeline is, and if we do modify it, how do we modify it,” he said. Fauci went on to criticize members of the media who he accused of seeking to drive a wedge between himself and the president by posing probing questions intended to expose their diverging views on matters of public health. He asserted that “fundamentally, at the core,” no such discrepancies exist, and called those lines of inquiry “really unfortunate.” “The idea of just pitting one against the other is just not helpful,” Fauci said. “I wish that would stop and we’d look ahead at the challenge we have to pull together to get over this thing.”",Trump signals unity with Fauci amid talk of tension,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/donald-trump-anthony-fauci-coronavirus-tension-146035,politico

"Congressional negotiators signaled Tuesday they are likely hours away from clinching a bipartisan agreement on a nearly $2 trillion emergency stimulus package — capping five days of frenetic talks over a response to the coronavirus pandemic. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to announce an agreement later Tuesday, under immense pressure from President Donald Trump, a dire economic outlook, and the growing number of Americans losing their livelihoods amid the crisis. The Senate’s lead negotiators — Mnuchin, Schumer, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland — have spent most of Tuesday huddling behind closed doors as they finalized policy details and legislative text. If those last-minute talks are successful, lawmakers say they could vote within hours. “The timeline is as soon as possible,” Ueland said leaving a more than hour-long meeting with McConnell, Mnuchin, and a half-dozen GOP senators who have been heavily involved in the rescue package.  “We’re trying to finalize all the documents, going through a lot of complicated issues, and we're making a lot of progress,” Mnuchin said added, also flanked by Rep. Mark Meadows, who was recently tapped as Trump’s next chief of staff. Schumer took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to declare that senators were “on the 2-yard line” and said there were no remaining disagreements that couldn’t be resolved over the next few hours. “There are lots of good things here,” Schumer said. “In the last few days we have made huge progress in achieving these goals.” On the other side of the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was also projecting confidence that a deal could be clinched on Tuesday. Pelosi, who is working from Washington while the vast majority of the House remains in their districts for recess, said she hopes to get unanimous consent on the bill — an agreement that would not only allow swift passage, but would also keep worried lawmakers away from the Capitol, where the virus has started spreading. “I think there is real optimism that we could get something done in the next few hours,” she said during an interview on CNBC, saying Senate Democrats did a “great job” in the negotiations. Hours later, Pelosi told MSNBC that negotiators were “in the red zone,” in her latest of several media appearances on Tuesday as she sought to promote her own members’ priorities.  But Democratic and Republican leaders in the House don’t yet know whether it would be possible to muscle through a sweeping $2 trillion bill without a single objection from any of the chamber’s 435 lawmakers. If they can get a unanimous consent agreement, one idea being floated by leadership is to have lawmakers later record how they would have voted in a roll call. Privately, many lawmakers say they don’t want to return to the House, which would risk further spreading the virus either while traveling to Washington or in the Capitol itself. Three members of Congress, including two House lawmakers, have tested positive for the coronavirus, as well as several staffers.  It would be nearly unprecedented, however, for the House to unanimously approve a package that large, with massive implications for nearly every sector of the economy. Several lawmakers, including freshman firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), have telegraphed at least some concerns with the latest version of the Senate talks.  House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told Democrats on a conference call Tuesday afternoon that he would prefer to vote by unanimous consent, but still doesn’t have timing on when a vote would be, according to people familiar with the discussions on the call. Hoyer also said Congress would take up at least one more economic package to respond to the crisis, possibly appeasing some in the caucus who are pushing for still more in the current bill.  Pelosi added that she is still waiting to see final details on two issues — food stamps and pension shortfalls — and continues to watch out for potential GOP poison pills. Still, the sudden burst of productivity between Senate negotiators — with both sides declaring they have moved beyond partisan politics — is a welcome shift from Monday, when a breakdown in talks and two failed procedural votes led to raucous exchanges and bitter sniping on the Senate floor. Stocks soared as trading opened Tuesday morning, with the Dow Jones Industrial average spiking more than 1,000 points, as investors eye an imminent deal. “Today we can make all of the Washington drama fade away,” McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday morning. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) told reporters on Tuesday that bipartisan talks on the bill had resumed after Republicans were on the floor the day before “beating the living crap out of everybody.” One of the biggest question marks — like in all must-pass bills that require buy-in from both parties — is Trump. Trump has sent mixed signals over whether he would ultimately support the deal, taking to Twitter on Monday night to harangue Democrats over their demands, but pushing for an immediate vote by Tuesday morning. “Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!” Trump tweeted. Mnuchin, who has been running point on the negotiations with Schumer, said he was actively keeping the president in the loop. At one point Tuesday morning, Mnuchin said he had spoken with Trump twice already. Much of the in-person negotiations have taken place between Schumer and Mnuchin, who met in person six times on Monday with the final meeting wrapping up around midnight.  By Tuesday afternoon, the biggest sticking points involved the food stamps program, a state stabilization fund and airline relief, according to lawmakers and other negotiators involved in the talks.  But Ueland said he would not characterize any of those issues “as a snag,” Ueland said, when asked about the food stamps program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.  “We are just working through each issue as they arise and trying to find a resolution,” Ueland said. One of the biggest problems from Monday has already been resolved, according to Democrats. Schumer said he extracted a key concession from Mnuchin: strict oversight over a $500 billion fund designed to lend money to corporations that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, according to three sources. Democrats had criticized the initial proposal as a “slush fund” that provided no mechanisms for accountability and allowed the Trump administration to withhold details about which companies received such loans. Schumer also told Senate Democrats on a conference call Tuesday afternoon that he was “confident” he had secured $150 billion for a state and local fund and $130 billion for hospitals as part of the negotiations with Mnuchin, according to a person familiar with the call. During her CNBC interview, Pelosi said the fund would be overseen by an inspector general and a congressional panel. And Schumer later said the bill includes “unemployment insurance on steroids,” giving Americans four months worth of their income if they are furloughed or lose their job. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Rules Committee, is recommending that the House pass the Senate’s emergency package by unanimous consent or a voice vote. House Democrats will convene on a conference call on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the path forward. But leadership could encounter roadblocks in either party: Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), members of the so-called progressive squad, have already raised concerns with the emerging deal. “The developments of this Senate relief bill are concerning,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “It seems to give a *HALF TRILLION DOLLARS* away to big corporations, w/ few worker protections.” And in the GOP, some members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus have been notorious for grinding fast-moving spending bills to a halt; Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) threatened to hold up a package of corrections to another coronavirus relief bill just last week, though he eventually backed off. House Republican aides maintain that unanimous consent is still a possibility, but GOP leadership needs to review the final text of the bill and take the temperature of the conference before they determine whether that’s a realistic scenario. To the end, the House GOP’s whip team — which plans to remotely whip the relief package — will hold a conference call early Tuesday afternoon.

"BRUSSELS — Chinese-style surveillance is coming to a neighborhood near you. From drones barking orders at park-goers to tracing people's movements through cellphones, Western governments are rushing to embrace sophisticated surveillance tools that would have been unthinkable just a few weeks ago. In the European Union, home to the world's strictest privacy regimen, leaders have taken the unprecedented step of asking telecoms companies to hand over mobile phone data so they can track population movements and try to stop the spread. The European Commission has gone further, asking all such data to be centralized to speed up prevention across the bloc, three people involved in the talks told POLITICO. But epidemiologists argue that such efforts are only a first step: To be fully effective, some say, the EU will have to follow the example of South Korea and China and make infected people download an app that would reveal exactly where they go and whom they meet. “It would be much more efficient [to stop the spread of the coronavirus] if everyone had the same app,” said Sune Lehmann Jørgensen, a professor at the Technical University of Denmark who is advising the government on how best to track the coronavirus. “But we shouldn’t just institute global surveillance.  [The] 9/11 [attacks] showed us that in times of crisis, we can erode people’s rights."" While governments seek out more effective tracking tools, companies best known for providing digital surveillance for security forces are proving only too happy to oblige. Some, like the Israeli NSO Group and facial recognition company Clearview AI, have barely emerged from controversies about their practices, while others, like U.S.-based Palantir, are closely linked to the intelligence and defense communities in the United States. The race to embrace invasive tools underscores a simple dynamic at play during the current global pandemic: Public health concerns are trumping the desire to protect individuals' privacy online and in the real world, even in the home of the General Data Protection Regulation, Europe's sweeping privacy rules. And so far, regulators and the public are largely standing by. “The acceptance level for tracking is higher,"" said Staffan Truvé, chief technology officer of cybersecurity intelligence firm Recorded Future. ""Everyone feels at risk. The personal benefit of briefly giving up your privacy feels much bigger than with terrorist attacks.” Just a few weeks ago, when the pandemic was still a distant fear, privacy advocates latched on to a clip of Chinese police ordering an elderly woman back into her home via drone-mounted loudspeaker as an example of Big Brother tactics gone awry. Now, drones are deployed in Brussels, the heart of Europe's institutional capital, to enforce social-distancing rules, and stay-at-home orders are being broadcast through the streets of German cities. The speed with which such solutions have not just been rolled out, but also been largely accepted by anxious populations is prompting critics to warn of a danger to democracy. In Israel, the government last week approved sweeping new emergency surveillance powers that allow authorities to enforce quarantine orders and warn people about potentially infectious encounters. Despite the potential for snooping and privacy breaches, the EU has said it would continue to approve the transfer of data about EU citizens to Israel. And some European lawmakers are already calling for similar surveillance powers closer to home. In France, two conservative senators last week tabled an amendment that would authorize telecoms operators to collect health and location data on all mobile phone users for six months. It was defeated, but telecoms-to-government data transfers are happening on an ad hoc basis. In Brussels, Thierry Breton, the EU's Internal Markets Commissioner, has been at the forefront of efforts to get companies to share data. During a conference call with executives from telecoms giants, including Deutsche Telekom and Orange, the Frenchman asked them to hand over so-called metadata, or peripheral information stripped of individual identifiers, on millions of people's mobile phones. “The whole idea [in sharing mobile data with governments] is to be ahead of the curve,"" said Frederic Pivetta, the founder of Dalberg, a data analytics firm that has been contracted by the Belgian government to use telecom data to map the spread of the coronavirus. ""This exercise is meant to flatten the curve, so less people are going to be infected because you know where the infected people are today."" As governments take similar steps across the EU, they can look to Norway for an example of how it can be implemented. Telenor, the local carrier, has been sharing aggregated mobile data with scientists for three weeks, according to Arnoldo Frigessi, a statistician at the University of Oslo involved in the project. He said that his team had been able to track a roughly 60 percent drop in people moving between municipalities by tracking smartphone movements. But now that most people were staying at home, Frigessi said more needs to be done to ensure people are staying separated. His team is helping the Norwegian government to create its own smartphone app in the coming weeks to give greater insight into individuals’ activities. An app ""is a completely different story,"" he said. Norway is not alone. Spain, Romania, Slovakia and Poland have already created their own version of these apps, which experiences in South Korea, Hong Kong and China suggest can be highly effective in slowing the spread of disease. The rush to embrace data-sharing and even apps that track infected people's whereabouts raises the question: Where are Europe's data regulators? For now, they are largely keeping an eye on developments and even in some cases giving their blessings to new data-collection initiatives. “I’m observing how in the corona pandemic, other countries are neglecting data protection in parts,"" said Ulrich Kelber, who's in charge of the federal privacy regulator in Germany. ""But in Germany I don’t see any reason for that because all solutions can be designed so that they don't infringe upon fundamental rights."" Kelber endorsed a scheme under which Deutsche Telekom, the local carrier, handed over 5 gigabytes of data on its 46 million mobile customers to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany's national disease control center. Across the border in Austria, top data regulator Andrea Jelinek, has done the same for similar data-sharing plans. Such aggregated data does not offer granular information on people's everyday movements. “Rest assured that all offices are watching this [data-transfer practice] closely,” Jelinek, who also chairs the EDPB, Europe's umbrella group of privacy authorities, told POLITICO. “People have other concerns right now than hollowing out data protection standards."" But privacy advocates strongly disagree. Pointing to a wave of new surveillance powers approved nationally and EU-wide in 2015- 2017, following a wave of terrorist attacks, critics argue that regulators are green-lighting practices that will be almost impossible to unwind once the pandemic has passed. Patrick Breyer, a German MEP, said that once approved, mobile data-sharing schemes would set a dangerous precedent for real-time monitoring of meetings and gatherings. “There can be many reasons why you would want to meet in private without being tracked by the government and without alerting them to it,"" he said. ""It's important in a democracy, and even more important in autocratic regimes, where people need to meet in secret, to make sure that they are not exposed to a government crackdown."" According to European Commissioner Breton and other top officials urging telecoms operators to hand over data, privacy can be respected because the data concerned is anonymized and aggregated. But that is a little reassurance, according to privacy experts who point out that an individual's identity can easily be deduced from just a handful of anonymized mobile phone location data points. ""The challenge with this data is that we don't believe it can be anonymized,"" said Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, head of the computational privacy group at Imperial College London, whose research found that almost all people could be personally identified from just four pieces of anonymized mobile phone data. ""It comes down to what is reasonable and proportionate."" Laura Kayali contributed reporting. Want more analysis from POLITICO? POLITICO Pro is our premium intelligence service for professionals.

In a memo to top Justice Department leaders, law enforcement agency chiefs and U.S. Attorneys across the country, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said prosecutors and investigators could come across cases of “purposeful exposure and infection of others with COVID-19.” “Because Coronavirus appears to meet the statutory definition of a ‘biological agent’… such acts potentially could implicate the Nation’s terrorism-related statutes,” Rosen wrote. “Threats or attempts to use COVID-19 as a weapon against Americans will not be tolerated.” Rosen did not say whether any such threats or intentional exposures had been reported or whether his warning was simply precautionary. The Justice Department has also set up a task force to address hoarding and price gouging related to supplies urgently needed for the fight against the virus. Attorney General Bill Barr said during a briefing at the White House on Monday that hoarding of supplies like masks would be prosecuted. However, memos issued by Barr and Rosen on Tuesday said the Department of Health and Human Services has yet to formally designate the health-related items the administration wants covered by the Defense Production Act. The task force pursuing such issues will be headed by U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Craig Carpenito, and it will include someone from each U.S. Attorney’s Office and other Justice Department units, Barr said.",Those who intentionally spread coronavirus could be charged as terrorists,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/coronavirus-terrorism-justice-department-147821,politico
"A legal campaign to force the release of at-risk immigration detainees escalated Tuesday as officials announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus in a prisoner being held for immigration violations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement revealed that a 31-year-old Mexican national held at the Bergen County, N.J., Jail tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The agency provided few details but said the individual “has been quarantined and is receiving care.” ICE also said it has suspended sending immigration detainees to that jail. The announcement came as one lawsuit pressing for release of immigration detainees because of the virus got a court date and another suit was filed in a bid to spur such releases.  District Judge James Boasberg in Washington set a Monday afternoon hearing on a request for a temporary restraining order that would spring 37 immigrant families held at detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, in California, lawyers filed suit Tuesday to try to win freedom for 13 immigration detainees at facilities in Bakersfield and Yuba County. The lawyers wrote in the suit, filed in federal court in San Francisco, that the immigrants’ ages or health conditions put them in additional danger from the virus. “Unless this Court intervenes to order the release of the Plaintiffs, they, along with many other detained individuals, will face dramatically increased chances of contracting COVID-19, becoming seriously ill, and dying,” said the lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union’s California branches, the San Francisco Public Defender’s office, the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights in San Francisco and Oakland immigration law firm Lakin & Wille. The suit says releasing the most at-risk detainees would also ease crowding at the centers and reduce the danger to other prisoners. Lawyers handling the case have asked for a temporary restraining order, but there was no immediate word on a hearing. ICE said on its website Tuesday evening that in addition to the COVID-19 case in New Jersey, an ICE detention worker in Elizabeth, N.J., has also tested positive. There are also 18 confirmed cases among ICE nondetention personnel, the agency said. Meanwhile, a report published Tuesday by The Nation magazine said that as of March 19, nine ICE detainees were in medical-related isolation and 24 more were being monitored for medical issues. It was not immediately clear whether all were suspected of being infected with coronavirus or whether there were other medical issues. The figures obtained by the Nation show 1,444 Homeland Security employees in self-quarantine as of five days ago, including 670 Transportation Security Administration workers and 120 ICE personnel. An ICE spokeswoman said she was unable to provide numbers other than for confirmed cases. Courts handling legal cases involving immigration detainees have reached different conclusions about whether such prisoners should remain in custody as the pandemic develops. Last week, a federal judge in Seattle rejected a suit seeking the release of nine immigrants held at a center in Tacoma, Wash.  “There is no evidence of an outbreak at the detention center or that Defendants’ precautionary measures are inadequate to contain such an outbreak or properly provide medical care should it occur,” wrote District Judge James Robart. However, Robart added a footnote saying he might reconsider if the outbreak worsened. “The court is mindful of the gravity and rapidly changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. The court emphasizes that this order is based on and extends no further than the narrow set of facts, arguments, and requested relief presently before the court,” the judge wrote. And on Monday, a panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited the increasing threat of the virus when ordering the release of a Mexican woman, Lucero Xochihua-Jaimes, pursuing an asylum claim in the U.S. “In light of the rapidly escalating public health crisis, which public health authorities predict will especially impact immigration detention centers, the court sua sponte orders that Petitioner be immediately released from detention and that removal of Petitioner be stayed pending final disposition by this court,” said the order, issued by Judges Eugene Siler, Kim Wardlaw and Milan Smith.",Legal battles escalate over virus dangers to immigration detainees,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/coronavirus-immigration-detainees-147721,politico
"Over the past week, as President Donald Trump‘s top officials came to the podium to give their updates, they first gave thanks.  “Let me start by thanking you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for your decisive leadership,” offered Attorney General William Barr.  “Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President for your tireless leadership,” proclaimed Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. “Today's announcement is just the latest in a long line of bold, decisive actions the president has taken to protect Americans from the coronavirus spreading across our borders,” remarked Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.  And as they talked, they peppered their remarks with frequent reminders of who they served — “at the president’s direction,” “with the president’s leadership” — as their boss stood watching. At the White House podium over the last few weeks, each member of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force has been cognizant of two messages: one for millions of Americans; another for the man just a few feet away. Even the health experts — many of them not political appointees — have made sure to deliver some praise to the president to help the medicine go down as they dish out some of the more dire predictions about the growing pandemic. Critics have noted that aides have been premature at times to lavish compliments on the president as they continue to fight the virus. They compared the constant thank-yous to Trump’s televised Cabinet meetings, during which Trump went around the room and had each senior official praise him.  “It undermines the credibility of the experts. … What people need are the facts. They don’t need experts spending time fluffing up the commander in chief,” David Lapan, a former Pentagon spokesperson and vice president of communications at Bipartisan Policy Center said. The effusiveness has even caught on among late-night comedians. The Daily Show relabeled the task force “The Coronavirus Thank Force” in a video that compiled each member’s hyperbolic praise. For Trump, it’s a management style that goes back decades.  “He never told us to do it, but we picked it up,” said Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization vice president who worked for him for 12 years. “Delivering any kind of bad news to him involved some kind of build-up. You’d have to first say what a great decision he’d made on another project and how well everything was going, and by the way…”  “People picked up really quickly that he needed to be flattered,” she added.  For those who know the president, public praise and flattery are a valuable political currency. Trump has been noticeably more gracious towards several Democratic governors during the coronavirus outbreak, often citing their praise of his current leadership. The president on Sunday noted that state governors were “very, very complimentary” on a recent nationwide coronavirus call. “I watched, over the last few days, Gov. [Andrew] Cuomo, I watched Gavin Newsom,” Trump said, referencing the Democratic governors in New York and California, two of the hardest-hit states. “I watched both of them. And they’ve been, you know, very complimentary.” It’s a dynamic, the president warned during an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, governors must be aware of. “It’s a two-way street,” Trump said during a Tuesday interview on Fox News. “They have to treat us well, also. They can’t say, ‘Oh, gee, we should get this, we should get that.’” Unable to hear the roaring cheers at his campaign rallies due to coronavirus cancellations, the president has turned to his daily press briefings to get national attention and hear congratulatory remarks, sometimes at the expense of delivering accurate statements about the disease. The president is hyper aware of TV ratings, which are compiled weekly for him in the White House, and viewership of the briefings during the daytime hours have seen a notable spike as Americans anxiously watch from home. Administration officials say it’s an opportunity for experts from the task force to answer questions, but it also gives the president a national platform to assure the public and offer himself a pat on the back. “Many doctors, I’ve read many, many doctors, can’t believe the great job that I’ve done,” Trump said, without offering specifics, even as health professionals have publicly warned of severe equipment shortages.  “Europe was just designated as the hotspot right now, and we closed that border a while ago. So that was lucky or through talent or through luck. Call it whatever you want,” Trump said, referring to his decision to cut off most travel from Europe and China to the United States. Like many of Trump’s rhetorical quirks — hyperbole, casual bragging — his desire to be lavished with praise is something that is often inconsequential. But in a moment of crisis, Trump’s critics say it distracts from important messaging efforts. “Pre-crisis, that stuff is mildly annoying but it’s not harmful,” said Lapan, the ex-Pentagon spokesman. “In the midst of a pandemic, it’s potentially harmful. We want facts, we want clear information from experts, we don’t need to spend time mixing the message by praising the president.” Nancy Cook contributed to this report.",How to update the country on coronavirus: Thank Trump first,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/update-country-coronavirus-thank-trump-147625,politico

"The far-right’s most zealous Trump supporters have set their sights on Dr. Anthony Fauci.  To the vast majority of Republicans, the entire medical community and the country at large, Fauci is the government’s leading infectious disease expert, respected for providing Americans with consistent, factual information about the coronavirus pandemic — even if it means contradicting President Donald Trump while he hovers feet away. But to a vocal minority of ring-wing blogs and pro-Trump pundits, Fauci is the embodiment of the establishment forces that have been arrayed against the president since he came to Washington. And those voices are getting louder amid rumblings about Fauci’s standing with Trump as the president itches to get the economy restarted in the coming weeks.  “A Deep-State Hillary Clinton-loving stooge,” read a Saturday headline on the American Thinker, a far-right website, latching on to a WikiLeaks-released email that showed Fauci praising Clinton for her Benghazi testimony as secretary of State. “Guy was a Hillary mole,” pro-Trump podcaster Bill Mitchell tweeted on Monday.  “Disrespectful,” read a Monday headline on the right-wing Gateway Pundit, comparing Fauci to ousted general Stanley McChrystal.  The narrative has even started to migrate to Fox News, a key source of information for the president.  “He’ll still have a job at the end of this, whatever happens,” Fox News host Steve Hilton argued during his Sunday night monologue on “The Next Revolution.” “Our ruling class and their TV mouthpieces whipping up fear over this virus, they can afford an indefinite shutdown.”  Fauci’s portrayal in conservative media circles could play a crucial role in the coming days as the country comes to the end of a 15-day period of social distancing and business closures intended to slow the coronavirus outbreak. While public health officials like Fauci have cautioned that the country will likely have to extend that period, Trump and his team are signaling that they want to get people back to work soon, by mid-April if possible. The cues from right-wing media, as split as they are, could influence how much Trump listens to Fauci. “He obviously has the backing of the president right now, but a lot of people on the right in the grass roots are extremely skeptical of this entire coronavirus thing,’” said Lee Stranahan, the host of “Fault Lines” on Sputnik Radio, a Russian government-backed media outlet. The coronavirus has killed hundreds in the United States and almost 20,000 worldwide, according to researchers and government officials, overwhelming hospitals and straining global medical supplies. Cases and deaths are expected to keep rising in the coming days.  For the moment, Fauci — director of the National Institute Of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 — still has the respect of large swathes of Trump’s supporters, reflecting the unique fissures that have emerged in the MAGA movement during the coronavirus. Trump supporters who praise Fauci also tend to believe the president should employ swift, severe measures — and keep the economy shuttered — as long as necessary to keep coronavirus under control.  In past, non-pandemic times, the right would have likely unified in rallying against a government official publicly quibbling with the president. But this time, reliable Trump boosters like Breitbart and the majority of the Fox News stable are leaving him alone.  “I think he’s obviously excellent at his job, and I think he’s aware that he’s on that stage to offer detail and help finesse language, and he seems cool with it,” said Raheem Kassam, the former editor of Breitbart London and host of the podcast ""War Room.""  Fauci’s criticism of palace intrigue reporting on his relationship with Trump has endeared even more to this crowd. “Mainstream media and several journalists, especially as it pertains to the White House press corps, are purposely trying to get Fauci to contradict Trump for a juicy conflict in the middle of a pandemic,” said Stephen Miller, a conservative media columnist who contributes to The Spectator USA, the American division of the long-time conservative British outlet.  The New York Times published an article Monday suggesting the president was losing patience with Fauci’s willingness to oppose him in public and in interviews, even as the NIAID director has gone out of his way to praise Trump to more conservative outlets. Miller noted Fauci had implicitly rebuked reporters for asking questions that Fauci said were “pitting one against the other,” calling it “just not helpful” in the middle of the pandemic. Fauci, Miller said, “doesn't appear to want to take the bait.” Instead, it’s the right-wing fringe that has been going after Fauci, largely due to the fact that he tamps down Trump’s excitement over quick-fix solutions, such as the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, his desire for stringent restrictions on gatherings and his publicly dire predictions about the potential death toll that are at odds with Trump’s more optimistic outlook. These figures have been latched on to Fauci for weeks, even if their comments weren’t initially gaining much traction.  “The guy has been around for 50 years yet never thought to prepare for something like this?” griped John Cardillo, a pundit for the Trump-friendly Newsmax, in a March 13 tweet. “Every time he speaks he makes things worse. Maybe he is the problem, not the solution.” “I think a lot of people at this point are looking for an explanation for the very confusing, unprecedented events going on in the world,” said Stranahan, who vehemently opposed attacking Fauci.  Trump on Tuesday tried to quell any rumors of dissatisfaction with Fauci, who was noticeably absent at Monday’s White House coronavirus briefing and a Tuesday afternoon virtual town hall on Fox News.  But then Fauci was there again, at the president’s side, Tuesday night during the latest coronavirus briefing. And Trump praised Fauci early in the day, calling his performance as “very good,” and even appearing to make light on Twitter of a much-shared meme showing Fauci facepalm as the president jokingly used the term “deep State Department.” Regardless, Trump does have a history of sidelining administration officials who disagree with him, from former White House counsel Don McGahn to ex-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.  In this case, however, much of the conservative world, including many Trump supporters, would prefer to keep Fauci in his role.  “What I would say to the president is that we’re all in this thing together and people have come to recognize Fauci alongside Trump as a solid team up there, so why change it?” Kassam argued. That won’t stop the hardcore MAGA fanbase from going after Fauci. Hours before Trump praised Fauci on Tuesday, Mitchell, the Trump-friendly podcaster, tweeted a fresh Fauci-bashing article from the far-right site Big League Politics.  “Dr. Fauci Wants America to Become a Police State Like China in Order to Stop Coronavirus.”",Anthony Fauci becomes a fringe MAGA target,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/anthony-fauci-fringe-maga-target-147401,politico
"The Department of Homeland Security stopped updating its annual models of the havoc that pandemics would wreak on America’s critical infrastructure in 2017, according to current and former DHS officials with direct knowledge of the matter. From at least 2005 to 2017, an office inside DHS, in tandem with analysts and supercomputers at several national laboratories, produced detailed analyses of what would happen to everything from transportation systems to hospitals if a pandemic hit the United States. But the work abruptly stopped in 2017 amid a bureaucratic dispute over its value, two of the former officials said, leaving the department flat-footed as it seeks to stay ahead of the impacts the COVID-19 outbreak is having on vast swathes of the U.S. economy. Officials at other agencies have requested some of the reports from the pandemic modeling unit at DHS in recent days, only to find the information they needed scattered or hard to find quickly.  And while department leaders dispute that, others say the confusion is just the latest example of the Trump administration’s struggle to respond to an outbreak that has sickened more than 50,000 Americans and threatens to overwhelm hospitals and other healthcare providers. Officials are now scrambling to secure enough masks, respirators and ventilators to meet the rapidly exploding need. Doctors and nurses are reusing their protective gear as supplies dwindle; governors are begging the administration for federal help that has been slow to arrive. The models -- primarily computer simulations that seek to anticipate the interaction between millions of Americans and U.S. infrastructure systems -- were overseen by the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC), a program that has been run by a shifting alphabet soup of agencies within DHS, reflecting the continual bureaucratic reshuffling that has plagued the department since its inception in 2002.  Some of the modeling unit’s analyses looked at what would happen if a large portion of the U.S. workforce — say, 40 percent — got sick or couldn’t show up to work to maintain and operate key aspects of the national infrastructure, such as the systems that keep planes flying safely. The reports were meant to guide policymakers toward areas that would demand their attention in the event of an outbreak. One 2015 DHS report, based partly on data produced by NISAC, warned that America’s public and private health systems might “experience significant shortages in vaccines, antivirals, pharmaceuticals needed to treat secondary infections and complications, personal protective equipment (PPE), and medical equipment, including ventilators.” Juliette Kayyem, a senior DHS official in the Obama administration, praised the quality of the NISAC reports she received when she was at the department, and criticized DHS for being “singularly focused on border enforcement” under Trump at the expense of properly planning for other threats like a pandemic. “We should not be surprised that a department that has for the last three and a half years viewed itself solely as a border enforcement agency seems ill-equipped to address a much greater threat to the homeland,” she said. In recent days, as the government raced to address the growing demands, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services asked their counterparts at DHS to dig up some of the old reports and analyses, according to two former DHS officials. The request came from within HHS’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, which works to ensure that the country has enough medical equipment and drugs to deal with public health emergencies and everyday health needs. But Homeland Security officials initially had trouble finding some documents related to planning for a pandemic, including 2007 and 2009 pandemic reports as well as a report produced for a 2014 exercise held by senior policymakers, according to the former officials -- although some were eventually found and put in a ZIP file sent to HHS. “Nobody even knew where any of the documents were anymore,” one of the former officials said. “It’s really just a source of frustration.” The former DHS officials said if the pandemic models had been maintained properly, the administration might have had an earlier understanding of where shortages might occur, and acted accordingly to address them. “A lot of what we’re doing now is shooting in the dark, and there’s going to be secondary impacts to infrastructure that are going to be felt in part because we didn’t maintain these models,” said one of the former DHS officials. “Our ability to potentially foresee where the impacts are or may manifest is a result of the fact that we don’t have the capabilities anymore.” The pandemic models emerged as part of a broader shift in the federal government’s thinking after Hurricane Katrina, when DHS and FEMA came under heavy criticism for their response to the disaster. With those searing lessons still fresh, DHS broadened its focus from a narrow set of issues -- primarily terrorist attacks within the United States -- to preventing and preparing for all types of emergency events. The department began modeling and analyzing how severe events, including a pandemic, could affect critical infrastructure and hit supply chains. Some of the predictions in the July 2015 DHS report were eerily prescient about the kinds of issues that the U.S. has faced in recent weeks because of the coronavirus; the report said that “a severe influenza pandemic could overwhelm the Healthcare and Public Health Sector in as little as 3-6 weeks” and warned that healthcare facilities in cities could be swamped. The report also warned that basic medical supplies for emergency services could be at risk because they’re dependent on “just-in-time” deliveries of healthcare supplies, and a big increase in demand during a pandemic would make it harder for them to get what they need. Much of the blame for the switch in focus at DHS, according to two of the former officials, falls on longtime DHS employee Robert Hanson, who became division director of prioritization and modeling at the department’s Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis (OCIA) in May 2016. When he was elevated to that job, Hanson wanted to focus more on visualizations of events like hurricanes and “going down rabbit holes that really didn’t need to be done,” according to one of the former officials. He also wanted to focus more on elections and cybersecurity because “cyber is the magic word to attract money,” said the other former official.  “They’ve allowed a lot of capability to decay, including the pandemic models and transportation models and a whole bunch of other stuff in favor of chasing the soccer ball on different cyber things,” including trying to use machine learning and AI in work on cybersecurity, this person said. In an interview, Hanson acknowledged decreasing some funding away from pandemic modeling to other topics of research because he had “been given direction by my leadership at the time to reprioritize a lot of the projects,” and he agreed it was necessary. He also said that when he took over the modeling program, it was considered “ineffective” by DHS leadership and by executive branch overseers.  Hanson thought, too, that pandemic modeling was best done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the former DHS officials said, although the CDC’s mandate is different and researchers there don’t focus on how a pandemic could affect non-health related infrastructure. After an uprising by staff last year who complained about what they called his abusive management style and lack of leadership, Hanson was removed as the assistant director of analysis at the National Risk Management Center, OCIA’s successor organization, according to the two former DHS officials. Hanson and his deputy, Carmen Zapata, were detailed elsewhere within DHS. Explaining his departure, Hanson said he “had made such fundamental changes to the program that some of the staff were unhappy with me and were going to see me as an object of ire so I decided to leave.”  NISAC, the DHS office that oversaw the models, began as a partnership between the Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories back in 1999 but was folded in 2003 into DHS by the USA Patriot Act and in 2014 put under OCIA, which has listed analyzing “pandemic influenza” as a top priority. The program’s costs were not inconsiderable: The government had to regularly purchase data sets to keep the models current, while also paying for coding, operations and maintenance, along with the original development costs. Between six and 10 people at Los Alamos were focused on pandemics and a total of 60 to 70 people at both DHS and the national labs had some role in the models, according to one of the former officials. Beginning under the George W. Bush administration, all critical infrastructure in the U.S. was segregated into different categories, which now comprise 16 sectors. DHS was made a lead agency for 10 of them, including IT, communications, critical manufacturing and commercial facilities. The DHS models were designed to look at the impacts of a pandemic on the different sectors within the department’s bailiwick, as well as other sectors that touched on homeland security. For instance, one report that NISAC worked on for a table-top exercise looked at how to combat a hypothetical epidemic in Southeast Asia, what travel restrictions to put in place, and how to design social distancing to stop the epidemic inside the United States. The simulations the modeling unit produced also helped the department understand the impact a pandemic might have on its own workforce. More than 9,700 DHS employees are quarantined or self-monitoring because of the virus, and 73 employees were confirmed or presumed COVID-19 positive as of Monday, according to a person familiar with the numbers. The modeling unit’s work also addressed real-life impacts to infrastructure due to smaller-scale outbreaks, including the H5N1 bird flu in 2007, H1N1 in 2009, Ebola in 2014 and the Zika virus in early 2016. During the Ebola outbreak, the Obama White House asked the unit to support its decision-making on deliberations about banning travel from certain countries based on risk, whether to close any borders and how to spend money on airport screening, according to one of the former DHS officials. Reports based on the models were usually emailed to DHS leadership and sometimes officials in the White House. There were also about 20,000 people on the distribution list, including a wide group of critical infrastructure owner-operators and state officials. Some of the papers ran to 150 pages. It wouldn’t be easy for DHS to rebuild its capacity to model pandemics, given the brain drain within the department: Many of the people who worked on the models have now scattered across the government or left government service altogether, one of the former officials said.  “There’s no institutional memory whatsoever,” this person said. NISAC was “really, really good” about studying the impacts of pandemics, a former Trump official said, but there’s been “so much turnover that people just don’t know that [their work] exists and there’s been very poor work to catalogue and keep lessons learned.” Hanson insisted that DHS maintained the capability at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and that the system is still being used today by DHS to inform decisions on the coronavirus across the federal government, but he couldn’t recall the full name of the PNNL staffer he said was in charge of the model now. Meanwhile, current officials are left essentially to reinvent the wheel in the middle of a pandemic that has already claimed more than 600 American lives.  Bob Kolasky, the director of the National Risk Management Center, OCIA’s successor organization within DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, recently told employees to write a plan for how to respond to the virus by early this week, but some employees aren’t confident that any plan they come up with will actually be used, according to one of the former DHS officials. Asked for comment, Kolasky said that his division of DHS “has been out front and actively working with partners to provide guidance as they make risk-based decisions during the COVID 19 response. The National Risk Management Center continues to use NISAC, along with other government and private sector resources, to provide valuable insight and assessments to our stakeholders.” “I’ve heard people say it’s a black swan. It’s not a black swan,” said one of the former DHS officials. “This is the whitest of white swans. This was absolutely inevitable, and the fact is we didn’t even maintain the capacity that we had or even the records of what we had done so that information could be quickly located and turned over to people who are making the critical operations right now.” Betsy Woodruff Swan contributed to this report.",DHS wound down pandemic models before coronavirus struck,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/dhs-pandemic-coronavirus-146884,politico
"States have enacted a wide range of policies in an effort to ""flatten the curve"" and address the economic effects of the novel coronavirus. While all 50 states have declared states of emergency, giving governors emergency powers, the policy response from states has been wide-ranging.  We tracked seven metrics using data from the Kaiser Family Foundation to pull apart the differences in how states are responding to the outbreak. Five of the statewide metrics are aimed at mitigating the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, such as closing all nonessential business. Two metrics track health policy enacted by the states, including paid sick leave for affected workers. California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have initiated the most comprehensive policies. They've closed all bars and restaurants except for takeout and delivery, banned all gatherings, ordered mandatory statewide quarantine, closed all nonessential businesses, and closed all schools. California and Washington have also enacted paid sick leave for workers. Mississippi and Oklahoma are on the other end of the spectrum. Neither has instituted social restrictions outside closing schools. Many states have limited the operations of dining establishments to prevent the spread of the disease among crowds, requiring bars and restaurants to either shift to takeout-only operations or close down entirely. Though the development of a coronavirus vaccine is likely more than a year away, many states have already enacted policies dictating that the vaccine be provided to all residents for free. Lawmakers pushing for this argue the high cost of vaccinating the population for free pales in comparison to the cost of failing to do so and having the virus resurge in the future.  Many states have banned large gatherings to slow the spread of the virus, but there is wide variation on what constitutes a “large gathering.” As the crisis has worsened over the past few weeks, states have brought down the size of allowed gatherings from 1,000 to 250 to 50 to just 10.  States hardest hit by the virus have implemented broad mandatory quarantine orders, also referred to as “shelter in place” or “stay at home” policies. Though the policies vary between states, residents are generally instructed to stay at home unless going out for essential activities, such as grocery shopping.  Many states have ordered all business deemed nonessential to temporarily close, while those like grocery stores, pharmacies and hospitals that must continue operating need to implement strict safety guidelines for workers. States have differed on whether abortion clinics and gun stores, among other businesses, should be deemed essential.  A handful of mainly progressive states have enacted laws expanding paid sick leave for workers who contract coronavirus or who must care for a loved one who becomes infected. Before the outbreak, many workers had little or no guaranteed paid leave, including millions of people in the gig economy.  Nearly every state in the nation has closed its schools out of fear that large groups of children would become petri dishes for the virus. The move has, however, created other problems, as many low-income children depend on free school meals and many parents who have to continue going to work or work from home now have to care for their children.

"The three states that President Donald Trump has formally declared coronavirus disaster areas have not received the disaster unemployment assistance that they expected to follow that designation. New York, California and Washington state all requested access to several aid programs provided under a disaster declaration, including disaster unemployment assistance. Disaster unemployment assistance allows workers who aren't eligible for traditional unemployment benefits, like Uber drivers and other gig economy workers, to receive 26 weeks' unemployment benefits if their job loss is attributable to a disaster that eliminates their job or keeps them from reaching their job site. To receive disaster employment assistance, a state must be declared a disaster area by the president. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which, in conjunction with the Labor Department, manages the program that disburses disaster unemployment assistance, said that ""federal emergency aid has been made available"" when the president issued the three ""major disaster"" declarations on March 20 for New York and March 22 for California and Washington state. But the disaster unemployment benefits, arguably the most crucial funds freed up by a disaster declaration, were not made available, even as Goldman Sachs estimated that jobless claims nationwide rose last week by more than 2 million, ""a roughly ninefold increase over the pre-virus level."" The Labor Department will release its tally for the week ending March 21 on Thursday. The only aid the Trump administration has yet released as a result of the three disaster declarations is for “crisis counseling.” Funds made available through a disaster declaration require separate approval, and are released at the discretion of the executive branch. A senior administration official said the administration is holding off on approving requests for disaster unemployment assistance because it anticipates Congress will provide similar protections in the coronavirus stimulus package under negotiation. Under the GOP’s proposed version of the package, workers ineligible for traditional state-funded unemployment benefits, including self-employed workers, could receive aid from a newly created temporary Pandemic Unemployment Assistance fund. The states' request to access aid programs offered under the disaster declaration, including the disaster unemployment benefits, ""remain under review at this time,"" a FEMA spokesperson told POLITICO. New York filed its request to be declared a major disaster area on March 16, Washington on March 19 and California on March 22. Texas requested a disaster declaration Monday. “We appreciate that the federal government has recognized the severity of the public health emergency,” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said in a prepared statement. But that declaration did not ""unlock many forms of federal assistance we have requested to help workers,"" the Democratic governor said, including the disaster unemployment funds. ""It is time for the federal government to provide Disaster Unemployment Assistance to New Yorkers,"" agreed Jack Sterne, a spokesperson for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in a prepared statement. But the senior Trump official said the issue “would have already been addressed” if Democrats “hadn’t airdropped in and made insane demands not related to Covid-19” by moving forward with their own stimulus proposal and blocking several procedural votes to advance the Republicans' package. Lawmakers were expected to announce an agreement on a bipartisan proposal Tuesday. Hoping to clear bureaucratic obstacles to releasing disaster unemployment assistance, Inslee wrote Trump yesterday urging him to free up the funds and either to move faster to declare additional states disaster areas or to work ""with Congress to make this funding available."" Govs. Mike Dunleavy (R-Alaska), Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) and J.B. Pritzker (D.-Ill.) also signed the letter. The governors noted that disaster unemployment assistance was designed, under the 1974 law that created it, specifically to help workers who can't otherwise tap unemployment benefits, including independent contractors and people who haven't worked long enough in their present jobs to qualify for unemployment benefits. ""Even as states enact policies to flexibly provide unemployment insurance to those in need,"" wrote the four governors, ""we are still leaving many hourly and independent workers behind who desperately need assistance during this crisis.” Earlier this month, Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) introduced the Coronavirus Worker Relief Act to ensure that individuals out of work due to the coronavirus be eligible for disaster unemployment funds. DOL did not respond to a request for comment.",Trump hasn’t yet released disaster unemployment funds,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/trump-disaster-unemployment-funds-147404,politico
"The Federal Reserve has been thrust into the lead role of saving the U.S. economy from the coronavirus pandemic, taking on the extraordinary task of rescuing households, businesses and local governments as Washington lawmakers have spent weeks debating how to come to grips with the crisis. In just over a week, the Fed has slashed its main borrowing rate to zero, pledged unlimited purchases of U.S. government bonds, announced plans to back state and local governments, and even promised to buy debt from large corporations. It has said it will set up a program to lend to small businesses and eased pressure on rates for student loans, auto loans and credit card debt. All told, the support for the economy will easily total trillions of dollars, with more plans in the works. The calls for the Fed to lend to all corners of the economy are striking given Congress’s move just 10 years ago to restrict its emergency lending authority after the last economic meltdown because its power was deemed too far-reaching. But officials inside the Fed — and even critics of the central bank — say that given the magnitude of the crisis, it had little choice to but to launch a stunning array of initiatives to help soften the blow of a recession or even to stave off a years-long depression. “I am a Fed skeptic. I want to limit their power,” said Sheila Bair, who helped lead the country through the last financial crisis as head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. But the “sheer magnitude of the problem,” she said, “justifies them really stretching the limits of their authority.” Thus, the Fed under Chair Jerome Powell, which has endured more than a year of abuse from President Donald Trump for not doing more to boost the economy, is now embarked on the quickest and most massive response to a crisis in its more than 100-year history. Unlike in the 2008 crisis, when the Fed sparked an outcry for bailing out nonbanks like insurance giant AIG and investment bank Bear Stearns, it now has formal buy-in from the Treasury Department for many of its emergency programs. Thanks to the landmark 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has to authorize the central bank to lend to such non-bank companies in emergencies, and his department has kicked in taxpayer money to cover losses if borrowers default. The stimulus package that Congress is on the brink of approving will vastly expand the amount of cash available to cushion those losses. But, unlike the controversial 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program, the scope of lending will be larger than just appropriated funds. Because Treasury has been supplying 10 percent of the funding for Fed emergency lending programs, $425 billion from Treasury could translate to more than $4 trillion in lending to businesses, consumers, local governments, and money market mutual funds. “They opened up the channels, and when the Treasury gets more money, they’ll be able to scale up these programs,” former Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said. But the Fed will still be under a microscope as it implements these programs, especially in lending to large corporations. The central bank, seeking to head off criticism from lawmakers, has already said companies will face restrictions on buying back their own stock — which boosts share prices and disproportionately benefits wealthier stockholders — and on CEO bonuses. The Fed will also be bringing in private-sector financial firms to help administer the programs, a potential line of attack it could face down the road; the central bank has already hired asset manager BlackRock for that purpose. Still, the amount of help that is directly targeted at consumers and small businesses will soften the criticism of moves to help larger firms, said Amanda Fischer, a former Democratic congressional aide who now directs policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. She said the Fed is usually inclined to support markets rather than people directly. “Now we see cracks” in that approach as the central bank broadens its focus to also embrace Main Street, she added. That's partly because of the sheer scale of this crisis and pressure it is getting from even Republicans, including Trump, to do more, Fischer said. Many free-market Republicans, who have balked at the central bank for its large footprint in the past, are sounding a different note now. Prominent GOP lawmakers like Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) have pushed for the Fed to do more to support businesses during this crisis. The central bank’s bond holdings are ballooning in the midst of the pandemic, a topic that has also sparked complaints from Republicans in the past. Its massive purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities will over the course of a week equal its second round of asset purchases in the wake of the 2008 crisis, which took place over seven months. That’s part of an effort to keep the key markets for U.S. government debt and mortgages, as well as all the markets that those assets feed into, from freezing up. All these unprecedented moves could transform how the public views the Fed’s role in downturns, although support for similar actions in the future “will depend a lot on where the crisis begins and who’s paying the price,” said Kohn, the former Fed official. Bair said conversations about the Fed’s role should be put on hold in recognition of just how broad the economic damage could be. She added that because the Fed prints money and controls the rails of the payments system, using it as a medium for bolstering the economy is the quickest option. “They’re a very efficient transmission mechanism,” she said of the central bank. “If you think of them as more of administrators as opposed to a piggy bank, that might be a better way of looking at it.” Still, there are limits to what the Fed can do; one of the ways the central bank has historically sought to protect its authority is by keeping its goals relatively narrow and noncontroversial. For example, it has declined to outright purchase debt from cities and governments. Glenn Hubbard, dean emeritus at Columbia Business School and former chief economist to President George W. Bush, said Congress needs to act to do its part, including sending money directly to people, which the Fed doesn't have the authority to do. As for the Fed’s actions: ""Any time you get into something that has any risk, you’re going to have political concerns about the Fed, but the Fed is a lender of last resort,” he said. “It’s the right thing to do.”",Fed breaks the bank in bid to rescue economy,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/federal-reserve-coronavirus-147342,politico
"The coronavirus pandemic is deepening the divide on abortion access between blue and red states by sparking a debate over whether the procedure is medically essential. Anti-abortion forces led by Republican governors in Ohio, Texas and Mississippi are citing the critical shortage of medical supplies in trying to close abortion clinics, in some instances threatening jail time if they don't shut down and donate protective gear and other necessities to local hospitals. Meanwhile, in blue states like New York, Washington and New Jersey, governors are deeming abortion and family planning clinics an essential service that can continue during the pandemic. The moves come against the backdrop of a wave of tough new abortion laws passed by conservative states in recent years that virtually ban the procedure — which coincides with a broader push to convince the Supreme Court to reevaluate abortion rights. Legislatures in Kentucky and Idaho, for example, are continuing to advance new abortion curbs, even during the pandemic. The leaders of Ohio, Texas and Mississippi say their orders will help preserve scarce medical gear for hospitals facing a surge of new coronavirus cases. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has characterized the policy as mainly a “deterrent” to encourage people to stay at home and slow the virus’ spread, adding he was not looking to make arrests, while Texas is threatening fines of $1,000 or 180 days in jail for any doctor continuing to perform elective abortions. Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves told reporters Tuesday that his office would take unspecified actions against the state's one remaining abortion clinic if it does not comply. ""We'll take whatever action we need to to protect not only the lives of unborn children, but also the lives of anyone who may contract this particular virus,"" he said. Powerful anti-abortion groups allied with the Trump administration are also advocating for a federal shutdown order, arguing the clinics are pulling resources away from “legitimate health care providers.” On Tuesday, the Susan B. Anthony List and other conservative groups wrote to HHS Secretary Alex Azar urging him to use ""emergency authority"" to make the clinics close and donate their supplies to nearby hospitals. ""While we are in a hectic race to save lives, Planned Parenthood and other powers in the abortion industry remain insistent on taking the lives of innocent unborn children,"" the letter reads. Clinics in Texas and Ohio say they will defy the orders and continue to see patients, arguing that women who need an abortion can’t live with a weeks or months-long delay. “Emergency actions during a global pandemic should advance health and safety for us all, not force people to delay much-needed care and possibly exacerbate their health situations by doing so,” said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the President of Whole Woman’s Health and Whole Woman’s Health Alliance, which operates three Texas clinics and has facilities in other states. Progressive states that have implemented broad orders shutting down businesses during the pandemic, such as Washington, have clarified that they consider abortion and family planning clinics an essential service that can continue during the pandemic. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy was one of a handful of Democratic leaders to explicitly carve out an exception for “the full range of family planning services and procedures, including terminations of pregnancies” from his executive order that suspends elective surgeries. Meanwhile in New York, clinics are working to expand access to medication abortion. Planned Parenthood is conducting more assessments over its telehealth platform so eligible patients only have to come to centers to pick up medication, as is required by law. The reproductive health organization is building out capacity to avoid having too many people in a waiting room. “We feel we have a critical responsibility to patients and staff to be part of flattening the curve without shifting our care,“ said Laura McQuade, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater New York. She added the centers are also preparing for an influx of patients seeking surgical abortions as hospital beds are taken up by coronavirus patients. Long before the pandemic hit, the ability to obtain an abortion, particularly for low-income women, already varied widely by state, with access virtually out of reach in many parts of the country. Ohio, Texas and Mississippi have been some of the most aggressive states in passing laws to restrict access to the procedure and strip funding from clinics. While federal courts have found many such efforts violated Roe v. Wade, narrower laws have taken effect, such as one in Texas requiring that patients must have a counseling session that includes a sonogram 24 hours before the procedure with the same doctor performing the abortion. NARAL Pro-Choice Texas is one of several groups calling on states to waive some abortion restrictions so that women can more easily take an abortion pill at home without physically traveling multiple times to a clinic as they currently must — a requirement they argue puts both patients and doctors at greater risk of exposure to the coronavirus. “State leaders should ensure that Texans who need care can access it with the least amount of obstacles and medically unnecessary visits possible,” said the group’s executive director, Aimee Arrambide. The realities of the pandemic could further limit access while putting legal fights over abortion rights in limbo. Travel restrictions may ground abortion providers who live in coronavirus hot spots like New York, Washington state and California who previously made regular trips to serve regions with few, if any, providers. The economic hardship unleashed by the pandemic could also make it harder for working-class people to afford travel to a clinic and the cost of the procedure. And with many courts suspending proceedings during the pandemic, any lawsuit challenging states’ moves to close clinics could be put on hold indefinitely. The Texas order on abortion clinics, outlined on Monday, sets a monthlong ban on elective procedures, including any abortions that are not not “medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.” Nearly half of the state’s abortion clinics closed between 2012 and 2016 amid a wave of state laws targeting their funding and operation. Ohio's ""stay at home"" order, which lasts until April 6, appears less stringent, without specific penalties for violations. Yet it did single out abortion clinics with targeted letters to the state's providers, even as businesses including gun stores and marijuana dispensaries were deemed essential and allowed to remain open. The state has passed some of the country’s most sweeping abortion bills in recent years, including a ban on all abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected that hasn't taken effect amid court challenges. The Ohio attorney general’s office told POLITICO Tuesday morning that it had not yet received any reports of violations from the Department of Health about the clinics. Still, with the scope of enforcement not yet known, progressive lawmakers and abortion rights groups warn the new orders will cause widespread harm by eliminating what little access to abortion remains. “There is potential for a lot of unintended consequences,” said Texas Democratic state Rep. Donna Howard, including forcing a woman into ""having a pregnancy continue with severe fetal abnormalities.” Howard said she’s speaking with reproductive rights lawyers who are trying to parse the attorney general’s statement to better understand the possible consequences. Elisabeth Smith, the chief counsel of state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the organization is prepared to bring legal challenges if needed, even if most court hearings are currently suspended. ""In many states, there is still access to the court for emergency issues,"" she said. ""Obviously, a determination that abortion is prohibited in a state would fall into that category."" In the meantime, Ohio’s abortion providers, both those that are part of Planned Parenthood’s network and independent clinics, insist they are in full compliance and that they aren't yet contemplating legal challenges. Cleveland’s Preterm clinic told POLITICO it's adhering to the directive to “stop providing non-essential surgeries and procedures and take other steps to reduce the use of equipment in short supply.” Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio says staff at its four clinics are ""doing our part to conserve needed resources and to protect the health and safety of our patients and staff.” Some states are still working out how abortion fits into broader prohibitions on elective procedures. On Monday, Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan appeared to suggest that he was labeling abortion clinics nonessential when he issued a statewide “stay-at-home” order, responding to a reporter’s question about abortions by saying: “We included in our directive an order to limit all elective surgeries ... because we need to free up beds for the things that are going to save people’s lives.” Hogan’s office later clarified to POLITICO that abortion providers would be allowed to remain open during the pandemic.",Pandemic sparks new front in abortion wars,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/pandemic-new-front-abortion-wars-147315,politico
"Anyone who recently traveled from the New York City metro area should self-quarantine for 14 days from the time they left due to the high coronavirus infection rate in the city, members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force said Tuesday. “Everyone who was in New York should be self-quarantined for the next 14 days to ensure the virus doesn't spread to others, no matter where they have gone,” coronavirus task force coordinator Deborah Birx told reporters. The move comes after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday that passengers flying from New York would be subject to mandatory isolation for two weeks to slow the spread of the virus. It is critical people adhere to the federal government's request so New York City does not become “another seeding point” for the rest of the country, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “The idea, if you look at the statistics, it's disturbing, about one per 1,000 of these individuals are infected,” Fauci said. “That’s about eight to ten times more than in other areas. Which means when they go to another place, for their own safety, they have got to be careful, monitor themselves.” More than 14,700 confirmed coronavirus cases have been detected in New York City and 131 people have died, the city said Tuesday morning. Over 2,200 people are hospitalized, including at least 525 in intensive care units. Vice President Mike Pence encouraged people who were recently in New York City to monitor their temperature and other symptoms closely. “We have to deal with the New York City metropolitan area as a high-risk area, and for that reason we are taking these steps and asking for the cooperation of the American people,” Pence said.

"First came the National Education Association. Then the United Food and Commercial Workers. The American Federation of Teachers came next, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees followed.  Joe Biden has racked up endorsements from four of the largest — and most politically influential — unions in the past 10 days, a show of force that has bolstered his standing as the de facto Democratic nominee for president and dealt a serious blow to Bernie Sanders’ flickering hopes. “Bernie has a real decision to make,” AFT President Randi Weingarten said without explicitly calling on Sanders to drop out. “I’m optimistic that Bernie always finds a way to meet the moment, and I’m optimistic he’ll meet the moment here. It’s obvious to me Joe Biden has earned this,” Weingarten said. She credited the Vermont senator for his positive tone in campaigning and efforts to pass an economic stimulus package in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The coalescing of major labor support — including three of the four large public employee unions — behind Biden came as the latest blow to Sanders, a union ally whose progressive campaign is built around helping working people. Absent an unforeseen turn of events, Sanders has little realistic hope of overcoming Biden’s sizable lead in the race for enough delegates to clinch the nomination. Sanders, however, isn’t ready to quit. On Tuesday, Sanders’ campaign touted its organizing efforts “in the ramp up to the New York primary” on April 28. His campaign also told The New York Times it plans to participate in the Democratic presidential debate in April, if one is held.  But Sanders is refraining from taking shots at Biden, and he’s using his campaign and Senate offices to raise awareness of and funds for the response to the coronavirus. Asked about Sanders' decision to stay in the race, Biden told CNN on Tuesday: “That’s his decision. And I've been asked that question, as you recall, about all of the other folks who were in the primary before — all of whom have dropped out. I think with one exception [all of them] formally endorsed me. That’s a decision for them to make, not for me to make.” The last of the large public unions, Service Employees International Union, hasn’t yet endorsed. But according to SEIU officials, it’s not because of a division in their ranks or a fear of weighing in; it’s because the coronavirus is requiring it to focus on the safety of its members, many of whom work in health care, custodial, child care and building-security services. The AFL-CIO also has not yet endorsed, which is relatively common in presidential primaries, meaning the past four major endorsements Biden landed are likely the last to come in the race. “Certainly, it’s a signal to Bernie Sanders that progressives and the Democratic Party are consolidating behind Joe Biden’s candidacy,” said Steve Rosenthal, a top national union consultant and former political director for AFL-CIO. “These endorsements are extremely significant and come at an important time when three of the most progressive organizations — because NEA, AFT and AFSCME are not just labor unions, they’re three of the most progressive organizations in the United States — decide to weigh in,” Rosenthal said. Rosenthal said the endorsements should have a tangible benefit for Biden in the general election in the union-heavy swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Minnesota. A poll in those states conducted for a Democratic group in December showed that 68 percent of former union members and voters who model unionlike characteristics viewed unions favorably and 67 percent saw unions as a viable source of information about candidates and political topics. Rosenthal pointed out that all of the unions revamped their endorsement processes to ensure they wouldn’t be accused of misrepresenting their support, a charge leveled by some backers of Sanders in his 2016 Democratic bid against Hillary Clinton. The NEA said it’s looking forward to the general election. “With so much at stake in this election, educators are now focused on November, where as a union, we have the ability to reach voters in a meaningful way, unlike any other organization. We will be organizing and using our collective voice to propel Joe Biden to the White House,” Lily Eskelsen García, NEA president, said in a statement. NEA kicked off the wave of endorsements on March 14, three days before the last round of states voted and made Biden the presumptive nominee. After that, AFT, AFSCME and the food and commercial workers unions were ready to endorse. But they decided to hold off to see what happened in the March 17 elections. Weingarten said one major factor in delaying the endorsement process was input from members in Florida, where Biden went on to crush Sanders by about 40 percentage points. Three days later, she said, support for Biden over Sanders among members was 2-1. It was a huge shift from its Feb. 20 decision, reflecting the divided membership, to issue a triple endorsement of sorts, backing Biden, Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. “We saw a tectonic shift in the March primaries, as did everybody else, in terms of Democrats coalescing behind Biden as well as our own members,” Weingarten said.",‘Bernie has a real decision to make’: Labor throws in with Biden,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/biden-labor-primary-unions-147115,politico
"BRUSSELS — Finance ministers fell short of agreement Tuesday night on an EU-wide strategy to fight an economic slump caused by the coronavirus. Ministers met by videoconference to discuss further EU measures, sought by some governments to reassure investors and others that the bloc would find a common response to the virus shutting down economic activity. Southern European countries had hoped ministers would agree on new credit lines from the eurozone’s bailout fund or creating special EU “corona bonds” to fund the economic fight. Countries including the Netherlands and Germany resisted the ideas. “We still need more work, this was the conclusion of this evening,” Mário Centeno of Portugal told reporters after chairing the meeting. “The mandate that we get from [leaders] is absolutely key to the next steps.” The deadlock will push those questions to leaders of the EU governments, who are planning a summit meeting by videoconference on Thursday. Compared to the corona bonds idea, many countries preferred the option of opening credit lines from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), Centeno said — although nothing has been agreed. ESM chief Klaus Regling said there was support for an idea of credit lines that could support 2 percent of a eurozone country’s economic output and would come with conditions on how governments could use the money. “But it [would be] up to every member state to decide whether they want to apply for it or not,” he said.",European Union finance ministers deadlock on coronavirus economic strategy,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/european-union-finance-ministers-deadlock-on-coronavirus-economic-strategy-147143,politico
"Former Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump over the president’s declaration he wants to restart the economy in a matter of weeks — over objections from health experts — advising Trump to “just stop talking.”  In a series of cable news hits Tuesday afternoon from a makeshift studio in his Delaware home’s basement, Biden, who appears likely to become the Democratic nominee for president, repeatedly implored his would-be rival to heed the advice of his coronavirus task force and keep social distancing efforts in place to ""flatten the curve"" of individuals infected by the virus. “I would like to open the government tomorrow if it were possible,” Biden said in an interview on MSNBC. But, he continued, “Let's be realistic. This curve is going up and up and up because we did not act when we should have acted.”  Medical experts are in agreement that social distancing is critical to preventing further spread of the virus, which has infected more than 50,000 people in the U.S. and killed more than 600. Nearly every state has issued some combination of orders to close schools and nonessential businesses or directed residents to shelter in place. Trump has recently become impatient with the federal guidance for Americans to hunker down, citing the dire impact on the economy. But epidemiologists have warned that it's still too soon to allow parts of the country to return to business as usual, arguing that if there's a resurgence of infections it could cause even greater economic damage.  On Tuesday, an alternately heated and emotional Biden contended that if Trump wants to get the economy moving again by loosening the guidance, he will do so at his own risk. ""If you want to ruin the economy for a long, long, long time, let's go ahead and see this thing continue by having it burst out again and so we haven't even flattened the curve out,"" Biden said. ""I know you know this,” he told MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace. “I apologize but it's frustrating to hear this president speak. He should stop talking. Let the experts speak.”  Trump has come under fire more than once during the coronavirus crisis for getting out in front of scientific experts, hyping unproven drugs as potential miracle cures and understating the speed at which a vaccine will become available — and then being gently corrected by the members of his coronavirus task force. Biden applauded the health experts Trump has surrounded himself with — notably Dr. Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Trump, he said, should heed their recommendations when deciding when to loosen social distancing guidance — something the president refused to commit to doing in a news briefing the night before. “Listen to Dr. Fauci. [Trump]'s not a scientist. Let the scientists speak. Let them lay out the facts as they know them,” Biden urged Trump. “Let's lay out what happened in other countries as we know it. This is not unique to the United States of America.” The former vice president also called on Trump to act like the “wartime president” he has declared himself to be, asking Trump to summon the full power of the Defense Production Act so that the federal government can direct manufacturers to begin making the medical supplies hospitals are now scrounging to acquire. Biden stressed that he realized the outbreak, which originated in China, was not the president’s fault, but he argued that Trump had wasted valuable time downplaying the virus when he could have been preparing for it to hit the U.S. While Trump has frequently boasted about various travel bans he put in place to prevent foreigners from bringing the virus in with them, his administration has been under fire for its stumbles in providing access to widespread testing materials for the illness and a reluctance to address a patchwork of social distancing restrictions from state to state.",'He should stop talking': Biden implores Trump to listen to his scientists ,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/biden-implores-trump-listen-scientists-146824,politico
"The shortage of supplies for front-line health workers is so severe in her district that Rep. Elissa Slotkin has started texting sewing patterns of DIY face masks to embroidery companies. In between, she’s calling nonstop the governor's staff, hospitals and state leaders to seek help for her constituents from the coronavirus pandemic. And she’s doing it all from her family’s farm in Holly, Mich. “The military would call this ‘discovery learning,’” said the freshman Democrat and former CIA analyst, who said she is spending as much as 13 or 14 hours a day on the phone. Slotkin has also held as many digital events as possible, including a virtual summit for 200 small-business owners, a conference call with 300 bankers and a teletown hall that drew 6,000 people. As the outbreak threatens to overwhelm the nation, more than 400 House members are working to combat a mammoth crisis almost entirely from their living rooms — sometimes enduring the same daily indignities, like botched conference calls, that millions of other Americans are experiencing while  working from home. “A lot of us are doing very different jobs than we did two weeks ago,” Slotkin added in an interview.  Members of the House have spent the past 12 days mostly hunkered down around coffee tables and countertops as they grapple with the mounting caseloads of coronavirus in their districts and the rapidly deteriorating economy. That includes most of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's leadership team, which drafted a 1,443-page rescue package remotely in just a matter of days. “Our dining room table is now kind of command central,” said Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who has spent the recess holding teleconference after teleconference, including one with Sen. Tina Smith, a fellow Minnesota Democrat, that drew thousands of attendees.   The experience, according to lawmakers and aides, has been more than just replacing Congress’ ritual of in-person meetings with conference calls. It’s a radical shift for a governing body built on face-to-face interactions, particularly for senior members who are accustomed to being surrounded by staff and followed around the Capitol by reporters.  And it’s an enormous challenge, technologically, for an institution that’s largely stuck in the 20th century. Members are still handed pagers after they’re sworn in, and most staff aren’t trained in secure video-conferencing, let alone how to conduct a thousand-person teletown hall. Rep. Max Rose — a platoon leader in Afghanistan before he came to Congress last year — has turned his home in New York City into a one-man war room amid the epicenter of the national outbreak. On Staten Island alone, where Rose lives, the number of cases soared to 935 on Tuesday.  Over the past week, the freshman Democrat helped secure New York City’s first testing site in his district and pushed the White House and state officials to speed up procedural steps, such as approval from the Food and Drug Administration. “We are building the plane as we fly it,” Rose said. Last week, Rose went out and visited the testing site, where he and others have been helping recruit former or retired health care workers to sign up for shifts. He’s also stepped up public outreach, dialing in to a local Fox station as he sought to reassure his district: “Now we’re at war with a virus, not an army,” he told the anchor.   The fight has gotten particularly close to home for several members who have been quarantined after possible exposure. Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), who ended his quarantine over the weekend, has been taking part in a stream of conference calls local TV appearances and even co-teaching an online class at a local university.  Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) used a videoconferencing system to appear on CNN while quarantining at home, discussing his failed attempt to get a test from the House physician’s office to learn whether he had the virus. Beyer has shown no symptoms of the virus and will hold a virtual town hall on Tuesday.  It doesn’t all go off without a hitch: On a Friday teleconference call with the Congressional Black Caucus, Chairwoman Karen Bass (D-Calif.), had to adapt on the fly when she was told other speakers weren’t on the call.  But it’s a particularly important task for first-term lawmakers, who are overseeing resources and communication for their districts as they make their first attempts at reelection — particularly now that the response to the virus is likely to dominate their campaigns.  Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) took a virtual tour of the Virginia Commonwealth University hospital system and spoke with administrators via video call. Rep. Kim Schrier (D-Wash.), a pediatrician, announced a Facebook Live event in which she and her young son will take questions from kids about the coronavirus outbreak. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) hosted a virtual storytime on Instagram in which she and her stepdaughter read “The Story of Coretta Scott King.”  It’s unclear when the House will return to Washington. Pelosi and her leadership team have said members won’t be called back until there is a fully negotiated stimulus package ready for a vote, though there is also hope that the House would be able to pass a bipartisan Senate deal by unanimous consent. That would spare lawmakers from having to cram into the House chamber this week for a roll call vote to deliver relief to the public.  Dozens of lawmakers in both chambers — including nearly 70 House Democrats — have also called on House and Senate leadership to consider remote voting at a time when the nation’s public health experts have discouraged gatherings of more than 20 people.   But other lawmakers, including Slotkin and members of leadership, have warned that such a dramatic change to congressional rules would be unlikely, if not impossible, in such a short time frame. That means lawmakers will eventually have to return to the House — with some, like Rose, already vowing to drive instead of taking the usual train or flight.  Phillips, a Minnesota Democrat, said the forced isolation was “strangely accommodating” for his job at this moment, which consists of a lot of phone calls but zero hours of fundraising or lengthy flights to Washington.  “There’s a silver lining in this,” he said. “It’s fair to say I’m communicating with more constituents, more broadly and more deeply, right now, than I’ve been able to in a year and a half in Congress.”  What is harder — Phillips said, after taking part in several days of nonstop calls with his colleagues — is legislating from afar.   “Deliberating is damn hard when 435 members are spread out in every nook and cranny in the country,” he said.",The House works from home,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/house-work-from-home-coronavirus-congress-144948,politico
"The Trump administration has stopped seizing the wages, tax refunds and Social Security benefits of people who are in default on their federal student loans, an administration official confirmed to POLITICO on Tuesday. The Education Department is putting a stop to collecting on defaulted federal student loans amid the coronavirus pandemic and ordering private collection firms to stop pursuing borrowers “until further notice,"" according to the official and a memo sent to the companies. The department plans to make the policy retroactive to March 13, the day President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, the official said. The new executive actions, which the Trump administration is expected to announce this week, provide a reprieve for the more than 9 million federal student loan borrowers who are in default on their debt. Borrowers default on those loans by failing to make a payment for roughly a year. The decision to halt the debt collection comes as congressional Democrats, labor unions and consumer advocacy groups urged Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to hit pause during the pandemic on the sweeping powers that the federal government has to pursue borrowers. Department officials have ordered the private companies it hires to collect defaulted loans to immediately stop calling borrowers, sending collection notices or taking steps to seize portions of their paychecks, according to a memo viewed by POLITICO. “Private Collection Agencies shall cease all Administrative Wage Garnishment efforts,” a department official wrote in the message to the industry last week. The department’s restrictions, which still permit the collection companies to accept incoming calls from borrowers, are to remain in place “until further notice,” the message said. The Education Department also plans to stop referring defaulted student loan accounts to the Treasury Department, which is responsible for executing the seizure of borrowers’ tax refunds and other federal benefits like Social Security payments. The executive actions by the Trump administration come as Democrats and Republicans in Congress are fighting over how far the student debt relief provisions of the massive $2 trillion economic rescue package should go. House Democrats’ massive stimulus proposal released on Monday would have forced the Education Department to suspend involuntary collections on federal student loans. The Senate bill would require the department to halt all monthly payments for six months, though it doesn’t explicitly reference the collection of defaulted loans. GOP senators have argued that the six-month postponement provides adequate relief to borrowers during the coronavirus emergency, while Democrats are pushing to include at least $10,000 in debt cancellation for each loan borrower. The Trump administration has already set the interest rates on all federally held student loans at zero percent and created a new forbearance option for any borrower who wants to pause payments for at least two months. Most borrowers have to request that option from their loan servicer, though the Education Department said it was automatically applying the benefit to borrowers who are already more than a month delinquent on their loans.",DeVos halts collection of defaulted federal student loans,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/exclusive-devos-halts-collection-of-defaulted-federal-student-loans-146929,politico
"President Donald Trump’s vow Tuesday that he would “love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,” less than three weeks from now, was the clearest signal yet of the political logic he hopes to follow in a presidential campaign shadowed by global pandemic. He is eager to own the only good thing about a crisis that has paralyzed the country and left millions of people in housebound despair: The reality that life will at some point slowly lurch back to normal. He is determined to make other people—specifically, governors and public health officials—own everything else, including the reality that massive shutdowns will continue long after the Christian holy day on April 12. Trump’s Monday evening briefing at the White House and his remarks this afternoon at a “virtual townhall” hosted in the Rose Garden represented a new chapter in audacity from a president who has already authored volumes on the theme.  His pledges about a return “much sooner than expected,” as he put it Monday, to a functioning economy, in which people can return to work and schools and the familiar rituals of consumer culture, is in defiance of what health experts in his own administration say will likely be necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prevent hospitals from being overrun. It is in defiance, too, of closures of schools and businesses that governors in both parties have already ordered beyond April 12. Increasingly, though, it has become clear that the gap between Trump’s optimism and impatience and the caution and gravity of other figures in the crisis is exactly the point, in political terms.  It reflects his reading of the power dynamics of this crisis. The one thing he has complete authority over is the words that come from his own mouth. Other people, especially governors, can assume the legal authority over closures and public sacrifice that flows from them.  This appraisal reflects a narrow view of presidential power, especially from someone who is often perceived as trying to expand the prerogatives of his office. No concern about federalism likely would stop a president who wanted the responsibility from leading a consistent nationwide response in concert with state and local officials, who would be hard-pressed to stand in defiance of a national plan.  But it has become clear that when it comes to coronavirus Trump does not want this responsibility. He says governors are free to navigate the situation in their state; he’s also free to second-guess any decision they make that he doesn’t like. In the Fox News session, for example, Trump took shots at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has pleaded with the administration for help in getting more ventilators to the state, currently the county’s epicenter of COVID-19 and nearing the limits of its capacity to help stricken patients. He referred to unsupported allegations from former New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey that in 2015 Cuomo had turned down a chance to increase the state’s ventilator stockpile. “I’m not blaming him or anything else, but he shouldn’t be talking about us,” Trump told Fox’s Bill Hemmer. “He’s supposed to be buying his own ventilators.” Later in the session, when Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House’s coronavirus task force said New York City’s problems are exacerbated by its density, Trump interjected, “Do you blame the governor for that?” Birx didn’t answer her boss’s question. Cumulatively, Trump’s appearances in recent days have offered an answer on the briefly in-doubt question of whether a pandemic would force alteration of Trump’s basic rally-his-partisans, blame-his-adversaries political style. The answer: no. In a televised Oval Office speech on March 11, Trump implored: “We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify together as one nation and one family.” Now, he has signaled that the country may be in the pandemic together—“parts of our country are very lightly affected,” he said Monday—but the response will be guided by conflicting voices. He said at that briefing if it were “up to the doctors” they would say “let’s keep it shut down” across the world “for a couple years.” Whatever the element of political calculation, the Rose Garden appearance also made clear that Trump is also genuinely frustrated by the dictates of health experts that the more extensive the shutdown the greater the effectiveness—no matter the associated human and economic cost.  “We lose much more than that to automobile accidents,” Trump said. “We don't call up the automobile companies and say stop making cars. We have to get back to work.” COVID-19 has so far killed under 700 people in the United States, compared to just under 39,000 auto fatalities in 2019. But disease experts say if uncontained COVID-19 could kill hundreds of thousands in the United States. While Trump’s handling of the crisis has drawn fierce criticism from many quarters—particularly his downplaying of the severity in January and February and bogus prediction that cases would soon be “down to zero”—there is evidence that general public appraisals are more generous. The Gallup organization Tuesday released a poll showing 49 percent job approval for Trump, tied for his highest ever.  “Trump's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic may be behind his higher overall approval rating,” Gallup said, in announcing the data. “Americans give the president generally positive reviews for his handling of the situation, with 60% approving and 38% disapproving. Ninety-four percent of Republicans, 60% of independents and 27% of Democrats approve of his response.” The polling organization also noted that presidents typically see approval ratings rise amid crisis at home or abroad, but the gains usually prove perishable.",Trump bets that voters are as impatient as he is,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/trump-voters-impatient-coronavirus-shutdowns-146770,politico
"In a Monday evening briefing, President Donald Trump stupefied the White House press corps and the nation with a dramatic about-face decision. He said he was ready to overrule the advice of administration doctors like Anthony Fauci, scientists, public health officials and others about tamping down the coronavirus pandemic by maintaining social distancing and keeping businesses shuttered. Then he kept going on Tuesday: “We have to go back to work, much sooner than people thought,” Trump said during a Fox News Channel interview, adding that he was looking toward Easter, April 12.  Arguing that the economy could not endure an extended lockdown, Trump said on Monday that we “cannot” let the cure be worse than the problem itself.” He added that when the 15-day period of social distancing he originally ordered expired on March 30, he would make a decision about “essentially reopening the country.” Trump floated this balloon even though the speed with which the contagion is ripping through the U.S. population rivals what Italy, Iran, France and other exposed developed countries have experienced. Should Trump execute this move, the spike in cases could deluge hospitals well beyond their capacity and push the U.S. death toll beyond the 2.2 million predicted in the widely cited Imperial College coronavirus model. To fill the streets with sick people, overload the hospitals with patients it can’t treat, and feed the cemeteries with a bumper crop of corpses will only damage the economy more than the current containment policies, say the health professionals. What on earth is the president doing? One possibility is that he’s not really serious about lifting the restrictions, and is just blowing hot air to make sure the stock markets don’t get scared downward any further. Trump is known for his short-term thinking, responding to even complex issues with improvised day-to-day or minute-by-minute antics. Maybe that’s what’s happening here, too. But maybe he’s serious. If so, here’s a modest proposal: As an example to his followers, Trump and his entire White House team can go first. To really boost confidence, Trump could go big and bold, temporarily relocating White House operations and personnel to the hottest coronavirus spot in the country, New York City, and relax restrictions in a place where all can see. He could move his Resolute desk into his Trump Tower office and could instruct his White House staff to take the elevator down at lunchtime to patronize food carts and restaurants, take the subway and buses to work, and play pick-up games of basketball.  To further demonstrate his sincerity, Trump should also order his entire family to break out of their life-support cocoons to take jobs as cashiers, deliverymen, nursing home janitors, bus drivers, EMT assistants and other positions that require regular contact with potentially infected people. Of course, Trump won’t do any such thing. He’s a germaphobe whose prize possession is his family. But his love of family makes it fair to ask why he seems so eager to sacrifice other people’s families while offering no corresponding sacrifice of his own. (Is he really advocating getting-coronavirus-to-own-the libs?) There’s also something exploitative about how he has relied on his loyal followers at Fox News Channel to downplay the danger of the coronavirus outbreak. Fox, whose virus commentaries were cavalier until recent days, obviously knew better weeks ago. Even as Fox anchors were dismissing the virus as an unnecessary panic, the people who own and control the network were acting differently. As the New York Times columnist Ben Smith reported Tuesday, the big 89th birthday party planned for Fox chairman Rupert Murdoch was canceled on March 8 because such a large gathering posed a threat to his health.  To be fair to Trump, he isn’t the only one talking about lifting restrictions. America’s shadow president, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who, unlike Trump, has been serving accurate medical information in his pressers, likewise conceded on Monday that the economy can’t remain on shutdown forever. But heeding scientific advice instead of rejecting, Cuomo doesn’t anticipate opening the window for many weeks or months, favoring the “surgical” approach of restarting parts of the economy in stages while protecting the vulnerable.  If Trump were to conduct a coronavirus experiment on himself, he wouldn’t be the first medical thinker to expose himself to danger to prove a theory. There’s a long tradition of self-experimentation by doctors and researchers who have made themselves guinea pigs. If Trump is as medically savvy as he claimed to be while touring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta earlier this month—“I like this stuff. I really get it,” he said—and it’s as epidemiologically sound as he makes it out to be to abandon the current restrictions, Trump can show us the way. All we should request in return is his promise to refuse a ventilatior should he get sick enough to need one.

"PARIS — France's strict confinement measures meant to reduce the spread of coronavirus could last longer than the 15-day lockdown originally announced, according to Health Minister Olivier Véran. ""As long as [the lockdown] will be necessary, it will last,"" Véran told reporters Tuesday, adding that no decision had been officially taken yet to extend it. ""We'll only be able to stop confinement when the epidemic curve allows it."" The health minister's comments come after the country's Council of Scientists advisory group formally recommended a six-week lockdown. The group of 11 experts has been working closely with President Emmanuel Macron and his ministers to help shape policies since the beginning of the crisis. Macron announced a nationwide lockdown for at least 15 days last week in an effort to step up the country's fight against the virus. On Monday, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced that stricter confinement rules would be necessary and would go into effect on Tuesday to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The country had reported more than 22,300 cases as of Tuesday, with 1,100 deaths. The Paris region and the eastern region of Alsace are the most impacted. More than 10,000 people are hospitalized, and 2,516 are in intensive care.",Health minister: French lockdown could last longer than 15 days,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/france-lockdown-health-minister-146666,politico
"Top Trump administration officials on Tuesday signaled that they were already laying the groundwork to restart the U.S. economy amid the coronavirus pandemic — a tremendous task that President Donald Trump revealed he would like to accomplish by mid-April. “I’d love to have it open by Easter, OK? I would love to have it open by Easter. I will tell you that right now,” Trump said from the White House Rose Garden, where he and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force participated in a virtual town hall on Fox News. “It’s such an important day for other reasons, but I’ll make it an important day for this, too,” he added. “I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.” Trump’s remarks came just hours after Vice President Mike Pence told conservative leaders on a private call that White House aides were discussing ways to encourage businesses to reopen and healthy Americans to return to work at the end of the current 15-day period of recommended social distancing, during which administration officials have asked Americans to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people and stay home as much as possible. The shifting message could set Trump on a collision course with health officials inside his administration, who have warned that resuming business as usual could worsen conditions by accelerating the spread of the coronavirus. Those experts are still searching for answers regarding the severity of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and whether patients who recover from it become immune. Senior administration officials, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, have shared concerns about the urgency of reopening the economy after hearing from a number of industry executives in recent days, while officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and some Republican lawmakers have advised the president to keep his focus on containing the threat — a mission that becomes more difficult if Americans return to work, they say. Pence said on Tuesday that the president had no plans to overrule social-distancing guidance that state and local officials have issued to their residents, but that he was interested in softening federal guidelines in order to recharge the economy, according to five participants on the call. “The vice president was clear in this call they’re not going to undermine governors and the decisions they are making, but he said the president wants to get the country back to work,” said Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots and one of more than two dozen conservative leaders who spoke with Pence on Tuesday morning. Trump’s eagerness to bring an end to strict preventative measures he imposed last Monday bubbled up over the weekend as he consulted with outside allies and top economic aides, many of whom warned him that the unemployment rate could reach 30 percent in the second quarter of 2020 if businesses remain shuttered. CDC guidelines, as well as more severe directives from state and local authorities, have already thrust the U.S. economy into a severe recession as Americans remain largely confined to their homes and large corporations and small businesses shed employees. “THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM!” Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning prior to his appearance on Fox News, echoing a view that has gained traction among White House allies. Some conservative leaders, for instance, warned Pence that prolonged closures and layoffs could do more to damage the health of American workers and business owners than the coronavirus itself. “There’s stress, there’s anxiety. People can wind up having a heart attack, committing suicide, turning to drug use. There are a lot of unintended consequences when people move into economic distress,” Martin said, noting that she and others voiced these concerns during their conversation with the vice president. So far, the administration has declined to specify what guidance, if any, the federal government might issue or roll back to bridge the 13-day gap between the end of the administration’s 15 Days to Slow the Spread initiative, which wraps up at the end of the weekend, and Easter, which falls on April 12. “There weren’t specifics,” Kristan Hawkins, head of the anti-abortion group Students for Life, said of the conference call with Pence, adding that she was worried about the infection rate of COVID-19 and the potential risks of lifting social-distancing guidelines prematurely. “I’m not going to even feel personally comfortable lifting my own self-quarantine until we start seeing more data and some of these experimental treatments are proven to be effective,” Hawkins said. “I think there are going to [be] people like me who, for a long time, are going to be wary of being in crowds — of being on airplanes.” Trump, meanwhile, asserted on Fox News that it would be “absolutely possible” to begin to resurrect the economy by Easter, while cautioning that Americans going back to their jobs next month would have to continue practicing “all of the things that we’re doing now” — including social distancing in the workplace, frequent hand washing and avoiding shaking hands. “We have to get our country back to work. Our country wants to be back at work,” Trump said, claiming without evidence that more people would die as a result of the economic consequences of social-distancing measures than the number who would perish if Americans reentered the workforce. He also said the mental health implications of prolonged social distancing would prove dire, and warned that the U.S. would suffer “suicides by the thousands.” Still, in a White House news briefing with the coronavirus task force on Tuesday, the president sprinkled in several caveats to soften his earlier proclamations. “Rest assured, every decision we make is grounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens. This is a medical crisis. This isn’t a financial crisis,” Trump said.  “So we’re going to look at it, we will only do it if it’s good, and maybe we do sections of the country, we do large sections of the country,” he continued, adding that he would confer with the task force members.  But Trump expressed confidence that the mid-April date would work out, suggesting Easter could even overshoot the necessary duration of social distancing. “I would love to see it come even sooner,” he explained, “but I think that would just be a beautiful timeline.” At the White House briefing, Trump’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, appeared to temper expectations, stressing that the president’s timeline was “very flexible.” “We just had a conversation with the president in the Oval Office talking about, you can look at a date but you’ve got to be very flexible,” he said. “On literally a day-by-day, week-by-week basis, you need to evaluate the feasibility of what you are trying to do.” Asked what kind of data points would inform a recommendation to loosen social-distancing guidelines, Fauci argued that the ensuing weeks would allow health experts to more closely examine testing data in areas without an “obvious outbreak.” “Is there something underneath the surface that says, wait a minute, you better be careful and really clamp down? Or, looks there that you don’t have to be as harsh as you are in other areas?” he said, pointing to the recent surge of testing capability as critical to that effort. “So, it’s looking at information that up to this point we never had.” Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, seemed less enthusiastic regarding the president’s proposed Easter end date, and declined to directly answer whether such a deadline was realistic. Birx instead emphasized the importance of employing “21st century solutions” and collecting data at the “most granular level” to better understand the rampant spread of COVID-19. “That’s what the president has asked us to put together: to use these two weeks to get all the data from around the country and all the data from around the globe and really understand what’s working,” she told Fox News, adding that “every American needs to continue the president’s guidelines for these next six days or seven days. We have to have them following those guidelines.” Pence also made a forceful case for Americans to keep heeding the federal guidance until at least the conclusion of the 15-day period, listing the administration’s recommendations in the final minutes of Fox News’ broadcast. “These are all the principles that every American can do,” he said. “Now, there are going to be Americans that have different guidance from their state and local officials that are more stringent. We defer to that. We respect that. But the more Americans that do this, the sooner that we’ll be able, as the president said, to get back to work.” Defending his rationale for reopening the economy, Trump repeatedly invoked deadly flu seasons in the U.S., remarking that the fatalities produced by that illness do not shut down the nation’s normal operations in the way the coronavirus has. “Thirty-six thousand deaths a year ... but we’ve never closed down the country for the flu,” the president said. “So you say to yourself, what is this all about?” Of course, flu season began months ago, and its death toll is largely predictable. The coronavirus, which is much more infectious than the flu, has only recently started tearing across the country, and could result in hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths. Trump’s new push to promptly wind down social distancing breaks with the advice of public health experts who have been urging greater governmental action, not less, in the race to “flatten the curve” of cases and prevent communities from confronting the kind of crisis unfolding in New York — the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S. Without tested treatments or a newly developed vaccine, limited person-to-person contact remains the best recipe for slowing the coronavirus’ spread, even if it won’t halt the disease’s transmission entirely. Several health officials have predicted that the need for social distancing could last until late spring, not just two or three more weeks. But the Easter cutoff does offer the administration extra time to intensify mitigation efforts and plan whatever steps Trump decides to take next. It is also possible that as the outbreak worsens, the president’s relatively rosy assessment of the likely cost to American lives will grow grimmer. On Tuesday, though, Trump appeared as focused on the practicalities of reopening the economy by Easter Sunday as he was on the cultural significance of the date itself, which he called a “very special day for me.” “You’ll have packed churches all over our country,” Trump told Fox News. “I think it would be a beautiful time, and it’s just about the timeline that I think is right.” In his appearance on the network, the president also appeared at times preoccupied with past and present political battles while discussing the administration’s war against the pandemic. When pressed on the CDC’s far-from-perfect initial testing operation for the coronavirus, Trump was quick to point to the scandal that ensnared his presidency and resulted in his impeachment by the House of Representatives in December. “What I said is perfect was my conversation with the head of the Ukraine,” he said. “That’s what I really said is perfect, OK? That was another whole scandal, nonsense. A total, you know, witch hunt.” And when Birx posited that the heightened rates of COVID-19 infection in New York could have been exacerbated by a large number of people returning to the state from Asia after the Christmas holiday, the president interrupted her. “Do you blame the governor for that?” Trump said with a smirk, needling his sometime political foil Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.",‘I’d love to have it open by Easter’: Trump says he wants to restart economy by mid-April,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/trump-wants-to-restart-economy-by-mid-april-146398,politico
"A federal judge has resoundingly rejected a bid by former personal Trump attorney Michael Cohen to be released early from his three-year prison sentence. Cohen has been seeking a sentence reduction since last year, arguing prosecutors were refusing to accept his cooperation because doing so would implicate President Donald Trump in crimes. The former Trump fixer also made a series of entreaties to Congress to try to bolster his credibility as a whistleblower and lighten his sentence, most famously at a widely viewed House hearing in February 2019. More recently, Cohen’s attorney argued his client was at risk because of the coronavirus outbreak. District Judge William Pauley on Tuesday turned down the request and gave Cohen a tongue-lashing for refusing to come to terms with the gravity of the tax fraud, campaign finance and false statement charges Cohen pleaded guilty to about a year and a half ago.  “Ten months into his prison term, it’s time that Cohen accept the consequences of his criminal convictions for serious crimes that had far reaching institutional harms,” Pauley wrote in a two-page order. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 in separate cases brought by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan and special counsel Robert Mueller's team.  One of the cases included run-of-the-mill tax evasion charges as well as more spectacular allegations that Cohen orchestrated illegal campaign contributions in 2016 by arranging payments of hush money to two women to suppress stories about alleged sexual affairs with Trump. The president has denied the affairs. In the other case, Cohen admitted to making false statements to Congress in a bid to minimize Trump’s involvement in a real estate development project in Russia at the height of the 2016 campaign. Trump dismissed Cohen’s admissions as lies designed to win favorable treatment from prosecutors. “He's lying, very simply, to get a reduced sentence,” Trump said in November 2018. In the new ruling, Pauley said only prosecutors can make a motion to shorten a sentence under the provision Cohen cited. The judge, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, also scoffed at Cohen’s suggestion that he’d been useful to investigators. “Cohen made material and false statements in his post-sentencing proffer sessions,” Pauley wrote. “Unable to articulate how he advanced any investigation or prosecution, Cohen and his surrogates make extravagant allegations that the Department of Justice — from the Attorney General down to line prosecutors — acted in bad faith. Those ad hominem attacks lack any substance and do not trigger the right to a remedy or a hearing before this Court.” Pauley also dismissed Cohen’s claim of virus-related danger as yet another effort to worm his way into the headlines. “That Cohen would seek to single himself out for release to home confinement appears to be just another effort to inject himself into the news cycle,” the judge wrote. Cohen is serving his sentence at a minimum-security federal prison camp in Otisville, N.Y., about 70 miles north of Manhattan. He reported to prison in May 2019 and — with credit for “good time” — is scheduled for release in November 2021, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",'Accept the consequences': Court rejects Michael Cohen’s plea to reduce sentence,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/court-rejects-michael-cohens-plea-to-cut-short-sentence-146359,politico
"UPDATE:  Lawmakers and the Trump administration reached an agreement on a nearly $2 trillion coronavirus emergency rescue package, a move intended to assist businesses and millions of Americans amid an unprecedented halt in the economy.  The announcement caps five days of tense negotiations between senators and the White House. Both the Senate and House still need to approve the bill before sending it to President Donald Trump for his signature.  ORIGINAL STORY: Congressional and Trump administration negotiators signaled Tuesday that they are on track to clinch a bipartisan agreement on a nearly $2 trillion emergency stimulus package, though the timeline for final passage has likely slipped. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are still expected to announce an agreement later Tuesday night under immense pressure from President Donald Trump, a dire economic outlook and the growing number of Americans losing their livelihoods amid the crisis.  While senators may not vote until Wednesday — despite initial hopes that the chamber could wrap things up by Tuesday evening — negotiators may be eager to at least announce a ""deal in principle"" before the markets open back up. The Senate’s lead negotiators — Mnuchin, Schumer, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland — have spent most of Tuesday huddling behind closed doors as they finalized policy details and legislative text.  “The timeline is as soon as possible,” Ueland said leaving a more than hourlong meeting with McConnell, Mnuchin and a half-dozen GOP senators who have been heavily involved in the rescue package.  “We’re trying to finalize all the documents, going through a lot of complicated issues, and we're making a lot of progress,” Mnuchin said, flanked by Rep. Mark Meadows, who was recently tapped as Trump’s next chief of staff. Yet as the negotiations dragged on, Republican senators began to grow impatient and called on the president to step back from the negotiating table. ""Pass the damn bill. Enough already!"" tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump's top allies. Schumer took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to declare that senators were “on the 2-yard line” and said there were no remaining disagreements that couldn’t be resolved over the next few hours. “There are lots of good things here,” Schumer said. “In the last few days, we have made huge progress in achieving these goals.” On the other side of the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was also projecting confidence that a deal could be clinched on Tuesday. Pelosi, who is working from Washington while the vast majority of the House remains in their districts for recess, said she hopes to get unanimous consent on the bill — an agreement that would not only allow swift passage, but would also keep worried lawmakers away from the Capitol, where the virus has started spreading. “I think there is real optimism that we could get something done in the next few hours,” she said during an interview on CNBC, saying Senate Democrats did a “great job” in the negotiations. Hours later, Pelosi told MSNBC that negotiators were “in the red zone,” in her latest of several media appearances on Tuesday as she sought to promote her own members’ priorities.  But Democratic and Republican leaders in the House don’t yet know whether it would be possible to muscle through a sweeping $2 trillion bill without a single objection from any of the chamber’s 430 lawmakers. In fact, the House GOP's whip team held a conference call Tuesday evening where they acknowledged that there's a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement, according to a whip team source. But passing the rescue package by voice vote is another viable option and being discussed with the GOP conference, the source added. Privately, many lawmakers say they don’t want to return to the House, which would risk further spreading the virus either while traveling to Washington or in the Capitol itself. Three members of Congress, including two House lawmakers, have tested positive for the coronavirus, as well as several staffers.  It would be nearly unprecedented, however, for the House to unanimously approve a package that large, with massive implications for nearly every sector of the economy. Several lawmakers, including freshman firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), have telegraphed at least some concerns with the latest version of the Senate talks.  House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told Democrats on a conference call Tuesday afternoon that he would prefer to vote by unanimous consent, but still doesn’t have timing on when a vote would be, according to people familiar with the discussions on the call. Hoyer also said Congress would take up at least one more economic package to respond to the crisis, possibly appeasing some in the caucus who are pushing for still more in the current bill.  Pelosi added that she is still waiting to see final details on two issues — food stamps and pension shortfalls — and continues to watch out for potential GOP poison pills. Still, the sudden burst of productivity between Senate negotiators — with both sides declaring they have moved beyond partisan politics — is a welcome shift from Monday, when a breakdown in talks and two failed procedural votes led to raucous exchanges and bitter sniping on the Senate floor. Stocks soared as trading closed Tuesday afternoon, with the Dow Jones Industrial average surging more than 2,000 points, as investors eye an imminent deal. “Today we can make all of the Washington drama fade away,” McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday morning. One of the biggest question marks — like in all must-pass bills that require buy-in from both parties — is Trump. Trump has sent mixed signals over whether he would support the deal, taking to Twitter on Monday night to harangue Democrats over their demands, but pushing for an immediate vote by Tuesday morning. “Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!” Trump tweeted. Mnuchin, who has been running point on the negotiations with Schumer, said he was actively keeping the president in the loop. At one point Tuesday morning, Mnuchin said he had spoken with Trump twice already. Much of the in-person negotiations have taken place between Schumer and Mnuchin, who met in person six times on Monday with the final meeting wrapping up around midnight.  By Tuesday afternoon, the biggest sticking points involved the food stamps program, a state stabilization fund and airline relief, according to lawmakers and other negotiators involved in the talks.  But Ueland said he would not characterize any of those issues “as a snag,” when asked about the food stamps program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.  “We are just working through each issue as they arise and trying to find a resolution,” Ueland said. One of the biggest problems from Monday has already been resolved, according to Democrats. Schumer said he extracted a key concession from Mnuchin: strict oversight over a $500 billion fund designed to lend money to corporations that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, according to three sources. Democrats had criticized the initial proposal as a “slush fund” that provided no mechanisms for accountability and allowed the Trump administration to withhold details about which companies received such loans. Schumer also told Senate Democrats on a conference call Tuesday afternoon that he was “confident” he had secured $150 billion for a state and local fund and $130 billion for hospitals as part of the negotiations with Mnuchin, according to a person familiar with the call. During her CNBC interview, Pelosi said the fund would be overseen by an inspector general and a congressional panel. And Schumer later said the bill includes “unemployment insurance on steroids,” giving Americans four months worth of their income if they are furloughed or lose their job. If the House tries to pass the rescue package unanimously, leadership could encounter roadblocks in either party: Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), members of the so-called progressive squad, have already raised concerns with the emerging deal.  “The developments of this Senate relief bill are concerning,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “It seems to give a *HALF TRILLION DOLLARS* away to big corporations, w/ few worker protections.” And in the GOP, some members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus have been notorious for grinding fast-moving spending bills to a halt; Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) threatened to hold up a package of corrections to another coronavirus relief bill just last week, though he eventually backed off. During the House GOP's whip team conference call, Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) emphasized to his colleagues that their best bet is to accept the Senate bill, given the progressive wish-list included in Pelosi's stimulus bill.

"The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it ultimately did not have to use the Defense Production Act to secure medical equipment needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic, reversing an announcement by the head of the agency on Tuesday morning. FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor had said earlier in the day that the Trump administration would formally implement the emergency measure to stock up on vital medical supplies. “So, just a little while ago, my team came in, and we’re actually going to use the DPA for first time today,” Gaynor told CNN. He said triggering the act would help access “about 60,000 test kits,” and added that the administration would insert “DPA language” into the mass contracts for the federal government’s order of 500 million personal protective masks. Gaynor later stressed on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” that the law would be used narrowly as “leverage.” But late Tuesday night, FEMA press secretary Lizzie Litzow changed coursed, writing: “At the last minute we were able to procure the test kits from the private market without evoking the DPA.” Federal delays in rolling out widespread testing have sparked criticism from state officials, who have said they are woefully underprepared to handle the unfurling outbreak. One testing kit serves roughly 300 to 400 patients. President Donald Trump last week invoked the DPA as the administration broadened its response to the public health crisis, but he has resisted actually activating the statute — insisting that governors bear more responsibility for obtaining potentially life-saving supplies and arguing that the private sector would pitch in to supply needed equipment voluntarily. Meanwhile, state authorities and health experts have called for more forceful federal intervention as they struggle to get their hands on ventilators, hospital beds and other necessities before health care systems are overwhelmed by the rapidly spreading outbreak. “Even the most conservative political theories recognize that governments do sometimes have to take directive actions and markets alone cannot solve these problems,” said Mildred Solomon, president of the bioethics-focused Hastings Center. Nearly 1,400 bioethicists and health leaders have signed a letter organized by Hastings demanding that Trump use the DPA and other federal powers to secure supplies and cover COVID-19 treatments. “It should be a war mentality, and the government should be the leader,” Solomon told POLITICO. When the federal government invokes the DPA, private manufacturers are required to fill federal orders for medical equipment before any other. But implementing the law does not do anything to increase production of these items, which increasingly are in short supply.  Even amid a push to expand the nation’s testing capacity, for instance, there are looming shortages of key materials needed to run tests. Trump has alternately said state officials have been given everything they need, particularly for testing, and that they need to provide some essential supplies — like protective masks — themselves. State leaders, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, have railed against the approach, urging the president to “do more.” Cuomo said on Sunday that his administration had overpaid to secure desperately needed masks. Trump referenced possible price gouging on necessary equipment in a Monday press conference, telling reporters, “We will not allow anyone to exploit Americans for profit.” Gaynor appeared to take a softer approach to invoking the act in his appearance on Fox News. “We ask every governor — if you can find it, buy it. We are ready to use the Defense Production Act,” he said. “If we need as it leverage, we have it as leverage now.” The FEMA chief told CNN that the administration “wanted to be thoughtful about not upsetting, you know, the balance,” and ensure that “we can get it out to the market and the federal government not consume it all.” Some American manufacturers have privately expressed concerns that it is more difficult to ramp up production of medical equipment without clear guidance from the federal government outlining what materials are needed — and where. But other manufacturers are moving forward with plans to begin churning out medical equipment even without federal orders. Bill Ford, the head of Ford Motor Company, said on Tuesday that his company is “going as fast as we can” to furnish medical supplies through four projects: working with GE to make ventilators; working with 3M to make air purifying respirators; and working in-house to 3-D print face shields and N95 masks. “We’re doing it on our own,” Ford told NBC News’ “Today” show. “Obviously, the White House has put a call out for companies to help, but frankly, we were doing this, getting all this in motion before that.” Though the president had pushed off invoking the DPA, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in late February that his department could use the measure to procure a range of necessary personal protective equipment.  “We’ve spoken of procuring at least 300 million N95 masks,” he told reporters last month, adding, “We need additional gowns — the Tyvek gowns, as well as gloves.” The president’s executive order directed Azar to work with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and other officials to determine top priorities and allocate resources. The Food and Drug Administration and HHS referred questions about the process to FEMA. The coronavirus crisis is not the first time the White House has struggled with the DPA. In 2018, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, backed by the coal industry, presented a plan to Trump that would have used the act and other emergency laws to force utilities to buy coal from struggling U.S. miners.  But the plan ran aground at the White House due to opposition from members of the National Security Council and National Economic Council, who questioned the move’s legality and impacts on electricity bills.

"President Donald Trump on Tuesday sought to signal that he and Dr. Anthony Fauci are on the same page when it comes to combating the rapid spread of the coronavirus in the United States — insisting that his relationship with the nation’s top infectious disease expert has “been very good” throughout the administration’s response to the global pandemic. The president’s latest stabs at a show of unity with Fauci come after a series of interviews, news reports and conspicuous absences have hinted at heightened frustration with the career public health official. Fauci, who has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for 3½ decades, has become one of the most widely recognized and respected faces of the federal government’s management of the novel coronavirus. On Tuesday morning, Trump seemed eager to reaffirm Fauci’s standing within the administration amid the latest bout of palace intrigue, thanking him for recent complimentary remarks and making light of a perceived slight by the NIAID chief. Trump first retweeted a short clip of Fauci’s appearance on conservative media personality Mark Levin’s Fox News talk show, during which Fauci described the president as an incessantly inquisitive leader who heeds scientific counsel. “Thank you Tony!” Trump wrote in an accompanying message. Less than a half-hour later, Trump even made reference on social media to Fauci’s meme-worthy “facepalm” at a White House coronavirus task force briefing on Friday, sharing a post by a Twitter user who declared, “Dr. Fauci is all of us.” The viral moment, which saw Fauci stifle a chuckle and apparently react dismissively to Trump’s branding of the State Department as the “Deep State Department,” was among the inciting incidents that have sparked new speculation regarding his status with the president.  In that same White House briefing last week and another news conference on Saturday, the two men offered conflicting assessments of possible pharmaceutical treatments for the coronavirus, with Trump striking an optimistic tone and Fauci emphasizing the need for further clinical trials. Then, in an interview with Science magazine published on Sunday, Fauci acknowledged the difficulties of fact-checking the commander in chief in real time, saying, “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down.” On Monday, The New York Times reported that Trump and some White House advisers’ patience with Fauci had “started to wear thin,” but noted that the president has afforded the doctor “more leeway to contradict him than he has other officials” given Fauci’s credibility among journalists and the broader public. But when Trump arrived hours later at the White House daily news briefing, Fauci — normally a regular presence at the televised sessions with reporters — was not by the president’s side. Although Trump and Vice President Mike Pence explained that Fauci was attending a meeting of the coronavirus task force, to many observers, his exclusion from the briefing represented yet another indication of the White House’s displeasure. As concerns continued to mount over the president’s opinion of Fauci and other government health experts, the White House opted to forgo its traditional task force briefing on Tuesday, with Trump instead partaking in a virtual coronavirus town hall on Fox News. Pence, White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx and Surgeon General Jerome Adams all participated, but Fauci did not appear “because he has other things to do,” Trump said.  The president reported that he and Fauci “get along very well,” and said he holds both Fauci and Birx in high regard. “I respect all of these people. These are great people. And Deborah is extraordinary, and Tony is extraordinary. I get along with all of them,” he said.  Despite that praise, Trump has demonstrated a greater willingness to break with the advice of public health experts by suggesting he might try to restart the American economy by Easter — April 12 — after the administration’s recommended 15-day period of social distancing. Asked on Monday whether Fauci, who has championed preventative measures throughout the federal response, sides with the president, Trump answered, in part, “He doesn’t not agree.” Fauci also attempted to deescalate tensions in an interview on Tuesday with a local Washington radio station, arguing that Trump is working to perform a “delicate balancing act” taking into account the dual threats to Americans’ safety and the nation’s financial welfare. “We’re under very intense discussions right now about what the most appropriate timeline is, and if we do modify it, how do we modify it,” he said. Fauci went on to criticize members of the media who he accused of seeking to drive a wedge between himself and the president by posing probing questions intended to expose their diverging views on matters of public health. He asserted that “fundamentally, at the core,” no such discrepancies exist, and called those lines of inquiry “really unfortunate.” “The idea of just pitting one against the other is just not helpful,” Fauci said. “I wish that would stop and we’d look ahead at the challenge we have to pull together to get over this thing.” Whispers aside, both Trump and Fauci appeared to be in good spirits when the doctor made his first appearance in the White House briefing room in days during a Tuesday evening news conference with members of the coronavirus task force.",Trump signals unity with Fauci amid talk of tension,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/donald-trump-anthony-fauci-coronavirus-tension-146035,politico
"Senate leaders and the Trump administration clinched a bipartisan deal early Wednesday morning on a nearly $2 trillion emergency relief package in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a move intended to assist businesses and millions of Americans amid an unprecedented halt in the U.S. economy. The announcement, which came around 1 a.m., capped five days of tense, marathon talks between senators and the White House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate will pass the bill later Wednesday, while House leaders are eyeing an expedited process to get the massive emergency package to President Donald Trump’s desk for signature before the end of the week. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who led the negotiations for the White House, were under intense pressure to reach an agreement before the financial markets opened back up on Wednesday morning, facing a dire economic outlook and a growing number of Americans losing their livelihoods amid the global crisis. In a show of unity, McConnell and Schumer announced the deal in a joint set of speeches from the Senate floor. But lawmakers and aides were still finalizing the text of the legislation, which is expected to be released later Wednesday morning, according to Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs chief. “In effect, this is a wartime level of investment into our nation,” McConnell said on the Senate floor just after 1:30 a.m. as he announced the deal. “The men and women of the greatest country on earth are going to defeat this coronavirus and reclaim our future.” The Senate’s lead negotiators — Mnuchin, Schumer, McConnell and Ueland — spent most of Tuesday huddling behind closed doors and shuttling between offices as they finalized policy details and legislative text. Rep. Mark Meadows, who was recently tapped as Trump’s next chief of staff, and a half-dozen GOP senators who were heavily involved in crafting the rescue package were also part of the in-person discussions. “After sleep-deprived nights and marathon negotiating sessions, we have a bipartisan agreement on the largest rescue package in American history,” Schumer said. “This bill is far from perfect, but we believe the language has been improved significantly to warrant its quick passage.” As the negotiations dragged late into Tuesday evening, some Republican senators began to grow impatient and called on the president to step back from the negotiating table — a sign of the tension that has bubbled up in the Senate in recent days as they struggled to break the impasse, and as one of their own, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), tested positive for the coronavirus. “Pass the damn bill. Enough already!” tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump’s top allies. After Schumer insisted that negotiators were “on the 2-yard line” Tuesday afternoon, he and his counterparts spent several hours finalizing the language and hammering out the remaining sticking points, which included everything from the structure of loans to the airline industry to details about an enhanced fund for state and local governments. Senate Democrats had been pushing for strict oversight of a $500 billion fund designed to lend money to corporations that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats had criticized the initial proposal as a “slush fund” that provided no mechanisms for accountability and allowed the Trump administration to withhold details about which companies received such loans.  One of the concessions Democrats said they won in the negotiations was an agreement that the pot of money will be overseen by an inspector general and a congressional panel. They also secured $150 billion for a state and local fund, $130 billion for hospitals, and beefed up unemployment insurance that will give Americans four months-worth of their income if they are furloughed or lose their job due to the coronavirus crisis, according to Schumer. The version of the massive rescue package that was initially unveiled by the GOP provides direct payments to qualified individuals and families with checks of up to $1,200 and $2,400, based on income, and allocates $367 billion in federally guaranteed loans for small businesses. The final product, according to McConnell, “will help secure our economic foundations and stabilize key national industries to prevent as many layoffs as possible.” On the other side of the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi — who is working from Washington while the vast majority of House members remain in their districts for recess — said she hopes to pass the Senate bill via unanimous consent of the chamber. Such an agreement would not only allow swift passage, but would also keep worried lawmakers away from the Capitol, where the virus has started spreading. But Democratic and Republican leaders in the House don’t yet know whether it would be possible to muscle through a sweeping $2 trillion bill without a single objection from any of the chamber’s 435 lawmakers. In fact, the House GOP's whip team held a conference call Tuesday evening where they acknowledged that there's a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement, according to a whip team source. But passing the rescue package by voice vote is another viable option and being discussed with the GOP conference, the source added. Privately, many lawmakers say they don’t want to return to the House, which would risk further spreading the virus either while traveling to Washington or within the Capitol itself. Three members of Congress, including two House lawmakers, have tested positive for the coronavirus, as well as several staffers. It would be nearly unprecedented, however, for the House to unanimously approve a package that large, with massive implications for nearly every sector of the economy. Several lawmakers, including freshman firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), have telegraphed at least some concerns with the latest version of the Senate talks. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told Democrats on a conference call Tuesday afternoon that he would prefer to vote by unanimous consent, but still doesn’t have timing on when a vote would be, according to people familiar with the discussions on the call. Hoyer also said Congress would take up at least one more economic package to respond to the crisis, possibly appeasing some in the caucus who are pushing for still more in the current bill.

"“THIS IS WHY WE NEED BORDERS!” Donald Trump tweeted on Monday morning. He offered no additional context, but it’s safe to assume the “this” in his tweet was the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. In recent months, his administration has taken progressive action to strengthen borders and travel controls in response to the virus. Trump isn’t alone: Leaders around the world have restricted nonessential travel to varying degrees, some sealing off their borders entirely, to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. They’re following a playbook centuries old, dating back to at least the Black Death of the 14th century. In fact, countering disease was one of the main justifications for early border controls at a time when boundaries between countries were marked more by contested territories than firm divisions. (It would not be until the 1600s that an atlas with delineated borders between European countries was published.) In the past, these measures may have worked. But the history of disease-driven border lockdowns has some sobering lessons. One is that border controls tended to long outlast whatever crisis they were supposed to prevent, at the expense of trade and free movement. And they’re also very much a relic of their times. More recent disease eradication efforts, and the broad path of the coronavirus itself, show that prolonged border controls are more an expression of xenophobic policy than an enduring solution to an infectious threat. Today, there’s far more to gain through international cooperation than by keeping borders locked down. A closer look at how governments successfully sealed off their countries in the past to prevent disease is enough to show that the scale of international travel and porousness of borders today is incompatible with such fixes long-term, and that similar impulses today will only take us further from real solutions. During the Black Death, the city-states of Italy used expanded border controls as part of their efforts to keep the plague at bay. Florence imposed fines on visitors from plague-affected cities and issued passes to travelers deemed healthy enough to move freely. In 1348, Venice began preventing ships in the harbor from docking for 30 days to see if those on board came down with the plague. Venetian colonies and others followed suit. By 1383, Marseilles, France, had extended the isolation period to 40 days, leading to the to the term “quarantine” (from the Italian for 40: “quaranta”). Italian states used systems of armed patrol ships, observation posts and horse patrols to enforce disease controls that lasted until the 1850s. The enforcement of that quarantine period was one of the earliest forms of regulating ship travel and was used during plague outbreaks for centuries afterward The infrastructure and regulation for those systems became permanent, such as the designation of particular ports of entry and patrols to make sure they were used. The last European outbreak of plague attacked Marseilles in 1720, the result of lax enforcement of a quarantine on a ship from plague-ridden Cyprus. After it subsided in Europe, the Black Death continued to ravage the Ottoman Empire. In the 1730s, Austria’s Sanitary Court Commission recommended a series of inspection stations along the border with Ottoman lands. People and goods were both quarantined, although practices and periods varied—tobacco leaves spread out and aired for seven days were considered purified, for example. Many travelers were held in quarantine for as long as 48 days, and if they developed plague symptoms, they could be shot. Similarly, evading the quarantine system was punishable by death. The system lasted until 1871.  Border controls against plague appeared to have helped—if you hold infected fleas and people in isolation for long enough, the fleas die and the people either die or get better. Certainly, the Austrian Empire remained free of plague after the middle of the 18th century. And, perhaps as a result, travel and trade restrictions became an increasingly popular tool against the threat of new infections. The United States quarantined ships to prevent the spread of yellow fever in the 1790s, a practice repeated during subsequent outbreaks into the 19th century, and France briefly closed the border with Spain to prevent the spread of the same disease. In the 19th century, a number of countries briefly imposed quarantines in an attempt to protect against cholera.  Those controls, short of total exclusion, proved an ineffective tool against both diseases, in part because yellow fever is mosquito-borne and in part because, by the mid-19th century, it was simply too difficult to implement a leak-proof system of inspection, control and quarantine at borders. But that did not stop continued adoption.  As we see today with a surge in anti-Asian discrimination, it is not just that disease is associated with international travel and migration; it is associated with foreigners. This, too, is nothing new: Jews were blamed for the Black Death and burned to death in pogroms. The Irish were blamed for bringing cholera to the United States and the Italians for spreading polio. Tuberculosis was called “the Jewish disease.” Syphilis, first recorded in Europe infecting the armies of Charles VIII as he was fighting in Naples, was referred to as the Naples Disease, the Spanish sickness, the French Pox, the German Sickness and the Polish sickness as it spread—the name based on a combination of local prejudice and the course of infection. When it got to the Middle East, it was called “the European pestilence.” Infection also became the justification for increasingly strict migration restrictions in countries, including in the United States. The Immigration Act of 1891, which provided a foundation for federal oversight of migration, banned criminals, polygamists, prostitutes, contract laborers and those with a “loathsome or contagious disease.” It was increasingly used to selectively exclude ethnic groups considered undesirable. Between 1898 and 1915, the proportion of immigrants denied access to the United States on medical grounds climbed from two percent to above two thirds. On the Mexican border, federal officials stripped migrants naked and showered them with kerosene. Some of America’s first undocumented immigrants were those who crossed unguarded sections of the Rio Grande rather than submit to the medical exam; up until that point, Mexican migrants hadn’t needed travel documents.  Infection as an excuse for nativism continues today. In 2014, Representative Phil Gingrey of Georgia wrote to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over disturbing “reports of illegal immigrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus, and tuberculosis.” The reports would have been considerably more concerning had they been accurate. That same year, Trump pushed for travel bans covering Africa to respond to the Ebola outbreak. And the last few weeks have seen Trump declare that wall-building would protect the United States from a disease far more prevalent here than in Mexico, while battling to rename COVID-19 the “Chinese virus.” But the evidence continues to mount that in a world of massive cross-border flows of people, border controls and travel bans simply aren’t an effective tool to keep infections at bay—not in the long term. Effective pandemic response takes the fight to the pandemic; it doesn’t wait for the pandemic to reach us. We know that from the most successful campaign against infection in history: the global fight against of smallpox. Led by the World Health Organization, that worldwide effort involved cooperation between Cold War rivals the United States and the USSR to provide vaccines, equipment and technical advice to teams across the globe who monitored for outbreaks and responded with an immediate “ring vaccination” of contacts to limit the disease’s spread. The result: Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980, and a disease that killed hundreds of millions of people in the last century has killed no one so far in the new millennium. Certainly at this point in the COVID-19 outbreak, few people should be going to an airport or getting on a plane at a time when we’re trying to limit social contact. But after the immediate crisis of this pandemic has abated, the United States should be leading an effort to strengthen global capacity to respond to outbreaks. And there is a long way to go: In 2013, out of 193 member countries, the WHO found only 80 met the International Health Regulations with regard to core capacities required for hazard alert and response to disease outbreaks that might become pandemic. The U.S. Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future estimates that $4.5 billion a year would buy strengthened national health systems, international coordination and funding for research and development, and financing for coordination that would address some of the most urgent weaknesses in global health security. That number pales in significance compared to the multi-trillion dollar price tag already attached to the economic disruption triggered by COVID-19. For all the Trump administration has begun to take the coronavirus pandemic with the seriousness it deserves, the response has been slow and parochial. By the time a global pandemic threatens again, America should be part of a coordinated worldwide response that reduces the risk of outbreak, tackles outbreaks that do occur where they emerge, and cooperates on global response from vaccine production to cure research. Because in the long run, borders—and certainly walls—simply don’t stop viruses.",Pandemics Close Borders—And Keep them Closed,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-borders-history-plague-146788,politico
"A major outbreak of the coronavirus among air traffic controllers could threaten much of the U.S. aviation system's efficiency, revealing weaknesses in the Federal Aviation Administration's contingency plans. FAA personnel at air traffic control facilities from Las Vegas to New York have tested positive in the last week, prompting closures while the buildings were cleaned. The majority of the almost one dozen facilities affected so far have been towers at airports, but two of the incidents have been at centers responsible for controlling airspace over multiple states. Though the airports themselves remained open, buildings had to be closed temporarily and control duties taken over by another facility, creating delays even in this depressed environment for flights. A cascade of more cases spreading throughout the controller community, especially if it hits several facilities in one region at the same time, could be crippling. The FAA has contingency plans in place for just this sort of issue -- which were updated as recently as this month -- but no amount of contingency planning could anticipate a system affected by virus hot spots across the country. Sandy Murdock, who was chief counsel for the FAA during the Reagan administration, noted, however, that the agency was able to handle the air traffic controller strike in 1981 as well as a fire at a major center near Chicago in 2014. ""It’s going to take a pretty good whack"" to majorly disrupt traffic, Murdock said. But ""if all of those little red circles on the map get larger and larger and larger, it’s going to be very hard. ... I think we'll get to a point where you may see a 10 percent nationwide reduction or point-to-point reduction. And after you go through that for a while, then you may see a system failure."" However, the drop in demand for air travel will ""reduce the pressure to have the same level of operations,"" Murdock added. ""So there may be supply and demand offsetting each other equally for basically the same reason -- sick people in the control towers and people not getting into the airplanes."" One air traffic controller who works at a large facility in the D.C. area said the system will start to show strain if a major center has to be closed for several weeks, or if two centers in the same region are shut down at the same time. Such disruptions would be mitigated by fewer planes being in the sky, but the controller said as of Friday he hadn’t yet seen air traffic decline by much, even though airline bookings have fallen dramatically. “Our air traffic system is resilient and flexible,” the FAA said in a statement, noting that all facilities have contingency plans to “keep air traffic moving safely when events impede normal operations. In some cases, this means transferring duties to adjacent facilities.” “Each disruption has a distinct impact on the air traffic system,” the agency added. “We are experiencing this at the handful of facilities already affected by COVID-19. This is frustrating and inconvenient, but is necessary in the interest of safety.” Mike Perrone, the president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, a union that represents FAA technical employees, said he thought the FAA was slow at first in reacting to the outbreak. “They were slow to get to the dance, I mean as was, I think, the government in general,” Perrone said in an interview with POLITICO on Friday. “They were trying to just … follow regulations. The administrator’s waiting for the DOT secretary. The DOT secretary’s waiting for OMB and the president’s guidelines.” “Now, they are moving, they are trying — but just, again, a little bit too late,” he added. “Hopefully we can get ahead of it across the board, not just the FAA.” Perrone said he’s urged the agency to ensure managers across the country are consistent in encouraging telework and social distancing. He said PASS’ members, who maintain equipment at air traffic control facilities, need “a common message, a common philosophy.” “Right now, it’s piecemeal,” he said. “At one location, the manager says, ‘Go home. You can’t come to work.’ [At] another location, ‘No, you have to come to work.’” The FAA is considering deferring some maintenance work, similarly to what’s done during holiday seasons, Perrone said. PASS has also recommended workers stop reporting to a central location to cut down their interactions with other employees. Overall, Perrone said the FAA needs to be more “flexible” and “think outside the box” during the crisis, which is unlike any other faced by the aviation industry. “We’ve got to be able to do things in a different way to keep people safe and keep the system — if they want to continue it — up and running,” he said. Last week, PASS complained that some technical workers weren't immediately told about a potential coronavirus case at Las Vegas' McCarran tower. The controller in the D.C. area said that his facility was slow to send home trainees and encourage those who could telework to do so as much as possible, but that changed as last week went on. “They’re trying to send as many nonessential folks home as possible,” the controller said on Friday. Last week, Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) sent a letter to FAA Administrator Steve Dickson detailing concerns about telework not being mandated for nonessential employees and a lack of cleaning products. The FAA said in a statement it ""is encouraging all eligible employees to telework to the maximum extent possible,"" and for employees who can't perform their work remotely, the agency is ""employing social distancing measures and increasing the cleaning of workspaces to reduce risk of exposure."" The agency also said facilities generally have enough cleaning products, ""with the exception of isolated cases."" And in those instances, ""managers are authorized to buy them locally,"" the FAA said. ""We are not requiring employees to bring supplies from home, although some employees are doing so voluntarily,"" it said.",Coronavirus among air traffic control workers could threaten U.S. aviation system,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/coronavirus-air-traffic-aviation-147725,politico
"Republicans said Tuesday they're forging forward with their national convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, this summer, even as the coronavirus is shuttering high-profile events across the country. “We are fully committed to holding the Republican convention in Charlotte as planned and re-nominating President Trump. We have not had any substantive conversations about alternative scenarios,” said Richard Walters, the Republican National Committee chief of staff. Democrats have also said they plan to move forward with their summer convention in Milwaukee. But the Democratic National Committee issued a statement on Monday that appeared to hedge, saying the party was “exploring a range of contingency options to ensure we can deliver a successful convention without unnecessary risk to public health.” (The party insisted that contingency planning is the norm for conventions, and that nothing has changed.) Democrats have comparably less time to decide how to proceed. The convention is scheduled for July 13-16, more than a month before the Republican event. The site build-out for the Republican convention, which will be held Aug. 24-Aug. 27 at the Spectrum Center, isn’t slated to begin until mid-July. Republicans said they were factoring the coronavirus into their planning. Marcia Lee Kelly, the convention’s president and CEO, said party officials were taking “additional steps to ensure the safety and health of all attendees.” The party's statement came the same day that President Donald Trump declared that he wants the U.S. economy ""opened up and just raring to go by Easter,"" which is on April 12, despite warnings from the medical and public health communities. While both parties say they are moving forward, other major summer events are being canceled or delayed. The summer Olympics in Tokyo was just postponed until next year. Republican officials have been working behind the scenes to prepare for the convention, raising money and building a rapport with Charlotte's Democratic mayor.  Republicans have so far received $51 million in commitments for the convention. The party has set a goal of $65 million by the end of June, though it's unclear how the public health crisis will affect fundraising.  Louis DeJoy, a North Carolina businessman who serves as finance chairman for the Charlotte host committee, has emerged as a substantial donor to the convention, according to people familiar with the fundraising efforts. DeJoy, a longtime Republican giver, has been a top financier of the president’s political operation. While past conventions have relied on grants from local governments, Republicans this year have been focusing their outreach on major donors and large corporations. Party officials say they are in far better financial shape than they were in 2016. Just before that year’s confab, organizers pleaded with Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, for a $6 million cash infusion. Organizers have been plotting out themes they want to emphasize during the multi-day event. They're planning a “Made in America” marketplace at the contention, with booths for American-based companies that have benefited financially from Trump’s economic policies. Trump, a former reality TV star who is keenly focused on production of his rallies and events, has been kept up to date on planning for the event. He has held several conversations with RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and other senior Republicans about the convention. The event has been a source of controversy. Some officeholders in the liberal-tilting city initially voiced concern about hosting the convention, and last year the Charlotte city council passed a resolution condemning the president. But people familiar with convention planning say Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles has been cooperative.  National party conventions typically turn out to be a windfall for host cities and the confab is expected to benefit Charlotte financially. While the Charlotte event is going forward, state parties are adjusting planned conventions that will determine national delegates. Several states, such as Colorado and Kansas, have altered the format of their conventions to be digitally focused. Other states, such as Texas, Virginia, and Washington, have delayed their conventions. Earlier this month, the RNC legal counsel distributed a memo noting that party rules “allow for some flexibility as it relates to a state party administering its delegate and presidential nomination processes during an emergency.”",Republicans forging ahead with Charlotte convention,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/republican-national-convention-charlotte-147029,politico
"To anybody suddenly tuning into the president’s press conference this Monday evening, it might have seemed like the leader of the free world was channeling an off-hours televangelist, taking advantage of a pandemic to offer a hazy tale of a miraculous cure. “… a gentleman,” Donald Trump intoned from inside the White House, invoking an antimalarial remedy called hydroxychloroquine, “they thought he was not going to make it. He said goodbye to his family. They had given him the drug just a little while before, but he thought it was over. His family thought he was going to die. And a number of hours later, he woke up, felt good. Then he woke up again, and he felt really good. And he’s in good shape. And he’s very happy …” The drug, if it works on Covid-19, would be, he said, “a gift from God.” This brief, almost mystical tale came in the eight-minute mark of the first hour of another installment of what has become a new American serial drama. Over the last two weeks, Trump has embarked on a striking chapter of his optics-obsessed presidency, turning the all-but-abandoned briefing room into the set of a largely unscripted television series that has gripped, worried and (depending on one’s political affiliation) infuriated viewers. Stripped of the weapon of his rallies, of “chopper talk,” of the sorts of set pieces to which the populace had grown accustomed over the three-plus years he’s been commander-in-chief, Trump as a president in crisis has engineered something different. While governors from New York to California have staged almost daily briefings, offering a traditional mixture of stern warnings and words of comfort, Trump has created something more like a show built on narrative surprises and populated with familiar characters—the good doctors, the bad reporters, the loyal lieutenants. And in the middle of it all, playing the role of the ringmaster, the marketer and the brander and the professed expert, is Trump. His mood and his message have ebbed and flowed, alternately boasting and bashing, soothing and striking, intermittently solemn, flippant and peeved, flouting facts and shifting blame, underplaying dire projections and overselling potential vaccines. “He is,” former Trump Organization executive Barbara Res told me, “being himself.” The president’s political career has been shaped deeply by his experiences as the star of “The Apprentice,” for which he developed the “Mr. Trump” boardroom persona and his trademark judgmental pout. He entered the Oval Office urging aides to see his administration as a show in which he battles rivals, and he has duly done his part, serving up twists and turns and clear-cut conflicts with recurring and easily identifiable enemies (the press, the Democrats, “Sleepy Joe Biden,” “the Chinese virus”). But the program he now has constructed out of the press briefings has drawn an audience far beyond even what he found with his invariably provocative tweets or his rallies packed with MAGA-capped fans. The enormity of a worldwide plague has galvanized the attention of the entire nation, every corner of which has been touched by the spreading disease. For the public, a portion of which had tuned out or become numb, these briefings have amounted to a reintroduction of sorts to the man who is their president—“the most present human being I ever met,” as a Trump associate told biographer Wayne Barrett some three decades back, “the episodic man,” as psychologist Dan P. McAdams writes in a book out just last week. “The endless quiz show, the endless soap opera,” Trump biographer Gwenda Blair told me the other day. “It’s never over with him. He’s always going to have something to make you tune in again.” “What he’s doing in these briefings is not that different than what he’s ever done,” McAdams said in an interview. “The difference now is that we are in a unique historical period … and so everything that the president does in a situation like this gets magnified”—the airy, unfounded assurances, the casual advocacy of untested potential treatments based on “just a feeling,” the intensely personal sparring with Peter Alexander from NBC, his snide comment about the self-quarantining Mitt Romney. It all might kind of feel more or less like typical Trump schtick—if not for the relentlessly grim stakes. What next? “There’s a sense,” added Michael Caputo, a former Trump adviser, “of a cliffhanger at the end of every one—you can almost hear it at the close of every briefing, something straight out of, like, ‘same bat time, same bat channel.’” Even when he’s not at the microphone, he never relinquishes the spotlight. In the middle of Monday’s briefing, for instance, Dr. Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, was at the lectern and mentioned that she had stayed home over the weekend on account of a low-grade fever. “Uh oh,” quipped the notoriously germaphobic Trump, theatrically throwing up his hands and moving away from her, eliciting a chorus of camera clicks. But she got tested for the virus, she said, and it came back negative. “Phew,” the president said, flashing a self-satisfied smile. With hundreds of millions of people justifiably freaked out and cooped up, cable news networks’ ratings are rising. Some polls say Trump’s approval ratings are doing the same. And these new daily doses of Trump keep getting longer. Slowly but surely, they’re tending toward later in the day, too, edging into prime time, reportedly no accident. Monday’s was the longest one yet. It lasted 10 minutes shy of two hours, pushing into the 8 o’clock hour. “I’ve gotten to like this room,” Trump said. Immersed in the world of TV—as an inveterate watcher, as a proven practitioner—Trump has settled into a formulaic rhythm. The briefing almost always starts with him. It almost always ends with him. He initially had deputized Mike Pence, of course, to head up his administration’s coronavirus response, but the spread and its consequences kept getting worse and the vice president continued to receive a share of praise, and Trump going on two weeks or so ago began to reclaim center stage. “He’s his own best messenger, and he’s his own best strategist, always,” former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg told me this week, “and at this point he realizes he needs to be the public face of the U.S. response to this pandemic.” Why? “His presidency is at stake.” And the briefing room? “The perfect setting.” Following halting, uneven performances from inside the Oval Office and outside in the Rose Garden, Trump kicked off the regular stretch in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room on March 14. “Thank you very much,” he said to start, a little after noon, describing “the results” of that day’s meeting of the coronavirus task force as “very, very good.” Since then, Trump has been introducing the members of his supporting cast—the doctors, the admirals and the secretaries, and the public health pros—“fantastic,” “very talented,” “highly respected” “incredible patriots,” as he has put it. “We’ve created a number of new stars,” he said that Saturday. (In the past, it’s how he would talk sometimes about his ex-wives.) He has stoked fights with stock foes—discerning, non-fawning reporters—and he has crowd-tested terms to label the enemy at hand. When he hasn’t called it “the Chinese virus” to effectively wink at the nativist parts of his base, Trump has dubbed Covid-19 “an invisible enemy,” “the toughest enemy,” “this hidden scourge.” Touting bold declarations of nonspecific actions, loosely tied to vague, noncommittal windows of time, deploying his well-practiced spoken stop signs (“excuse me,” “just so you know”), and leaning hard on his superlative-laced lexicon (“never been done,” “not even close,” “tremendous” and “incredible” and “dramatic” and “historic”), Trump has searched in this most vexing trial of his life for ways to do what he’s always done—declare victory. In a quiet admission that there’s next to nothing he can spin into a win, at least right now, he has hailed successes from the past and pledged triumphs in the future. “… numbers like no other country has ever done before, number one in the world, if you go back two weeks …” “… everything was really hunky-dory …” “… we will win …” “… even faster than we thought …” “… our country is going to bounce back like you’ve never seen before.” He airily has offered unsurprisingly generous self-assessments about his performance and that of his team. “We’ve done a fantastic job,” he said in one briefing. “I’d rate it a ’10,’” he said in another. When pressed for nettlesome particulars, he has stepped aside for Pence, for Birx, for immunologist and task force member Tony Fauci and others—resolutely, practically reflexively shifting the blame. To his predecessors (“we inherited a very obsolete system”). To (Democratic) governors. To China. “Where are the tests?” Trump was asked on March 18. “I’ll let Mike answer that,” he said. The masks? This was the next day. “Vice president?” the president said. “Your administration,” a reporter asked on March 22, “eliminated a key position in China in July—a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s Disease Control Agency—and it was just months before the first cases were spotted in Wuhan. So the question is, basically, why the post was eliminated …” “Anybody?” Trump said, looking at the people with him on the stage. And the showman president has ended every briefing with promises of more to come. “We’re making a lot of progress,” he said Friday, “and we’ll see you folks tomorrow.” “Tomorrow,” he said Saturday. “Tomorrow,” he said Sunday. There are limits, needless to say, to Trump’s attempts to shoehorn what he accomplished with his raucous rallies into this smaller, more staid space, and with a steadily shrinking audience of socially distancing reporters who are focused on one subject only—the most sweeping public health scare in more than a century. Without, say, a Mark Burnett on hand to hack at the narrative incoherence and mold the visceral, minute-to-minute adlibbing into some tidy, salable shape, Trump in the course of these briefings so far has ended up (as he has done throughout the bulk of his existence) quite often contradicting himself. Untethered from what he has said in the past, unbothered by what he might have to say in the future, focused totally on what he must do to fight his way through the immediate present, Dan McAdams’ “episodic man” has called the press “very fair,” “very fair” … and then “very dishonest”—coming to an especially ugly head in the interaction with NBC’s Alexander. “What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?” Alexander asked. “I say that you’re a terrible reporter,” Trump said. “That’s what I say.” He called the coronavirus “the Chinese virus,” “the Chinese virus,” “the Chinese virus,” day after day after day—until he didn’t. “It seems,” he said Monday, “that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian-Americans in our country. And I don’t like that at all. These are incredible people. They love our country. And I’m not going to let it happen.” He has dubbed himself “a wartime president” while nonetheless insisting the federal government is not “a shipping clerk” for necessary medical supplies. He often has placed the onus on governors. “We’re sort of a backup for the states,” he said Sunday. He has gone from being upbeat one day to dour the next. “We’re going to be so good,” he said March 15. “It’s bad,” he said March 16. “It’s bad.” “August. Could be July. Could be longer than that,” he said that day, responding to a question concerning when normalcy might return. As much as five months or more. But he lost patience with those sober projections just a week into the war. “It’s not going to be three or four months,” he said, “as some people were saying”—first and foremost himself. “America will again, and soon, be open for business—very soon—a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner.” “Easter,” Trump said during Tuesday’s briefing. “What a great timeline that would be.” What a good story. What a pleasing finale to this season of the show.",The New Trump Show: ‘I’ve Gotten to Like This Room’,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-white-house-briefing-room-press-conference-147571,politico
"NEW YORK — With officials warning of medical shortages and tabloids reporting horror stories like a 39-year-old coronavirus victim found dead on her kitchen floor, much of the nation is looking at New York City with fear and foreboding. “We are your future,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told the country during a briefing on Tuesday morning. ""New York is the canary in the coal mine,” he said. “New York is going first. We have the highest and the fastest rate of infection. What happens to New York is going to wind up happening to California, and Washington state, and Illinois. It's just a matter of time. We're just getting there first."" But not all public health experts share Cuomo’s certitude on the point of whether other parts of the country will soon experience outbreaks comparable to New York City’s. ""Nobody knows the specific answer to that,"" said Joseph Vinetz, an infectious diseases specialist at the Yale School of Medicine.  Indeed, POLITICO interviews with five leading public-health specialists indicated that while Cuomo’s point is well taken – there likely will be other places where the level of contagion will equal New York’s – there are also reasons to be hopeful that the transmission of the virus will be slower, and less widespread, in many parts of the country. Among the factors that make New York more vulnerable are its extensive public transportation system and its sheer size. New York is both the country’s most populous city and its most densely populated. Vinetz said both the city’s high density and the fact that it is densely populated across a large region could be exacerbating factors. Vinetz also cited the city’s status as a hub for global travel as a factor that could be contributing to the outbreak there.  Joshua Epstein, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s school of global public health, cited other reasons as to why New York’s experience might not be replicated elsewhere. He pointed as well to preliminary evidence suggesting that the virus spreads more easily in northern latitudes than it does in warm, humid environments, as one possible reason for the severity of New York’s outbreak. But there are too many unknowns to draw firm conclusions at this point, and residents of the rest of the country should not assume they will avoid New York City’s fate, experts said.  “Some places will be affected more than others and some places will be affected earlier than others,"" said William Hanage, professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “However, everywhere should be preparing for this.”  Hanage said that the evidence presented so far that the virus spreads more easily in cold climates is slight, and that in general, it was premature to be making specific forecasts based on New York’s experience.  Hanage’s advice to the rest of the country, when drawing lessons from New York, he said, is to, ""Look at it. And don’t think that it won't happen to you."" Indeed, interviews with New York residents and officials suggested that both the New York lifestyle – replete with shoulder-to-shoulder public transportation, frequent dining out because of the limits of apartment living, and reliance on crowded city parks for daily recreation – as well as a certain stubbornness in curbing it may have contributed to New York’s high infection rate. “We're used to the city being our living room,” said Michael Hendrix, director of state and local policy at conservative think tank the Manhattan Institute. “We have smaller living quarters; we live with roommates. We make this choice because New York City has so much to offer.” But he pushed back on the idea that density alone was responsible for New York’s fate, citing similarly dense Asian cities that have so far fared better. “Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo also have density and nowhere near the kinds of outbreaks we have,” Hendrix said. “Density also requires good governance coupled with reinforced strong social norms to counter the spread of contagious disease. What you’re seeing today is the fruit of a slow government response to a crisis.” While Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio have been ahead of the federal government in issuing calls for social distancing, an early spate of mixed messaging from elected officials may have led some New Yorkers — especially those who perceive themselves as young and healthy — to take unnecessary risks. Many seemed to believe that it was important to avoid indoor crowds but still safe to spend the day at the farmers market or lounging around Brooklyn’s Prospect Park as the weather warms up.  Less than three weeks ago – March 5 – de Blasio took a subway ride to show his confidence in the safety of the city’s transportation system and his administration told the city’s 4.3 million straphangers that they were safe riding in jam-packed subway cars as long as no one coughed or sneezed directly on them.  “We have the best public health professionals in the world protecting you,” said de Blasio as he boarded the train on March 5. “Right now, all over the city, there are doctors and nurses and disease detectives and all sorts of other folks out there trying to make sure everyone is safe.”  Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the NYU School of Medicine, cited “leakage in social isolation” from contact closer than six feet in places like subway stations. “The bottom line is we interact and have, if not intimate contact, but pretty close, not six feet apart contact, with a lot of people,” said Caplan. With slow guidance and lax enforcement of social distancing guidelines, Cuomo said Monday night that the COVID-19 wave will crash on New York City’s health care facilities and inundate the system over the next 10 to 21 days — a rate in line with the federal estimate. “The New York metro area of New Jersey, New York City, and parts of Long Island have an attack rate close to one in 1,000. This is five times what the other areas are seeing,” Dr. Deborah Birx, White House Coronavirus Task Force response coordinator, said Monday evening. “Clearly, the virus has been circulating there for a number of weeks to have this level of penetrance into the general community.”  New York City has 15,597 Covid-19 cases and 192 deaths as of Tuesday night. The hospitalization rate is about 18 percent, according to data from the mayor’s office. Cuomo claims that the high rate of cases is correlated to testing at “the highest per capita level in the United States.”  “No one is testing more than we are testing,” he said Tuesday. Yet New York City changed its guidance on March 20 to suspend general testing and only use equipment and supplies on patients most likely to test positive — confirmation needed for health care professionals to administer experimental treatments. The city also discourages health care workers from getting tested —a policy medical professionals argue puts them and their families at risk of being patients in the hospitals already overrun with COVID-19. Out on the streets, older New Yorkers sometimes compare today’s hardships with those that followed the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001. Back then, there was a gaping hole in downtown Manhattan and New Yorkers were told to go about their normal lives in defiance of terrorism and windblown missing person signs. Now, the city’s skyline is untouched, but its once-bustling city streets are desolate and the storefronts and restaurants are already collecting dust. “After 9/11 the call to New Yorkers was to find strength in the social life of the city and everything that entails,” said New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot. “Residents found comfort in our artistic, cultural, culinary and sports communities, among others. What we’re asking of New Yorkers is so different right now.”  Nonetheless, public-health experts say other cities – and suburbs and even rural areas – need to follow New York’s lessons about social distancing right now, as they worry about facing a similar fate. Vinetz, the Yale University infectious-disease specialist, emphasized that communities will differ in their levels of coronavirus, but said state and local leaders around the country should take their cues from New York in helping their people prepare for the worst. “Governor Cuomo is becoming a hero because of his straight talk,” he said. “Have a straightforward, blunt-speaking, rational and reliable leader, and people respond very well to that.""",‘We are your future’: Will all of America become like New York?,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/new-york-coronavirus-147262,politico
"Big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are enjoying an unexpected boost in their D.C. popularity after the White House enlisted them to use their tremendous size, reach and mastery of data to fight the coronavirus. But those same traits continue to pose a peril for Silicon Valley's giants, who are the subjects of multiple federal antitrust probes that are nearing a critical stage despite the pandemic. Justice Department attorneys are still forging ahead with taking sworn testimony from witnesses — though they are slowed a little by new telework requirements and other logistical hurdles the outbreak has created. DOJ, which is pursuing separate antitrust inquiries into Google, Facebook and the tech industry as a whole, hopes to bring its efforts to “fruition” by “early summer,” Attorney General William Barr said in a Wall Street Journal interview published this week. “And by fruition, I mean decision time,” said Barr, who — as POLITICO reported this month — has taken a more active role than usual in overseeing the tech probes. Barr has previously expressed hope of wrapping up the department's investigations by the end of the year. The Federal Trade Commission is also pursuing its own probe of complaints of alleged antitrust abuses by Facebook and possibly anticompetitive mergers by the tech giants including Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. And the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel still aims to release initial findings from its own probe, though it had to delay plans to release initial findings this month. One person involved in the DOJ investigations told POLITICO that they did not expect any obstacles raised by the White House’s new alliance with the industry. The tech antitrust probes are ""a bipartisan issue,"" said the individual, who wasn't authorized to speak on the record about the investigations. ""It's not about what the White House wants because this is not specific to Trump."" Several people involved in the DOJ's probes said they thought Barr's early-summer timing might be optimistic, however. The White House's outreach to Silicon Valley is happening on multiple fronts, including one effort launched by President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and a separate one by the Office of Science and Technology Policy — by all appearances with little coordination. Facebook and Google have responded by using their digital reach to deliver public health messages to Americans, while Amazon has changed its sprawling distribution network to speed up deliveries of sanitation products and medical supplies. The industry has also broached the delicate topic of how to employ companies’ vast stores of data on hundreds of millions of Americans. ""We’re truly grateful for the efforts of tech companies in disseminating best practices and guidance for citizens online, all over the country,"" Vice President Mike Pence told reporters last week. ""The public spiritedness that’s been reflected there is a credit to those great companies and a credit to all the dedicated Americans who work there."" The friendlier vibes could have a big impact on another critical factor — Silicon Valley's much-battered public image, which after two years of data and privacy scandals has helped drive a bipartisan interest in bringing the industry to heel. Public opinion about the major tech companies was certainly “a piece of what was driving the antitrust agencies” to open their probes, said Lisa Phelan, an attorney who spent 25 years at the DOJ’s antitrust division. “Some pressure was coming from the public sense that these are big, bad companies,” said Phelan, now a partner at the law firm Morrison & Foerster. “Now the view is, ‘These are our saviors and we love them.’ It’s one possible scenario that their public image changes [and] that may reduce some of the pressure” to bring cases. That change could indeed blunt the political impetus for an antitrust crackdown, some of the industry's antitrust critics acknowledge. “The tech giants have been violating the antitrust laws for years. What was always missing was a lack of political will to enforce the antitrust laws against these companies, and those tides have turned in the last year and a half,"" said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute. ""And so I definitely think if all of a sudden these companies are America's darlings again, there could be some deterioration of that political will, at least at the federal level."" But Hubbard remains bullish that state attorneys general, who opened broad, bipartisan antitrust investigations into Google and Facebook last year, will not be swayed by the companies’ coronavirus efforts. ""I've always been having a lot more faith in that investigation than anything coming out of the DOJ because I've seen how politicized things have been under the Trump administration,"" she said. She added that the administration’s reliance on the industry’s help for public outreach, delivery logistics and computing power proves a major criticism of the tech countries — that their economic impact and public reach makes them too large and ubiquitous to avoid. “Anti-monopoly advocates like me have been arguing for a long time that what these companies are now is infrastructure. They're the infrastructure that the rest of the economy is dependent on,” Hubbard said. “The crisis is making that abundantly clear.” Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have all denied they hold monopoly power in their respective industries, arguing that their retail, digital marketing and mobile operating businesses face constant competition. Their market leadership has been earned by creating products people enjoy, they say. Lawyers who practice before the DOJ and FTC said business was proceeding as normal, although at a slightly sluggish pace as government employees adjust to working entirely online. In a release last week, the antitrust division said it was canceling all scheduled depositions — the in-person interviews that prosecutors use to help build their cases — and would reschedule them to take place over videoconference. But remote depositions bring their own host of logistical and substantive challenges, said William Stallings, who worked at the antitrust division for 17 years. “In-person is absolutely preferable,” said Stallings, now a partner at Mayer Brown. “I don’t want to say it’s impossible, but it’s incredibly, incredibly challenging to defend a deposition remotely.” Ann O’Brien, who left the antitrust division in February after 20 years, said that “every week that people aren’t allowed to go into office, there are some things that will experience delays.” “Key face-to-face depositions, key witness interviews may be put off,” said O’Brien, now at the firm BakerHostetler. “I think if this goes on for a long time, people will have to look at alternatives to move those forward.” Another challenge facing the agencies is access to documents. Normally, a company submits a hard-drive to the FTC or DOJ in response to a subpoena or document request. As of last week, the agencies have asked that the documents be uploaded to a file-sharing platform hosted by the secure cloud company Accellion. That switch has led to its own difficulties as both the agencies and law firms get used to the new system. DOJ declined to comment on how the pandemic is affecting the tech probes or whether it might change the timeline. The FTC is looking separately at a decade's worth of small acquisitions by Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, as part of a study aimed at determining whether those kinds of deals should get tougher antitrust scrutiny. And the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee is pursuing its own investigation into major internet companies, though that probe will be delayed as Congress responds to the coronavirus outbreak, subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said Thursday. The panel had been set to release its findings this month.   The shift in the White House’s tone toward Silicon Valley comes as Trump, facing the toughest challenge yet to his presidency, needs the tech industry’s help more than ever. Kushner has led much of the outreach to tech CEOs with help from Chris Liddell, a White House deputy chief of staff and former Microsoft executive, two administration officials told POLITICO. That effort has included soliciting input from companies like Amazon, Apple and Facebook about how to ease challenges like distributing test kits, managing supply chains and disseminating public service announcements. ""Someday they should make a movie about how the private sector and the White House came together to solve this crisis, but for now we need to get back to work,” one senior administration official said. The Office of Science and Technology Policy has been separately engaging tech company representatives on issues like removing online misinformation, and using artificial intelligence and supercomputers to analyze medical research.  Google has played an especially prominent role in the administration’s public pronouncements, including in Trump’s apparently overstated Rose Garden announcement about a coronavirus-screening project by the company’s health sciences affiliate. Google is also part of the supercomputing consortium that Trump announced Sunday, which also includes IBM, Microsoft and Amazon.   The government and private industry are also discussing how vast droves of data, by far the companies’ most valuable asset, could be leveraged to help stem the spread of the virus. “We’re exploring ways that aggregated anonymized location information could help in the fight against Covid-19,” said a Google spokesperson, who added the company could, for instance, assist in measuring the impact of social distancing. “This work would follow our stringent privacy protocols and would not involve sharing data about any individual’s location, movement or contacts.” Facebook, meanwhile, already helps health officials track diseases based on aggregated, anonymized data from users who have opted to share their location. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters last week that no government had asked for access to the company’s user data in response to the pandemic, adding that he would probably oppose such a step “at a high level.” “I don't think that there are direct asks for access to people's data directly,” Zuckerberg said. “The request we’ve gotten mostly from government has largely been about helping to disseminate authoritative information and making sure that we stay on top of preventing misinformation from spreading.” That kind of work could pay dividends in Washington once the coronavirus pandemic has ebbed. ""These are not the actions of American businesses who only care about their own benefit,"" said Carl Szabo, vice president of the trade association NetChoice, whose members include Facebook, Google and Amazon. ""They are stepping up to do what's best for the country in a time of need, and I hope once this tumultuous period is over that we all remember that.""",Why Silicon Valley's virus-era D.C. glow may not last,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/silicon-valley-virus-era-dc-glow-147178,politico
"Doctors and nurses are increasingly worried they will become the spreaders of the coronavirus rather than the healers, as hospitals themselves become a hot spot for the pandemic. That fear is already a reality in Italy, the global epicenter of the pandemic, where researchers have found hospitals overloaded by coronavirus patients have become transmission points. Public health officials, like those at the World Health Organization, have increasingly warned that health care workers themselves could be vectors for the disease — accelerating its spread and undermining the ability of countries’ health systems to combat it. U.S. hospital staff worry a similar scenario could play out here, according to 10 health care workers who responded to a POLITICO survey and others who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs. In an open call for hospital workers to tell us what they're seeing, dozens of others cited concerns about equipment and testing shortages, as well as sickness among hospital staff. Essential gear protecting providers is woefully inadequate and could remain so in some areas for weeks, despite assurances from federal officials that more specialized masks and surgical gowns are on their way. And because of a widespread lack of testing, frontline workers said they are treating patients without knowing if they’re infected — and that the coronavirus could spread not just to doctors and nurses, but security and cleaning staff as well. Several American health workers have already died after contracting the virus. In a suburb of Washington, D.C., one major health system isn’t sending sick staff home, even when their symptoms indicate a possible coronavirus infection, according to a nurse who said she took vacation time to self-quarantine after getting symptoms, including a low-grade fever. She’s still waiting for test results she had to drive to another Virginia county to get. In hard-hit New York City, a critical care nurse reported that a sick hospital clinician has exposed a long-term patient to the coronavirus. POLITICO is withholding the names of most facilities in this story on the request of workers who feared retribution for speaking out. The outbreak in Italy could hold important lessons for the worst that could come to America. Physicians handling the brunt of that country's outbreak, to reduce transmission in hospitals, are encouraging mobile clinics and even moving ventilators into patients' homes. ""We are learning that hospitals might be the main COVID-19 carriers, as they are rapidly populated by infected patients, facilitating transmission to uninfected patient,"" Italian doctors wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine recently. In Washington state, an early epicenter of the country’s outbreak, the virus had been “blossoming” undetected in some hospitals for weeks, according to a physician with CHI Franciscan’s network of hospitals there. Early in the outbreak, one patient with an unrecognizable cough had already infected some frontline staff by the time the person’s Covid-19 test came back positive, the physician said. And this wasn’t an isolated case. The physician reported that over the weekend clinicians — unprotected at the time due to the protective mask shortage — came into contact with patients whose tests came back positive. “I don’t think the problems are any different in our system than elsewhere. It's just that we haven't gotten the surge completely yet,"" said the physician, who credited the health system for shutting down elective surgeries over 10 days ago, before there was mounting pressure on hospitals to do so. A spokesperson for the hospital system said all staff members are being screened before entering a facility and health care workers who are ""coughing, have a fever, or feel ill"" are asked to stay home. “These are not normal times, and we are doing everything we can to keep our staff and patients safe, while also conserving masks under the latest local CDC guidelines,"" said Carly Evans, the spokesperson. Evans said the system’s hospitals are sharing resources and “working very hard to find more resources as soon as possible."" In Connecticut, a nurse at a community hospital said her facility is giving providers just one specialized mask to treat coronavirus patients; they put a face shield in front of the mask to protect it and reuse both. Those who aren’t treating coronavirus patients or suspected cases don’t use the masks, but there’s still fear that the infection could spread. “Am I going to bring this home to my kids? Am I going to bring this home to my husband?” said the nurse, whose spouse is a first responder. Many hospitals are urging patients who aren’t very sick to stay at home, and some are conducting tests in isolation tents or screening patients in their cars. The Trump administration has urged hospitals to postpone nonessential elective procedures, such as cataract surgery and colonoscopies. There's been resistance among some hospitals which depend on the lucrative procedures, though, and some health workers expressed concern to POLITICO that those could further spread the virus throughout hospitals. Federal officials say they’re prioritizing measures to keep health care workers safe. President Donald Trump said this week that FEMA is distributing 8 million special medical masks and 14 million surgical masks to areas around the country, particularly where they're needed most. FEMA has received 6.5 million more in donations. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, the nation's top doctor, said he's heard concerns around the country about protecting health workers. “I want health care workers of America to know, we are fighting for you each and every day to make sure you get what you need from the stockpile, to make sure you get what you need from manufacturers across America,"" Adams said during a Fox News virtual town hall on Tuesday. For weeks, however, state officials and hospitals have urged the federal government to provide more protective equipment. Some frontline health workers made pleas on social media. Others crafted their own surgical masks and have taken to recycling whatever gear they can. “Hospitals are in a tough position,"" said an emergency physician based near Oakland, Calif. ""Because all the leadership would prefer to have more equipment available and the sudden surge of demand has put all these hospitals in this untenable position of trying to procure something that needs massive manufacturing.” In some parts of America, the risk of infection isn’t confined to hospitals directly treating coronavirus patients. It appears to be spreading through facilities connected to health systems. One Indiana nurse who works at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic next to a hospital said she had virus symptoms and went through multiple phone screenings while her supervisors debated how to handle the situation. One supervisor said she should get tested, but another manager reversed that decision. She said she was cleared to return to work as soon as she recovered from her low-grade fever, even though she hadn't completed the typical 14 days of quarantine for people who've been ill or directly exposed to the virus, and she was still coughing. She still doesn't know if she had the virus, and she and her colleagues don’t typically wear protective masks since they work outside the hospital.",Health workers fear U.S. hospitals will become coronavirus hot spots ,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/health-workers-hospitals-coronavirus-147398,politico
"After three-plus years of consistently negative approval ratings, President Donald Trump is getting better marks for his handling of the still-fledgling coronavirus outbreak ravaging the nation.  But Trump’s higher job ratings from Americans are just relative: Voters are still mostly split on how he’s handling the pandemic, and the past two weeks have brought only a modest bump in his overall approval numbers, which still show more Americans disapprove of his performance as president than approve.  In a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, a quarter of voters surveyed said Trump is doing an “excellent” job handling the virus, and another 17 percent said he is doing a “good” job. But almost as many, 39 percent, said he’s doing a “poor” job, and 13 percent rate his handling of the crisis as “just fair.”  Those numbers are statistically unchanged from last week’s survey and match the results of other public polls, which show Americans divided along partisan lines in judging Trump’s handling of the virus.  The latest poll numbers come at a pivot point for Trump, who is considering loosening some of the constraints placed on American's public and economic lives to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus — even as public-health officials warn that the U.S. is falling behind in its containment efforts despite the actions already taken. Meanwhile, Americans are growing more supportive of aggressive containment measures like quarantines.  Trump said Tuesday he hopes the economy would resume in large part by Easter, which is April 12. While Trump and some of his allies are blanching at the growing economic toll of the virus, polls show Americans aren’t worried the government is going too far in trying to contain the virus. On the contrary: Voters say they are more concerned the government won’t go far enough. According to the latest POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, only 3 percent of voters said the Trump administration is doing too much in response to the virus, compared to 45 percent who say the Trump administration isn’t doing enough. Roughly 4 in 10 voters said the administration is doing the right amount. ""As the coronavirus pandemic continues, voters are almost evenly split on whether the Trump administration is doing the right amount or not enough in response,"" said Tyler Sinclair, vice president for Morning Consult. That matches the sentiment in other surveys. About as many Americans in a Monmouth University poll released Monday said the federal government wasn’t doing enough (45 percent) as said the federal government’s response was “appropriate” (47 percent). Just two weeks ago, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed voters divided evenly over whether they were more worried the government would go too far or not far enough in combating the coronavirus. But Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm that makes up half of the news organizations' bipartisan team of researchers, said in its private polling over the past week that significantly more respondents are worried the government won’t go far enough. “Last week, public opinion tipped to favoring more restrictions and shut downs,” GOP pollster Bill McInturff wrote on Public Opinion Strategies’ website. In the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, a big majority of voters said they would be on board with a national quarantine to control the spread of coronavirus, permitting only essential travel such as trips to grocery stores and pharmacies. Nearly 3 in 4 voters would either strongly or somewhat support a national quarantine.  For Trump, the polling amounts to a mixed bag. On one hand, there is a long-duration Gallup poll, conducted March 13-22 — a 10-day stretch beginning the same day Trump declared the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency. The Gallup poll shows Trump with a 49 percent approval rating overall, equaling a high-water mark, with 60 percent approving of his response to the virus. Other polls, including the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, show a smaller bump. Trump’s overall approval rating is up just 2 points from last week’s POLITICO/Morning Consult survey, from 43 percent to 45 percent, with a majority, 52 percent, still disapproving of his job performance. Trump gets mildly positive reviews in other polls for his response to the virus. Monmouth found 50 percent of Americans said he was doing a good job handling the outbreak, while 45 percent said he was doing a bad job. A CBS News/YouGov poll was similar: A combined 53 percent said Trump was doing a “very good” or “somewhat good” job, but 47 percent said he was doing a “very bad” or “somewhat bad” job. The Monmouth poll also showed a slight uptick in Trump's approval rating, to 46 percent. But Trump still trails former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading Democratic presidential candidate, in a matchup among registered voters, 48 percent to 45 percent, the poll shows. While views of Trump and his response fall largely along partisan lines, so does concern about the virus. In the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, a slight majority of voters, 53 percent, said they are “very concerned” about the coronavirus outbreak. But the share of self-identified Democratic voters who are “very concerned” (64 percent) is significantly larger than the percentages of Republicans (46 percent) and independents (47 percent) who said the same. Democratic voters are also more plugged into news about the virus and the government’s response. Overall, nearly a quarter of voters said the outbreak will have a “major impact” on their vote in the 2020 elections. But twice as many Democrats (32 percent) as Republicans (16 percent) said it will have a “major impact.” ""Week over week, more voters are now saying the outbreak will impact their vote for president, so all eyes remain on the federal government's handling of this virus,” Sinclair said. The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll was conducted March 20-22, as the Senate wrangled over a stimulus package intended to support the economy. Proposals from both parties would benefit both workers and businesses, but the poll asked voters which was more important. The vast majority, 73 percent, said the government “should provide financial assistance to individual Americans during the coronavirus pandemic, because businesses will benefit from the economic activity” — far more than the 15 percent who said the government “should provide financial assistance to businesses during the coronavirus pandemic, because individual Americans will benefit from the economic activity.” The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll surveyed 1,996 registered voters via online interviews and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. Morning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy.

"Subscribe to Women Rule on Apple Podcasts here. | Subscribe via Spotify here. As the coronavirus pandemic has grown across the country, Joanne Kenen has spent these last few weeks like many Americans: phoning old friends, trying to entertain bored children, convincing her elderly mother to stock up on food and stay in. Then, of course, comes the demands of her day job — which at this moment, has become a day-and-night-every-day-and-every-night job — as the executive editor at the helm of POLITICO’s health care coverage. “I realized in January it was a huge story. I don't think I realized until much more recently that it was the story of our lifetime,” Kenen said in an interview for a special coronavirus-focused episode of POLITICO’s Women Rule podcast.  She’s clear-eyed about the outlook for America in the short term (“I don't think we can get back to normal in a couple of months,” Kenen said), and though she sees some glimmers of hope, she describes herself as “extremely worried” about the toll this will take on the United States. “I think we've made a huge amount of mistakes. I do see some of them being somewhat corrected. There's some governors who have really stepped up and taken control, at least in their states. But we have not had a consistent, accurate national strategy to make the best decisions we could make all along.” What follows are excerpts of her interview with Anna Palmer, edited for length and readability. For more, listen to the interview on the newest episode of Women Rule.  Anna Palmer: For a lot of people, the speed of all the changes we've seen to daily life has been stunning. Everyone's grounded, stuck in their houses. What has happened in the last month that has surprised you?  Joanne Kenen: Within our office, people thought I was a little alarmist back in January, when I said things like, ""We have to think about whether we'll be able to have normal elections, and we're gonna have to think about whether we can have a normal convention."" People thought I was maybe overreacting. In retrospect, I think I was under-reacting: It is worse than I anticipated.  It's hard to measure what isn't happening. Do we know whether social distancing is ""flattening the curve,"" making fewer people get sick at once, which allows our hospitals to cope with the people who are sick? I think it's probably working, but trying to get to a degree, trying to get data on something that didn't happen is hard. And because the testing in this country was so late and so insufficient in the opening days, we don't really know what the baseline is in order to tell whether it's getting better or worse. All we can do is hope. Our best tool is social distancing. We don't have a drug yet. We don't have a vaccine yet. And our hospitals aren't really ready. So stay home. Palmer: I want to rewind a little bit and understand kind of how we got here. You were talking before about being almost perceived internally as an alarmist. When did you realize this was going to be a huge story?  Kenen: I realized in January it was a huge story. I don't think I realized until much more recently that it was the story of our lifetime. And I hope it is the worst thing that ever happens in our lifetime. For me, as a mom, 9/11 was my very first day back from maternity leave with my second child. And I was in the White House — I happened to be at the White House when plane number one hit. That was the first time I was away from my baby. And I was with Laura Bush in a motorcade when plane number two hit. And I was on [Capitol] Hill when plane number three hit, and we could see the smoke from the Pentagon. I thought that was the biggest story I'd ever cover. That was the worst work day I ever had. This is a slower motion, less of a shock — we've seen it coming.  9/11 changed our world. And this is going to change our world, too, in ways that we don't understand yet. So it's not just the story of today and tomorrow and next week, it's the story of the months to come, and how do we heal, how do we recover?  Palmer: This, at first, was always being described [in comparison to] the flu — whether this was going to be worse than the flu — why do you think that was? Is it just because people didn't have anything else to compare it against?  Kenen: President Trump — and others, not just President Trump — was telling us it was like the flu. And in some ways, it's a useful comparison, because it's an invisible enemy that hits you, and It's hard to protect yourself. But it's way more dangerous than the flu. We don't shut down our economy because of the flu. The flu is really contagious, but the flu doesn't kill as many people.  In a pandemic year, I looked it up [for] 1957. And if I'm remembering the number correctly, something like 119,000 Americans [died]. A few weeks ago, I thought that's what we were looking at as a worst-case scenario. Now we know from the public health people, the worst-case scenario — and we may not get the worst-case scenario, it looks like it won't be — but it would be way more than 100,000 dead. Palmer: One of the other issues that has really come up clearly is this lack of supplies — ventilators, masks. This could be the difference between life and death for a lot of people.  Kenen: Yes, because Patient A, who has coronavirus, if there's not enough protective gear, they can infect Patient B, who doesn't have coronavirus. We do think that might be part of what's going on in Italy: it spread within the hospitals. Secondly, if health care workers can't protect themselves — you sure do not want health care workers either getting sick or being quarantined for two weeks and then not being able to take care of those of us who do get sick.  So the personal protective gear — which means masks, gowns, gloves, all these things, the N95 masks — those are really, really, really important to the health care system. Had this country really woken up in January and started figuring out, ""Where are they? How can we make more? How can we enlist other factories to make more? How do we get them? How do we come up with a national allocation system? How do you want to prioritize? It doesn't make sense to have a ventilator for every American, but we don't have enough.""  So, A, we should have planned better. And B, we should have planned better over the years for the inevitable pandemic. If we really woke up to this in January, we'd have more things in place in March. And instead, in March, we're mobilizing to get things in place for May. Palmer: The other big issue is the testing and the lack of the tests, and the lapse from when the people take the tests and when they actually get the results. What happened there?  Kenen: Our test didn't work. We decided to use a CDC test — and the CDC is usually able to do this. But this time, the CDC made a test, and it simply did not work. There was probably some kind of contamination in the manufacturing process; it's still being investigated. What we do know is it worked in the CDC, and when they sent it out into the state labs, into the communities, it simply did not work. Taking weeks and weeks to get a test that worked put us way behind the curve. And we were slow. Some medical schools and academic medical centers were developing their own. There is a way to use emergency powers to approve those things quickly. Finally, the FDA figured it out, they started expanding. But it took them weeks to expedite. They had those tools. President Trump is saying it's the fault of the prior administrations tying their hands. No. Whether the test worked or not has nothing to do with whether you can quickly get another test. Germany developed tests, South Korea developed tests, China developed tests, the WHO was sending its tests out to something like 60 countries by February, and we decided not to use that. The CDC has now said, ‘Well, we didn't think their test was good enough.’ Well, we didn't have a test. If you wanted to develop the perfect, gold-standard test, fine. But I don't know anybody, outside of the government, who thinks it was OK to not use another test, at least as a temporary bridge. Use what's available, and then try to make a better one. We’ve created this dichotomy: we’re going to use nothing, or wait for the perfect one instead of using the best available at the time. Palmer: You run our health care team. A lot of the coverage that your team has done has focused on the administration's response and some of the infighting at the agencies. What are one or two of the bigger stories where your team has been able to kind of plant a flag? Kenen: We have been way ahead of the curve on the testing problems. We're not the only outlet — there's a lot of really great journalism — but we have been really ahead of the curve. We have a reporter who specializes in testing and diagnostics. I've written about the WHO and the international testing and testing gaps. You can say, ""Well, the personality conflicts … it doesn't matter right now who likes someone, or who's up and who's down.” It does matter if it's affecting clear, consistent policies from moving ahead, or if people are fighting and we're not sure who's in charge, or there's somebody different in charge every day. It took a long time for the president to get FEMA — they didn't get involved until a few days ago. So all these fights over who's making decisions, who's in the good graces of the White House, they aren't “petty” to the extent that they are preventing us from having a coherent and cohesive national strategy. Palmer: You started out as a reporter at Reuters mid-80's. At the time, there was a little-understood but high mortality rate disease: HIV/AIDS. How does this moment compare to now? Kenen: I think the stigma around AIDS, because the populations that it affected — and I was not a full-time health reporter then, but I was living in New York, so I did report on it. Remember: our society has changed a lot about how we treat and think about our gay friends and family. It was much more stigmatic in the 1980s. Drug use was the other main way it was spreading. America was not always at its greatest. There was a lot of stigma, a lot of fear — and there's fear now, but it was different: it was a fear of specific people. And here, it's more a fear of a really dangerous germ. It was harder to treat; it took us years. It's not exactly the same, because this is a pandemic that's spreading so fast and everybody is vulnerable to getting it. So there are some parallels, and it's new and frightening. But the way we've responded is not the same.  Palmer: This is clearly a time when people are very uncertain about what the future holds on pretty much every front. Every conversation I have with family and friends, it turns to: ""When is life going to return to normal?"" Do you have any sense of that?  Kenen: I don't think we know yet. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has talked about another 10–12 weeks of this ""hunker down"" stage. President Trump is tweeting that maybe we can't go that long. I think that it'll be interesting to watch that dynamic. By the time people listen to this, we may have more clarity about what the president is going to say. I don't think it's years. I don't think it's two weeks. I think that we are in for a period of disruption. And it'll be prolonged until we're back to whatever ""normal"" is, post-pandemic. I don't think we can get back to normal in a couple of months, but we may get over this really intense ""hunker down"" stage.  It's really important to understand that when public health works and things don't happen, then people think, ""Well, we didn't need to do all that: There were only X cases!"" But that means it worked. It doesn't mean that we didn't need it. Palmer: I want to end on, hopefully, a more positive note. We don't know when this is going to end. There's a lot we don't know about supplies and what our future is in the short term. But given all that you do know, is there anything giving you reason to hope right now?  Kenen: You know, without really solid data, we’re trying to figure out: are we bending this curve, are we flattening this curve watching? In New York in particular, it looks like the supply chain is improving a little bit. It’s not where we need to be, but it looks like it's incrementally getting better.  I was more worried about the worst-case scenario a few days ago than I am right now, which doesn't mean I'm optimistic or I don't think it's going to be bad. I do think it's going to get bad.  The challenge for those of us living this and covering it is that we’re also participants in it. So trying to take care of myself, taking care of my family — those in the house and those that I'm talking to remotely — sort of balancing my sort of human reactions and my professional reactions.  I am still extremely worried. I think we've made a huge amount of mistakes. I do see some of them being somewhat corrected. There's some governors who have really stepped up and taken control, at least in their states. But we have not had a consistent, accurate national strategy to make the best decisions we could make all along. A week or two ago, a former public health official sent me an email for all of Politico, saying “Your coverage is helping save lives.” And that's probably the most important thing any of us in this virtual political newsroom will do and be able to be proud of going forward.

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to feign mock excitement over Sen. Mitt Romney's announcement of his negative coronavirus test, tweeting glibly about the global public health threat now bearing down on members of Congress. Sharing online an article from the alt-right Breitbart News regarding the Utah Republican's test results, Trump wrote: ""This is really great news! I am so happy I can barely speak. He may have been a terrible presidential candidate and an even worse U.S. Senator, but he is a RINO, and I like him a lot!"" The president's post came hours after Romney tweeted on Tuesday afternoon that he had tested negative for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Romney was tested after he came into close contact with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who tested positive and has faced intense criticism for potentially infecting other lawmakers. Despite Romney's negative results, he wrote that ""guidance from my physician, consistent with the CDC guidelines, requires me to remain in quarantine as the test does not rule out the onset of symptoms during the 14-day period."" Romney's office did not immediately respond a request for comment on the president's tweet. His wife, Ann, has long suffered from multiple sclerosis, a neurological disease that could make her, like others with underlying conditions, more vulnerable to the coronavirus. Both Romney and Utah's other senator, Republican Mike Lee, had begun self-quarantining after Paul's diagnosis on Sunday. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.) is also self-quarantining in Washington after potential exposure earlier this month. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) finished a quarantine period on Monday. On the other side of the Capitol, Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Ben McAdams (D-Utah) have tested positive for COVID-19 after developing symptoms last weekend. House members are largely working from home as the crisis escalates and the health risks posed by colleagues become more immediate. The coronavirus' outbreak within Washington's halls of power have winnowed the number of lawmakers present to vote on critical pieces of legislation — including an imminent, nearly $2 trillion stimulus package — and provoked new discussions regarding potential emergency measures such as remote voting to ensure continuity of government throughout the pandemic.",'I am so happy I can barely speak': Trump whacks Romney after negative coronavirus test,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/donald-trump-mitt-romney-coronavirus-test-negative-148069,politico

"Top Trump administration officials on Tuesday signaled that they were already laying the groundwork to restart the U.S. economy amid the coronavirus pandemic — a tremendous task that President Donald Trump revealed he would like to accomplish by mid-April. “I’d love to have it open by Easter, OK? I would love to have it open by Easter. I will tell you that right now,” Trump said from the White House Rose Garden, where he and members of the administration’s coronavirus task force participated in a virtual town hall on Fox News. “It’s such an important day for other reasons, but I’ll make it an important day for this, too,” he added. “I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.” Trump’s remarks came just hours after Vice President Mike Pence told conservative leaders on a private call that White House aides were discussing ways to encourage businesses to reopen and healthy Americans to return to work at the end of the current 15-day period of recommended social distancing, during which administration officials have asked Americans to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people and stay home as much as possible. The shifting message could set Trump on a collision course with health officials inside his administration, who have warned that resuming business as usual could worsen conditions by accelerating the spread of the coronavirus. Those experts are still searching for answers regarding the severity of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, as well as whether patients who recover from it become immune. Senior administration officials, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, have shared concerns about the urgency of reopening the economy after hearing from a number of industry executives in recent days, while officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and some Republican lawmakers have advised the president to keep his focus on containing the threat — a mission that becomes more difficult if Americans return to work, they say. Pence said on Tuesday that the president had no plans to overrule social-distancing guidance that state and local officials have issued to their residents, but that he was interested in softening federal guidelines in order to recharge the economy, according to five participants on the call. “The vice president was clear in this call they’re not going to undermine governors and the decisions they are making, but he said the president wants to get the country back to work,” said Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots and one of more than two dozen conservative leaders who spoke with Pence on Tuesday morning. Trump’s eagerness to bring an end to strict preventative measures he imposed last Monday bubbled up over the weekend as he consulted with outside allies and top economic aides, many of whom warned him that the unemployment rate could reach 30 percent in the second quarter of 2020 if businesses remain shuttered. CDC guidelines and more severe directives from state and local authorities have already thrust the U.S. economy into a severe recession as Americans remain largely confined to their homes and large corporations and small businesses shed employees. “THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM!” Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning prior to his appearance on Fox News, echoing a view that has gained traction among White House allies. Some conservative leaders, for instance, warned Pence that prolonged closures and layoffs could do more to damage the health of American workers and business owners than the coronavirus itself. “There’s stress, there’s anxiety. People can wind up having a heart attack, committing suicide, turning to drug use. There are a lot of unintended consequences when people move into economic distress,” Martin said, noting that she and others voiced these concerns during their conversation with the vice president. So far, the administration has declined to specify what guidance, if any, the federal government might issue or roll back to bridge the 13-day gap between the end of the administration’s 15 Days to Slow the Spread initiative, which wraps up at the end of the weekend, and Easter, which falls on April 12. “There weren’t specifics,” Kristan Hawkins, head of the anti-abortion group Students for Life, said of the conference call with Pence, adding that she was worried about the infection rate of COVID-19 and the potential risks of lifting social-distancing guidelines prematurely. “I’m not going to even feel personally comfortable lifting my own self-quarantine until we start seeing more data and some of these experimental treatments are proven to be effective,” Hawkins said. “I think there are going to [be] people like me who, for a long time, are going to be wary of being in crowds — of being on airplanes.” Trump, meanwhile, asserted on Fox News that it would be “absolutely possible” to begin to resurrect the economy by Easter, while cautioning that Americans going back to their jobs next month would have to continue practicing “all of the things that we’re doing now” — including social distancing in the workplace, frequent hand washing and avoiding shaking hands. “We have to get our country back to work. Our country wants to be back at work,” Trump said, claiming without evidence that more people would die as a result of the economic consequences of social-distancing measures than the number who would perish if Americans reentered the workforce. He also said the mental health implications of prolonged social distancing would prove dire, and warned that the U.S. would suffer “suicides by the thousands.” Still, in a White House news briefing with the coronavirus task force on Tuesday, the president sprinkled in several caveats to soften his earlier proclamations. “Rest assured, every decision we make is grounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens. This is a medical crisis. This isn’t a financial crisis,” Trump said.  “So we’re going to look at it, we will only do it if it’s good, and maybe we do sections of the country, we do large sections of the country,” he continued, adding that he would confer with the task force members.  But Trump expressed confidence that the mid-April date would work out, suggesting Easter could even overshoot the necessary duration of social distancing. “I would love to see it come even sooner,” he explained, “but I think that would just be a beautiful timeline.” At the White House briefing, Trump’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, appeared to temper expectations, stressing that the president’s timeline was “very flexible.” “We just had a conversation with the president in the Oval Office talking about, you can look at a date but you’ve got to be very flexible,” he said. “On literally a day-by-day, week-by-week basis, you need to evaluate the feasibility of what you are trying to do.” Asked what kind of data points would inform a recommendation to loosen social-distancing guidelines, Fauci argued that the ensuing weeks would allow health experts to more closely examine testing data in areas without an “obvious outbreak.” “Is there something underneath the surface that says, wait a minute, you better be careful and really clamp down? Or, looks there that you don’t have to be as harsh as you are in other areas?” he said, pointing to the recent surge of testing capability as critical to that effort. “So, it’s looking at information that up to this point we never had.” Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, seemed less enthusiastic regarding the president’s proposed Easter end date, and declined to directly answer whether such a deadline was realistic. Birx instead emphasized the importance of employing “21st century solutions” and collecting data at the “most granular level” to better understand the rampant spread of COVID-19. “That’s what the president has asked us to put together: to use these two weeks to get all the data from around the country and all the data from around the globe and really understand what’s working,” she told Fox News, adding that “every American needs to continue the president’s guidelines for these next six days or seven days. We have to have them following those guidelines.” Pence also made a forceful case for Americans to keep heeding the federal guidance until at least the conclusion of the 15-day period, listing the administration’s recommendations in the final minutes of Fox News’ broadcast. “These are all the principles that every American can do,” he said. “Now, there are going to be Americans that have different guidance from their state and local officials that are more stringent. We defer to that. We respect that. But the more Americans that do this, the sooner that we’ll be able, as the president said, to get back to work.” Defending his rationale for reopening the economy, Trump repeatedly invoked deadly flu seasons in the U.S., remarking that the fatalities produced by that illness do not shut down the nation’s normal operations in the way the coronavirus has. “Thirty-six thousand deaths a year ... but we’ve never closed down the country for the flu,” the president said. “So you say to yourself, what is this all about?” Of course, flu season began months ago, and its death toll is largely predictable. The coronavirus, which is much more infectious than the flu, has only recently started tearing across the country, and could result in hundreds of thousands or even millions of deaths. Trump’s new push to promptly wind down social distancing breaks with the advice of public health experts who have been urging greater governmental action, not less, in the race to “flatten the curve” of cases and prevent communities from confronting the kind of crisis unfolding in New York — the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S. Without tested treatments or a newly developed vaccine, limited person-to-person contact remains the best recipe for slowing the coronavirus’ spread, even if it won’t halt the disease’s transmission entirely. Several health officials have predicted that the need for social distancing could last until late spring, not just two or three more weeks. But the Easter cutoff does offer the administration extra time to intensify mitigation efforts and plan whatever steps Trump decides to take next. It is also possible that as the outbreak worsens, the president’s relatively rosy assessment of the likely cost to American lives will grow grimmer. On Tuesday, though, Trump appeared as focused on the practicalities of reopening the economy by Easter Sunday as he was on the cultural significance of the date itself, which he called a “very special day for me.” “You’ll have packed churches all over our country,” Trump told Fox News. “I think it would be a beautiful time, and it’s just about the timeline that I think is right.” In his appearance on the network, the president also appeared at times preoccupied with past and present political battles while discussing the administration’s war against the pandemic. When pressed on the CDC’s far-from-perfect initial testing operation for the coronavirus, Trump was quick to point to the scandal that ensnared his presidency and resulted in his impeachment by the House of Representatives in December. “What I said is perfect was my conversation with the head of the Ukraine,” he said. “That’s what I really said is perfect, OK? That was another whole scandal, nonsense. A total, you know, witch hunt.” And when Birx posited that the heightened rates of COVID-19 infection in New York could have been exacerbated by a large number of people returning to the state from Asia after the Christmas holiday, the president interrupted her. “Do you blame the governor for that?” Trump said with a smirk, needling his sometime political foil Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.",‘I’d love to have it open by Easter’: Trump says he wants to restart economy by mid-April,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/trump-wants-to-restart-economy-by-mid-april-146398,politico

"Doctors and nurses are increasingly worried they will become the spreaders of the coronavirus rather than the healers, as hospitals themselves become a hot spot for the pandemic. That fear is already a reality in Italy, the global epicenter of the pandemic, where researchers have found hospitals overloaded by coronavirus patients have become transmission points. Public health officials, like those at the World Health Organization, have increasingly warned that health care workers themselves could be vectors for the disease — accelerating its spread and undermining the ability of countries’ health systems to combat it. U.S. hospital staff worry a similar scenario could play out here, according to 10 health care workers who responded to a POLITICO survey and others who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs. In an open call for hospital workers to tell us what they're seeing, dozens of others cited concerns about equipment and testing shortages, as well as sickness among hospital staff. Essential gear protecting providers is woefully inadequate and could remain so in some areas for weeks, despite assurances from federal officials that more specialized masks and surgical gowns are on their way. And because of a widespread lack of testing, frontline workers said they are treating patients without knowing if they’re infected — and that the coronavirus could spread not just to doctors and nurses, but security and cleaning staff as well. Several American health workers have already died after contracting the virus. In a suburb of Washington, D.C., one major health system isn’t sending sick staff home, even when their symptoms indicate a possible coronavirus infection, according to a nurse who said she took vacation time to self-quarantine after getting symptoms, including a low-grade fever. She’s still waiting for test results she had to drive to another Virginia county to get. In hard-hit New York City, a critical care nurse reported that a sick hospital clinician has exposed a long-term patient to the coronavirus. POLITICO is withholding the names of most facilities in this story on the request of workers who feared retribution for speaking out. The outbreak in Italy could hold important lessons for the worst that could come to America. Physicians handling the brunt of that country's outbreak, to reduce transmission in hospitals, are encouraging mobile clinics and even moving ventilators into patients' homes. ""We are learning that hospitals might be the main COVID-19 carriers, as they are rapidly populated by infected patients, facilitating transmission to uninfected patient,"" Italian doctors wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine recently. In Washington state, an early epicenter of the country’s outbreak, the virus had been “blossoming” undetected in some hospitals for weeks, according to a physician with CHI Franciscan’s network of hospitals there. Early in the outbreak, one patient with an unrecognizable cough had already infected some frontline staff by the time the person’s Covid-19 test came back positive, the physician said. And this wasn’t an isolated case. The physician reported that over the weekend clinicians — unprotected at the time due to the protective mask shortage — came into contact with patients whose tests came back positive. “I don’t think the problems are any different in our system than elsewhere. It's just that we haven't gotten the surge completely yet,"" said the physician, who credited the health system for shutting down elective surgeries over 10 days ago, before there was mounting pressure on hospitals to do so. A spokesperson for the hospital system said all staff members are being screened before entering a facility and health care workers who are ""coughing, have a fever, or feel ill"" are asked to stay home. “These are not normal times, and we are doing everything we can to keep our staff and patients safe, while also conserving masks under the latest local CDC guidelines,"" said Carly Evans, the spokesperson. Evans said the system’s hospitals are sharing resources and “working very hard to find more resources as soon as possible."" In Connecticut, a nurse at a community hospital said her facility is giving providers just one specialized mask to treat coronavirus patients; they put a face shield in front of the mask to protect it and reuse both. Those who aren’t treating coronavirus patients or suspected cases don’t use the masks, but there’s still fear that the infection could spread. “Am I going to bring this home to my kids? Am I going to bring this home to my husband?” said the nurse, whose spouse is a first responder. Many hospitals are urging patients who aren’t very sick to stay at home, and some are conducting tests in isolation tents or screening patients in their cars. The Trump administration has urged hospitals to postpone nonessential elective procedures, such as cataract surgery and colonoscopies. There's been resistance among some hospitals which depend on the lucrative procedures, though, and some health workers expressed concern to POLITICO that those could further spread the virus throughout hospitals. Federal officials say they’re prioritizing measures to keep health care workers safe. President Donald Trump said this week that FEMA is distributing 8 million special medical masks and 14 million surgical masks to areas around the country, particularly where they're needed most. FEMA has received 6.5 million more in donations. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, the nation's top doctor, said he's heard concerns around the country about protecting health workers. “I want health care workers of America to know, we are fighting for you each and every day to make sure you get what you need from the stockpile, to make sure you get what you need from manufacturers across America,"" Adams said during a Fox News virtual town hall on Tuesday. For weeks, however, state officials and hospitals have urged the federal government to provide more protective equipment. Some frontline health workers made pleas on social media. Others crafted their own surgical masks and have taken to recycling whatever gear they can. “Hospitals are in a tough position,"" said an emergency physician based near Oakland, Calif. ""Because all the leadership would prefer to have more equipment available and the sudden surge of demand has put all these hospitals in this untenable position of trying to procure something that needs massive manufacturing.” In some parts of America, the risk of infection isn’t confined to hospitals directly treating coronavirus patients. It appears to be spreading through facilities connected to health systems. One Indiana nurse who works at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic next to a hospital said she had virus symptoms and went through multiple phone screenings while her supervisors debated how to handle the situation. One supervisor said she should get tested, but another manager reversed that decision. She said she was cleared to return to work as soon as she recovered from her low-grade fever, even though she hadn't completed the typical 14 days of quarantine for people who've been ill or directly exposed to the virus, and she was still coughing. She still doesn't know if she had the virus, and she and her colleagues don’t typically wear protective masks since they work outside the hospital. Tucker Doherty contributed to this report.",Health workers fear U.S. hospitals will become coronavirus hot spots ,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/health-workers-hospitals-coronavirus-147398,politico
"Last updated 8:40PM Tuesday | Next update: 12PM Wednesday States have enacted a wide range of policies in an effort to ""flatten the curve"" and address the economic effects of the novel coronavirus. While all 50 states have declared states of emergency, giving governors emergency powers, the policy response from states has been wide-ranging.  We tracked seven metrics using data from the Kaiser Family Foundation to pull apart the differences in how states are responding to the outbreak. Five of the statewide metrics are aimed at mitigating the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, such as closing all nonessential business. Two metrics track health policy enacted by the states, including paid sick leave for affected workers. California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have initiated the most comprehensive policies. They've closed all bars and restaurants except for takeout and delivery, banned all gatherings, ordered mandatory statewide quarantine, closed all nonessential businesses, and closed all schools. California and Washington have also enacted paid sick leave for workers. Mississippi and Oklahoma are on the other end of the spectrum. Neither has instituted social restrictions outside closing schools. Many states have limited the operations of dining establishments to prevent the spread of the disease among crowds, requiring bars and restaurants to either shift to takeout-only operations or close down entirely. Though the development of a coronavirus vaccine is likely more than a year away, many states have already enacted policies dictating that the vaccine be provided to all residents for free. Lawmakers pushing for this argue the high cost of vaccinating the population for free pales in comparison to the cost of failing to do so and having the virus resurge in the future.  Many states have banned large gatherings to slow the spread of the virus, but there is wide variation on what constitutes a “large gathering.” As the crisis has worsened over the past few weeks, states have brought down the size of allowed gatherings from 1,000 to 250 to 50 to just 10.  States hardest hit by the virus have implemented broad mandatory quarantine orders, also referred to as “shelter in place” or “stay at home” policies. Though the policies vary between states, residents are generally instructed to stay at home unless going out for essential activities, such as grocery shopping.  Many states have ordered all business deemed nonessential to temporarily close, while those like grocery stores, pharmacies and hospitals that must continue operating need to implement strict safety guidelines for workers. States have differed on whether abortion clinics and gun stores, among other businesses, should be deemed essential.  A handful of mainly progressive states have enacted laws expanding paid sick leave for workers who contract coronavirus or who must care for a loved one who becomes infected. Before the outbreak, many workers had little or no guaranteed paid leave, including millions of people in the gig economy.  Nearly every state in the nation has closed its schools out of fear that large groups of children would become petri dishes for the virus. The move has, however, created other problems, as many low-income children depend on free school meals and many parents who have to continue going to work or work from home now have to care for their children.

"The Department of Homeland Security has been briefed that New York City’s morgues are nearing capacity, according to a department official and a second person familiar with the situation.  Officials were told that morgues in the city are expected to reach capacity next week, per the briefing. A third person familiar with the situation in New York said that some of the city’s hospital morgues hit capacity over the last seven days.  If the available morgue space in New York City fills up as the number of COVID-19 deaths increases, federal help will be available, a former senior administration official said, noting that the George W. Bush administration sent mortuary assistance in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the September 11 attacks. The Department of Health and Human Services oversees the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams (DMORT), which can help set up temporary morgues. The teams operate in response to requests from local authorities. For now, city officials do not seem especially alarmed. Aja Worthy-Davis, a spokesperson for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), said concerns about morgue capacity may be unfounded. In Manhattan alone, she said, OCME’s morgue can store up to 900 bodies. The city has a morgue for each of the five boroughs, she said. “We have the ability to expand pretty dramatically,” she said. “If you look back at what we did during 9/11, we have the ability to create mobile stations that allow us to house bodies if we run out of space.”  New York City has not dealt with mass casualties at the same rate as Covid-19 in recent memory, however. “All hospitals within the city tend to have small morgue spaces, so it’s possible that with the capacity of hospitals in New York City, there may be an expectation … that they’ll run out of morgue space,” Worthy-Davis added.  In a 2008 plan for a pandemic influenza outbreak, OCME noted, “It is probable that funeral directors, cemeteries and crematoria may be unable to process remains at the same rate as the OCME, due to the large influx of deaths during a PI [pandemic influenza] outbreak.” According to the plan, the office would respond to such a crisis by enhancing its medical transport teams. The H1N1 virus, which is nowhere nearly as deadly as Covid-19, brought hospitals “to their knees,” said Dr. Conrad Fischer, a residency program director in internal medicine at Brookdale University Medical Center in Brooklyn. An official with Bellevue Hospital said that a temporary morgue outside NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan has in recent days been stood up to help house the remains of COVID-19 victims. The New York Post first reported the news. Another issue for responders will be handling significantly more burials and cremations than is typical. Federal assistance may be available to help with that potential challenge, and it would need to work in tandem with state and local officials.  More than 50,000 Americans have tested positive for Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, and at least 800 have died from it, according to constantly updated numbers from Johns Hopkins University. New York has been particularly hard-hit, with more than 25,000 positive cases in the state and about 16,000 in the city alone, per city and state information.  Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed New York state residents on March 20 to stay at home, and has temporarily banned “all non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason,” per an announcement on a state government website.  A spokesperson for HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether New York officials had asked for assistance from the teams; neither did a spokesperson for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Dept. of Health or New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office. Spokespersons for DHS headquarters also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","NYC morgues near capacity, DHS briefing warns",2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/dhs-briefing-nyc-morgues-near-capacity-148259,politico

The House could pass the package as soon as Thursday — assuming not one of the 430 lawmakers objects — clearing the historic package for President Donald Trump’s signature by the end of the day.  The package — the largest of its kind in history — comes after five days of tense negotiations between Senate leaders and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It includes a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance, a rescue fund for state and local governments, immediate cash for hospitals and a huge pool of grants and loans for small businesses. It is Congress’s third major bill in response to the crisis, which has infected 55,500 Americans and brought the U.S. economy to a standstill, and will not be the last. “In effect, this is a wartime level of investment into our nation,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor at about 1:30 a.m. as he announced the accord with Democrats and the White House.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered strong praise for the Senate deal in a Wednesday morning statement, saying the package has evolved enormously from the bill McConnell was pushing over the weekend. “The Republican bill proposed by Senator McConnell on Sunday was a non-starter,” Pelosi said. “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people.” Hours after the deal was announced, legislative staff were racing to finalize thousands of pages of highly complex text. The Senate is expected to easily clear the agreement, and then depart Washington, where it’s unclear when they will return. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday the “odds are high” that senators will return to Washington at some point to work on an additional rescue package.  ""We should be willing, able to come back in a bipartisan way and do more if we need it, and I believe we'll probably have to do that, one way or another,” he said.  But there are still big questions about the House’s timeline.  As she arrived in the Capitol on Wednesday morning, Pelosi said Democrats are still reviewing the details and wouldn't commit to holding a vote that same day. ""We’ll see the bill, and see when the Senate votes. So there’s no decision about timing until we see the bill,"" Pelosi told reporters. In her statement Wednesday, Pelosi touted the Democratic wins secured in the multi-trillion dollar deal, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals, a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits and federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid industries. But Pelosi and other top Democrats will need to begin selling the deal to their members if they hope for a quick vote in the House.  Pelosi fielded a series of questions and concerns from House Democrats on a two-hour caucus call Tuesday. Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), leader of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, sharply criticized Democrats’ strategy so far. Murphy said House Democrats’ decision to release their own $2.5 trillion proposal — a wishlist more than anything — distracted from the ongoing Senate negotiations and put the caucus’ most vulnerable members in a defensive crouch. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), leader of the caucus’ progressive wing whose home state has been hit especially hard by the virus, also spoke up on the call, saying she had several questions she wanted answered about benefits for immigrants, worker protections and federal oversight, before agreeing to pass the bill via unanimous consent. To that end, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has scheduled a series of calls with specific committee chairs through the day. Democrats can dial in and ask specific policy questions about the Senate deal. Those calls, which run from 11 a.m. until 7 p.m., are designed to get the caucus comfortable with the massive deal, which lawmakers will only likely have hours to read before voting. Pelosi said she plans to bring up the bill in a way that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington, through “unanimous consent,” a legislative maneuver generally reserved for quick passage of noncontroversial legislation. A single lawmaker, however, could object to that motion, requiring the House to pivot to other options, including bringing members back to Washington for a roll call vote or even proxy voting. A Democratic report released earlier this week outlined the various voting options, strongly endorsing unanimous consent as the best way forward in the current crisis. Some progressives have raised concerns with the bill on Twitter, though many Democrats say their caucus would not ultimately be willing to jeopardize the emergency aid. House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there's a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement, and discussed it on a whip team conference call Tuesday evening. But passing the rescue package by voice vote is another viable option that allows almost all lawmakers to remain in their home districts and is being discussed within the GOP conference, the source added. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who frequently objects to Congress’s biggest spending packages and isn’t beholden to party leadership, has also scoffed at the deal on Twitter, calling it “a raw deal for the people.” “It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor,” he wrote early Wednesday.",Senate readies vote on massive coronavirus rescue package after early morning deal,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/senate-vote-coronavirus-rescue-package-deal-148135,politico
"Congress gave $100 billion in emergency funding to hospitals bracing for coronavirus under a massive stimulus package congressional negotiators sealed overnight. Lawmakers will also bump Medicare payments for coronavirus-related treatment, though it’s unclear by how much, and provide $1 billion to the Indian Health Service. An outline of the deal from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer didn’t detail whether the package restricts how the money should be distributed to help health care providers treat infected patients and stave off financial losses stemming from pandemic. An earlier version of the fund from Senate Republicans and House Democrats gave the Trump administration wide latitude to distribute the bailout. The funding, one of the last sticking points in high-stakes talks that stretched over five days, amounts to a major win for hospital lobbies, who had recently intensified calls for a rescue fund to offset huge revenue losses from cancellation of lucrative elective surgeries and major costs from a flood of Covid-19 patients needing critical care. Some cash-strapped rural and safety net hospitals have already warned about their ability to make payroll after calling off non-emergency procedures. The American Hospital Association, along with the American Medical Association and American Nurses Association, had asked for $100 billion late last week, while for-profit hospitals pushed for more than double the amount. HHS declined to comment on any discussions about how the department plans to distribute the funds. However, once Congress passes the stimulus, possibly as soon as Wednesday, the lobbying battle will likely shift to the executive branch. Provider lobbyists in the past several days moved the needle considerably on funding talks. In their initial plan released last week, Senate Republicans left out any direct funding and instead called for suspending the 2 percent Medicare rate cut from the ongoing sequester while boosting Medicare payments related to Covid-19 treatment by 15 percent. They later proposed $75 billion in grants and other direct funding in an amended package over the weekend, before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Monday countered with her own stimulus package that boosted the number to $100 billion. Senate Democrats led by Schumer, who has close ties to his state's hospitals, had sought even more — closer to the $225 billion pushed by the for-profit hospital lobby Federation of American Hospitals. Schumer claimed Wednesday’s compromise boosted hospital funding by $55 billion over the Senate GOP’s earlier proposal.",Congress gives hospitals $100B they demanded in coronavirus package,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/congress-hospitals-coronavirus-funding-148152,politico
"President Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to feign mock excitement over Sen. Mitt Romney’s announcement of his negative coronavirus test, tweeting glibly about the global public health threat now bearing down on members of Congress. Sharing online an article from the alt-right media outlet Breitbart News regarding the Utah Republican’s test results, Trump wrote: “This is really great news! I am so happy I can barely speak. He may have been a terrible presidential candidate and an even worse U.S. Senator, but he is a RINO, and I like him a lot!” The president’s post came hours after Romney tweeted on Tuesday afternoon that he had tested negative for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Romney was tested after he came into close contact with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who tested positive and has faced intense criticism for potentially infecting other lawmakers. Despite Romney’s negative results, he wrote that “guidance from my physician, consistent with the CDC guidelines, requires me to remain in quarantine as the test does not rule out the onset of symptoms during the 14-day period.” Romney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the president’s tweet. His wife, Ann, has long battled multiple sclerosis, a neurological disease that could make her, like others with underlying conditions, more vulnerable to the coronavirus. Both Romney and Utah’s other senator, Republican Mike Lee, had begun self-quarantining after Paul’s diagnosis on Sunday. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.) is also self-quarantining in Washington after potential exposure earlier this month. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) finished a quarantine period on Monday. On the other side of the Capitol, Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Ben McAdams (D-Utah) have tested positive for COVID-19 after developing symptoms last weekend. House members are largely working from home as the crisis escalates and the health risks posed by colleagues become more urgent. The coronavirus’ outbreak within Washington’s halls of power have winnowed the number of lawmakers present to vote on critical pieces of legislation — including an imminent, nearly $2 trillion stimulus package — and provoked consideration of potential emergency measures such as remote voting to ensure continuity of government throughout the pandemic.",‘I am so happy I can barely speak’: Trump whacks Romney after negative coronavirus test,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/donald-trump-mitt-romney-coronavirus-test-negative-148069,politico
"“THIS IS WHY WE NEED BORDERS!” President Donald Trump tweeted on Monday morning. He offered no additional context, but it’s safe to assume the “this” in his tweet was the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. In recent months, his administration has taken progressive action to strengthen borders and travel controls in response to the virus. Trump isn’t alone: Leaders around the world have restricted nonessential travel to varying degrees, some sealing off their borders entirely, to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. They’re following a playbook centuries old, dating back to at least the Black Death of the 14th century. In fact, countering disease was one of the main justifications for early border controls at a time when boundaries between countries were marked more by contested territories than firm divisions. (It would not be until the 1600s that an atlas with delineated borders between European countries was published.) In the past, these measures might have worked. But the history of disease-driven border lockdowns has some sobering lessons. One is that border controls tended to long outlast whatever crisis they were supposed to prevent, at the expense of trade and free movement. And they’re also very much a relic of their times. More recent disease eradication efforts, and the broad path of the coronavirus itself, show that prolonged border controls are more an expression of xenophobic policy than an enduring solution to an infectious threat. Today, there’s far more to gain through international cooperation than by keeping borders locked down. A closer look at how governments successfully sealed off their countries in the past to prevent disease is enough to show that the scale of international travel and porousness of borders today is incompatible with such fixes long term, and that similar impulses today will take us only further from real solutions. During the Black Death, the city-states of Italy used expanded border controls as part of their efforts to keep the plague at bay. Florence imposed fines on visitors from plague-affected cities and issued passes to travelers deemed healthy enough to move freely. In 1348, Venice began preventing ships in the harbor from docking for 30 days to see whether those on board came down with the plague. Venetian colonies and others followed suit. By 1383, Marseilles, France, had extended the isolation period to 40 days, leading to the to the term “quarantine” (from the Italian for 40: “quaranta”). Italian states used systems of armed patrol ships, observation posts and horse patrols to enforce disease controls that lasted until the 1850s. The enforcement of that quarantine period was one of the earliest forms of regulating ship travel and was used during plague outbreaks for centuries afterward. The infrastructure and regulation for those systems became permanent, such as the designation of particular ports of entry and patrols to make sure they were used. The last European outbreak of plague attacked Marseilles in 1720, the result of lax enforcement of a quarantine on a ship from plague-ridden Cyprus. After it subsided in Europe, the Black Death continued to ravage the Ottoman Empire. In the 1730s, Austria’s Sanitary Court Commission recommended a series of inspection stations along the border with Ottoman lands. People and goods were both quarantined, although practices and periods varied—tobacco leaves spread out and aired for seven days were considered purified, for example. Many travelers were held in quarantine for as long as 48 days, and if they developed plague symptoms, they could be shot. Similarly, evading the quarantine system was punishable by death. The system lasted until 1871.  Border controls against plague appeared to have helped—if you hold infected fleas and people in isolation for long enough, the fleas die and the people either die or get better. Certainly, the Austrian Empire remained free of plague after the middle of the 18th century. And, perhaps as a result, travel and trade restrictions became an increasingly popular tool against the threat of new infections. The United States quarantined ships to prevent the spread of yellow fever in the 1790s, a practice repeated during subsequent outbreaks into the 19th century, and France briefly closed the border with Spain to prevent the spread of the same disease. In the 19th century, a number of countries briefly imposed quarantines in an attempt to protect against cholera.  Those controls, short of total exclusion, proved an ineffective tool against both diseases, in part because yellow fever is mosquito-borne and in part because, by the mid-19th century, it was simply too difficult to implement a leak-proof system of inspection, control and quarantine at borders. But that did not stop continued adoption of border controls.  As we see today with a surge in anti-Asian discrimination, it is not just that disease is associated with international travel and migration; it is associated with foreigners. This, too, is nothing new: Jews were blamed for the Black Death and burned to death in pogroms. The Irish were blamed for bringing cholera to the United States and the Italians for spreading polio. Tuberculosis was called “the Jewish disease.” Syphilis, first recorded in Europe infecting the armies of Charles VIII of France as he was fighting in Naples, was referred to as the Naples Disease, the Spanish sickness, the French Pox, the German Sickness and the Polish sickness as it spread—the name based on a combination of local prejudice and the course of infection. When it got to the Middle East, it was called “the European pestilence.” Infection also became the justification for increasingly strict migration restrictions in countries, including in the United States. The Immigration Act of 1891, which provided a foundation for federal oversight of migration, banned criminals, polygamists, prostitutes, contract laborers, and those with a “loathsome or contagious disease.” It was increasingly used to selectively exclude ethnic groups considered undesirable. From 1898 to 1915, the proportion of immigrants denied access to the United States on medical grounds climbed from 2 percent to more than two-thirds. On the Mexican border, federal officials stripped migrants naked and showered them with kerosene. Some of America’s first undocumented immigrants were those who crossed unguarded sections of the Rio Grande rather than submit to the medical exam; up until that point, Mexican migrants hadn’t needed travel documents.  Infection as an excuse for nativism continues today. In 2014, Representative Phil Gingrey of Georgia wrote to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over disturbing “reports of illegal immigrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus, and tuberculosis.” The reports would have been considerably more concerning had they been accurate. That same year, private citizen Donald Trump pushed for travel bans covering Africa to respond to the Ebola outbreak. And the past few weeks have seen Trump declare that wall-building would protect the United States from a disease far more prevalent here than in Mexico, while battling to rename COVID-19 the “Chinese virus.” But the evidence continues to mount that, in a world of massive cross-border flows of people, border controls and travel bans simply aren’t an effective tool to keep infections at bay—not in the long term. Effective pandemic response takes the fight to the pandemic; it doesn’t wait for the pandemic to reach us. We know that from the most successful campaign against infection in history: the global fight against of smallpox. Led by the World Health Organization, that worldwide effort involved cooperation between Cold War rivals the United States and the Soviet Union to provide vaccines, equipment and technical advice to teams across the globe that monitored for outbreaks and responded with an immediate “ring vaccination” of contacts to limit the disease’s spread. The result: Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980, and a disease that killed hundreds of millions of people in the past century has killed no one so far in the new millennium. Certainly at this point in the COVID-19 outbreak, few people should be going to an airport or getting on a plane at a time when we’re trying to limit social contact. But after the immediate crisis of this pandemic has abated, the United States should be leading an effort to strengthen global capacity to respond to outbreaks. And there is a long way to go: In 2013, out of 193 member countries, the WHO found only 80 met the International Health Regulations with regard to core capacities required for hazard alert and response to disease outbreaks that might become pandemic. The U.S. Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future estimates that $4.5 billion a year would buy strengthened national health systems, international coordination and funding for research and development, and financing for coordination that would address some of the most urgent weaknesses in global health security. That number pales in significance compared with the multitrillion dollar price tag already attached to the economic disruption triggered by COVID-19. For all the Trump administration has begun to take the coronavirus pandemic with the seriousness it deserves, the response has been slow and parochial. By the time a global pandemic threatens again, America should be part of a coordinated worldwide response that reduces the risk of outbreak, tackles outbreaks that do occur where they emerge, and cooperates on global response from vaccine production to cure research. Because in the long run, borders—and certainly walls—simply don’t stop viruses.",Pandemics Close Borders—And Keep them Closed,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-borders-history-plague-146788,politico
"To anybody suddenly tuning into the president’s news conference this Monday evening, it might have seemed like the leader of the free world was channeling an off-hours televangelist, taking advantage of a pandemic to offer a hazy tale of a miraculous cure. “… a gentleman,” Donald Trump intoned from inside the White House, invoking an antimalarial remedy called hydroxychloroquine, “they thought he was not going to make it. He said goodbye to his family. They had given him the drug just a little while before, but he thought it was over. His family thought he was going to die. And a number of hours later, he woke up, felt good. Then he woke up again, and he felt really good. And he’s in good shape. And he’s very happy.” The drug, if it works on Covid-19, would be, he said, “a gift from God.” This brief, almost mystical tale came at the eight-minute mark of the first hour of another installment of what has become a new American serial drama. Over the past two weeks, Trump has embarked on a striking chapter of his optics-obsessed presidency, turning the all-but-abandoned briefing room into the set of a largely unscripted television series that has gripped, worried and (depending on one’s political affiliation) infuriated viewers. Stripped of the weapon of his rallies, of “chopper talk,” of the sorts of set pieces to which the populace had grown accustomed over the three-plus years he’s been commander in chief, Trump as a president in crisis has engineered something different. While governors from New York to California have staged almost daily briefings, offering a traditional mixture of stern warnings and words of comfort, Trump has created something more like a show built on narrative surprises and populated with familiar characters—the good doctors, the bad reporters, the loyal lieutenants. And in the middle of it all, playing the role of the ringmaster, the marketer and the brander, and the self-professed expert, is Trump. His mood and his message have ebbed and flowed, alternately boasting and bashing, soothing and striking, intermittently solemn, flippant and peeved, flouting facts and shifting blame, underplaying dire projections and overselling potential vaccines. “He is,” former Trump Organization executive Barbara Res told me, “being himself.” The president’s political career has been shaped deeply by his experiences as the star of “The Apprentice,” for which he developed the “Mr. Trump” boardroom persona and his trademark judgmental pout. He entered the Oval Office urging aides to see his administration as a show in which he battles rivals, and he has duly done his part, serving up twists and turns and clear-cut conflicts with recurring and easily identifiable enemies (the news media, the Democrats, “Sleepy Joe Biden,” “the Chinese virus”). But the program he now has constructed out of the news briefings has drawn an audience far beyond even what he found with his invariably provocative tweets or his rallies packed with MAGA-capped fans. The enormity of a worldwide plague has galvanized the attention of the entire nation, every corner of which has been touched by the spreading disease. For the public, a portion of which had tuned out or become numb, these briefings have amounted to a reintroduction of sorts to the man who is their president—“the most present human being I ever met,” as a Trump associate told biographer Wayne Barrett some three decades back, “the episodic man,” as psychologist Dan P. McAdams writes in a book out just last week. “The endless quiz show, the endless soap opera,” Trump biographer Gwenda Blair told me the other day. “It’s never over with him. He’s always going to have something to make you tune in again.” “What he’s doing in these briefings is not that different than what he’s ever done,” McAdams said in an interview. “The difference now is that we are in a unique historical period … and so everything that the president does in a situation like this gets magnified”—the airy, unfounded assurances, the casual advocacy of untested potential treatments based on “just a feeling,” the intensely personal sparring with Peter Alexander from NBC, his snide comment about the self-quarantining Mitt Romney. It all might kind of feel more or less like typical Trump shtick—if not for the relentlessly grim stakes. What next? “There’s a sense,” added Michael Caputo, a former Trump adviser, “of a cliffhanger at the end of every one—you can almost hear it at the close of every briefing, something straight out of, like, ‘same bat-time, same bat-channel.’” Even when he’s not at the microphone, he never relinquishes the spotlight. In the middle of Monday’s briefing, for instance, Dr. Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, was at the lectern and mentioned that she had stayed home over the weekend on account of a low-grade fever. “Uh oh,” quipped the notoriously germaphobic Trump, theatrically throwing up his hands and moving away from her, eliciting a chorus of camera clicks. But she got tested for the virus, she said, and it came back negative. “Phew,” the president said, flashing a self-satisfied smile. With hundreds of millions of people justifiably freaked out and cooped up, cable news networks’ ratings are rising. Some polls say Trump’s approval ratings are doing the same. And these new daily doses of Trump keep getting longer. Slowly but surely, they’re tending toward later in the day, too, edging into prime time, reportedly no accident. Monday’s was the longest one yet. It lasted 10 minutes shy of two hours, pushing into the 8 p.m. hour. “I’ve gotten to like this room,” Trump said. Immersed in the world of TV—as an inveterate watcher, as a proven practitioner—Trump has settled into a formulaic rhythm. The briefing almost always starts with him. It almost always ends with him. He initially had deputized Mike Pence, of course, to head up his administration’s coronavirus response, but the spread and its consequences kept getting worse and the vice president continued to receive a share of praise, and Trump, two weeks or so ago, began to reclaim center stage. “He’s his own best messenger, and he’s his own best strategist, always,” former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg told me this week, “and at this point he realizes he needs to be the public face of the U.S. response to this pandemic.” Why? “His presidency is at stake.” And the briefing room? “The perfect setting.” After halting, uneven performances from inside the Oval Office and outside in the Rose Garden, Trump kicked off the regular stretch in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room on March 14. “Thank you very much,” he said to start, a little after noon, describing “the results” of that day’s meeting of the coronavirus task force as “very, very good.” Since then, Trump has been introducing the members of his supporting cast—the doctors, the admirals and the Cabinet secretaries, and the public health pros—“fantastic,” “very talented,” “highly respected” “incredible patriots,” as he has put it. “We’ve created a number of new stars,” he said that Saturday. (In the past, it’s how he would talk sometimes about his ex-wives.) He has stoked fights with stock foes—discerning, nonfawning reporters—and he has crowd-tested terms to label the enemy at hand. When he hasn’t called it “the Chinese virus” to effectively wink at the nativist parts of his base, Trump has dubbed Covid-19 “an invisible enemy,” “the toughest enemy,” “this hidden scourge.” Touting bold declarations of nonspecific actions, loosely tied to vague, noncommittal windows of time, deploying his well-practiced spoken stop signs (“excuse me,” “just so you know”), and leaning hard on his superlative-laced lexicon (“never been done,” “not even close,” “tremendous” and “incredible” and “dramatic” and “historic”), Trump has searched in this most vexing trial of his life for ways to do what he’s always done—declare victory. In a quiet admission that there’s next to nothing he can spin into a win, at least right now, he has hailed successes from the past and pledged triumphs in the future. “… numbers like no other country has ever done before, number one in the world, if you go back two weeks …” “… everything was really hunky-dory …” “… we will win …” “… even faster than we thought …” “… our country is going to bounce back like you’ve never seen before.” He airily has offered unsurprisingly generous self-assessments about his performance and that of his team. “We’ve done a fantastic job,” he said in one briefing. “I’d rate it a ‘10,’” he said in another. When pressed for nettlesome particulars, he has stepped aside for Pence, for Birx, for immunologist and task force member Tony Fauci and others—resolutely, practically reflexively shifting the blame. To his predecessors (“we inherited a very obsolete system”). To (Democratic) governors. To China. “Where are the tests?” Trump was asked on March 18. “I’ll let Mike answer that,” he said. The masks? This was the next day. “Vice president?” the president said. “Your administration,” a reporter asked on March 22, “eliminated a key position in China in July—a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s Disease Control Agency—and it was just months before the first cases were spotted in Wuhan. So the question is, basically, why the post was eliminated …” “Anybody?” Trump said, looking at the people with him on the stage. And the showman president has ended every briefing with promises of more to come. “We’re making a lot of progress,” he said Friday, “and we’ll see you folks tomorrow.” “Tomorrow,” he said Saturday. “Tomorrow,” he said Sunday. There are limits, needless to say, to Trump’s attempts to shoehorn what he accomplished with his raucous rallies into this smaller, staider space, and with a steadily shrinking audience of socially distancing reporters who are focused on one subject only—the most sweeping public health emergency in more than a century. Without, say, a Mark Burnett on hand to hack at the narrative incoherence and mold the visceral, minute-to-minute ad-libbing into some tidy, salable shape, Trump in the course of these briefings so far has ended up (as he has done throughout the bulk of his existence) often contradicting himself. Untethered from what he has said in the past, unbothered by what he might have to say in the future, focused totally on what he must do to fight his way through the immediate present, Dan McAdams’ “episodic man” has called the press “very fair,” “very fair” … and then “very dishonest”—coming to an especially ugly head in the interaction with NBC’s Alexander. “What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?” Alexander asked. “I say that you’re a terrible reporter,” Trump said. “That’s what I say.” He called the coronavirus “the Chinese virus,” “the Chinese virus,” “the Chinese virus,” day after day after day—until he didn’t. “It seems,” he said Monday, “that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian-Americans in our country. And I don’t like that at all. These are incredible people. They love our country. And I’m not going to let it happen.” He has dubbed himself “a wartime president” while nonetheless insisting the federal government is not “a shipping clerk” for necessary medical supplies. He often has placed the onus on governors. “We’re sort of a backup for the states,” he said Sunday. He has gone from being upbeat one day to dour the next. “We’re going to be so good,” he said March 15. “It’s bad,” he said March 16. “It’s bad.” “August. Could be July. Could be longer than that,” he said that day, responding to a question concerning when normalcy might return. As much as five months or more. But he lost patience with those sober projections just a week into the war. “It’s not going to be three or four months,” he said, “as some people were saying”—first and foremost himself. “America will again, and soon, be open for business—very soon—a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner.” “Easter,” Trump said during Tuesday’s briefing. “What a great timeline that would be.” What a good story. What a pleasing finale to this season of the show.",The New Trump Show: ‘I’ve Gotten to Like This Room’,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-white-house-briefing-room-press-conference-147571,politico
"NEW YORK — With officials warning of medical shortages and tabloids reporting horror stories like a 39-year-old coronavirus victim found dead on her kitchen floor, much of the nation is looking at New York City with fear and foreboding. “We are your future,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told the country during a briefing on Tuesday morning. ""New York is the canary in the coal mine,” he said. “New York is going first. We have the highest and the fastest rate of infection. What happens to New York is going to wind up happening to California, and Washington state, and Illinois. It's just a matter of time. We're just getting there first."" But not all public health experts share Cuomo’s certitude on the point of whether other parts of the country will soon experience outbreaks comparable with New York City’s. ""Nobody knows the specific answer to that,"" said Joseph Vinetz, an infectious diseases specialist at the Yale School of Medicine.  Indeed, POLITICO interviews with five leading public-health specialists indicated that while Cuomo’s point is well taken — there likely will be other places where the level of contagion will equal New York’s — there are also reasons to be hopeful that the transmission of the virus will be slower, and less widespread, in many parts of the country. Among the factors that make New York more vulnerable are its extensive public transportation system and its sheer size. New York is both the country’s most populous city and its most densely populated. Vinetz said both the city’s high density and the fact that it is densely populated across a large region could be exacerbating factors. Vinetz also cited the city’s status as a hub for global travel as a factor that could be contributing to the outbreak there.  Joshua Epstein, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s school of global public health, cited other reasons as to why New York’s experience might not be replicated elsewhere. He pointed as well to preliminary evidence suggesting that the virus spreads more easily in northern latitudes than it does in warm, humid environments, as one possible reason for the severity of New York’s outbreak. But there are too many unknowns to draw firm conclusions at this point, and residents of the rest of the country should not assume they will avoid New York City’s fate, experts said.  “Some places will be affected more than others and some places will be affected earlier than others,"" said William Hanage, professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “However, everywhere should be preparing for this.”  Hanage said the evidence presented so far that the virus spreads more easily in cold climates is slight, and that in general, it was premature to be making specific forecasts based on New York’s experience.  Hanage’s advice to the rest of the country, when drawing lessons from New York, is to, ""Look at it. And don’t think that it won't happen to you."" Indeed, interviews with New York residents and officials suggested that both the New York lifestyle — replete with shoulder-to-shoulder public transportation, frequent dining out because of the limits of apartment living, and reliance on crowded city parks for daily recreation — as well as a certain stubbornness in curbing it may have contributed to New York’s high infection rate. “We're used to the city being our living room,” said Michael Hendrix, director of state and local policy at conservative think tank the Manhattan Institute. “We have smaller living quarters; we live with roommates. We make this choice because New York City has so much to offer.” But he pushed back on the idea that density alone was responsible for New York’s fate, citing similarly dense Asian cities that have so far fared better. “Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo also have density and nowhere near the kinds of outbreaks we have,” Hendrix said. “Density also requires good governance coupled with reinforced strong social norms to counter the spread of contagious disease. What you’re seeing today is the fruit of a slow government response to a crisis.” While Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio have been ahead of the federal government in issuing calls for social distancing, an early spate of mixed messaging from elected officials may have led some New Yorkers — especially those who perceive themselves as young and healthy — to take unnecessary risks. Many seemed to believe that it was important to avoid indoor crowds but still safe to spend the day at the farmers market or lounging around Brooklyn’s Prospect Park as the weather warms up.  Less than three weeks ago — March 5 — de Blasio took a subway ride to show his confidence in the safety of the city’s transportation system and his administration told the city’s 4.3 million straphangers that they were safe riding in jam-packed subway cars as long as no one coughed or sneezed directly on them.  “We have the best public health professionals in the world protecting you,” said de Blasio as he boarded the train. “Right now, all over the city, there are doctors and nurses and disease detectives and all sorts of other folks out there trying to make sure everyone is safe.”  Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the NYU School of Medicine, cited “leakage in social isolation” from contact closer than six feet in places like subway stations. “The bottom line is we interact and have, if not intimate contact, but pretty close, not 6-feet-apart contact, with a lot of people,” Caplan said. With slow guidance and lax enforcement of social distancing guidelines, Cuomo said Monday night that the COVID-19 wave will crash on New York City’s health care facilities and inundate the system over the next 10 to 21 days — a rate in line with the federal estimate. “The New York metro area of New Jersey, New York City, and parts of Long Island have an attack rate close to one in 1,000. This is five times what the other areas are seeing,” Dr. Deborah Birx, White House Coronavirus Task Force response coordinator, said Monday evening. “Clearly, the virus has been circulating there for a number of weeks to have this level of penetrance into the general community.”  New York City has 15,597 COVID-19 cases and 192 deaths as of Tuesday night. The hospitalization rate is about 18 percent, according to data from the mayor’s office. Cuomo claims the high rate of cases is correlated to testing at “the highest per capita level in the United States.”  “No one is testing more than we are testing,” he said Tuesday. Yet New York City changed its guidance on March 20 to suspend general testing and only use equipment and supplies on patients most likely to test positive — confirmation needed for health care professionals to administer experimental treatments. The city also discourages health care workers from getting tested —a policy medical professionals argue puts them and their families at risk of being patients in the hospitals already overrun with COVID-19. Out on the streets, older New Yorkers sometimes compare today’s hardships with those that followed the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001. Back then, there was a gaping hole in downtown Manhattan and New Yorkers were told to go about their normal lives in defiance of terrorism and windblown missing person signs. Now, the city’s skyline is untouched, but its once-bustling city streets are desolate and the storefronts and restaurants are already collecting dust. “After 9/11 the call to New Yorkers was to find strength in the social life of the city and everything that entails,” said New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot. “Residents found comfort in our artistic, cultural, culinary and sports communities, among others. What we’re asking of New Yorkers is so different right now.”  Nonetheless, public-health experts say other cities — and suburbs and even rural areas — need to follow New York’s lessons about social distancing right now, as they worry about facing a similar fate. Vinetz, the Yale University infectious-disease specialist, emphasized that communities will differ in their levels of coronavirus, but said state and local leaders around the country should take their cues from New York in helping their people prepare for the worst. “Gov. Cuomo is becoming a hero because of his straight talk,” Vinetz said. “Have a straightforward, blunt-speaking, rational and reliable leader, and people respond very well to that.""",‘We are your future’: Will all of America become like New York?,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/new-york-coronavirus-147262,politico
"Doctors and nurses are increasingly worried they will become the spreaders of the coronavirus rather than the healers, as hospitals themselves become a hot spot for the pandemic. That fear is already a reality in Italy, the global epicenter of the pandemic, where researchers have found hospitals overloaded by coronavirus patients have become transmission points. Public health officials, like those at the World Health Organization, have increasingly warned that health care workers themselves could be vectors for the disease — accelerating its spread and undermining the ability of countries’ health systems to combat it. U.S. hospital staff worry a similar scenario could play out here, according to 10 health care workers who responded to a POLITICO survey and others who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs. In an open call for hospital workers to tell us what they're seeing, dozens of others cited concerns about equipment and testing shortages, as well as sickness among hospital staff. Essential gear protecting providers is woefully inadequate and could remain so in some areas for weeks, despite assurances from federal officials that more specialized masks and surgical gowns are on their way. And because of a widespread lack of testing, frontline workers said they are treating patients without knowing if they’re infected — and that the coronavirus could spread not just to doctors and nurses, but security and cleaning staff as well. Several American health workers have already died after contracting the virus. In a suburb of Washington, D.C., one major health system isn’t sending sick staff home, even when their symptoms indicate a possible coronavirus infection, according to a nurse who said she took vacation time to self-quarantine after getting symptoms, including a low-grade fever. She’s still waiting for test results she had to drive to another Virginia county to get. In hard-hit New York City, a critical care nurse reported that a sick hospital clinician has exposed a long-term patient to the coronavirus. POLITICO is withholding the names of most facilities in this story on the request of workers who feared retribution for speaking out. The outbreak in Italy could hold important lessons for the worst that could come to America. Physicians handling the brunt of that country's outbreak, to reduce transmission in hospitals, are encouraging mobile clinics and even moving ventilators into patients' homes. ""We are learning that hospitals might be the main COVID-19 carriers, as they are rapidly populated by infected patients, facilitating transmission to uninfected patient,"" Italian doctors wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine recently. In Washington state, an early epicenter of the country’s outbreak, the virus had been “blossoming” undetected in some hospitals for weeks, according to a physician with CHI Franciscan’s network of hospitals there. Early in the outbreak, one patient with an unrecognizable cough had already infected some frontline staff by the time the person’s COVID-19 test came back positive, the physician said. And this wasn’t an isolated case. The physician reported that over the weekend clinicians — unprotected at the time due to the protective mask shortage — came into contact with patients whose tests came back positive. “I don’t think the problems are any different in our system than elsewhere. It's just that we haven't gotten the surge completely yet,"" said the physician, who credited the health system for shutting down elective surgeries over 10 days ago, before there was mounting pressure on hospitals to do so. A spokesperson for the hospital system said all staff members are being screened before entering a facility and health care workers who are ""coughing, have a fever, or feel ill"" are asked to stay home. “These are not normal times, and we are doing everything we can to keep our staff and patients safe, while also conserving masks under the latest local CDC guidelines,"" said Carly Evans, the spokesperson. Evans said the system’s hospitals are sharing resources and “working very hard to find more resources as soon as possible."" In Connecticut, a nurse at a community hospital said her facility is giving providers just one specialized mask to treat coronavirus patients; they put a face shield in front of the mask to protect it and reuse both. Those who aren’t treating coronavirus patients or suspected cases don’t use the masks, but there’s still fear that the infection could spread. “Am I going to bring this home to my kids? Am I going to bring this home to my husband?” said the nurse, whose spouse is a first responder. Many hospitals are urging patients who aren’t very sick to stay at home, and some are conducting tests in isolation tents or screening patients in their cars. The Trump administration has urged hospitals to postpone nonessential elective procedures, such as cataract surgery and colonoscopies. There's been resistance among some hospitals which depend on the lucrative procedures, though, and some health workers expressed concern to POLITICO that those could further spread the virus throughout hospitals. Federal officials say they’re prioritizing measures to keep health care workers safe. President Donald Trump said this week that FEMA is distributing 8 million special medical masks and 14 million surgical masks to areas around the country, particularly where they're needed most. FEMA has received 6.5 million more in donations. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, the nation's top doctor, said he's heard concerns around the country about protecting health workers. “I want health care workers of America to know, we are fighting for you each and every day to make sure you get what you need from the stockpile, to make sure you get what you need from manufacturers across America,"" Adams said during a Fox News virtual town hall on Tuesday. For weeks, however, state officials and hospitals have urged the federal government to provide more protective equipment. Some frontline health workers made pleas on social media. Others crafted their own surgical masks and have taken to recycling whatever gear they can. “Hospitals are in a tough position,"" said an emergency physician based near Oakland, Calif. ""Because all the leadership would prefer to have more equipment available and the sudden surge of demand has put all these hospitals in this untenable position of trying to procure something that needs massive manufacturing.” In some parts of America, the risk of infection isn’t confined to hospitals directly treating coronavirus patients. It appears to be spreading through facilities connected to health systems. One Indiana nurse who works at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic next to a hospital said she had virus symptoms and went through multiple phone screenings while her supervisors debated how to handle the situation. One supervisor said she should get tested, but another manager reversed that decision. She said she was cleared to return to work as soon as she recovered from her low-grade fever, even though she hadn't completed the typical 14 days of quarantine for people who've been ill or directly exposed to the virus, and she was still coughing. She still doesn't know if she had the virus, and she and her colleagues don’t typically wear protective masks since they work outside the hospital.

"Over the past week, as President Donald Trump’s top officials came to the lectern to give their updates, they first gave thanks.  “Let me start by thanking you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for your decisive leadership,” offered Attorney General William Barr.  “Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President for your tireless leadership,” proclaimed Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. “Today's announcement is just the latest in a long line of bold, decisive actions the president has taken to protect Americans from the coronavirus spreading across our borders,” remarked Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.  And as they talked, they peppered their remarks with frequent reminders of who they served — “at the president’s direction,” “with the president’s leadership” — as their boss stood watching. At the White House podium over the past few weeks, each member of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force has been cognizant of two messages: one for millions of Americans; another for the man just a few feet away. Even the health experts — many of them not political appointees — have made sure to deliver some praise to the president to help the medicine go down as they dish out some of the more dire predictions about the growing pandemic. Critics have noted that aides have been premature at times to lavish compliments on the president as they continue to fight the virus. They compared the constant thank-yous to Trump’s televised Cabinet meetings, during which Trump went around the room and had each senior official praise him.  “It undermines the credibility of the experts. … What people need are the facts. They don’t need experts spending time fluffing up the commander in chief,” David Lapan, a former Pentagon spokesperson and vice president of communications at Bipartisan Policy Center said. The effusiveness has even caught on among late-night comedians. “The Daily Show” relabeled the task force “The Coronavirus Thank Force” in a video that compiled each member’s hyperbolic praise. For Trump, it’s a management style that goes back decades.  “He never told us to do it, but we picked it up,” said Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization vice president who worked for him for 12 years. “Delivering any kind of bad news to him involved some kind of buildup. You’d have to first say what a great decision he’d made on another project and how well everything was going, and by the way … ”  “People picked up really quickly that he needed to be flattered,” she added.  For those who know the president, public praise and flattery are a valuable political currency. Trump has been noticeably more gracious toward several Democratic governors during the coronavirus outbreak, often citing their praise of his current leadership. The president on Sunday noted that state governors were “very, very complimentary” on a recent nationwide coronavirus call. “I watched, over the last few days, Gov. [Andrew] Cuomo, I watched Gavin Newsom,” Trump said, referencing the Democratic governors in New York and California, two of the hardest-hit states. “I watched both of them. And they’ve been, you know, very complimentary.” It’s a dynamic, the president warned during an interview on Fox News on Tuesday, governors must be aware of. “It’s a two-way street,” Trump said. “They have to treat us well, also. They can’t say, ‘Oh, gee, we should get this, we should get that.’” Unable to hear the roaring cheers at his campaign rallies due to coronavirus cancellations, the president has turned to his daily news briefings to get national attention and hear congratulatory remarks, sometimes at the expense of delivering accurate statements about the disease. The president is hyperaware of TV ratings, which are compiled weekly for him in the White House, and viewership of the briefings during the daytime hours have seen a notable spike as Americans anxiously watch from home. Administration officials say it’s an opportunity for experts from the task force to answer questions, but it also gives the president a national platform to assure the public and offer himself a pat on the back. “Many doctors, I’ve read many, many doctors, can’t believe the great job that I’ve done,” Trump said, without offering specifics, even as health professionals have publicly warned of severe equipment shortages.  “Europe was just designated as the hot spot right now, and we closed that border a while ago. So that was lucky or through talent or through luck. Call it whatever you want,” Trump said, referring to his decision to cut off most travel from Europe and China to the United States. Like many of Trump’s rhetorical quirks — hyperbole, casual bragging — his desire to be lavished with praise is something that is often inconsequential. But in a moment of crisis, Trump’s critics say it distracts from important messaging efforts. “Pre-crisis, that stuff is mildly annoying but it’s not harmful,” Lapan, the ex-Pentagon spokesman, said. “In the midst of a pandemic, it’s potentially harmful. We want facts, we want clear information from experts; we don’t need to spend time mixing the message by praising the president.” Nancy Cook contributed to this report.",How to update the country on coronavirus: Thank Trump first,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/update-country-coronavirus-thank-trump-147625,politico
"The far-right’s most zealous Trump supporters have set their sights on Dr. Anthony Fauci.  To the vast majority of Republicans, the entire medical community and the country at large, Fauci is the government’s leading infectious disease expert, respected for providing Americans with consistent, factual information about the coronavirus pandemic — even if it means contradicting President Donald Trump while he hovers feet away. But to a vocal minority of right-wing blogs and pro-Trump pundits, Fauci is the embodiment of the establishment forces that have been arrayed against the president since he came to Washington. And those voices are getting louder amid rumblings about Fauci’s standing with Trump as the president itches to get the economy restarted in the coming weeks.  “A Deep-State Hillary Clinton-loving stooge,” read a Saturday headline on the American Thinker, a far-right website, latching on to a WikiLeaks-released email that showed Fauci praising Clinton for her Benghazi testimony as secretary of State. “Guy was a Hillary mole,” pro-Trump podcaster Bill Mitchell tweeted on Monday.  “Disrespectful,” read a Monday headline on the right-wing Gateway Pundit, comparing Fauci to ousted general Stanley McChrystal.  The narrative has even started to migrate to Fox News, a key source of information for the president.  “He’ll still have a job at the end of this, whatever happens,” Fox News host Steve Hilton argued during his Sunday night monologue on “The Next Revolution.” “Our ruling class and their TV mouthpieces whipping up fear over this virus, they can afford an indefinite shutdown.”  Fauci’s portrayal in conservative media circles could play a crucial role in the coming days as the country comes to the end of a 15-day period of social distancing and business closures intended to slow the coronavirus outbreak. While public health officials like Fauci have cautioned that the country will likely have to extend that period, Trump and his team are signaling that they want to get people back to work soon, by mid-April if possible. The cues from right-wing media, as split as they are, could influence how much Trump listens to Fauci. “He obviously has the backing of the president right now, but a lot of people on the right in the grass roots are extremely skeptical of this entire coronavirus thing,” said Lee Stranahan, the host of “Fault Lines” on Sputnik Radio, a Russian government-backed media outlet. The coronavirus has killed hundreds in the United States and almost 20,000 worldwide, according to researchers and government officials, overwhelming hospitals and straining global medical supplies. Cases and deaths are expected to keep rising in the coming days.  For the moment, Fauci — director of the National Institute Of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 — still has the respect of large swaths of Trump’s supporters, reflecting the unique fissures that have emerged in the MAGA movement during the coronavirus. Trump supporters who praise Fauci also tend to believe the president should employ swift, severe measures — and keep the economy shuttered — as long as necessary to keep coronavirus under control.  In past, non-pandemic times, the right would have likely unified in rallying against a government official publicly quibbling with the president. But this time, reliable Trump boosters like Breitbart and the majority of the Fox News stable are leaving him alone.  “I think he’s obviously excellent at his job, and I think he’s aware that he’s on that stage to offer detail and help finesse language, and he seems cool with it,” said Raheem Kassam, the former editor of Breitbart London and host of the podcast ""War Room.""  Fauci’s criticism of palace intrigue reporting on his relationship with Trump has endeared even more to this crowd. “Mainstream media and several journalists, especially as it pertains to the White House press corps, are purposely trying to get Fauci to contradict Trump for a juicy conflict in the middle of a pandemic,” said Stephen Miller, a conservative media columnist who contributes to The Spectator USA, the American division of the long-time conservative British outlet.  The New York Times published an article Monday suggesting the president was losing patience with Fauci’s willingness to oppose him in public and in interviews, even as the NIAID director has gone out of his way to praise Trump to more conservative outlets. Miller noted Fauci had implicitly rebuked reporters for asking questions that Fauci said were “pitting one against the other,” calling it “just not helpful” in the middle of the pandemic. Fauci, Miller said, “doesn't appear to want to take the bait.” Instead, it’s the right-wing fringe that has been going after Fauci, largely due to the fact that he tamps down Trump’s excitement over quick-fix solutions, such as the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, his desire for stringent restrictions on gatherings and his publicly dire predictions about the potential death toll that are at odds with Trump’s more optimistic outlook. These figures have been latched on to Fauci for weeks, even if their comments weren’t initially gaining much traction.  “The guy has been around for 50 years yet never thought to prepare for something like this?” griped John Cardillo, a pundit for the Trump-friendly Newsmax, in a March 13 tweet. “Every time he speaks he makes things worse. Maybe he is the problem, not the solution.” “I think a lot of people at this point are looking for an explanation for the very confusing, unprecedented events going on in the world,” said Stranahan, who vehemently opposed attacking Fauci.  Trump on Tuesday tried to quell any rumors of dissatisfaction with Fauci, who was noticeably absent at Monday’s White House coronavirus briefing and a Tuesday afternoon virtual town hall on Fox News.  But then Fauci was there again, at the president’s side, Tuesday night during the latest coronavirus briefing. And Trump praised Fauci early in the day, calling his performance as “very good,” and even appearing to make light on Twitter of a much-shared meme showing Fauci facepalm as the president jokingly used the term “deep State Department.” Regardless, Trump does have a history of sidelining administration officials who disagree with him, from former White House counsel Don McGahn to ex-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.  In this case, however, much of the conservative world, including many Trump supporters, would prefer to keep Fauci in his role.  “What I would say to the president is that we’re all in this thing together and people have come to recognize Fauci alongside Trump as a solid team up there, so why change it?” Kassam argued. That won’t stop the hardcore MAGA fanbase from going after Fauci. Hours before Trump praised Fauci on Tuesday, Mitchell, the Trump-friendly podcaster, tweeted a fresh Fauci-bashing article from the far-right site Big League Politics.  “Dr. Fauci Wants America to Become a Police State Like China in Order to Stop Coronavirus.”",Anthony Fauci becomes a fringe MAGA target,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/anthony-fauci-fringe-maga-target-147401,politico
"The Department of Homeland Security stopped updating its annual models of the havoc that pandemics would wreak on America’s critical infrastructure in 2017, according to current and former DHS officials with direct knowledge of the matter. From at least 2005 to 2017, an office inside DHS, in tandem with analysts and supercomputers at several national laboratories, produced detailed analyses of what would happen to everything from transportation systems to hospitals if a pandemic hit the United States. But the work abruptly stopped in 2017 amid a bureaucratic dispute over its value, two of the former officials said, leaving the department flat-footed as it seeks to stay ahead of the impact the COVID-19 outbreak is having on vast swaths of the U.S. economy. Officials at other agencies have requested some of the reports from the pandemic modeling unit at DHS in recent days, only to find the information they needed scattered or hard to find quickly.  And while department leaders dispute that, others say the confusion is just the latest example of the Trump administration’s struggle to respond to an outbreak that has sickened more than 50,000 Americans and threatens to overwhelm hospitals and other health care providers. Officials are now scrambling to secure enough masks, respirators and ventilators to meet the rapidly exploding need. Doctors and nurses are reusing their protective gear as supplies dwindle; governors are begging the administration for federal help that has been slow to arrive. The models — primarily computer simulations that seek to anticipate the interaction of millions of Americans and U.S. infrastructure systems — were overseen by the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center, a program that has been run by a shifting alphabet soup of agencies within DHS, reflecting the continual bureaucratic reshuffling that has plagued the department since its inception in 2002.  Some of the modeling unit’s analyses looked at what would happen if a large portion of the U.S. workforce — say, 40 percent — got sick or couldn’t show up at work to maintain and operate key aspects of the national infrastructure, such as the systems that keep planes flying safely. The reports were meant to guide policymakers toward areas that would demand their attention in the event of an outbreak. One 2015 DHS report, based partly on data produced by NISAC, warned that America’s public and private health systems might “experience significant shortages in vaccines, antivirals, pharmaceuticals needed to treat secondary infections and complications, personal protective equipment (PPE), and medical equipment, including ventilators.” Juliette Kayyem, a senior DHS official in the Obama administration, praised the quality of the NISAC reports she received when she was at the department, and criticized DHS for being “singularly focused on border enforcement” under Trump at the expense of properly planning for other threats, like a pandemic. “We should not be surprised that a department that has for the last 3½ years viewed itself solely as a border enforcement agency seems ill-equipped to address a much greater threat to the homeland,” she said. In recent days, as the government raced to address the growing demands, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services asked their counterparts at DHS to dig up some of the old reports and analyses, according to two former DHS officials. The request came from within HHS’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, which works to ensure that the country has enough medical equipment and drugs to deal with public health emergencies and everyday health needs. But Homeland Security officials initially had trouble finding some documents related to planning for a pandemic, including 2007 and 2009 pandemic reports, as well as a report produced for a 2014 exercise held by senior policymakers, according to the former officials — although some were eventually found and put in a ZIP file sent to HHS. “Nobody even knew where any of the documents were anymore,” one of the former officials said. “It’s really just a source of frustration.” The former DHS officials said if the pandemic models had been maintained properly, the administration might have had an earlier understanding of where shortages might occur, and acted accordingly to address them. “A lot of what we’re doing now is shooting in the dark, and there’s going to be secondary impacts to infrastructure that are going to be felt in part because we didn’t maintain these models,” said one of the former DHS officials. “Our ability to potentially foresee where the impacts are or may manifest is a result of the fact that we don’t have the capabilities anymore.” The pandemic models emerged as part of a broader shift in the federal government’s thinking after Hurricane Katrina, when DHS and FEMA came under heavy criticism for their response to the disaster. With those searing lessons still fresh, DHS broadened its focus from a narrow set of issues — primarily terrorist attacks within the United States — to preventing and preparing for all types of emergency events. The department began modeling and analyzing how severe events, including a pandemic, could affect critical infrastructure and hit supply chains. Some of the predictions in the July 2015 DHS report were eerily prescient about the kinds of issues that the U.S. has faced in recent weeks because of the coronavirus; the report said that “a severe influenza pandemic could overwhelm the Healthcare and Public Health Sector in as little as 3-6 weeks” and warned that healthcare facilities in cities could be swamped. The report also warned that basic medical supplies for emergency services could be at risk because they’re dependent on “just-in-time” deliveries of health care supplies, and a big increase in demand during a pandemic would make it harder for them to get what they need. Much of the blame for the switch in focus at DHS, according to two of the former officials, falls on longtime DHS employee Robert Hanson, who became division director of prioritization and modeling at the department’s Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis in May 2016. When he was elevated to that job, Hanson wanted to focus more on visualizations of events like hurricanes and “going down rabbit holes that really didn’t need to be done,” according to one of the former officials. He also wanted to focus more on elections and cybersecurity because “cyber is the magic word to attract money,” said the other former official.  “They’ve allowed a lot of capability to decay, including the pandemic models and transportation models and a whole bunch of other stuff in favor of chasing the soccer ball on different cyber things,” including trying to use machine learning and AI in work on cybersecurity, this person said. In an interview, Hanson acknowledged reallocating some funding away from pandemic modeling to other topics of research because he had “been given direction by my leadership at the time to reprioritize a lot of the projects,” and he agreed it was necessary. He also said when he took over the modeling program, it was considered “ineffective” by DHS leadership and by executive branch overseers.  Hanson thought, too, that pandemic modeling was best done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the former DHS officials said, although the CDC’s mandate is different and researchers there don’t focus on how a pandemic could affect infrastructure not related to health care. After an uprising by staff last year who complained about what they called his abusive management style and lack of leadership, Hanson was removed as the assistant director of analysis at the National Risk Management Center, OCIA’s successor organization, according to the two former DHS officials. Hanson and his deputy, Carmen Zapata, were detailed elsewhere within DHS. Explaining his departure, Hanson said he “had made such fundamental changes to the program that some of the staff were unhappy with me and were going to see me as an object of ire so I decided to leave.”  NISAC, the DHS office that oversaw the models, began as a partnership between the Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories in 1999 but in 2003 was folded into DHS by the USA Patriot Act and in 2014 put under OCIA, which has listed analyzing “pandemic influenza” as a top priority. The program’s costs were considerable: The government had to regularly purchase data sets to keep the models current, while also paying for coding, operations and maintenance, along with the original development costs. From six and 10 people at Los Alamos were focused on pandemics and a total of 60 to 70 people at DHS and the national labs had some role in the models, according to one of the former officials. Beginning under the George W. Bush administration, all critical infrastructure in the U.S. was segregated into different categories, which now comprise 16 sectors. DHS was made a lead agency for 10 of them, including IT, communications, critical manufacturing and commercial facilities. The DHS models were designed to look at the impacts of a pandemic on the different sectors within the department’s bailiwick, as well as other sectors that touched on homeland security. For instance, one report NISAC worked on for a table-top exercise looked at how to combat a hypothetical epidemic in Southeast Asia, what travel restrictions to put in place and how to design social distancing to stop the epidemic inside the United States. The simulations the modeling unit produced also helped the department understand the impact a pandemic might have on its own workforce. More than 9,700 DHS employees are quarantined or self-monitoring because of the virus, and 73 employees were confirmed or presumed COVID-19 positive as of Monday, according to a person familiar with the numbers. The modeling unit’s work also addressed real-life impacts to infrastructure due to smaller-scale outbreaks, including the H5N1 bird flu in 2007, H1N1 in 2009, Ebola in 2014 and the Zika virus in early 2016. During the Ebola outbreak, the Obama White House asked the unit to support its decision-making on deliberations about banning travel from certain countries based on risk, whether to close any borders and how to spend money on airport screening, according to one of the former DHS officials. Reports based on the models were usually emailed to DHS leadership and sometimes officials in the White House. There were also about 20,000 people on the distribution list, including a wide group of critical infrastructure owner-operators and state officials. Some of the papers ran to 150 pages. It wouldn’t be easy for DHS to rebuild its capacity to model pandemics, given the brain drain within the department: Many of the people who worked on the models have now scattered across the government or left government service altogether, one of the former officials said.  “There’s no institutional memory whatsoever,” this person said. NISAC was “really, really good” about studying the impacts of pandemics, a former Trump official said, but there’s been “so much turnover that people just don’t know that [their work] exists and there’s been very poor work to catalogue and keep lessons learned.” Hanson insisted that DHS maintained the capability at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and that the system is still being used today by DHS to inform decisions on the coronavirus across the federal government, but he couldn’t recall the full name of the PNNL staffer he said was in charge of the model now. Meanwhile, current officials are left essentially to reinvent the wheel in the middle of a pandemic that has already claimed more than 600 American lives.  Bob Kolasky, director of the National Risk Management Center, OCIA’s successor organization within DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, recently told employees to write a plan for how to respond to the virus by early this week, but some employees aren’t confident that any plan they come up with will actually be used, according to one of the former DHS officials. Asked for comment, Kolasky said his division of DHS “has been out front and actively working with partners to provide guidance as they make risk-based decisions during the COVID 19 response. The National Risk Management Center continues to use NISAC, along with other government and private sector resources, to provide valuable insight and assessments to our stakeholders.” “I’ve heard people say it’s a black swan. It’s not a black swan,” said one of the former DHS officials. “This is the whitest of white swans. This was absolutely inevitable, and the fact is we didn’t even maintain the capacity that we had or even the records of what we had done so that information could be quickly located and turned over to people who are making the critical operations right now.” Betsy Woodruff Swan contributed to this report.",DHS wound down pandemic models before coronavirus struck,2020-03-24,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/dhs-pandemic-coronavirus-146884,politico
"Last updated 8:39PM Tuesday | Next update: 12PM Wednesday States have enacted a wide range of policies in an effort to ""flatten the curve"" and address the economic effects of the novel coronavirus. While all 50 states have declared states of emergency, giving governors emergency powers, the policy response from states has been wide-ranging.  We tracked seven metrics using data from the Kaiser Family Foundation to pull apart the differences in how states are responding to the outbreak. Five of the statewide metrics are aimed at mitigating the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, such as closing all nonessential business. Two metrics track health policy enacted by the states, including paid sick leave for affected workers. California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have initiated the most comprehensive policies. They've closed all bars and restaurants except for takeout and delivery, banned all gatherings, ordered mandatory statewide quarantine, closed all nonessential businesses, and closed all schools. California and Washington have also enacted paid sick leave for workers. Mississippi and Oklahoma are on the other end of the spectrum. Neither has instituted social restrictions outside closing schools. Many states have limited the operations of dining establishments to prevent the spread of the disease among crowds, requiring bars and restaurants to either shift to takeout-only operations or close down entirely. Though the development of a coronavirus vaccine is likely more than a year away, many states have already enacted policies dictating that the vaccine be provided to all residents for free. Lawmakers pushing for this argue the high cost of vaccinating the population for free pales in comparison to the cost of failing to do so and having the virus resurge in the future.  Many states have banned large gatherings to slow the spread of the virus, but there is wide variation on what constitutes a “large gathering.” As the crisis has worsened over the past few weeks, states have brought down the size of allowed gatherings from 1,000 to 250 to 50 to just 10.  States hardest hit by the virus have implemented broad mandatory quarantine orders, also referred to as “shelter in place” or “stay at home” policies. Though the policies vary between states, residents are generally instructed to stay at home unless going out for essential activities, such as grocery shopping.  Many states have ordered all business deemed nonessential to temporarily close, while those like grocery stores, pharmacies and hospitals that must continue operating need to implement strict safety guidelines for workers. States have differed on whether abortion clinics and gun stores, among other businesses, should be deemed essential.  A handful of mainly progressive states have enacted laws expanding paid sick leave for workers who contract coronavirus or who must care for a loved one who becomes infected. Before the outbreak, many workers had little or no guaranteed paid leave, including millions of people in the gig economy.  Nearly every state in the nation has closed its schools out of fear that large groups of children would become petri dishes for the virus. The move has, however, created other problems, as many low-income children depend on free school meals and many parents who have to continue going to work or work from home now have to care for their children.

"As congressional leaders haggled over a $2 trillion emergency economic relief bill on Tuesday, President Donald Trump mocked House Democrats for stuffing their own rescue proposal with priorities unrelated to the coronavirus crisis—especially one priority he famously hates. “They had things in there that were terrible,” Trump complained during his virtual town hall on Fox News. “Windmills all over the place, all sorts of credits for windmills!” In fairness to the Democrats, their 1,400-page draft had nothing about windmills. But in fairness to Trump, windmills were among the few Democratic priorities that didn’t appear in the “Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act” that the House floated Monday night. The proposal did include extra funding for workers and families, but also for Supplemental Dairy Margin Coverage, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts—even though the Kennedy Center is closed—and hundreds of other government programs and services unrelated to the emergency. Congressional leaders didn’t use the House draft as the basis for the stimulus deal they struck early Wednesday morning, but they did fund quite a few of its provisions—from modest items with little connection to the pandemic, like $12.5 million for the Bureau of Reclamation or $25 million for the Kennedy Center, to $25 billion for ravaged transit agencies. And Congress is expected to pass more stimulus bills in the coming months, so the House proposal still bears a very close look as a preview of how Democrats plan to use their leverage. It also gives Republicans some talking points about the random taxpayer-funded goodies their opponents are pushing during a crisis. What’s in it? Even though airports are virtually empty, and the Transportation Security Administration has never had less to do, the Democrats proposed $26 million for overtime for TSA employees. They also slipped in $20 million to help the TSA to buy new swabs for detecting explosives, a worthy security measure that lacks any apparent connection to the pandemic, $31 million for “bio-surveillance of wildlife,” and $45 million to help the Agricultural Marketing Service grade commodities like beef, eggs and, well, pork. Agricultural anything tends to attract bipartisan support, and the final stimulus deal included that entire $45 million request. But suffice to say that if Christmas trees were graded, the House’s draft would be USDA Prime, while the final deal would probably be closer to U.S. Standard. And in an economic crisis, congressional grab bags can be politically toxic. In 2009, Republicans successfully branded President Obama’s stimulus bill as a dog’s breakfast of traditional big-government spending—including “sod on the Mall,” “smoking cessation,” “herpes prevention” and other line items that didn’t even make it into the final bill. Now some former Obama aides are afraid congressional Democrats might be walking into the same “Porkulus” trap. Obama’s $800 billion Recovery Act helped end the Great Recession, but Republicans hammered away its laundry-list optics so relentlessly that within a year, the percentage of Americans who believed it had created jobs was smaller than the percentage who believed Elvis was alive. Like Winston Churchill’s apocryphal pudding, the Obama stimulus lacked a theme, and Democrats seem to be repeating their public-relations mistakes. “Have we learned nothing?” asked Jared Bernstein, who worked on the Recovery Act as chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden in the Obama White House. It’s not just that the House bill veers away from the pandemic or even the economy. The bill simply reads like a typical congressional appropriations bill, with plus-ups like $100 million for NASA construction and environmental compliance and the Legal Services Corporation, as well as $300 million for the National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities and Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The only real difference is boilerplate language justifying most of the plus-ups “to support activities to prevent, prepare for and respond to coronavirus,” from the $20 million for the Bureau of Reclamation to the $33 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s not all relatively small-ticket items, either; the Postal Service got $25 billion, plus $11 billion worth of debt forgiveness and $15 billion in new borrowing authority, which is real money even by congressional standards. The bill included a major bailout of underfunded multi-employer pension plans that coal miners, Teamsters and other labor groups have been pushing for years, as well as a $10,000-per-borrower reduction in student loan debt. “Skimming it, I was struck by: ‘What does all this shit have to do with anything?’” another Obama White House veteran said. Last year, Republicans turned a few off-message lines in a Green New Deal memo written by a staffer to Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez into a mantra that Democrats were determined to ban cows and airline travel. Now some Democrats—including some aides to Biden, who oversaw the Recovery Act for Obama and is now the party’s presumptive presidential nominee—fear that history will repeat itself over the Democratic wish list. In fact, one message Republicans kept repeating Tuesday was that the Democrats were already trying to use the economic relief bill to pass a backdoor Green New Deal, even though the House draft had almost nothing related to energy or climate change. “This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal,” Trump tweeted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered an angry floor speech about “completely non-germane Democratic wish-list items,” in which he only specified two—tax credits for wind and solar energy, which were not even in the Democratic proposal, and emissions restrictions for bailed-out airlines, which were. “Democrats won’t let us fund hospitals or save small businesses unless they get to dust off the Green New Deal,” McConnell declared. The 2009 stimulus did include down payments on several of Obama’s long-range policy priorities, including education reform, scientific research, infrastructure, and yes, green energy, which received a whopping $90 billion that helped create booms in wind, solar, electric vehicles and LED lighting. The current House bill takes a different approach, calling for modest spending increases for a grab bag of federal agencies and services but actually limiting its major investments in longstanding Democratic priorities to issues with some nexus to the current crisis. For example, the Democrats pushed for dramatic spending increases on unemployment insurance, which they got, as well as paid sick leave and family leave to help workers stuck at home during the pandemic and a national vote-by-mail system to make sure the coronavirus doesn’t prevent Americans from casting ballots in November, which they didn’t get. But other than the money for struggling transit agencies and a $1 billion program to help bailed-out airlines replace high-polluting airplanes with more efficient ones, the House bill mostly ignores the calls from climate hawks for a game-changing down payment on a Green New Deal. Some Democrats disgusted by the House bill’s cats-and-dogs approach argue that if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was going to push for anything other than containing the virus and helping cash-strapped families, she should have pushed for more transformative spending that would put Americans back to work over the coming year—like a Marshall Plan to rebuild American infrastructure, or a nationwide initiative to install rooftop solar. “If you’re going to Christmas-tree this up and spend $2 trillion, why not go big?” asked Kenneth Baer, the former communications director for Obama’s budget office. Everyone in Washington knows that a crisis can be the best way to ram some pet ideas through, and the Senate Republican proposal, weighing in at a mere 247 pages, includes some efforts to use the crisis to push longstanding conservative priorities, like language limiting aid to health providers that accept Medicaid patients, promoting abstinence education and cutting taxes on certain investment income. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been using the crisis to try to tighten border restrictions, restrict asylum claims, cancel union elections and give the Justice Department the power to detain Americans indefinitely without trial during emergencies. And since the final congressional compromise includes some of the esoteric Democratic wish list, Republicans who vote for it will to some extent own it. But if the Capitol Hill negotiations exposed the GOP as the stingier party when it comes to helping workers and vulnerable families, and the more generous party when it comes to helping bailed-out companies avoid strict conditions, the House bill does reinforce stereotypes as the Democrats as the party of big government, exploiting a pandemic to pour taxpayer dollars into heating assistance for the poor, runaway youth programs, and subsidies for little-used airports serving smaller cities. It wouldn’t be a Democratic economic relief bill without an extra $1 billion for Head Start, even when Head Start programs are shuttered for the pandemic. In 2009, Republican mockery of random projects financed by the Obama stimulus—“turtle tunnels,” “honeybee insurance” and a drug addiction study that the GOP shorthanded as “cocaine monkeys”—helped persuade the public it had nothing to do with jobs, even though subsequent studies found that it helped save millions of jobs. McConnell is the master of that game, and the Democrats who thought they could win it more than a decade ago remember that they ended up losing the House, the Senate and eventually the White House. “I don’t want to get into fights over either side’s wish list,” Bernstein says. “I think the politics are prohibitive, and the urgency is getting money out the door.”",‘Have We Learned Nothing?’,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/25/coronavirus-economy-stimulus-house-democrats-148512,politico
"NEW YORK -- For weeks, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has mostly played nice with the Trump administration, taking a calm and measured approach toward the federal government -- even as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has lashed out at Trump for neglecting his home town in a public health crisis. The differing temperaments between the two officials – Cuomo with a cool executive air bordering on aloofness, de Blasio with an us-against-them pugnaciousness – provided a stark contrast to people outside the tri-state area who were just tuning in to New York’s growing coronavirus crisis. That appeared to change on Tuesday, when Cuomo directed the full weight of his fury at the administration as the spread of coronavirus in his state threatened to spiral out of control. “The president says it’s a war,” Cuomo fumed, his voice rising at a press conference at the Javits Center, the massive Manhattan convention hall now being turned into an emergency hospital. “Well then act like it’s a war!” Faced with New York’s need for 30,000 ventilators to keep virus patients alive when the spread of the virus peaks - which could happen in as soon as two weeks - the federal government has sent 400 from its stockpile.  ""You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators,"" an angry Cuomo demanded. But within a day – after a mollifying conversation with Trump -- Cuomo was back on his steady course. ""It's something our team is working on with the White House team and I want to thank the president for his cooperation and his team for their cooperation,"" Cuomo said on Wednesday, referring to the supply-chain problems facing New York’s medical authorities. Cuomo’s calculation seems to be that a softer approach would get him further with a president known for being susceptible to flattery.  “I can tell you he is fully engaged on trying to help New York. He’s being very creative and very energetic, and I thank him for his partnership,” Cuomo said last week, after chatting with Trump about a Navy ship dispatched to New York harbor to serve as an emergency hospital. That ship, the USNS Comfort, it turned out, would not be ready for weeks. And so it has gone in Cuomo’s two-step with Trump on the health crisis, where gains for New York have often been followed by setbacks.  De Blasio has been less delicate with the president, consistently berating him for a slow federal response to the spiraling health crisis. “The fate of New York City rests in the hands of one man. He is a New Yorker. And right now, he is betraying the city he comes from,” the mayor told reporters last week.  In other appearances, de Blasio has labeled Trump his generation’s Herbert Hoover for his response to the pandemic and accompanying economic crash.  As the first cases of coronavirus hit New York, both men sought to avoid panic, encouraging New Yorkers to go about their lives while taking sensible precautions. They even held a dual press conference at the beginning of the month.  That was a rare occasion for two men whose dislike of each other is well known to their New York constituents. De Blasio, who won a longshot bid for mayor in 2013, fashioned himself the progressive alternative to Cuomo's brand of centrism, but the governor seemed to delight in undermining him at every turn. In their six years in office, they've feuded over matters as grave as the spiraling homeless population and dire conditions in the city's public housing and as trivial as the fate of a single deer found in Harlem. When coronavirus hit, both shared an interest in sparing New Yorkers from the brunt of the virus. But as circumstances grew more dire, and much of New York was forced into shutdown, their approaches diverged -- and occasionally devolved into the one-upmanship that has long characterized their relationship outside times of crisis. When de Blasio warned New Yorkers last week to prepare for a shelter in place order, Cuomo quickly shot down the idea. Days later, Cuomo issued just such an order, but said he did not want to call it shelter in place because the term is alarmist.  Cuomo pre-empted de Blasio’s announcement that New York City schools would close, making the news public just moments before de Blasio did. On Sunday, the two had wildly different takes on how city-dwellers were responding to the state’s stay at home order, with Cuomo saying he was so dissatisfied that New York City needed to come up with a plan within 24 hours to ensure people followed instructions. Cuomo, who has marshaled sweeping emergency powers for himself in the midst of the crisis at the expense of localities like New York City, sought to project command of the situation and stuck with a mostly measured tone, leaving it to de Blasio to sound the alarm about the federal government’s perceived failures.  Trump seemed to notice the difference, dismissing de Blasio when he was asked about the mayor’s charges of betrayal. “I’m not dealing with him. I’m dealing with the governor. And the governor agrees with me, and I agree with him,” he said on Friday. “I guess they’re not agreeing with each other, necessarily.” Yet by Tuesday, as the fast-moving pandemic claimed more New Yorkers’ lives, the mayor and the governor were united in their anger at the Trump administration. As Cuomo lashed out in his Javits Center press conference, de Blasio warned that the few ventilators the feds have delivered would buy the city only days. “Some days you need the carrot, and some days you need the stick. Today is a stick day,” said New York political strategist Stu Loeser, who was press secretary to former Mayor Mike Bloomberg.  He said that Cuomo’s anger, deployed sparingly, could be more effective than the bashing from de Blasio, who has criticized Trump more consistently during the pandemic and lacked the same “give and take.” “I think Gov. Cuomo wakes up every morning, to the degree that he sleeps, looks at the data on infections in New York, and looks as best he can at the president’s mood, and sets his course for the day based on both of those pieces of information,” he said.  In a virtual town hall from the White House’s Rose Garden Tuesday, the tentative truce between Cuomo and the administration still seemed intact, with Vice President Mike Pence saying he’s had continued meetings with both Cuomo and de Blasio and publicly assuring leaders the federal government “will make those resources available.” Four thousand ventilators will be sent to the state in the next two days, Pence said. But Trump did not take as well to his sometime ally’s criticism. The president appeared next in the Fox News event and railed on Cuomo for “complaining,” saying the federal government is doing “definitely more than anybody else” when it comes to helping out the state. Trump referred to a report — presumably this op-ed that ran in the New York Post by former Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey, a Republican -- saying that in 2015 the state declined the option to buy thousands of ventilators. “I'm not blaming him or anything else,” Trump said. “But he shouldn't be talking about us. He's supposed to be buying his own ventilators. We are going to help. But if you think about Governor Cuomo, we are building him four hospitals. We are building him four medical centers. We are working very, very hard for the people of New York. We are working along with him. Then I watch him on this show complaining.” For Cuomo, who has mobilized his resources and Rolodex to unparalleled levels this month, the tone shift on Tuesday seemed based on an inability to understand why the federal government wouldn’t similarly exhaust all avenues. The federal government can order manufacturers to build ventilators under the Federal Defense Production Act, Cuomo said. He, as governor, cannot. “Only the federal government has that power,” Cuomo said. “And not to exercise that power is inexplicable to me.”",Cuomo and de Blasio show different faces of anger,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/cuomo-de-blasio-new-york-coronavirus-response-148462,politico
"Republican governors are following the advice of public health experts and embracing coronavirus lockdowns and business closings despite President Donald Trump's push to reopen parts of the country by Easter. Trump's press to scrap social distancing in all but the most virus-ravaged areas — and statements implying the fight to contain the disease have turned a corner — have rankled some GOP governors consumed with efforts to contain transmission and ease the burden on stressed local health systems. ""You can’t put a timeframe on saving people’s lives. We’re going to make decisions based on the scientists and the facts,"" Maryland's Larry Hogan, chairman of the National Governors Association, said on Wednesday. Hogan's frustration burst into the open Tuesday, when he blasted Trump during a CNN interview for sending ""pretty confusing"" messages on the virus that don't sync up with the experience on the ground. “Most people think we’re weeks away from the peak, if not months. That’s the advice we’re getting from the smart folks at Johns Hopkins, the National Institutes of Health, the University of Maryland, places like that,” Hogan said. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, who presides over a state Trump won with more than 68 percent of the vote, on Monday ordered residents to stay home after the confirmation of the first case of community transmission, in a nursing home. Justice ordered the state’s National Guard to test everyone at the facility in a bid to control further transmission. Such moves are more than a display of independence. Governors traditionally have the final say in public health crises and can declare emergencies to speed a response. New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo twice in the last decade temporarily suspended state laws and regulations to administer shots to children during season flu outbreaks. Pennsylvania Democrat Tom Wolf used similar powers to respond to the opioid crisis in his state in 2018. In the case of coronavirus, Trump's optimistic statements have been at odds with the assessments of top scientists and doctors, as well as administration officials such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, who've predicted a formidable battle that could last into the summer. Officials from the World Health Organization warned Tuesday that the United States has the potential to become the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic based on the rapid uptick in confirmed cases. Trump during a Tuesday evening appearance with members of his coronavirus task force suggested that social distancing may still apply to the hardest hit areas like New York state, which has reported over 30,000 cases as of Wednesday. He said he will decide whether to extend nonbinding federal social distancing guidelines next Monday, 15 days after his administration first made the recommendations. But Trump's suggestions that the nationwide fight may already be winding down were at odds with efforts in some Republican-led states that seem to be just starting to ramp up their mitigation strategies, with more lockdowns and stay-at-home orders on the way. Hogan this week ordered all nonessential businesses in Maryland closed, saying people weren’t taking social distancing guidelines seriously enough. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp hasn’t gone as far as issuing a lockdown order, but on Monday announced the closure of bars and nightclubs and banned public gatherings of 10 or more people. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Tuesday intensified his state’s aggressive social distancing efforts and signaled he was not willing to lift restrictions just to help the economy. “We save our economy by first saving lives. And we have to do it in that order,” DeWine tweeted. DeWine on Sunday issued a “shelter in place” order through April 6 for residents to stay in their homes for all but essential outings and closed nonessential businesses. Democratic-led states including California, Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey and New York have similar orders under effect. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, meanwhile, during a Tuesday press conference, signaled he may be open to issuing a sweeping statewide stay-at- home order, after the largest counties announced their own lockdowns. Abbott’s lieutenant governor and close Trump ally Dan Patrick created a firestorm Monday night when he suggested he’s had conversations with older constituents who said they would rather die than see the economy destroyed by the coronavirus lockdowns. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another Trump ally, has steered a more independent course, resisting political pressure to issue a shelter-in-place order but saying he would restrict visitors coming into his state from hot spots including New York. Public health experts are most concerned that lifting national guidelines could undermine local, state and federal efforts to flatten the curve of disease spread at a time when they still don't have a firm grip on who is sick and where. “When you look at the country obviously no one is going to want to tone down things when you see what's going on in a place like New York City. I mean, that's just good public health practice and common sense,” NIH infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said during the Tuesday press briefing, with Trump standing nearby. Fauci added that when testing ramps up more across the country, officials will get a better idea of whether they will need to continue federal guidelines for the whole country or if the focus will need to be in only certain, hardest hit areas. Officials in some outlying areas with comparatively few cases appear content to take a wait-and-see approach. South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday said that, based on models, her state doesn’t expect to reach peak infection rate for at least another eight weeks. She hasn’t ordered a statewide lockdown but has restricted business and hospital operations. “Whatever decisions we make ... need to be sustained in the long term,” she said.",Red state governors buck Trump and stick with social distancing,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/republican-governors-trump-social-distancing-148428,politico
"OTTAWA — What was supposed to be a historic display of swift action and cross-party collaboration on Tuesday afternoon staggered across the finish line at 5:51 a.m. Wednesday morning, when Canada’s House of Commons passed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s coronavirus financial aid package after hours of behind-the-scenes negotiations. The bill, which will go to the Senate on Wednesday, allows the government to spend billions to help Canadian individuals and businesses weather the impacts of the novel coronavirus on the economy. But its passage was delayed over provisions in the draft legislation that would have given the Liberal government broad powers to spend money and change taxation levels without parliamentary approval for the next 21 months. The final version, which was debated by a skeleton crew of 30-odd MPs from all parties in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, is a compromise that scales back the new spending powers that opposition Conservatives had referred to as a “power grab.” But the drawn-out process was a strange hiccup in the frenetic pace of announcements from a government trying to navigate a crisis it never anticipated, whose new tagline has become, in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, “Choose speed over perfection.” For hours on Tuesday, the House of Commons hung in limbo as cabinet ministers who’ve been working around the clock milled about, waiting for whatever was coming next. The unusual sitting of the House of Commons got underway at noon, but was suspended minutes later so that parties could continue to negotiate the proposed legislation. More than six hours later, MPs filed back into the House of Commons and voted unanimously to extend the sitting into the evening for still more behind-the-scenes discussion between House leaders. Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez announced just after 2:30 a.m. that an agreement had been reached, and MPs returned to the House of Commons 45 minutes later, where deputy Speaker Bruce Stanton began proceedings with a grim, “Everyone ready?” Two and a half hours later, it was all over, the bill was passed, and MPs began packing up their things before Stanton could even declare the House adjourned. The aid package includes C$27 billion in direct financial support for individuals and businesses and C$55 billion in tax deferrals. Individual measures include a boost to the Canada Child Benefit, money for those who are out of work but don’t qualify for employment insurance and a six-month freeze on student loans. All parties were prepared to support the aid package, but opposition parties took issue with provisions that would have given the Liberal government unilateral power to spend, borrow and change taxation levels until December 2021. Late Monday evening, the Liberals agreed to drop a clause regarding taxation powers, but that wasn’t enough to satisfy the Conservatives. The agreement reached Wednesday morning puts a September 2020 end date on the government’s authority to spend on emergency health measures without parliamentary approval. The government also agreed to report regularly on spending decisions to parliamentary committees. “The Liberals shamefully tried to use a public health crisis to give themselves the powers to raise taxes, debt and spending without parliamentary approval until January 1, 2022,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said in a statement. “But after hours of negotiation, the government has backed down.” After days of rapid decision-making, Tuesday’s roadblock made for a strange, unanticipated lull. The House is officially adjourned until April 20 due to the spread of the coronavirus, and just over 30 MPs had been called back to reconvene the House for this emergency sitting — mostly MPs who live within driving distance and ministers who’ve been staying in Ottawa to deal with the crisis. For hours, they sat scattered about the chamber that normally holds 10 times their number. Several wandered in and out as the hours dragged by, while others chatted in little groups, keeping a healthy distance from each other as they waited for the outcome of negotiations happening outside the House. “What’s going on, Pablo, are we doing this today or no?” Health Minister Patty Hajdu demanded of Rodriguez at one point when he made a brief reappearance. The unexpected delay was, perhaps, a moment of respite for ministers who’ve had little time to pause. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne, always animated, told war stories to other MPs about negotiating by phone with foreign governments to bring home Canadians stranded abroad as more and more countries close their airspace. In Peru, which has recently gone into martial law, Champagne said, planes sent to pick up Canadians are now having to land on a military base. “Everything is an issue. There’s nothing that works normally,” he said. Hajdu chatted candidly with caucus colleagues about the difficulty of scaling up coronavirus testing and getting people to take social distancing seriously. She couldn’t believe people had still been getting on cruise ships even as the virus was spreading around the globe, she said: “For fuck’s sake, people, don’t get on these Petri dishes!” But as the day wore on, patience wore thin. Shortly after 5 p.m., Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet called a press conference in a room three floors below the House of Commons to express his frustration. He said the parties had agreed to changes on Monday night that should have been good enough. “I do not see a reason for it not to go forward now,” he said. NDP MP Lindsay Mathyssen, who was representing her party alongside Leader Jagmeet Singh and one other MP, directed her grievances at the Liberals. “Unfortunately, the government has put in other things by surprise that we weren’t expecting that now have to be negotiated, so it’s taken more time than we would have liked,” she said in an interview. The bill is expected to pass the Senate and become law on Wednesday afternoon. Trudeau spoke to Canadians in the morning. while Freeland and other ministers are expected to hold their daily briefing at noon, as usual. But as the government’s crisis routine shifts back into place, it was those hours before the parties reached an agreement that were the most revealing, when ministers had a moment to stop and reflect. After the pandemic, Hajdu said, everything else is going to seem easy. “I want to socially isolate at home on a lake, but I don’t think I’m going to get to do that,” she told her colleagues at one point. “The world has gone crazy.” Andy Blatchford and Lauren Gardner contributed to this report.

"Congress gave $100 billion in emergency funding to hospitals bracing for coronavirus under a massive stimulus package congressional negotiators sealed overnight. Lawmakers will also bump Medicare payments by 20 percent for coronavirus patients, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office confirmed. An outline of the deal from Schumer didn’t detail whether the package restricts how the money should be distributed to help health care providers treat infected patients and stave off financial losses stemming from pandemic. An earlier version of the fund from Senate Republicans and House Democrats gave the Trump administration wide latitude to distribute the bailout. The funding, one of the last sticking points in high-stakes talks that stretched over five days, amounts to a major win for hospital lobbies, who had recently intensified calls for a rescue fund to offset huge revenue losses from cancellation of lucrative elective surgeries and major costs from a flood of Covid-19 patients needing critical care. Some cash-strapped rural and safety net hospitals have already warned about their ability to make payroll after calling off non-emergency procedures. The American Hospital Association, along with the American Medical Association and American Nurses Association, had asked for $100 billion late last week, while for-profit hospitals pushed for more than double the amount. HHS declined to comment on any discussions about how the department plans to distribute the funds. However, once Congress passes the stimulus, which lawmakers hope to do this week, the lobbying battle will likely shift to the executive branch. Provider lobbyists in the past several days moved the needle considerably on funding talks. In their initial plan released last week, Senate Republicans left out any direct funding and instead called for suspending the 2 percent Medicare rate cut from the ongoing sequester while boosting Medicare payments related to Covid-19 treatment by 15 percent. They later proposed $75 billion in grants and other direct funding in an amended package over the weekend, before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Monday countered with her own stimulus package that boosted the number to $100 billion. Senate Democrats led by Schumer, who has close ties to his state's hospitals, had sought even more — closer to the $225 billion pushed by the for-profit hospital lobby Federation of American Hospitals. Schumer claimed Wednesday’s compromise boosted hospital funding by $55 billion over the Senate GOP’s earlier proposal. The bill also provides $1 billion to the Indian Health Service, which has had early struggles responding to the outbreak.",Congress gives hospitals $100B they demanded in coronavirus package,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/congress-hospitals-coronavirus-funding-148152,politico
"“THIS IS WHY WE NEED BORDERS!” President Donald Trump tweeted on Monday morning. He offered no additional context, but it’s safe to assume the “this” in his tweet was the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. In recent months, his administration has taken progressive action to strengthen borders and travel controls in response to the virus. Trump isn’t alone: Leaders around the world have restricted nonessential travel to varying degrees, some sealing off their borders entirely, to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. They’re following a playbook centuries old, dating back to at least the Black Death of the 14th century. In fact, countering disease was one of the main justifications for early border controls at a time when boundaries between countries were marked more by contested territories than firm divisions. (It would not be until the 1600s that an atlas with delineated borders between European countries was published.) In the past, these measures might have worked. But the history of disease-driven border lockdowns has some sobering lessons. One is that border controls tended to long outlast whatever crisis they were supposed to prevent, at the expense of trade and free movement. And they’re also very much a relic of their times. More recent disease eradication efforts, and the broad path of the coronavirus itself, show that prolonged border controls are more an expression of xenophobic policy than an enduring solution to an infectious threat. Today, there’s far more to gain through international cooperation than by keeping borders locked down. A closer look at how governments successfully sealed off their countries in the past to prevent disease is enough to show that the scale of international travel and porousness of borders today is incompatible with such fixes long term, and that similar impulses today will take us only further from real solutions. During the Black Death, the city-states of Italy used expanded border controls as part of their efforts to keep the plague at bay. Florence imposed fines on visitors from plague-affected cities and issued passes to travelers deemed healthy enough to move freely. In 1348, Venice began preventing ships in the harbor from docking for 30 days to see whether those on board came down with the plague. Venetian colonies and others followed suit. By 1383, Marseilles, France, had extended the isolation period to 40 days, leading to the to the term “quarantine” (from the Italian for 40: “quaranta”). Italian states used systems of armed patrol ships, observation posts and horse patrols to enforce disease controls that lasted until the 1850s. The enforcement of that quarantine period was one of the earliest forms of regulating ship travel and was used during plague outbreaks for centuries afterward. The infrastructure and regulation for those systems became permanent, such as the designation of particular ports of entry and patrols to make sure they were used. The last European outbreak of plague attacked Marseilles in 1720, the result of lax enforcement of a quarantine on a ship from plague-ridden Cyprus. After it subsided in Europe, the Black Death continued to ravage the Ottoman Empire. In the 1730s, Austria’s Sanitary Court Commission recommended a series of inspection stations along the border with Ottoman lands. People and goods were both quarantined, although practices and periods varied—tobacco leaves spread out and aired for seven days were considered purified, for example. Many travelers were held in quarantine for as long as 48 days, and if they developed plague symptoms, they could be shot. Similarly, evading the quarantine system was punishable by death. The system lasted until 1871.  Border controls against plague appeared to have helped—if you hold infected fleas and people in isolation for long enough, the fleas die and the people either die or get better. Certainly, the Austrian Empire remained free of plague after the middle of the 18th century. And, perhaps as a result, travel and trade restrictions became an increasingly popular tool against the threat of new infections. The United States quarantined ships to prevent the spread of yellow fever in the 1790s, a practice repeated during subsequent outbreaks into the 19th century, and France briefly closed the border with Spain to prevent the spread of the same disease. In the 19th century, a number of countries briefly imposed quarantines in an attempt to protect against cholera.  Those controls, short of total exclusion, proved an ineffective tool against both diseases, in part because yellow fever is mosquito-borne and in part because, by the mid-19th century, it was simply too difficult to implement a leak-proof system of inspection, control and quarantine at borders. But that did not stop continued adoption of border controls.  As we see today with a surge in anti-Asian discrimination, it is not just that disease is associated with international travel and migration; it is associated with foreigners. This, too, is nothing new: Jews were blamed for the Black Death and burned to death in pogroms. The Irish were blamed for bringing cholera to the United States and the Italians for spreading polio. Tuberculosis was called “the Jewish disease.” Syphilis, first recorded in Europe infecting the armies of Charles VIII of France as he was fighting in Naples, was referred to as the Naples Disease, the Spanish sickness, the French Pox, the German Sickness and the Polish sickness as it spread—the name based on a combination of local prejudice and the course of infection. When it got to the Middle East, it was called “the European pestilence.” Infection also became the justification for increasingly strict migration restrictions in countries, including in the United States. The Immigration Act of 1891, which provided a foundation for federal oversight of migration, banned criminals, polygamists, prostitutes, contract laborers, and those with a “loathsome or contagious disease.” It was increasingly used to selectively exclude ethnic groups considered undesirable. From 1898 to 1915, the proportion of immigrants denied access to the United States on medical grounds climbed from 2 percent to more than two-thirds. On the Mexican border, federal officials stripped migrants naked and showered them with kerosene. Some of America’s first undocumented immigrants were those who crossed unguarded sections of the Rio Grande rather than submit to the medical exam; up until that point, Mexican migrants hadn’t needed travel documents.  Infection as an excuse for nativism continues today. In 2014, Representative Phil Gingrey of Georgia wrote to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over disturbing “reports of illegal immigrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus, and tuberculosis.” The reports would have been considerably more concerning had they been accurate. That same year, private citizen Donald Trump pushed for travel bans covering Africa to respond to the Ebola outbreak. And the past few weeks have seen Trump declare that wall-building would protect the United States from a disease far more prevalent here than in Mexico, while battling to rename COVID-19 the “Chinese virus.” But the evidence continues to mount that, in a world of massive cross-border flows of people, border controls and travel bans simply aren’t an effective tool to keep infections at bay—not in the long term. Effective pandemic response takes the fight to the pandemic; it doesn’t wait for the pandemic to reach us. We know that from the most successful campaign against infection in history: the global fight against of smallpox. Led by the World Health Organization, that worldwide effort involved cooperation between Cold War rivals the United States and the Soviet Union to provide vaccines, equipment and technical advice to teams across the globe that monitored for outbreaks and responded with an immediate “ring vaccination” of contacts to limit the disease’s spread. The result: Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980, and a disease that killed hundreds of millions of people in the past century has killed no one so far in the new millennium. Certainly at this point in the COVID-19 outbreak, few people should be going to an airport or getting on a plane at a time when we’re trying to limit social contact. But after the immediate crisis of this pandemic has abated, the United States should be leading an effort to strengthen global capacity to respond to outbreaks. And there is a long way to go: In 2013, out of 193 member countries, the WHO found only 80 met the International Health Regulations with regard to core capacities required for hazard alert and response to disease outbreaks that might become pandemic. The U.S. Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future estimates that $4.5 billion a year would buy strengthened national health systems, international coordination and funding for research and development, and financing for coordination that would address some of the most urgent weaknesses in global health security. That number pales in significance compared with the multitrillion dollar price tag already attached to the economic disruption triggered by COVID-19. For all the Trump administration has begun to take the coronavirus pandemic with the seriousness it deserves, the response has been slow and parochial. By the time a global pandemic threatens again, America should be part of a coordinated worldwide response that reduces the risk of outbreak, tackles outbreaks that do occur where they emerge, and cooperates on global response from vaccine production to cure research. Because in the long run, borders—and certainly walls—simply don’t stop viruses.",Pandemics Close Borders—And Keep Them Closed,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-borders-history-plague-146788,politico
"To anybody suddenly tuning into the president’s news conference this Monday evening, it might have seemed like the leader of the free world was channeling an off-hours televangelist, taking advantage of a pandemic to offer a hazy tale of a miraculous cure. “… a gentleman,” Donald Trump intoned from inside the White House, invoking an antimalarial remedy called hydroxychloroquine, “they thought he was not going to make it. He said goodbye to his family. They had given him the drug just a little while before, but he thought it was over. His family thought he was going to die. And a number of hours later, he woke up, felt good. Then he woke up again, and he felt really good. And he’s in good shape. And he’s very happy.” The drug, if it works on Covid-19, would be, he said, “a gift from God.” This brief, almost mystical tale came at the eight-minute mark of the first hour of another installment of what has become a new American serial drama. Over the past two weeks, Trump has embarked on a striking chapter of his optics-obsessed presidency, turning the all-but-abandoned briefing room into the set of a largely unscripted television series that has gripped, worried and (depending on one’s political affiliation) infuriated viewers. Stripped of the weapon of his rallies, of “chopper talk,” of the sorts of set pieces to which the populace had grown accustomed over the three-plus years he’s been commander in chief, Trump as a president in crisis has engineered something different. While governors from New York to California have staged almost daily briefings, offering a traditional mixture of stern warnings and words of comfort, Trump has created something more like a show built on narrative surprises and populated with familiar characters—the good doctors, the bad reporters, the loyal lieutenants. And in the middle of it all, playing the role of the ringmaster, the marketer and the brander, and the self-professed expert, is Trump. His mood and his message have ebbed and flowed, alternately boasting and bashing, soothing and striking, intermittently solemn, flippant and peeved, flouting facts and shifting blame, underplaying dire projections and overselling potential vaccines. “He is,” former Trump Organization executive Barbara Res told me, “being himself.” The president’s political career has been shaped deeply by his experiences as the star of “The Apprentice,” for which he developed the “Mr. Trump” boardroom persona and his trademark judgmental pout. He entered the Oval Office urging aides to see his administration as a show in which he battles rivals, and he has duly done his part, serving up twists and turns and clear-cut conflicts with recurring and easily identifiable enemies (the news media, the Democrats, “Sleepy Joe Biden,” “the Chinese virus”). But the program he now has constructed out of the news briefings has drawn an audience far beyond even what he found with his invariably provocative tweets or his rallies packed with MAGA-capped fans. The enormity of a worldwide plague has galvanized the attention of the entire nation, every corner of which has been touched by the spreading disease. For the public, a portion of which had tuned out or become numb, these briefings have amounted to a reintroduction of sorts to the man who is their president—“the most present human being I ever met,” as a Trump associate told biographer Wayne Barrett some three decades back, “the episodic man,” as psychologist Dan P. McAdams writes in a book out just last week. “The endless quiz show, the endless soap opera,” Trump biographer Gwenda Blair told me the other day. “It’s never over with him. He’s always going to have something to make you tune in again.” “What he’s doing in these briefings is not that different than what he’s ever done,” McAdams said in an interview. “The difference now is that we are in a unique historical period … and so everything that the president does in a situation like this gets magnified”—the airy, unfounded assurances, the casual advocacy of untested potential treatments based on “just a feeling,” the intensely personal sparring with Peter Alexander from NBC, his snide comment about the self-quarantining Mitt Romney. It all might kind of feel more or less like typical Trump shtick—if not for the relentlessly grim stakes. What next? “There’s a sense,” added Michael Caputo, a former Trump adviser, “of a cliffhanger at the end of every one—you can almost hear it at the close of every briefing, something straight out of, like, ‘same bat-time, same bat-channel.’” Even when he’s not at the microphone, he never relinquishes the spotlight. In the middle of Monday’s briefing, for instance, Dr. Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, was at the lectern and mentioned that she had stayed home over the weekend on account of a low-grade fever. “Uh oh,” quipped the notoriously germaphobic Trump, theatrically throwing up his hands and moving away from her, eliciting a chorus of camera clicks. But she got tested for the virus, she said, and it came back negative. “Phew,” the president said, flashing a self-satisfied smile. With hundreds of millions of people justifiably freaked out and cooped up, cable news networks’ ratings are rising. Some polls say Trump’s approval ratings are doing the same. And these new daily doses of Trump keep getting longer. Slowly but surely, they’re tending toward later in the day, too, edging into prime time, reportedly no accident. Monday’s was the longest one yet. It lasted 10 minutes shy of two hours, pushing into the 8 p.m. hour. “I’ve gotten to like this room,” Trump said. Immersed in the world of TV—as an inveterate watcher, as a proven practitioner—Trump has settled into a formulaic rhythm. The briefing almost always starts with him. It almost always ends with him. He initially had deputized Mike Pence, of course, to head up his administration’s coronavirus response, but the spread and its consequences kept getting worse and the vice president continued to receive a share of praise, and Trump, two weeks or so ago, began to reclaim center stage. “He’s his own best messenger, and he’s his own best strategist, always,” former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg told me this week, “and at this point he realizes he needs to be the public face of the U.S. response to this pandemic.” Why? “His presidency is at stake.” And the briefing room? “The perfect setting.” After halting, uneven performances from inside the Oval Office and outside in the Rose Garden, Trump kicked off the regular stretch in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room on March 14. “Thank you very much,” he said to start, a little after noon, describing “the results” of that day’s meeting of the coronavirus task force as “very, very good.” Since then, Trump has been introducing the members of his supporting cast—the doctors, the admirals and the Cabinet secretaries, and the public health pros—“fantastic,” “very talented,” “highly respected” “incredible patriots,” as he has put it. “We’ve created a number of new stars,” he said that Saturday. (In the past, it’s how he would talk sometimes about his ex-wives.) He has stoked fights with stock foes—discerning, nonfawning reporters—and he has crowd-tested terms to label the enemy at hand. When he hasn’t called it “the Chinese virus” to effectively wink at the nativist parts of his base, Trump has dubbed Covid-19 “an invisible enemy,” “the toughest enemy,” “this hidden scourge.” Touting bold declarations of nonspecific actions, loosely tied to vague, noncommittal windows of time, deploying his well-practiced spoken stop signs (“excuse me,” “just so you know”), and leaning hard on his superlative-laced lexicon (“never been done,” “not even close,” “tremendous” and “incredible” and “dramatic” and “historic”), Trump has searched in this most vexing trial of his life for ways to do what he’s always done—declare victory. In a quiet admission that there’s next to nothing he can spin into a win, at least right now, he has hailed successes from the past and pledged triumphs in the future. “… numbers like no other country has ever done before, number one in the world, if you go back two weeks …” “… everything was really hunky-dory …” “… we will win …” “… even faster than we thought …” “… our country is going to bounce back like you’ve never seen before.” He airily has offered unsurprisingly generous self-assessments about his performance and that of his team. “We’ve done a fantastic job,” he said in one briefing. “I’d rate it a ‘10,’” he said in another. When pressed for nettlesome particulars, he has stepped aside for Pence, for Birx, for immunologist and task force member Tony Fauci and others—resolutely, practically reflexively shifting the blame. To his predecessors (“we inherited a very obsolete system”). To (Democratic) governors. To China. “Where are the tests?” Trump was asked on March 18. “I’ll let Mike answer that,” he said. The masks? This was the next day. “Vice president?” the president said. “Your administration,” a reporter asked on March 22, “eliminated a key position in China in July—a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s Disease Control Agency—and it was just months before the first cases were spotted in Wuhan. So the question is, basically, why the post was eliminated …” “Anybody?” Trump said, looking at the people with him on the stage. And the showman president has ended every briefing with promises of more to come. “We’re making a lot of progress,” he said Friday, “and we’ll see you folks tomorrow.” “Tomorrow,” he said Saturday. “Tomorrow,” he said Sunday. There are limits, needless to say, to Trump’s attempts to shoehorn what he accomplished with his raucous rallies into this smaller, staider space, and with a steadily shrinking audience of socially distancing reporters who are focused on one subject only—the most sweeping public health emergency in more than a century. Without, say, a Mark Burnett on hand to hack at the narrative incoherence and mold the visceral, minute-to-minute ad-libbing into some tidy, salable shape, Trump in the course of these briefings so far has ended up (as he has done throughout the bulk of his existence) often contradicting himself. Untethered from what he has said in the past, unbothered by what he might have to say in the future, focused totally on what he must do to fight his way through the immediate present, Dan McAdams’ “episodic man” has called the press “very fair,” “very fair” … and then “very dishonest”—coming to an especially ugly head in the interaction with NBC’s Alexander. “What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?” Alexander asked. “I say that you’re a terrible reporter,” Trump said. “That’s what I say.” He called the coronavirus “the Chinese virus,” “the Chinese virus,” “the Chinese virus,” day after day after day—until he didn’t. “It seems,” he said Monday, “that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian-Americans in our country. And I don’t like that at all. These are incredible people. They love our country. And I’m not going to let it happen.” He has dubbed himself “a wartime president” while nonetheless insisting the federal government is not “a shipping clerk” for necessary medical supplies. He often has placed the onus on governors. “We’re sort of a backup for the states,” he said Sunday. He has gone from being upbeat one day to dour the next. “We’re going to be so good,” he said March 15. “It’s bad,” he said March 16. “It’s bad.” “August. Could be July. Could be longer than that,” he said that day, responding to a question concerning when normalcy might return. As much as five months or more. But he lost patience with those sober projections just a week into the war. “It’s not going to be three or four months,” he said, “as some people were saying”—first and foremost himself. “America will again, and soon, be open for business—very soon—a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner.” “Easter,” Trump said during Tuesday’s briefing. “What a great timeline that would be.” What a good story. What a pleasing finale to this season of the show.",Trump Turns a Crisis Into His New Nightly TV Show,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-white-house-briefing-room-press-conference-147571,politico
"Data last updated 12PM Wednesday States have enacted a wide range of policies in an effort to ""flatten the curve"" and address the economic effects of the novel coronavirus. While all 50 states have declared states of emergency, giving governors emergency powers, the policy response from states has been wide-ranging.  We tracked seven metrics using data from the Kaiser Family Foundation to pull apart the differences in how states are responding to the outbreak. Five of the statewide metrics are aimed at mitigating the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, such as closing all nonessential business. Two metrics track health policy enacted by the states, including paid sick leave for affected workers. California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have initiated the most comprehensive policies. They've closed all bars and restaurants except for takeout and delivery, banned all gatherings, ordered mandatory statewide quarantine, closed all nonessential businesses, and closed all schools. California and Washington have also enacted paid sick leave for workers. Mississippi and Oklahoma are on the other end of the spectrum. Neither has instituted social restrictions outside closing schools. Many states have limited the operations of dining establishments to prevent the spread of the disease among crowds, requiring bars and restaurants to either shift to takeout-only operations or close down entirely. Though the development of a coronavirus vaccine is likely more than a year away, many states have already enacted policies dictating that the vaccine be provided to all residents for free. Lawmakers pushing for this argue the high cost of vaccinating the population for free pales in comparison to the cost of failing to do so and having the virus resurge in the future.  Many states have banned large gatherings to slow the spread of the virus, but there is wide variation on what constitutes a “large gathering.” As the crisis has worsened over the past few weeks, states have brought down the size of allowed gatherings from 1,000 to 250 to 50 to just 10.  States hardest hit by the virus have implemented broad mandatory quarantine orders, also referred to as “shelter in place” or “stay at home” policies. Though the policies vary between states, residents are generally instructed to stay at home unless going out for essential activities, such as grocery shopping.  Many states have ordered all business deemed nonessential to temporarily close, while those like grocery stores, pharmacies and hospitals that must continue operating need to implement strict safety guidelines for workers. States have differed on whether abortion clinics and gun stores, among other businesses, should be deemed essential.  A handful of mainly progressive states have enacted laws expanding paid sick leave for workers who contract coronavirus or who must care for a loved one who becomes infected. Before the outbreak, many workers had little or no guaranteed paid leave, including millions of people in the gig economy.  Nearly every state in the nation has closed its schools out of fear that large groups of children would become petri dishes for the virus. The move has, however, created other problems, as many low-income children depend on free school meals and many parents who have to continue going to work or work from home now have to care for their children.

"Lawmakers on Wednesday unveiled tougher oversight plans for the massive business bailout program at the heart of the latest coronavirus stimulus bill, after Democrats attacked the measure as an unchecked slush fund. According to new details of the economic stimulus legislation, the planned $500 billion Treasury Department fund would be subject to scrutiny via public reporting of transactions, as well as a new dedicated watchdog and accountability committee. The transparency provisions that lawmakers agreed to echo steps taken to police the bank bailouts in 2008 under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. ""We thought that rather than the extremely expansive version our Democratic colleagues were pushing for, we ought to follow the model of the TARP approach, where we would focus on specific transactions,"" Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) said Wednesday. The effectiveness of the measures will hinge on how the new oversight entities are structured, what powers they have and — perhaps most importantly — who's selected to run them, according to watchdogs and veterans of the bank bailout oversight programs. ""You can create an inspector general, but you have to make sure he or she has the necessary authority,"" said Neil Barofsky, who served as the special inspector general overseeing TARP. ""You have to pick the right person. It's kind of a meaningless position if you don't have someone who's going to fight for independence and to bring the necessary transparency and have the experience to protect against fraud in a program of this size and scope."" The bill would create a Treasury Department special inspector general to scrutinize the Treasury loans and establish an oversight panel tasked with protecting taxpayer dollars. It would also create ""real-time public reporting"" of Treasury transactions, according to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, including terms of loans, investments or other assistance to corporations. In addition, the bill would prohibit the Treasury loans or investments from going to any business controlled by the president, vice president, members of Congress and the heads of executive departments. The proposed Treasury funds include $46 billion for passenger airlines and other industries and $454 billion to support Federal Reserve lending programs to businesses, states and municipalities. The bipartisan congressional oversight commission that the bill would establish to examine decisions by Treasury and the Fed would consist of five members appointed by the GOP and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, according to legislative text circulated Wednesday. ""This is above board,"" White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Fox Business on Tuesday. ""Everyone will get a chance to see it. Nothing's going to be hidden."" TARP was also subject to a special inspector general and an oversight board. Before she was elected to the Senate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) became a progressive icon in part because of her role leading TARP's Congressional Oversight Panel, where she grilled figures such as then-Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner about the bank bailouts. Warren has been a fierce critic of the business rescue plan in the latest coronavirus bill as well. “We're not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends,"" she said before the latest version of the bill was announced. ""We're here to help workers, we're here to help hospitals."" That skepticism is likely to persist, even with the proposed checks on the bailout fund. ""Specific statutory provisions are irrelevant -- the House Ways and Means Chairman utilized a specific statutory provision to request Trump's tax returns from [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin and nearly a year later, he has not received them,"" said Jeff Hauser, who scrutinizes administration personnel as executive director of the Revolving Door Project. Isaac Boltansky, who served as a research analyst for the TARP oversight panel, said questions at this stage include whether investigators will have the ability to compel documents, whether there will be sufficient funding for staff and resources and whether there will be a way to review and potentially alter programs before they launch. ""Well-tailored oversight not only protects the taxpayer, but it can be additive to the overall effort if structured properly,"" he said. ""There is no monopoly on good ideas, especially when considering the scale and scope of the forthcoming endeavor.""",How the government will track $500B in bailout funds,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/government-track-bailout-funds-148641,politico

"NEW YORK -- For weeks, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has mostly played nice with the Trump administration, taking a calm and measured approach toward the federal government -- even as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has lashed out at Trump for neglecting his home town in a public health crisis. The differing temperaments between the two officials – Cuomo with a cool executive air bordering on aloofness, de Blasio with an us-against-them pugnaciousness – provided a stark contrast to people outside the tri-state area who were just tuning in to New York’s growing coronavirus crisis. That appeared to change on Tuesday, when Cuomo directed the full weight of his fury at the administration as the spread of coronavirus in his state threatened to spiral out of control. “The president says it’s a war,” Cuomo fumed, his voice rising at a press conference at the Javits Center, the massive Manhattan convention hall now being turned into an emergency hospital. “Well then act like it’s a war!” Faced with New York’s need for 30,000 ventilators to keep virus patients alive when the spread of the virus peaks - which could happen in as soon as two weeks - the federal government has sent 400 from its stockpile.  ""You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators,"" an angry Cuomo demanded. But within a day – after a mollifying conversation with Trump -- Cuomo was back on his steady course. ""It's something our team is working on with the White House team and I want to thank the president for his cooperation and his team for their cooperation,"" Cuomo said on Wednesday, referring to the supply-chain problems facing New York’s medical authorities. Cuomo’s calculation seems to be that a softer approach would get him further with a president known for being susceptible to flattery.  “I can tell you he is fully engaged on trying to help New York. He’s being very creative and very energetic, and I thank him for his partnership,” Cuomo said last week, after chatting with Trump about a Navy ship dispatched to New York harbor to serve as an emergency hospital. That ship, the USNS Comfort, it turned out, would not be ready for weeks. And so it has gone in Cuomo’s two-step with Trump on the health crisis, where gains for New York have often been followed by setbacks.  De Blasio has been less delicate with the president, consistently berating him for a slow federal response to the spiraling health crisis. “The fate of New York City rests in the hands of one man. He is a New Yorker. And right now, he is betraying the city he comes from,” the mayor told reporters last week.  In other appearances, de Blasio has labeled Trump his generation’s Herbert Hoover for his response to the pandemic and accompanying economic crash.  As the first cases of coronavirus hit New York, both men sought to avoid panic, encouraging New Yorkers to go about their lives while taking sensible precautions. They even held a dual press conference at the beginning of the month.  That was a rare occasion for two men whose dislike of each other is well known to their New York constituents. De Blasio, who won a longshot bid for mayor in 2013, fashioned himself the progressive alternative to Cuomo's brand of centrism, but the governor seemed to delight in undermining him at every turn. In their six years in office, they've feuded over matters as grave as the spiraling homeless population and dire conditions in the city's public housing and as trivial as the fate of a single deer found in Harlem. When coronavirus hit, both shared an interest in sparing New Yorkers from the brunt of the virus. But as circumstances grew more dire, and much of New York was forced into shutdown, their approaches diverged -- and occasionally devolved into the one-upmanship that has long characterized their relationship outside times of crisis. When de Blasio warned New Yorkers last week to prepare for a shelter in place order, Cuomo quickly shot down the idea. Days later, Cuomo issued just such an order, but said he did not want to call it shelter in place because the term is alarmist.  Cuomo pre-empted de Blasio’s announcement that New York City schools would close, making the news public just moments before de Blasio did. On Sunday, the two had wildly different takes on how city-dwellers were responding to the state’s stay at home order, with Cuomo saying he was so dissatisfied that New York City needed to come up with a plan within 24 hours to ensure people followed instructions. Cuomo, who has marshaled sweeping emergency powers for himself in the midst of the crisis at the expense of localities like New York City, sought to project command of the situation and stuck with a mostly measured tone, leaving it to de Blasio to sound the alarm about the federal government’s perceived failures.  Trump seemed to notice the difference, dismissing de Blasio when he was asked about the mayor’s charges of betrayal. “I’m not dealing with him. I’m dealing with the governor. And the governor agrees with me, and I agree with him,” he said on Friday. “I guess they’re not agreeing with each other, necessarily.” Yet by Tuesday, as the fast-moving pandemic claimed more New Yorkers’ lives, the mayor and the governor were united in their anger at the Trump administration. As Cuomo lashed out in his Javits Center press conference, de Blasio warned that the few ventilators the feds have delivered would buy the city only days. “Some days you need the carrot, and some days you need the stick. Today is a stick day,” said New York political strategist Stu Loeser, who was press secretary to former Mayor Mike Bloomberg.  He said that Cuomo’s anger, deployed sparingly, could be more effective than the bashing from de Blasio, who has criticized Trump more consistently during the pandemic and lacked the same “give and take.” “I think Gov. Cuomo wakes up every morning, to the degree that he sleeps, looks at the data on infections in New York, and looks as best he can at the president’s mood, and sets his course for the day based on both of those pieces of information,” he said.  In a virtual town hall from the White House’s Rose Garden Tuesday, the tentative truce between Cuomo and the administration still seemed intact, with Vice President Mike Pence saying he’s had continued meetings with both Cuomo and de Blasio and publicly assuring leaders the federal government “will make those resources available.” Four thousand ventilators will be sent to the state in the next two days, Pence said. But Trump did not take as well to his sometime ally’s criticism. The president appeared next in the Fox News event and railed on Cuomo for “complaining,” saying the federal government is doing “definitely more than anybody else” when it comes to helping out the state. Trump referred to a report — presumably this op-ed that ran in the New York Post by former Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey, a Republican -- saying that in 2015 the state declined the option to buy thousands of ventilators. “I'm not blaming him or anything else,” Trump said. “But he shouldn't be talking about us. He's supposed to be buying his own ventilators. We are going to help. But if you think about Governor Cuomo, we are building him four hospitals. We are building him four medical centers. We are working very, very hard for the people of New York. We are working along with him. Then I watch him on this show complaining.” For Cuomo, who has mobilized his resources and Rolodex to unparalleled levels this month, the tone shift on Tuesday seemed based on an inability to understand why the federal government wouldn’t similarly exhaust all avenues. The federal government can order manufacturers to build ventilators under the Federal Defense Production Act, Cuomo said. He, as governor, cannot. “Only the federal government has that power,” Cuomo said. “And not to exercise that power is inexplicable to me.”",New York reaches a coronavirus breaking point with Trump,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/cuomo-de-blasio-new-york-coronavirus-response-148462,politico
"OTTAWA — What was supposed to be a historic display of swift action and cross-party collaboration on Tuesday afternoon staggered across the finish line at 5:51 a.m. Wednesday morning, when Canada’s House of Commons passed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s coronavirus financial aid package after hours of behind-the-scenes negotiations. The bill, which was passed quickly by the Senate just before noon on Wednesday, allows the government to spend billions to help Canadian individuals and businesses weather the impacts of the novel coronavirus on the economy. But its passage in the House of Commons was delayed over provisions in the draft legislation that would have given the Liberal government broad powers to spend money and change taxation levels without parliamentary approval for the next 21 months. The final version, which was debated by a skeleton crew of 30-odd MPs from all parties in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, is a compromise that scales back the new spending powers that opposition Conservatives had referred to as a “power grab.” But the drawn-out process was a strange hiccup in the frenetic pace of announcements from a government trying to navigate a crisis it never anticipated, whose new tagline has become, in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, “Choose speed over perfection.” For hours on Tuesday, the House of Commons hung in limbo as cabinet ministers who’ve been working around the clock milled about, waiting for whatever was coming next. The unusual sitting of the House of Commons got underway at noon, but was suspended minutes later so that parties could continue to negotiate the proposed legislation. More than six hours later, MPs filed back into the House of Commons and voted unanimously to extend the sitting into the evening for still more behind-the-scenes discussion between House leaders. Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez announced just after 2:30 a.m. that an agreement had been reached, and MPs returned to the House of Commons 45 minutes later, where deputy Speaker Bruce Stanton began proceedings with a grim, “Everyone ready?” Two and a half hours later, it was all over, the bill was passed, and MPs began packing up their things before Stanton could even declare the House adjourned. The aid package includes C$27 billion in direct financial support for individuals and businesses and C$55 billion in tax deferrals the government announced last week. Individual measures include a boost to the Canada Child Benefit, money for those who are out of work and a six-month freeze on student loan repayments. All parties were prepared to support the aid package, but opposition parties took issue with provisions that would have given the Liberal government unilateral power to spend, borrow and change taxation levels until December 2021. Late Monday evening, the Liberals agreed to drop a clause regarding taxation powers, but that wasn’t enough to satisfy the Conservatives. The agreement reached Wednesday morning puts a September 2020 end date on the government’s authority to spend on emergency health measures without parliamentary approval. The government also agreed to report regularly on spending decisions to parliamentary committees. “The Liberals shamefully tried to use a public health crisis to give themselves the powers to raise taxes, debt and spending without parliamentary approval until January 1, 2022,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said in a statement. “But after hours of negotiation, the government has backed down.” After days of rapid decision-making, Tuesday’s roadblock made for a strange, unanticipated lull. The House is officially adjourned until April 20 due to the spread of the coronavirus, and just over 30 MPs had been called back to reconvene the House for this emergency sitting — mostly MPs who live within driving distance and ministers who’ve been staying in Ottawa to deal with the crisis. For hours, they sat scattered about the chamber that normally holds 10 times their number. Several wandered in and out as the hours dragged by, while others chatted in little groups, keeping a healthy distance from each other as they waited for the outcome of negotiations happening outside the House. “What’s going on, Pablo, are we doing this today or no?” Health Minister Patty Hajdu demanded of Rodriguez at one point when he made a brief reappearance. The unexpected delay was, perhaps, a moment of respite for ministers who’ve had little time to pause. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne, always animated, told war stories to other MPs about negotiating by phone with foreign governments to bring home Canadians stranded abroad as more and more countries close their airspace. In Peru, which has recently gone into martial law, Champagne said, planes sent to pick up Canadians are now having to land on a military base. “Everything is an issue. There’s nothing that works normally,” he said. Hajdu chatted candidly with caucus colleagues about the difficulty of scaling up coronavirus testing and getting people to take social distancing seriously. She couldn’t believe people had still been getting on cruise ships even as the virus was spreading around the globe, she said: “For fuck’s sake, people, don’t get on these Petri dishes!” But as the day wore on, patience wore thin. Shortly after 5 p.m., Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet called a press conference in a room three floors below the House of Commons to express his frustration. He said the parties had agreed to changes on Monday night that should have been good enough. “I do not see a reason for it not to go forward now,” he said. NDP MP Lindsay Mathyssen, who was representing her party alongside Leader Jagmeet Singh and one other MP, directed her grievances at the Liberals. “Unfortunately, the government has put in other things by surprise that we weren’t expecting that now have to be negotiated, so it’s taken more time than we would have liked,” she said in an interview. After receiving quick approval from the Senate, the bill is set to become law on Wednesday afternoon. Trudeau spoke to Canadians in the morning, while Freeland and other ministers held their daily briefing at noon, as usual. But as the government’s crisis routine shifts back into place, it was those hours before the parties reached an agreement that were the most revealing, when ministers had a moment to stop and reflect. After the pandemic, Hajdu said, everything else is going to seem easy. “I want to socially isolate at home on a lake, but I don’t think I’m going to get to do that,” she told her colleagues at one point. “The world has gone crazy.” Andy Blatchford and Lauren Gardner contributed to this report.","After sitting through the night, Canadian government passes emergency coronavirus aid package",2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/canada-coronavirus-emergency-trudeau-148362,politico
"The Department of Homeland Security has been briefed that New York City’s morgues are nearing capacity, according to a department official and a second person familiar with the situation.  Officials were told that morgues in the city are expected to reach capacity next week, per the briefing. A third person familiar with the situation in New York said that some of the city’s hospital morgues hit capacity over the last seven days. And a FEMA spokesperson told POLITICO that New York has asked for emergency mortuary assistance. Hawaii and North Carolina have asked for mortuary help as well, and the disaster response agency is currently reviewing the requests, according to the spokesperson. If the available morgue space in New York City fills up as the number of COVID-19 deaths increases, federal help will be available, a former senior administration official said, noting that the George W. Bush administration sent mortuary assistance in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the September 11 attacks. The Department of Health and Human Services oversees the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams (DMORT), which can help set up temporary morgues. The teams operate in response to requests from local authorities. For now, city officials do not seem especially alarmed. Aja Worthy-Davis, a spokesperson for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), said concerns about morgue capacity may be unfounded. OCME’s morgues can store up to 900 bodies across all five boroughs, she said. “We have the ability to expand pretty dramatically,” she said. “If you look back at what we did during 9/11, we have the ability to create mobile stations that allow us to house bodies if we run out of space.”  New York City has not dealt with mass casualties at the same rate as Covid-19 in recent memory, however. “All hospitals within the city tend to have small morgue spaces, so it’s possible that with the capacity of hospitals in New York City, there may be an expectation … that they’ll run out of morgue space,” Worthy-Davis added.  In a 2008 plan for a pandemic influenza outbreak, OCME noted, “It is probable that funeral directors, cemeteries and crematoria may be unable to process remains at the same rate as the OCME, due to the large influx of deaths during a PI [pandemic influenza] outbreak.” According to the plan, the office would respond to such a crisis by enhancing its medical transport teams. The H1N1 virus, which is nowhere nearly as deadly as Covid-19, brought hospitals “to their knees,” said Dr. Conrad Fischer, a residency program director in internal medicine at Brookdale University Medical Center in Brooklyn. An official with Bellevue Hospital said that a temporary morgue outside NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan has in recent days been stood up to help house the remains of COVID-19 victims. The New York Post first reported the news. Another issue for responders will be handling significantly more burials and cremations than is typical. Federal assistance may be available to help with that potential challenge, and it would need to work in tandem with state and local officials.  More than 50,000 Americans have tested positive for Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, and at least 800 have died from it, according to constantly updated numbers from Johns Hopkins University. New York has been particularly hard-hit, with more than 25,000 positive cases in the state and about 16,000 in the city alone, per city and state information.  Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed New York state residents on March 20 to stay at home, and has temporarily banned “all non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason,” per an announcement on a state government website.  A spokesperson for HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether New York officials had asked for assistance from the teams; neither did a spokesperson for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Dept. of Health or New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office. Spokespersons for DHS headquarters also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Correction: A spokesperson for OCME clarified after initial publication that the city's morgues across all five boroughs can hold up to 900 bodies, not just in Manhattan.","NYC morgues near capacity, DHS briefing warns",2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/dhs-briefing-nyc-morgues-near-capacity-148259,politico
"Congressional leaders are vowing swift action on a mammoth $2 trillion rescue package designed to blunt the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, following a bipartisan deal that was clinched early Wednesday morning. The Senate is expected to vote Wednesday afternoon on the legislation, which will deliver emergency aid to nearly every sector across the U.S., including $1,200 checks to many Americans. The House plans to pass the bill Thursday, assuming not one of the 430 lawmakers objects, clearing the historic package for President Donald Trump’s signature. The package — the largest of its kind in U.S. history — comes after five days of tense negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It includes a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance, a rescue fund for state and local governments, immediate cash for hospitals and a huge pool of grants and loans for small businesses. It is Congress’s third major bill in response to the crisis, which has infected 55,500 Americans and brought the U.S. economy to a standstill, and will not be the last. ""Today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,” McConnell said in an emotional speech about how the nation would fight and beat the coronavirus crisis. “Our nation needed us to go big and go fast and they did."" ""This is not even a stimulus package — it’s emergency relief,"" McConnell said. Speaking on the floor afterwards, Schumer said Democrats are prepared to support speeding up consideration of the bill so the Senate can vote on the package Wednesday. “I expect the Senate can get the job done in the [next] few hours,” he said in a midday floor speech. But efforts to fast-track the bill hit a last-minute snag: Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) raised concern that a “drafting error” in the bill would incentivize employees to be laid off and demanded a fix before they would agree to support speedy consideration of the package. Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered strong praise for the Senate deal in a Wednesday morning statement, saying the package has evolved enormously from the bill McConnell was pushing over the weekend. Within hours, Pelosi quickly began to consult with her chairs and her caucus to go over details of the giant bill.  Even as of noon, legislative staff were still racing to finalize thousands of pages of highly complex text, though lawmakers have been given near-final drafts to review. Ahead of the bill’s release, Mnuchin huddled with Senate Republicans on a conference call. Pelosi told her members in the first of several conference calls that there is “no way” the House could approve the legislation on Wednesday. The California Democrat also raised the prospects of lawmakers needing to return to the Capitol, noting that it could be difficult for Republicans to get unanimous support. House leaders are talking to Capitol Police and the attending physician in case members need to come to the floor.  But there has been a dose of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead’ and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call.  Cuomo later grew emotional during a press conference, lashing out at the Senate’s bill as “a drop in the bucket” for his state, which would receive roughly $3 billion under the Senate bill. New York now has 30,611 coronavirus cases, including 5,000 new cases in the last 24 hours — most of which are in New York City. “I’m telling you these numbers don’t work and I told the House members that we really need their help,” Cuomo said. Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals, a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits and federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid industries.  And Schumer revealed in a letter to his caucus that the deal includes a highly sought-after prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any business ""controlled by the President, Vice President, Members of Congress, and heads of Executive Departments from receiving loans or investments from Treasury programs."" Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations. They said Democrats had actually been pushing to give the panel subpoena power over the entire Trump administration’s response to the pandemic. Pelosi and other top Democrats will need to begin selling the deal to their members if they hope for a quick vote in the House. Already, several members of the New York delegation had been pushing for larger cash payments, including Reps. Max Rose, Lee Zeldin and Yvette Clark, who sent a letter to congressional leaders demanding cost-of-living adjustments for all cash payments. But many Democrats believe their caucus would not ultimately be willing to jeopardize the emergency aid, while leaders have emphasized they will have more opportunities to address their concerns in additional relief measures. ""This is certainly not the end of our work here in Congress, rather the end of the beginning,"" Schumer said.  Pelosi has been fielding questions and concerns from House Democrats through the week, even before Senate leaders reached a deal. And House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has scheduled a series of calls with specific committee chairs and Pelosi throughout the day, designed to get the caucus comfortable with the massive deal. On the first of those calls Wednesday, Pelosi and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) made a strong pitch for the Senate deal. But members raised a slew of concerns about their priorities that weren’t included, like student loan forgiveness or a higher income threshold allowing Americans in high-cost cities to qualify for the direct cash payments.  Pelosi and other senior Democrats reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats are expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text is unveiled.  Pelosi said she plans to bring up the bill in a way that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington, through “unanimous consent,” a legislative maneuver generally reserved for quick passage of noncontroversial legislation. A single lawmaker, however, could object to that motion, requiring the House to pivot to other options, including bringing members back to Washington for a roll call vote or even proxy voting. A Democratic report released earlier this week outlined the various voting options, strongly endorsing unanimous consent as the best way forward in the current crisis. In a letter to Democrats Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said he remains ""committed to giving House Members 24 hours’ notice before the House acts.""  ""Before we can determine when and how the House will consider this legislation, we must have the final legislative text and clear direction on when the Senate will vote,"" Hoyer said.  House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there's a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement, and discussed it on a whip team conference call Tuesday evening. But passing the rescue package by voice vote is another viable option that allows almost all lawmakers to remain in their home districts and is being discussed within the GOP conference, the source added. The House GOP will host two conference-wide calls Wednesday on the economic relief package: one in the afternoon and another in the evening. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Wednesday afternoon blessed the deal. ""Our country is on the edge, but we must be in this fight together,"" McCarthy said in a statement. ""It's time for Washington to start acting that way, and send this bill to the President."" Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who frequently objects to Congress’s biggest spending packages and isn’t beholden to party leadership, has also scoffed at the deal on Twitter, calling it “a raw deal for the people.” “It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor,” he wrote early Wednesday.

"The Covid-19 crisis is exactly the kind of moment when we need our leaders to reassure and protect us most. Instead, recent reports suggest that several United States senators responded by protecting themselves first, selling stock to avoid personal financial losses from a growing public health crisis that they knew, from confidential intelligence briefings, was probably going to be much worse than the public knew at the time. Congressional filings show that some members sold millions of dollars in investments, while another sold a very significant percentage of his total net worth and privately issued a grave warning to wealthy donors while publicly taking a much more sanguine tone. The public is rightly outraged, and many are questioning whether these actions were legal or ethical. As a longtime Senate staffer, I helped draft the Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge Act, or the STOCK Act, which was designed to apply in situations just like this. While it is not yet clear whether these senators violated that law, it is clear this episode has undermined the public’s trust in our elected officials. And it raises an important question: Should members of Congress even be permitted to trade securities or engage in significant outside business activities at all? I don’t think they should. This isn’t the first time that members of Congress have faced accusations that they misused information they learned on the job for their personal benefit. In November 2011, “60 Minutes” released an investigative report suggesting that several had engaged in extensive stock trading after learning secret details regarding the last financial crisis, in 2008-09. The problem was that while it looked and smelled like corruption, not everyone agreed that it violated federal securities laws. (That’s a separate question from whether the trading violated Congress’ self-imposed ethics rules, which senators can be censured or even thrown out of the Senate for violating, even if they didn’t break any law.) Trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information—commonly called “insider trading”—is illegal. But insider trading is defined by case law, not statute. Those cases require that a duty, of trust or loyalty, be breached, or information to be otherwise misappropriated. For example, if a corporate executive learns of an impending deal for his company and trades his stock before the deal becomes public, he has likely violated insider trading law, in part because he violated the “trust” the company had in him to not exploit that information for his own personal gain. But if there isn’t a duty being violated, then there isn’t insider trading. For example, suppose our executive was a just a very obnoxious cellphone user. And suppose another person just happened to overhear the company’s name and the upcoming, not-yet-public deal. That lucky listener may trade on that information without violating the law because they have no direct or indirect duty to the source of the information. Regulators have recently made it clear to “corporate insiders” that insider trading rules also cover material, nonpublic information related to the effects of the coronavirus outbreak. The same should obviously hold true for governmental insiders. Members of Congress and their staffs learn a lot of information that the general public doesn’t know: They get briefings from others in government; they get selective information from large companies and trade associations. Members of Congress are granted access to information precisely because they have the ability to influence outcomes, and they are entrusted to use their knowledge to make the best decisions for our country. Shouldn’t they then have a “duty” to not use the information they learn in their jobs for their own personal financial benefit? A handful of senators and staff, including myself, drafted the STOCK Act to answer that question with a resounding yes. The law clearly and directly imposes a duty on government officials to not trade while in possession of material, nonpublic information “derived” from their positions or “gained in the performance” of their jobs. Additionally, the new law requires reporting of transactions after the fact, so that we can more easily learn about potential abuses. The law is not limited to information about a specific company or companies. It covers any “material, non-public information.”  In fact, while negotiating the bill, I used an example to explain the bill to other congressional aides and their bosses. Suppose a member of the Senate learns of a credible threat of a major impending terrorist attack in New York City. The STOCK Act would make it illegal for the senator to then sell a slew of hotel stocks. That would be a betrayal of the senator’s duty. Nobody with whom I spoke— on either side of the political aisle—disagreed. Ultimately, the STOCK Act overwhelmingly passed both chambers of Congress and was signed into law on April 4, 2012. That brings us to now. I am not in a position to judge whether the recent transactions by some senators violated the STOCK Act or, for that matter, other federal laws or ethics rules. Those questions should be thoroughly investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and the Senate Ethics Committee. But given that Congress’ first obligation is to the American people and that serving that obligation so often requires having more knowledge than ordinary American investors, why should members of Congress be permitted to trade individual stocks at all? Why should we expect them to even be capable when making business decisions of separating what they know as a result of their governmental job and what they might otherwise know as private individuals? As recent events make clear, any trading by members of Congress can undermine confidence in government and our democracy. If we want members of Congress to focus on their work rather than their personal wealth, we should consider whether allowing them to be active traders of public-company stock, or even active participants in significant outside business activities, reflects the priorities the American people rightly demand of public servants. Members of Congress often have information that can mean millions, or even billions of dollars to market participants. Should they knowingly be misappropriating that information for themselves, their families, or their friends? Of course not. But it’s also unreasonable to expect members of Congress to pretend to not know something. The STOCK Act is a useful tool to combat corruption, but it isn’t sufficient. Stock trading isn’t the only way that members of Congress could be misusing the material, nonpublic information they learn. Information can also be valuable in real estate transactions, for example. Congress should consider prohibiting significant outside business activities for all members, and limit any securities trading to diversified funds, with all trades first precleared by an appropriate ethics office. That kind of process is common at investment banks and other firms where employees are often in possession of material, nonpublic information. Many compliance officers at companies like those sometimes even conclude that insiders ought to be prohibited from trading in entire industries. We should expect at least as much of members of Congress. The oath of office for a U.S. senator includes the pledge, “I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.” Those duties aren’t to their personal financial interests—but to us.",I Helped Write the STOCK Act.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday suggested there should be no more televised debates for the remainder of the 2020 Democratic primary, signaling an unwillingness to spar on stage again with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont next month. Ater a virtual news briefing on the coronavirus pandemic conducted from his home in Delaware, Biden was asked about the Sanders campaign’s statement to The New York Times on Tuesday that the senator would appear in an April debate if the Democratic National Committee proceeded with organizing the event. Pressed on whether he, too, would participate, Biden said: “My focus is just dealing with this crisis right now. I haven’t thought about any more debates. I think we’ve had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.” Biden and Sanders last traded barbs in their first one-on-one debate of the primary cycle on March 15, and it is unclear whether there will be another such forum before the start of the general election campaign. Despite hints that he would withdraw from the Democratic nominating contest soon after falling to Biden in the latest round of state primaries last week, Sanders has defied party pressure and remained in the race — which has been transformed by the coronavirus’ rapid spread across the country. Campaign staff have begun working from home, several states have postponed primary voting, and pre-scheduled rallies and town halls have been scrapped en masse. Even the fate of the Democratic convention in Milwaukee this summer is up in the air amid the public health crisis. Meanwhile, Biden and Sanders have sought to adapt to new methods of connecting with supporters as their campaign organizations rely increasingly on digital resources. “I’m learning a lot more about how to get the message out, in terms of beyond what we’re doing,” Biden said on Wednesday, adding that there is still “plenty of opportunity to communicate” with the American people.",Biden: ‘I think we’ve had enough debates’,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/joe-biden-debates-148620,politico
"EU leaders will on Thursday discuss a “Marshall Plan-like” stimulus package to fight the dire effects of the coronavirus on the bloc’s economies, European Council President Charles Michel said Wednesday. Speaking on Belgian television channel LN24, Michel said he had earlier this week discussed “the way we are going to put in place what I call a Marshall Plan-like stimulus strategy” with the bloc’s 27 ambassadors, ahead of Thursday’s videoconference of heads of state and government. “And when I say Marshall Plan-like, I say with a strong ambition,” he added. The impact of the economic shock on businesses means “we must be very active, very soon.” Michel described the endeavor as “an intra-European plan which must mobilize EU capital in the framework of the European budget; which must mobilize national funds and which should also mobilize the private sector,” adding: “We will have to use all the tools.” Leaders on Thursday are expected to call on the European Commission to put together a new plan for economic recovery. In a draft statement prepared ahead of the leaders' discussion and seen by POLITICO, officials wrote that the bloc would need an “exit strategy, a comprehensive recovery plan and unprecedented investment” for the coronavirus crisis, and would “invite the Commission to start work on a proposal for a Roadmap for recovery accompanied by an Action Plan.” Michel said: “We should not expect a sprint, this crisis is going to have an impact on us at short, medium and long term."" Prior to the virus hitting Europe, the Council president was focused on brokering a deal in negotiations over the bloc’s 2021-2027 budget. “I believe the crisis we are going through now has an impact” on the EU budget negotiations, Michel said, adding that the budget should draw on the “lessons” of the crisis and especially the ability to “assert solidarity and to have with that budget a real instrument to support our priorities for the economic stimulus plan.” Want more analysis from POLITICO?

"As congressional leaders haggled over a $2 trillion emergency economic relief bill on Tuesday, President Donald Trump mocked House Democrats for stuffing their own rescue proposal with priorities unrelated to the coronavirus crisis—especially one priority he famously hates. “They had things in there that were terrible,” Trump complained during his virtual town hall on Fox News. “Windmills all over the place, all sorts of credits for windmills!” In fairness to the Democrats, their 1,400-page draft had nothing about windmills. But in fairness to Trump, windmills were among the few Democratic priorities that didn’t appear in the “Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act” that the House floated Monday night. The proposal did include extra funding for workers and families, but also for Supplemental Dairy Margin Coverage, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts—even though the Kennedy Center is closed—and hundreds of other government programs and services unrelated to the emergency. Congressional leaders didn’t use the House draft as the basis for the stimulus deal they struck early Wednesday morning, but they did fund quite a few of its provisions—from modest items with little connection to the pandemic, like $12.5 million for the Bureau of Reclamation or $25 million for the Kennedy Center, to $25 billion for ravaged transit agencies. And Congress is expected to pass more stimulus bills in the coming months, so the House proposal still bears a very close look as a preview of how Democrats plan to use their leverage. It also gives Republicans some talking points about the random taxpayer-funded goodies their opponents are pushing during a crisis. What’s in it? Even though airports are virtually empty, and the Transportation Security Administration has never had less to do, the Democrats proposed $26 million for overtime for TSA employees. They also slipped in $20 million to help the TSA to buy new swabs for detecting explosives, a worthy security measure that lacks any apparent connection to the pandemic, $31 million for “bio-surveillance of wildlife,” and $45 million to help the Agricultural Marketing Service grade commodities like beef, eggs and, well, pork. Agricultural anything tends to attract bipartisan support, and the final stimulus deal included that entire $45 million request. But suffice to say that if Christmas trees were graded, the House’s draft would be USDA Prime, while the final deal would probably be closer to U.S. Standard. And in an economic crisis, congressional grab bags can be politically toxic. In 2009, Republicans successfully branded President Obama’s stimulus bill as a dog’s breakfast of traditional big-government spending—including “sod on the Mall,” “smoking cessation,” “herpes prevention” and other line items that didn’t even make it into the final bill. Now some former Obama aides are afraid congressional Democrats might be walking into the same “Porkulus” trap. Obama’s $800 billion Recovery Act helped end the Great Recession, but Republicans hammered away its laundry-list optics so relentlessly that within a year, the percentage of Americans who believed it had created jobs was smaller than the percentage who believed Elvis was alive. Like Winston Churchill’s apocryphal pudding, the Obama stimulus lacked a theme, and Democrats seem to be repeating their public-relations mistakes. “Have we learned nothing?” asked Jared Bernstein, who worked on the Recovery Act as chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden in the Obama White House. It’s not just that the House bill veers away from the pandemic or even the economy. The bill simply reads like a typical congressional appropriations bill, with plus-ups like $100 million for NASA construction and environmental compliance and the Legal Services Corporation, as well as $300 million for the National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities and Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The only real difference is boilerplate language justifying most of the plus-ups “to support activities to prevent, prepare for and respond to coronavirus,” from the $20 million for the Bureau of Reclamation to the $33 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s not all relatively small-ticket items, either; the Postal Service got $25 billion, plus $11 billion worth of debt forgiveness and $15 billion in new borrowing authority, which is real money even by congressional standards. The bill included a major bailout of underfunded multi-employer pension plans that coal miners, Teamsters and other labor groups have been pushing for years, as well as a $10,000-per-borrower reduction in student loan debt. “Skimming it, I was struck by: ‘What does all this shit have to do with anything?’” another Obama White House veteran said. Last year, Republicans turned a few off-message lines in a Green New Deal memo written by a staffer to Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez into a mantra that Democrats were determined to ban cows and airline travel. Now some Democrats—including some aides to Biden, who oversaw the Recovery Act for Obama and is now the party’s presumptive presidential nominee—fear that history will repeat itself over the Democratic wish list. In fact, one message Republicans kept repeating Tuesday was that the Democrats were already trying to use the economic relief bill to pass a backdoor Green New Deal, even though the House draft had almost nothing related to energy or climate change. “This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal,” Trump tweeted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered an angry floor speech about “completely non-germane Democratic wish-list items,” in which he only specified two—tax credits for wind and solar energy, which were not even in the Democratic proposal, and emissions restrictions for bailed-out airlines, which were. “Democrats won’t let us fund hospitals or save small businesses unless they get to dust off the Green New Deal,” McConnell declared. The 2009 stimulus did include down payments on several of Obama’s long-range policy priorities, including education reform, scientific research, infrastructure, and yes, green energy, which received a whopping $90 billion that helped create booms in wind, solar, electric vehicles and LED lighting. The current House bill takes a different approach, calling for modest spending increases for a grab bag of federal agencies and services but actually limiting its major investments in longstanding Democratic priorities to issues with some nexus to the current crisis. For example, the Democrats pushed for dramatic spending increases on unemployment insurance, which they got, as well as paid sick leave and family leave to help workers stuck at home during the pandemic and a national vote-by-mail system to make sure the coronavirus doesn’t prevent Americans from casting ballots in November, which they didn’t get. But other than the money for struggling transit agencies and a $1 billion program to help bailed-out airlines replace high-polluting airplanes with more efficient ones, the House bill mostly ignores the calls from climate hawks for a game-changing down payment on a Green New Deal. Some Democrats disgusted by the House bill’s cats-and-dogs approach argue that if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was going to push for anything other than containing the virus and helping cash-strapped families, she should have pushed for more transformative spending that would put Americans back to work over the coming year—like a Marshall Plan to rebuild American infrastructure, or a nationwide initiative to install rooftop solar. “If you’re going to Christmas-tree this up and spend $2 trillion, why not go big?” asked Kenneth Baer, the former communications director for Obama’s budget office. Everyone in Washington knows that a crisis can be the best way to ram some pet ideas through, and the Senate Republican proposal, weighing in at a mere 247 pages, includes some efforts to use the crisis to push longstanding conservative priorities, like language limiting aid to health providers that accept Medicaid patients, promoting abstinence education and cutting taxes on certain investment income. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been using the crisis to try to tighten border restrictions, restrict asylum claims, cancel union elections and give the Justice Department the power to detain Americans indefinitely without trial during emergencies. And since the final congressional compromise includes some of the esoteric Democratic wish list, Republicans who vote for it will to some extent own it. But if the Capitol Hill negotiations exposed the GOP as the stingier party when it comes to helping workers and vulnerable families, and the more generous party when it comes to helping bailed-out companies avoid strict conditions, the House bill does reinforce stereotypes of the Democrats as the party of big government, exploiting a pandemic to pour taxpayer dollars into heating assistance for the poor, runaway youth programs, and subsidies for little-used airports serving smaller cities. It wouldn’t be a Democratic economic relief bill without an extra $1 billion for Head Start, even when Head Start programs are shuttered for the pandemic. In 2009, Republican mockery of random projects financed by the Obama stimulus—“turtle tunnels,” “honeybee insurance” and a drug addiction study that the GOP shorthanded as “cocaine monkeys”—helped persuade the public it had nothing to do with jobs, even though subsequent studies found that it helped save millions of jobs. McConnell is the master of that game, and the Democrats who thought they could win it more than a decade ago remember that they ended up losing the House, the Senate and eventually the White House. “I don’t want to get into fights over either side’s wish list,” Bernstein says. “I think the politics are prohibitive, and the urgency is getting money out the door.”",‘Have We Learned Nothing?’,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/25/coronavirus-economy-stimulus-house-democrats-148512,politico
"OTTAWA — What was supposed to be a historic display of swift action and cross-party collaboration on Tuesday afternoon staggered across the finish line at 5:51 a.m. Wednesday morning, when Canada’s House of Commons passed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s coronavirus financial aid package after hours of behind-the-scenes negotiations. The bill, which became law on Wednesday afternoon, allows the government to spend billions to help Canadian individuals and businesses weather the impacts of the novel coronavirus on the economy. But its passage in the House of Commons was delayed over provisions in the draft legislation that would have given the Liberal government broad powers to spend money and change taxation levels without parliamentary approval for the next 21 months. The final version, which was debated by a skeleton crew of 30-odd MPs from all parties in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, is a compromise that scales back the new spending powers that opposition Conservatives had referred to as a “power grab.” But the drawn-out process was a strange hiccup in the frenetic pace of announcements from a government trying to navigate a crisis it never anticipated, whose new tagline has become, in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, “Choose speed over perfection.” For hours on Tuesday, the House of Commons hung in limbo as cabinet ministers who’ve been working around the clock milled about, waiting for whatever was coming next. The unusual sitting of the House of Commons got underway at noon, but was suspended minutes later so that parties could continue to negotiate the proposed legislation. More than six hours later, MPs filed back into the House of Commons and voted unanimously to extend the sitting into the evening for still more behind-the-scenes discussion between House leaders. Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez announced just after 2:30 a.m. that an agreement had been reached, and MPs returned to the House of Commons 45 minutes later, where deputy Speaker Bruce Stanton began proceedings with a grim, “Everyone ready?” Two and a half hours later, it was all over, the bill was passed, and MPs began packing up their things before Stanton could even declare the House adjourned. The aid package includes C$52 billion in direct financial support for individuals and businesses and C$55 billion in tax deferrals. Individual measures include a boost to the Canada Child Benefit, money for those who are out of work and a six-month freeze on student loan repayments. All parties were prepared to support the aid package, but opposition parties took issue with provisions that would have given the Liberal government unilateral power to spend, borrow and change taxation levels until December 2021. Late Monday evening, the Liberals agreed to drop a clause regarding taxation powers, but that wasn’t enough to satisfy the Conservatives. The agreement reached Wednesday morning puts a September 2020 end date on the government’s authority to spend on emergency health measures without parliamentary approval. The government also agreed to report regularly on spending decisions to parliamentary committees. “The Liberals shamefully tried to use a public health crisis to give themselves the powers to raise taxes, debt and spending without parliamentary approval until January 1, 2022,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said in a statement. “But after hours of negotiation, the government has backed down.” After days of rapid decision-making, Tuesday’s roadblock made for a strange, unanticipated lull. The House is officially adjourned until April 20 due to the spread of the coronavirus, and just over 30 MPs had been called back to reconvene the House for this emergency sitting — mostly MPs who live within driving distance and ministers who’ve been staying in Ottawa to deal with the crisis. For hours, they sat scattered about the chamber that normally holds 10 times their number. Several wandered in and out as the hours dragged by, while others chatted in little groups, keeping a healthy distance from each other as they waited for the outcome of negotiations happening outside the House. “What’s going on, Pablo, are we doing this today or no?” Health Minister Patty Hajdu demanded of Rodriguez at one point when he made a brief reappearance. The unexpected delay was, perhaps, a moment of respite for ministers who’ve had little time to pause. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne, always animated, told war stories to other MPs about negotiating by phone with foreign governments to bring home Canadians stranded abroad as more and more countries close their airspace. In Peru, which has recently gone into martial law, Champagne said, planes sent to pick up Canadians are now having to land on a military base. “Everything is an issue. There’s nothing that works normally,” he said. Hajdu chatted candidly with caucus colleagues about the difficulty of scaling up coronavirus testing and getting people to take social distancing seriously. She couldn’t believe people had still been getting on cruise ships even as the virus was spreading around the globe, she said: “For fuck’s sake, people, don’t get on these Petri dishes!” But as the day wore on, patience wore thin. Shortly after 5 p.m., Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet called a press conference in a room two floors below the House of Commons to express his frustration. He said the parties had agreed to changes on Monday night that should have been good enough. “I do not see a reason for it not to go forward now,” he said. NDP MP Lindsay Mathyssen, who was representing her party alongside Leader Jagmeet Singh and one other MP, directed her grievances at the Liberals. “Unfortunately, the government has put in other things by surprise that we weren’t expecting that now have to be negotiated, so it’s taken more time than we would have liked,” she said in an interview. Still, by Wednesday morning things were back on track. After a quick approval in the Senate, the bill received royal assent on Wednesday afternoon. Trudeau spoke to Canadians in the morning, while Freeland and other ministers held their daily briefing at noon, as usual. But as the government’s crisis routine shifts back into place, it was those hours before the parties reached an agreement that were the most revealing, when ministers had a moment to stop and reflect. After the pandemic, Hajdu said, everything else is going to seem easy. “I want to socially isolate at home on a lake, but I don’t think I’m going to get to do that,” she told her colleagues at one point. “The world has gone crazy.” Andy Blatchford and Lauren Gardner contributed to this report.","After sitting through the night, Canadian government passes emergency coronavirus aid package",2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/canada-coronavirus-emergency-trudeau-148362,politico
"Swift Senate action on a mammoth $2 trillion rescue package hit a speed bump Wednesday amid opposition from a small group of GOP lawmakers, throwing up a last-minute hurdle as congressional leaders rush to finalize the bipartisan deal. Senate leaders were hoping to vote Wednesday afternoon on the legislation, which will deliver much-needed emergency aid to nearly every sector across the U.S., including $1,200 checks to many Americans. But Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are opposing speedy consideration of the measure over concerns it would encourage employees to be laid off instead of working. At issue is language surrounding beefed-up unemployment insurance, which they say would allow workers to be paid more on unemployment than what they were making while employed. The lawmakers are working with the Senate Finance Committee to craft an amendment to fix the “drafting error” before they agree to fast-track consideration of the package — a demand that has delayed the bill’s release, as well as the timeline for final passage. “We’ll know in about an hour as to whether or not this is a drafting error,” Graham said at a press conference in the Capitol Wednesday afternoon. “I hope they’re right, but I’m concerned.”  Graham — who said they discovered the problem during a telephone briefing on the bill Wednesday morning — defended their efforts to hold up the package, arguing it was more “responsible” to get the historic piece of legislation right. Earlier this week, the GOP hammered Democrats for blocking two procedural votes on the measure as they fought for changes. The Senate is still hoping it can vote Wednesday night on the package, the largest of its kind in U.S. history, which comes after five days of tense negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It includes a dramatic expansion of unemployment insurance, a rescue fund for state and local governments, immediate cash for hospitals and a huge pool of grants and loans for small businesses. The House, meanwhile, is expected to take up the bill as early as Thursday afternoon. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team spent much of the day on conference calls briefing their members about the plan. It is Congress’s third major bill in response to the crisis, which has infected 55,500 Americans and brought the U.S. economy to a standstill, and will not be the last. ""Today, the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,” McConnell said in an emotional speech about how the nation would fight and beat the coronavirus crisis. “Our nation needed us to go big and go fast and they did."" ""This is not even a stimulus package— it’s emergency relief,"" McConnell said. Speaking on the floor afterwards, Schumer said Democrats are prepared to support speeding up consideration of the bill so the Senate can vote on the package Wednesday. “I expect the Senate can get the job done in the [next] few hours,” he said in a midday floor speech. As of 2 p.m., legislative staff were once again rewriting sections of the highly complex text, though lawmakers have been given near-final drafts to review. Ahead of the bill’s release, Mnuchin huddled with Senate Republicans on a conference call. Pelosi told her members on Wednesday afternoon that she’ll likely bring up the bill in a way that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington, through “unanimous consent,” a legislative maneuver generally reserved for quick passage of noncontroversial legislation, or via a voice vote.  A single lawmaker, however, could object and request a roll call vote, which would likely require lawmakers return to Washington to vote. The Democratic whip team is also figuring out a process for potential proxy voting, which would require a rule change but would require fewer members return to the Capitol. A Democratic report released earlier this week outlined the various voting options, strongly endorsing unanimous consent as the best way forward in the current crisis. Pelosi has already advised her members that they may need to return to Washington, telling Democrats Wednesday that House leaders are talking to Capitol Police and the attending physician in preparation.  Multiple members would not be able to attend votes, including the two lawmakers who are battling the coronavirus — Reps. Ben McAdams and Mario Diaz-Balart — as well as several others who are self-quarantining after possible exposure. Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) also said Wednesday that he has developed symptoms of the virus — but cannot get a test because of the national scarcity — and will be self-quarantining at his home. In a letter to Democrats Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said he remains ""committed to giving House Members 24 hours’ notice before the House acts."" ""Before we can determine when and how the House will consider this legislation, we must have the final legislative text and clear direction on when the Senate will vote,"" Hoyer said. House Republican leaders have privately acknowledged that there's a strong possibility that a member will object to a unanimous consent agreement. There has been plenty of last-minute drama with the Senate package. A furious New York Governor Andrew Cuomo held an emergency call with the House’s New York delegation at 11 a.m., where he told them “New York is dead’ and they needed to push for a stronger package, according to people familiar with the call.  Cuomo later grew emotional during a press conference, lashing out at the Senate’s bill as “a drop in the bucket” for his state, which now has 30,611 coronavirus cases. Shortly after, Schumer, who represents New York and signed off on the bill, organized his own teleconference for his state’s delegation to help rally support for the bill. Still, Democrats have touted wins in the package, including $130 billion in funding for hospitals; a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits; federal oversight of a $500 billion fund to aid distressed industries; and a prohibition on access to loans or investments from the new programs to any of Trump’s personal businesses. Republican aides, however, accused Schumer of exaggerating some of his “wins” and countered that the GOP never objected to more money for hospitals or oversight of the $500 billion fund for corporations.  Pelosi and other top Democrats have been fielding questions and complaints from their caucus in a series of calls Wednesday as rank-and-file Democrats complained that their priorities weren’t included in the Senate deal.  Pelosi and other senior Democrats reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats are expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text is unveiled.  House Republicans were also working Wednesday to shore up support. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blessed the deal in a statement Wednesday afternoon. ""Our country is on the edge, but we must be in this fight together,"" McCarthy said. ""It's time for Washington to start acting that way, and send this bill to the President."" The House GOP is scheduled to host two conference-wide calls Wednesday on the economic relief package. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who frequently objects to Congress’s biggest spending packages and isn’t beholden to party leadership, has also scoffed at the deal on Twitter, but signaled he won’t hold it up “if they have majorities to pass it.” Marianne Levine contributed to this story.",Massive coronavirus rescue package hits last-minute snag in Senate,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/senate-vote-coronavirus-rescue-package-deal-148135,politico
"Doctors and nurses are increasingly worried they will become the spreaders of the coronavirus rather than the healers, as hospitals themselves become a hot spot for the pandemic. That fear is already a reality in Italy, the global epicenter of the pandemic, where researchers have found hospitals overloaded by coronavirus patients have become transmission points. Public health officials, like those at the World Health Organization, have increasingly warned that health care workers themselves could be vectors for the disease — accelerating its spread and undermining the ability of countries’ health systems to combat it. U.S. hospital staff worry a similar scenario could play out here, according to 10 health care workers who responded to a POLITICO survey and others who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs. In an open call for hospital workers to tell us what they're seeing, dozens of others cited concerns about equipment and testing shortages, as well as sickness among hospital staff. Essential gear protecting providers is woefully inadequate and could remain so in some areas for weeks, despite assurances from federal officials that more specialized masks and surgical gowns are on their way. And because of a widespread lack of testing, frontline workers said they are treating patients without knowing if they’re infected — and that the coronavirus could spread not just to doctors and nurses, but security and cleaning staff as well. Several American health workers have already died after contracting the virus. In a suburb of Washington, D.C., one major health system isn’t sending sick staff home, even when their symptoms indicate a possible coronavirus infection, according to a nurse who said she took vacation time to self-quarantine after getting symptoms, including a low-grade fever. She’s still waiting for test results she had to drive to another Virginia county to get. In hard-hit New York City, a critical care nurse reported that a sick hospital clinician has exposed a long-term patient to the coronavirus. POLITICO is withholding the names of most facilities in this story on the request of workers who feared retribution for speaking out. The outbreak in Italy could hold important lessons for the worst that could come to America. Physicians handling the brunt of that country's outbreak, to reduce transmission in hospitals, are encouraging mobile clinics and even moving ventilators into patients' homes. ""We are learning that hospitals might be the main COVID-19 carriers, as they are rapidly populated by infected patients, facilitating transmission to uninfected patient,"" Italian doctors wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine recently. In Washington state, an early epicenter of the country’s outbreak, the virus had been “blossoming” undetected in some hospitals for weeks, according to a physician with CHI Franciscan’s network of hospitals there. Early in the outbreak, one patient with an unrecognizable cough had already infected some frontline staff by the time the person’s COVID-19 test came back positive, the physician said. And this wasn’t an isolated case. The physician reported that over the weekend clinicians — unprotected at the time due to the protective mask shortage — came into contact with patients whose tests came back positive. “I don’t think the problems are any different in our system than elsewhere. It's just that we haven't gotten the surge completely yet,"" said the physician, who credited the health system for shutting down elective surgeries over 10 days ago, before there was mounting pressure on hospitals to do so. A spokesperson for the hospital system said all staff members are being screened before entering a facility and health care workers who are ""coughing, have a fever, or feel ill"" are asked to stay home. “These are not normal times, and we are doing everything we can to keep our staff and patients safe, while also conserving masks under the latest local CDC guidelines,"" said Cary Evans, the spokesperson. Evans said the system’s hospitals are sharing resources and “working very hard to find more resources as soon as possible."" In Connecticut, a nurse at a community hospital said her facility is giving providers just one specialized mask to treat coronavirus patients; they put a face shield in front of the mask to protect it and reuse both. Those who aren’t treating coronavirus patients or suspected cases don’t use the masks, but there’s still fear that the infection could spread. “Am I going to bring this home to my kids? Am I going to bring this home to my husband?” said the nurse, whose spouse is a first responder. Many hospitals are urging patients who aren’t very sick to stay at home, and some are conducting tests in isolation tents or screening patients in their cars. The Trump administration has urged hospitals to postpone nonessential elective procedures, such as cataract surgery and colonoscopies. There's been resistance among some hospitals which depend on the lucrative procedures, though, and some health workers expressed concern to POLITICO that those could further spread the virus throughout hospitals. Federal officials say they’re prioritizing measures to keep health care workers safe. President Donald Trump said this week that FEMA is distributing 8 million special medical masks and 14 million surgical masks to areas around the country, particularly where they're needed most. FEMA has received 6.5 million more in donations. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, the nation's top doctor, said he's heard concerns around the country about protecting health workers. “I want health care workers of America to know, we are fighting for you each and every day to make sure you get what you need from the stockpile, to make sure you get what you need from manufacturers across America,"" Adams said during a Fox News virtual town hall on Tuesday. For weeks, however, state officials and hospitals have urged the federal government to provide more protective equipment. Some frontline health workers made pleas on social media. Others crafted their own surgical masks and have taken to recycling whatever gear they can. “Hospitals are in a tough position,"" said an emergency physician based near Oakland, Calif. ""Because all the leadership would prefer to have more equipment available and the sudden surge of demand has put all these hospitals in this untenable position of trying to procure something that needs massive manufacturing.” In some parts of America, the risk of infection isn’t confined to hospitals directly treating coronavirus patients. It appears to be spreading through facilities connected to health systems. One Indiana nurse who works at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic next to a hospital said she had virus symptoms and went through multiple phone screenings while her supervisors debated how to handle the situation. One supervisor said she should get tested, but another manager reversed that decision. She said she was cleared to return to work as soon as she recovered from her low-grade fever, even though she hadn't completed the typical 14 days of quarantine for people who've been ill or directly exposed to the virus, and she was still coughing. She still doesn't know if she had the virus, and she and her colleagues don’t typically wear protective masks since they work outside the hospital.

"Rural communities are bracing for the looming recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, expecting that it could devastate already shaky economies. As the virus shuts down schools, factories, restaurants and other businesses, rural towns contend with a smaller tax base, less access to high-speed internet and growing strain among lenders. Both farming and manufacturing were hurt in recent years under President Donald Trump’s trade wars, which in turn took tolls on community banks concentrated in the Midwest. Rural demographics and aging infrastructure often make it harder for these regions to confront an economic crisis and bounce back. Jessie Hobbs, a row crop farmer in Alabama, was already worried about the economic fallout long before the national emergency was declared. Now, corn futures have fallen from about $4 at the start of 2020 to below $3.50 this week, and other commodity prices are down off over worries about a drop in demand. “It’s affecting me emotionally, physically and somewhat financially,” said Hobbs, who washes his hands with diesel fuel, which he believes is more effective at sanitizing against germs. “We don’t know much about what’s down the road and what it might bring.” Lenders are worried about huge numbers of auction barns and processing plants closing down, leaving farmers with dwindling options for where to sell their products. Every hit to agriculture ripples throughout the broader rural economy. “It’s not only the farmers — it’s the Main Street businesses that they’re doing business with, the people that are employed by the processing and distribution chain,” said Mark Scanlan, senior vice president of agriculture and rural policy at the Independent Community Bankers of America, whose members are some 5,000 lenders. “This will be a wallop. This could set things back."" A recent USDA study comparing urban and rural areas from 2010 to 2018 found that the most isolated rural counties saw the steepest population loss and have the highest poverty rates. Labor force participation was slower to recover since the 2008-09 Great Recession in rural counties, while the income gap between metro and non-metro areas has only widened over the last decade. As painful as the last economic downturn was for rural regions, the current crisis poses its own problems that could ultimately be more devastating. “This is gonna be a whole new game,” said Ian LeMay, president of the California Fresh Fruit Association, which represents grape, blueberry and tree fruit growers and shippers. “There are probably lessons we have learned from ‘08, but I think the dynamics around what we’re seeing are much different and potentially could be longer-lasting.” USDA, for its part, has taken steps to help rural communities brace for the pandemic, like easing requirements for food assistance as well as rural housing programs that support low-income people. The latest Senate bill is also giving the Agriculture Department more power and $23 billion more to directly aid farmers and ranchers affected by the economic fallout. With widespread school closures across the country, many classes have gone virtual. But that’s not an option for plenty of students who lack reliable internet access at home, a disparity known as the digital homework gap. More critically, those shutdowns have made it harder to feed low-income students who rely on schools for subsidized meals. Districts face extra challenges in trying to feed rural school children, like wide distances between their homes and meal pickup sites. Shrinking access to cash-strapped and far-flung hospitals could also become a bigger crisis as the pandemic spreads to rural communities, where residents on average are older and more likely to have underlying health issues, according to USDA. Rural America “has a higher proportion of people vulnerable to the virus,” with less ability to work remotely, economists with the liberal think tank Center for American Progress wrote earlier this month. “Because of the economy that rural Americans face, they do not have the capacity to keep themselves safe from COVID-19 and continue to make a living,” it warned. Farmers and ranchers are already seeing their bottom lines eroded by the virus, which is hitting the U.S. just as planting begins across most of the country. The outbreak — and strict preventative measures to contain it — might even stretch into harvest season, with the first wave set to launch as soon as April in farming regions like the West Coast. “These type of black swan events, you can’t anticipate it,” said John Newton, chief economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation. “It’s a shock to the global economy. We will rebound and recover — it’s just a matter of how long’s the drag on this.” Tom Slunecka, CEO of the Minnesota Soybean Research and Promotion Council, said in February that it could take months to make up for the initial trade losses as the virus spread through China earlier this year. That shut down ports and factories while shipments of food and farm goods piled up. China is an irreplaceable market for soybean growers in the Upper Midwest who ship the vast majority of their beans there, Slunecka said. But farmers have been hamstrung by retaliatory tariffs over the last two years, crushing Chinese demand and weighing on soybean prices. The coronavirus is threatening to keep the downward pressure on prices in 2020. May soybean futures, which were roughly $9.70 per bushel at the start of the year, plummeted more than 16 percent by mid-March. “We desperately need some relief in our commodity prices,” Slunecka said. “There are a large number of farms that are hurting to a level that they haven’t seen in five years.” The global economic slowdown could also tie up imports and limit producers’ access to critical supplies, from farm chemicals to the computer systems on their combines, many of which are manufactured abroad. “We’re at the mercy of the global system to make sure that our inputs are there on time,” said Slunecka. “We’ll purchase what we can early, and the rest is just going to be a wild card.”",‘This will be a wallop’: Rural areas brace for hard economic hit,2020-03-26,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/26/rural-areas-coroanvirus-economy-149218,politico

Anger on Capitol Hill is growing over moves by insurers to deny claims being filed by restaurants, retailers and other businesses that believed they had coverage to financially protect themselves from a major disruption like the one they're now enduring. The insurance industry is so alarmed at the prospect of a massive payout that it's rushing to put together a plan to get Washington off its back. With lawmakers and the Trump administration hungry for new ways to support small businesses, insurance trade groups are weighing whether to propose a federal program that would direct funds to businesses disrupted by the pandemic. One early iteration was described as something similar to the victims compensation fund set up after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Industry insiders argue that it’s a way insurers can help the country during a deep economic slump while also heading off bipartisan pressure from Congress to pay out tens of billions of dollars or more in claims to businesses that have been forced to close their doors to slow the spread of the pandemic. “The industry is looking to be part of the solution,” said Tom Glassic, a consultant who served as senior insurance counsel to the House Financial Services Committee. The behind-the-scenes negotiations underscore the pressure that many industries are facing to help prop up the economy in the face of what's expected to be a historic level of business closures and layoffs. As restaurants and shops across the country scramble to make ends meet, they're finding that business interruption insurance policies didn't necessarily cover losses from outbreaks — just physical damage to their property. Jason Berry, co-founder of Washington, D.C.-based KNEAD Hospitality + Design, said his company paid $100,000 per year in insurance for its four restaurants only to have insurers deny business interruption claims in recent days. He's speaking with a lawyer and considering going to court, underscoring why the insurance industry is bracing for a massive wave of litigation over disputed payouts. ""Business owners everywhere — not just restaurants — are flabbergasted that they've been paying on a timely basis thinking they're covered if something bad happens, only to find out it's not the case,"" Berry said. Stories like Berry's are prompting a growing outcry in Washington, and lawmakers are eager to intervene. Insurance lobbyists have already been fighting off attempts at legislation that would have made policies retroactively cover the pandemic. Last week, 18 House lawmakers led by Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.) told insurance trade groups that their members should recognize financial losses triggered by the coronavirus outbreak as part of their customers’ business interruption coverage. The bipartisan letter was signed by 12 Democrats and six Republicans. “During times of crisis, we must all work together,” they said. The controversy prompted state insurance regulators on Wednesday to issue a stark warning that said forcing insurance companies to pay the massive number of business interruption claims would threaten the solvency of the insurance sector and exacerbate the economic turmoil. Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs at the National Restaurant Association, said that finding a way for the federal government to help with business interruption insurance claims is a top priority for his group's members. The association has called for the creation of a $100 billion federally backed business interruption insurance program to get funds to businesses in an expedited time frame. “We will definitely be at the table with our members asking for some kind of solution that will allow restaurant owners to claim their benefits under these policies,” Kennedy said. In recent days, major insurance trade associations including the American Property Casualty Insurance Association and the Reinsurance Association of America kicked off discussions with other business trade groups about the design of a potential federal program that could direct money to affected businesses, possibly via the insurance industry. One early proposal that circulated among insurance lobbyists in the last few days envisioned a ""Federal Business Interruption and Workers' Protection Recovery Fund"" — patterned after the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund — that would make assistance available to all businesses. Insurance industry sources said the plan was being revised. David Sampson, president and CEO of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, confirmed that the group was “discussing public policy options with many industry and stakeholder groups."" He acknowledged the need for ""liquidity solutions"" for the business community during the crisis and said the association hasn't settled on any specific proposal. ""Ideally, if they want to deliver the money quickly, they won’t put insurers in the middle,” said Jimi Grande, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies. “But we want to be available to help if that’s ultimately the way they go."" The issue is expected to attract greater attention as Congress pivots from the ""phase three"" coronavirus economic rescue package being debated this week and lawmakers turn to follow-up legislation. “It’s a very sensitive negotiation,” said Joel Wood, senior vice president for government affairs at the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers. “I wouldn’t want to jeopardize the conversations between all the stakeholders. But there is anticipation that much more beyond phase three is going to be required for many of our clients to survive. It’s all about liquidity, liquidity, liquidity.” For members of Congress pressing insurers to act, it’s a step in the right direction. “I’m glad my letter to the insurance industry drew their attention to this mammoth problem,” Velazquez said. ""I’m hopeful it motivates them to work constructively with Congress so all businesses harmed by the virus can receive badly needed assistance.”",Insurers scramble to avoid 9/11-style coronavirus backlash,2020-03-26,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/26/insurers-avoid-9-11-style-coronavirus-backlash-149462,politico
"Let’s take inventory of what new insights we have learned from the pandemic about President Donald Trump and his leadership character. One could hardly miss how this crisis has fortified one of the two primary pillars of the anti-Trump argument, as advanced by his most ardent detractors. It has been insufficiently noted, however, the degree to which the coronavirus response has weakened the other pillar. The first pillar is that Trump, in the near-unanimous view of the opposition, is a terrible person whose terribleness finds expression in terrible policies. He is narcissistic, dismissive of unwelcome facts, willing to traffic in falsehoods, lacking in empathy, erratic in personal manner, and, above all, impulsive in judgment. Are you following so far? Even a Trump defender could comprehend how Trump critics would seize on the performance of the past two months—“We have it totally under control,” he said on Jan. 22—to add damaging new counts to the indictment they began compiling four years ago. It is the second pillar of the anti-Trump case that has wobbled curiously in recent weeks. This president allegedly is not just a near-term menace but a long-term one—a leader bent on amassing personal power and undermining constitutional democracy in ways that would last beyond his presidency (which, under the worst scenarios, he might even try, Vladimir Putin-style, to extend illegally if he loses in November.) The notion of Trump as authoritarian strongman, however, has been cast in an odd light in this pandemic. Would-be tyrants use crisis to consolidate power. Trump, by contrast, has been pilloried from many quarters, including many liberals, for not asserting authority and responsibility more forcefully to combat Covid-19. Rather than seizing on a genuine emergency, Trump was slow to issue an emergency declaration, moved gingerly in employing the War Production Act to help overburdened local health systems, and even now seems eager to emphasize that many subjects—closure of schools and businesses, obtaining sufficient ventilators—are primarily problems for state governors to deal with.  Trump’s apparent personal affinity with Putin, and other dictators, has caused foes to conclude that he has an aesthetic attraction to leaders who don’t let procedural niceties of democracy or law get in their way. But he has shown passivity in what by all rights would be a dream scenario for an authoritarian strongman. Perhaps the way to think of Trump is as an authoritarian weakman. “I don’t take any responsibility at all,” Trump said, a line that seems likely to join a pantheon that includes George W. Bush’s “Brownie, you‘re doing a heck of a job,” and Bill Clinton’s “It depends on what the meaning of ‘is’ is,” as debacle-defining one-liners. That was in response to a question about inadequate supplies of coronavirus testing kits, which many health experts regard as the essence of why the United States has been flat-footed in containing the spread of disease. But the spirit has animated other dimensions of Trump’s response, in which he has been reluctant to make Washington the focal point of pandemic policy. “The governors,” Trump said at a media briefing on Sunday, “locally, are going to be in command. We will be following them, and we hope they can do the job.” Quotes like these don’t mean the critique of Trump as aspiring dictator is in terminal condition. But it is on bed rest with a high fever. He “has abdicated the role played by U.S. presidents in every previous global crisis of the past century, which is to step forward to offer remedies, support other nations and coordinate multilateral responses,” editorialized the Washington Post. New York Times columnist David Leonhardt criticized Trump for declining to “mobilize American business” by invoking an emergency, and said the voluntary initiatives he backs instead “are far less aggressive than a mandatory national effort would be.” Of course, even if Trump isn’t grasping for new power, others in his administration may be. POLITICO’s Betsy Woodruff Swan first reported on the Justice Department’s plan to seek new authority during emergencies, including asking judges to detain people without trial. “Over my dead body,” responded conservative Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah.) “Hell no,” added liberal Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) Experience suggests one should not get too fixated on any single image of Trump—a kaleidoscopic figure at most times, and especially including this one in the midst of highly fluid circumstances like a global pandemic. Many appraisals of Trump, from admirers and foes alike, depend in part on how one holds any particular moment up to the light. The diverse interpretations of Trump critics tend to fall along a spectrum. They tend also to return to a couple of deeply rutted debates. One debate concerns how seriously anti-Trumpers should take him. At one end of the spectrum are people who find Trump an absurd figure to be president but essentially the political equivalent of a professional wrestler—lots of bluster and puffery that is ultimately devoid of content beyond self-protection and self-promotion. By these lights Trump is dangerous in a moment like the corona pandemic because he is in over his head, not because he has lots menacing plans in his head. At the other end of this spectrum is the belief that he may not be guided by deep ideas in the traditional sense of politics but he is guided by some clear and purposeful instincts—toward elevating executive power (as long as he is the executive), punishing enemies, and weakening traditional constraints of custom and law. This is thesis of a pre-pandemic cover story in the Atlantic by influential writer George Packer.  The other debate, related, concerns how seriously Trump takes himself. Does he have any ability to detach himself from his own performance, to self-critique and modulate, to occasionally give a knowing wink to the audience to signal that he understands his act as well as they do. Or is he so fully immersed in the performance that he is lost in it—no longer makes a distinction between reality show and reality? (Incidentally, these debates among Trump foes are matched by ones from Trump supporters. Is he a crude but surprisingly effective politician with whom one can make common cause—the Mitch McConnell position? Or is he possessed of some kind of mystical leadership skills—possibly what former Energy Secretary Rick Perry meant when he said Trump was God’s “chosen one.”) The debate over how much Trump has weakened constitutional democracy in prepandemic episodes—his effort to nullify the independence of the FBI, for instance, or his consistent defiance of congressional oversight—is an argument without end, one that surely will continue years after Trump leaves office. But the stylistic question—how much ability Trump has to tailor his brand of politics to fit new circumstances and meet new demands—may well have been settled decisively in this crisis. The answer is no. If he had the ability to modulate to the moment he would have done so. And at times he has tried to do so. “Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before,” said at the end of his Oval Office address earlier this month, in a line that read like it was inserted at the insistence of someone else, like Ivanka Trump or Jared Kushner. But his pugilistic instincts returned almost instantly, as did his instinct that the most important part of being a winning leader is bluff self-confidence. Rather than seize command in the crisis, Trump is determined to project that bad news is the fault of someone else. ""The LameStream Media,” Trump tweeted on Wednesday, “is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success.” There was an old Trump argument in a new era. Maybe the most surprising thing we have learned about Trump during the pandemic is that he no longer has much capacity to surprise.

"How/where are you celebrating your birthday and with whom? “Probably the same way as everyone else this month: over the internet, which does offer the advantage of allowing me to invite friends in many time zones. I might even get dressed for the occasion!” How did you get your start in journalism? “I’ve gotten lucky with a pretty straightforward path: high school newspaper to college newspaper -- I was the editor-in-chief of the Yale Daily News, like Michael Barbaro and Rory Gilmore -- to a summer internship on the Metro desk of the Times, where I've been ever since.” What’s an interesting book/article you’re reading during coronavirus social distancing? And why? “The first coronavirus casualty, for a lot of us, was our ability to plan ahead for anything. This week’s birthday drinks, next month’s trip, the wedding in May, the carefully plotted move. I hadn’t realized how much I took that for granted, how much of my sense of well-being and forward motion depended on marking things down in a calendar. That hit me all the harder when I read this short essay by Ali Araghi about growing up in Iran, where political instability or some capricious turn of government was forever screwing up his life plans, and then moving to the U.S., where for the first time he heard people talking casually about the future.” What’s a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn’t get enough attention? “This gets plenty of attention in Middle East circles, but seems worth giving a boost: American policy has favored sanctions over military intervention in Syria -- which, by the way, is experiencing its worst humanitarian catastrophe of the war as the Syrian government and Russia retake Idlib Province chunk by chunk -- but there are many questions about whether there’s anything to be gained from further broad sanctions on the Syrian government, which has never changed its behavior, or if they’re just making life even harder for Syrians who have already been through nine years of war and economic collapse.” How’s the Trump presidency going? “Ask me in two months?” What’s a fun fact that people in Washington might not know about you? “I’ve led a fairly boring, law-abiding life.

"Donald Trump is getting hammered by millions of dollars in Democratic campaign ads depicting his response to the coronavirus as negligent and inept.  But the main super PAC backing his reelection has been silent in response — and Trump’s political advisers are not happy about it. In interviews, more than a half-dozen White House aides, campaign officials and other Trump allies said they felt deserted by the group, America First Action, openly questioning why it’s leaving Trump exposed on the airwaves at the most vulnerable moment of his presidency. “There is a major vacuum on the political front right now, with the White House focused on coronavirus response and the campaign, rightly so, echoing the White House,” said Chris LaCivita, who as chief strategist of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth orchestrated the 2004 John Kerry takedown.  “With attacks coming from all over, the simple question is: Where the hell is the president’s air cover?”  The campaign is legally barred from communicating directly with the super PAC. Trump’s reelection effort itself is not currently attacking Biden on the airwaves during the pandemic because it wants to focus on echoing the president's message. Liberal groups are collectively spending millions of dollars in swing states portraying Trump as an erratic leader at a time of national crisis who failed to recognize the threat the pandemic posed. Joe Biden’s campaign has launched a brutal spot savaging the president for repeatedly downplaying the coronavirus and then complaining that he could have done more had he known about it earlier. And a super PAC aligned with the former vice president is airing a commercial declaring that Trump has “failed” in his response. Yet America First Action, the principal pro-Trump super PAC that has received the blessing of the White House, has been quiet. While the administration and reelection campaign focus on developing a daily message surrounding the crisis, senior Trump aides contend the super PAC should be leading the charge against Biden. The angst underscores a central dilemma confronting Trump and his political advisers: How to wage a reelection campaign and respond to attacks while Americans are dying and daily life is grinding to a halt. The president’s sprawling political apparatus once envisioned launching a massive advertising blitz defining the presumptive nominee, but the idea was scuttled once the coronavirus took hold.  Kelly Sadler, an America First spokeswoman, declined to comment on the group’s plans. She said the pro-Biden groups, including Priorities USA, were squandering funds on misleading commercials while the president notched generally favorable approval ratings for his handling of the crisis. “We are more than happy the clown car at Priorities USA continues to waste liberal donor money as they’ve done year after year. Rest assured, we have plenty of time to put Sleepy Joe to bed,” Sadler said, using Trump’s nickname for the former vice president.  After amassing a huge war chest, the reelection campaign has found itself suddenly frozen by the crisis. While campaign officials have sent out tweets, news releases, and web videos attacking Biden and responding to his broadsides, they've so far held back on a paid advertising effort. The cash-flush Republican National Committee has adopted a similar posture. That's left a gaping void. ”In the midst of the current pandemic crisis, so that the president can focus on leading the nation and projecting an upbeat message of unity, it seems like the ideal time for his super PAC to be handling political messaging, and that messaging should be defining Joe Biden right now,” said Nick Everhart, a veteran Republican strategist who is working on an array of down-ballot races. Pressed for a response to this story, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said: “President Trump is doing his job protecting American citizens and that’s where his focus is.” To the extent Trump is getting backup, it's coming from a pair of unexpected figures: Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton are funding hard-hitting ads against Biden.  Frustration at America First has long been simmering among Trump aides. They want the kind of hard-charging super PAC that played a central role in Barack Obama’s successful 2012 reelection campaign, but say America First hasn't measured up. Much of the irritation surrounds fundraising. While the reelection campaign and RNC have raised record sums, the super PAC has had less success. America First reported $18 million cash on hand in its latest fundraising report, lagging behind Priorities USA, its main liberal competitor. Former WWE executive and Trump Cabinet member Linda McMahon was dispatched to the group last year to help boost fundraising.  According to finance records, McMahon has personally donated $2.7 million to the group this election cycle, about 14 percent of its total haul. Some contend that while the campaign and RNC have found ways to mix it up with Democrats and insert themselves into the news cycle on a daily basis, the super PAC has been more passive. The group's low-profile, critics say, has made it harder for the super PAC to draw the attention of donors. And the task won't get any easier, as the recent stock market sell-off weighs on the fortunes of wealthy givers.  Some senior Republicans said there's little point in waging an expensive advertising campaign right now since Trump himself is dominating the news with his daily news conferences. Typical campaign ads, they argue, would get drowned out by coronavirus coverage. They also said a TV blitz would look crass in the middle of a national emergency. “The more anti-Trumpers politicize the crisis, the higher Trump’s approval rating for handling it will go,” said Alex Castellanos, a longtime Republican strategist who in 2016 helped to oversee a pro-Trump super PAC. “Trump is showing uncharacteristic restraint so far in fighting back. It is the smart move and serving him well.”  America First has defended Trump on Twitter and Fox News, where McMahon appeared this week to tout Trump's economic response to the crisis. The super PAC also sent a letter to TV stations demanding they not run a Priorities USA commercial, which it described as “false, misleading, and deceptive.” (On Wednesday, the Trump campaign sent its own cease and desist letter to stations regarding the spot.) But some White House and campaign aides are concerned that left unanswered, the Democratic ad campaign will bake in the perception that Trump bungled the coronavirus response. “There are only three words that exist in a super PAC’s role,” LaCivita said, “and that’s attack, attack, attack.”",Infighting erupts in Trumpworld as coronavirus attacks mount,2020-03-26,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/26/trump-coronavirus-superpac-148932,politico
"First, China was handling the coronavirus outbreak “really well.” Then, China was to blame for letting the “Chinese virus” spread. Now, China has “very much stepped up” its purchases of American goods amid a “difficult time.” Next? Who knows. Since January, President Donald Trump has wavered repeatedly on China’s culpability for the coronavirus pandemic, a tactic his outside advisers say is helping counteract Chinese propaganda, creating a 2020 reelection argument and protecting years of on-again-off-again trade negotiations with the Asian power. To his critics, it’s merely a typical Trump attempt to shift blame. It’s the latest iteration of a dynamic that has played out over the three years that Trump has managed America’s relationship with China. Armed with the conflicting views of his closest advisers, the president has regularly flip-flopped between lavishing praise on China and its leader, Xi Jinping, and lashing out at the country over trade practices. Now, Trump is in a new fight with China over the narrative about the coronavirus pandemic that is racing around the world and stalling economies. It’s a battle that could help the president as he runs for reelection amid criticism that his administration's sluggish coronavirus response led to a shortage of tests and medical supplies. Even as Trump equivocates, his campaign, amplified by conservative groups and Trump allies, have gone after China.  “America is under attack — not just by an invisible virus, but by the Chinese,” the Trump campaign wrote in a recent email. Trump allies said the president’s vacillation is how he manages a rival power. “He’s being strategic,” said an outside adviser. “China is a clear foe. He builds them up to tear them down. The criticism plays zero role.” “Carrot and the stick,” said Kelly Sadler, a former White House staffer who now works at America First Policies, which supports Trump’s agenda. “It's a pull-and-a-push relationship with China. President Trump has always been very complimentary to President Xi and the Chinese people. He's also been very tough in standing up for Americans by calling out China's unfair trade practices and taking them to task with tariffs.” Most recently, Trump has been using the carrot, backing away from the term “Chinese virus” on Monday night. The shift came amid reports of a rise in racist and xenophobic behavior toward Asian Americans. It also came after a top Chinese official said his government shouldn’t push a conspiracy theory that coronavirus had come from the U.S. But the Trump administration more broadly has not let up on its blame-China message. The State Department on Wednesday pushed to include the phrase “Wuhan virus” — a reference to the Chinese city where the coronavirus originated — in a joint statement from the Group of Seven countries.  And, as always, China could soon find itself back in Trump’s cross-hairs as media reports emerge that officials are once again suppressing case totals and refusing to test patients to preserve the narrative that they are past the worst of the coronavirus outbreak. The White House and the office of Vice President Mike Pence, which heads the coronavirus task force, did not respond to a request for comment. Ryan Hass, the Obama-era National Security Council’s director for China, Taiwan and Mongolia, said Trump’s references to China are “often driven by political expediency.” “When it is advantageous to praise Xi Jinping in order to elicit Xi’s support for trade or exports related issues President Trump will do that,” said Hass, now a fellow at the center-left Brookings Institution. “When it feels like the walls are closing in on criticism about the Trump administration’s response to Covid-19 then he will … seek to shift blame to China for their botched initial efforts to contain the effort in Wuhan.” Trump constantly criticized China when he was on the campaign trail in 2016 pledging to beat the so-called enemy that cost the U.S. jobs, spied on U.S. businesses and stole U.S. technology. But once Trump was sworn into office in 2017, he began to speak fondly about Xi, his “good friend,” describing their relationship as “extraordinary.” Within the Trump administration, there are competing camps on China advising Trump. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser Robert O’Brien are both hawkish voices, focused on the threat the country poses. Others, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow are more concerned about preserving the valuable economic relationship with the country. Some of Trump’s outside friends, including John Thornton, former president of investment bank Goldman Sachs, and Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of the global equity firm Blackstone Group, also fall into that camp. Sometimes, however, Trump seems to ignore all of his aides and friends and just listen to Xi, the Chinese leader. “He’s drawn to authoritarian leaders,” said Michael Green, an Asia specialist for the NSC during the George W. Bush administration.  In January, Trump was receiving information about the coronavirus from both his own intelligence agencies, as well as Xi. Publicly, Trump sided with Xi’s optimistic narrative over the more dire warnings of his intelligence officials, praising Xi and China more than a dozen times for their handling of the coronavirus. “I’m confident that they’re trying very hard,” Trump told a Phoenix radio station on Feb. 19. “I know President Xi. I get along with him very well. We just made a great trade deal, which is going to be a lot of business for Arizona and every other place. But they are trying very, very hard, and I think the numbers are going to get progressively better as we go along.” That started to change in March. Those around Trump, including Pompeo, incoming chief of staff Mark Meadows, allies on Capitol Hill and conservatives on television, began calling the coronavirus the “Wuhan virus” or “Chinese virus.” ""There's been some discussion about China and what they knew and when they knew it,” Pompeo said. “The world is entitled to know.” Initially, China struck back, with the country's foreign ministry spokesman saying the U.S. Army may have had a role in spreading the virus.  “It might be U.S. army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” Zhao Lijian tweeted. “Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” It was then that Trump adopted “Chinese virus.” A photographer from The Washington Post captured a photo of Trump’s notes from a news briefing last week showing the word “corona” crossed out in coronavirus and replaced with the word “Chinese.” The president shrugged off accusations that the term was inappropriately divisive and racially tinged. The president’s outside allies swiftly adopted the posture.  “China unleashed this plague on the world, and there will be a reckoning when we're on the backside of it,” Sen. Tom Cotton, (R-Ark.) said Wednesday on Fox News. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is introducing a resolution calling for an investigation to prove the virus started in Wuhan and to hold China accountable. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fl.) introduced a bill this week that would bar taxpayer money, including funding from coronavirus recovery legislation, from being given to Chinese government-linked businesses. “The global coronavirus pandemic has been exacerbated by the Chinese government’s malicious misinformation and propaganda campaign against the United States and its citizens,” Gaetz said. Separately, Trump’s allies and aides have been trying to rewrite the narrative that Trump was slow to respond to the coronavirus, publicizing a list of actions he took to fight the virus since Jan. 6, a week after China reported the discovery of the coronavirus to the World Health Organization. That includes his decision to halt most travel from China. The president said in a Fox News town hall on Tuesday that he doesn’t regret using the phrase Chinese virus, but that he had retired it because Americans received his message. “I don't regret it,"" he said. ""But, you know, they accused us of having done it through our soldiers. They said our soldiers did it on purpose. What kind of a thing is that? … I didn't like that. So I think, look, everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn't make any more of a big deal out of it. I think I've made a big deal.” Meridith McGraw contributed to this report.",Trump can’t decide whether to blame China for the coronavirus,2020-03-26,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/26/trump-china-coronavirus-148806,politico
"The coronavirus pandemic—sadly—has introduced or reintroduced many people to the concept of an exponential curve, in which a quantity grows at an increasing rate over time, as the number of people contracting the virus currently is doing. It is this curve that so many of us are trying to “flatten” through social distancing and other mitigating measures, small and large. It’s easy to project a pattern of smooth, linear growth: one person gets the coronavirus today, another person contracts it tomorrow, a third person gets it on the third day, and the process continues in this manner, the cases simply adding. But most people, including leaders and policymakers, have a harder time imagining exponential growth, which means you can have two cases of coronavirus tomorrow, four on the third day, hundreds after the seventh day and thousands soon after—a situation that’s challenging to anticipate and manage. That’s the nature of pandemics. It’s also how climate change works. And if there’s any silver lining in this mess, it’s that the coronavirus pandemic is teaching us a valuable lesson about the perils of ignoring destructive processes—and perhaps even larger, longer-term disasters—that increase exponentially. Even if growth looks mild in the moment—think of the earliest segments on an exponential curve like the red line shown in the illustration above—it will soon enough be severe. In other words, delay is the enemy. The human mind does not easily grasp the explosive nature of exponential growth. This was demonstrated more than 40 years ago in a series of pioneering psychological experiments conducted in the Netherlands by Willem Wagenaar and his colleagues. In one study, participants were shown a hypothetical index of air pollution beginning in 1970 at a low value of 3 and rising yearly in an exponential way to 7, 20, 55 and, finally, 148 by 1974. Asked to intuitively predict the index value for 1979, many of the respondents produced estimates at or below 10 percent of the correct value of about 21,000 (which can be determined from the underlying exponential equation). Subsequent experiments have observed similarly dramatic underestimation of exponential growth and showed that it typically results from straight-line projections based on early small increases. The deceptive nature of exponential growth is similarly conveyed by the riddle of a single lily pad in a pond. Suppose each member of this species reproduces once a day so that on the second day there are two lily pads, on the third day there are four, on the fourth day there are eight, etc. On Day 48, the pond is covered completely. How long did it take to be covered halfway? The answer is 47 days. Moreover, even after 40 days of exponential growth, you would barely know the lily pads are there, as they would cover only 1/256th (0.4 percent) of the pond at that time. For a period of time, we can easily ignore the steady exponential growth of lily pads—until they smother the pond. With respect to the coronavirus, the initial doubling of the relatively small numbers of infected cases and deaths evoked little concern outside China in January and most of February, since, for weeks, people around the world had little or no personal exposure to the virus or its victims. But the deceptively mild and seemingly faraway beginnings of the current pandemic led health officials and governments to squander many opportunities for early intervention. As a result, in the past few weeks, the numbers have quickly become a torrent overwhelming our capacity to stop the virus’ spread and care for the victims. It took 67 days to reach 100,000 coronavirus cases worldwide. The second 100,000 cases took 11 days, and the third 100,000 took only four days. Public-health authorities are now scrambling to communicate just how steep and damaging the coronavirus growth curve has or could become, and urgent response is becoming the law of the land. Aside from the coronavirus pandemic, the biggest, most destructive exponential growth processes that we must grapple with today are those associated with global climate change. While it might be hard for humans to detect that carbon emissions and their concentration in the atmosphere are growing exponentially right now, that doesn’t mean we should rest easy. The opposite is true. As with the coronavirus, we need to anticipate the climate crisis and act quickly and aggressively to minimize further damages before they overwhelm us.  Scientists have long recognized that carbon dioxide emissions and their resulting effects have been increasing exponentially. Figure 1 shows the monthly average carbon dioxide concentration measured at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii—the longest record of direct measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere. The volume of CO2 stood at 315 parts per million (ppm) when first measured in 1958; by the end of February 2020, it had risen by 31 percent to 414 ppm. That might not sound all that worrisome on the surface. But this exponential increase signals that CO2 emissions are likely to be considerably higher in the coming years, unless we take strong measures now to reduce them. Otherwise, the exponential growth of CO2 emissions will drive our climate to extremes that look nothing like a linear extrapolation of recent history. We will experience more blistering heat waves, severe droughts, accelerating sea level rise, and unprecedented intensity of rainstorms and resulting flooding, just to name a few of the consequences.  Or consider another example of exponential growth related to increasing CO2 emissions: financial losses caused by climate change-related flooding, combined with population growth. A 2013 analysis in 136 major coastal cities around the world reveals that sea level rise (SLR) of 20 cm (7.9 inches) by 2050—an optimistic scenario—will cause the average annual flood losses in those cities to increase to $1.2 trillion that year from $52 billion in 2005. A more pessimistic scenario of SLR of 40 cm (15.7 inches) by 2050 will lead to average annual flood losses of $1.6 trillion. Houston was one of the 20 most vulnerable coastal cities in the study, and its average annual damage with an optimistic SLR scenario is estimated to increase by 78 percent, from $5.1 billion in 2005 to $9.1 billion in 2050. People are actually moving into harm’s way, not realizing the potential for severe damage they might suffer in the coming years due to climate change. From 1980 until 2018, the population of hurricane-prone counties in Florida increased by 163 percent, from 3.7 million people to 9.8 million, compared with a 61 percent increase in the population of the United States during this period. These Florida residents might not recognize that they are likely to experience increased damage from more intense hurricanes coupled with sea level rise due to climate change.  If carbon emissions continue to grow exponentially, most of the United States could see 20 to 30 more days annually with maximum temperatures higher than 90 degrees, with the Southeast potentially enduring 40 to 50 more such days. This extreme heat poses serious health risks, especially for the very young and the elderly, construction and agricultural workers, and those living in the core of urban areas. Wildfires present another problem that is growing exponentially and is exacerbated by global warming, as temperatures rise and humidity falls. California experienced a particularly drawn-out drought from December 2011 to March 2019 that contributed to extensive wildfire damage that is likely to increase significantly in the future because of climate change.  Taking a lesson from our flat-footed response to the coronavirus pandemic, we can no longer delay aggressive actions to halt and reverse what otherwise will be inevitable pandemic-like crises arising from climate change. Already, tipping points have been reached: Human populations and cultures are being devastated, and many species are becoming extinct.  Obviously, dealing with the present dangers from the coronavirus must be everyone’s top priority at this moment. We will eventually get control of this demon and begin to restore some semblance of normal life. When we do, the world must turn its attention to reducing CO2 emissions and stopping the further exponential havoc that climate change will wreak, far sooner than we expect.

"It was going to cost $1 trillion.  Late on March 16, five days after the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic, Larry Kudlow — the one-time cable news talker turned top economic advisor to President Donald Trump — was in the Senate’s historic Mansfield room, telling a group of senior GOP senators something they didn’t want to hear.   The U.S. economy was going to need a lot of help — and fast. Americans faced dire consequences if Congress didn’t act quickly, warned Kudlow, alongside Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland. The senators were stunned and dismayed.  Ten days later, the price tag for the Senate’s coronavirus economic rescue package has ballooned to more than $2 trillion, twice what Kudlow initially suggested, making it by far the most expensive spending bill in history.  The legislation — which passed the Senate by a unanimous, 96-0 vote late Wednesday and is expected to easily be approved by the House — provides direct payments to millions of individual Americans, dramatically expands unemployment insurance for workers forced out of their jobs by the crisis, and allocates hundreds of billions of dollars to distressed industries, hospitals and small businesses, as well as dozens of other provisions.  Senators in both parties hailed the passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES Act, as a major achievement, especially considering the extraordinary circumstances — a largely deserted Capitol, senators huddled in self-quarantine and a country slowly shutting down to save itself from even more suffering.  “It's a proud moment for the Senate,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in an interview with POLITICO. “We responded to the way the American people are acting among themselves by helping each other and putting whatever past grievances they have behind and trying to work together to get this behind us.”  But the process wasn’t always pretty.  At one point, the “Big 4” congressional leaders — McConnell, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) — squabbled with each other during a meeting in McConnell’s office, and there remains resentment among the quartet.  Senators attacked each other in surprisingly personal terms on the floor, accusing one another of playing politics while the country suffered. Senate Republicans complained bitterly in private when Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky revealed that he was tested for the coronavirus but had spent several days huddling with his colleagues, even swimming in the Senate’s pool the morning he received his positive diagnosis.  There were several setbacks and reversals in the “Phase 3” stimulus talks, interminably long late-night meetings that ended with little visible progress, and tedious reviews of legislative language in order to make sure one side wasn’t trying to slip something past the other — all of which dragged out a final vote days after many expected it to take place.  Schumer played a central role in the drama, serving as the lead Democratic negotiator and huddling for hours in his office with Mnuchin. And Mnuchin once again emerged as the go-to official for the Trump White House when it comes to negotiating with congressional Democrats. By the end of their discussions, the two referred to each other as “Chuck and Steven.”  “It’s one of the most major pieces of legislation we’ve done,” Schumer said in an interview. “I guess there are only a few other moments, I suppose. Obamacare. But otherwise you can’t think of something so major since the Great Society, Lyndon Johnson…”  How the typically-slow moving Senate went from nothing to a $2 trillion-plus emergency rescue package in just 10 days is a reflection of what senators described as a “snowball effect,” set into motion by the rapid spread of the virus and the cascading economic effect of business and school closures, dwindling airline traffic, and “stay-at-home” orders issued by officials in some of the nation’s largest cities and states. Plus, it took a whole lot of cash to make everyone happy.  “We have been totally inoperational for the last several years,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said. “And I’m very glad that we were able to step up and pass several major pieces of legislation that may end up saving the country from catastrophe.”  In a sign that the agreement may actually be a true compromise, both sides are claiming they got what they wanted all along.  McConnell described the final product as a “Republican-leaning bill” that meets his “four pillars”: aid to small businesses, direct cash payments, loans to companies in distressed industries, and money to fund the medical response to the coronavirus crisis. McConnell also kept Pelosi out of the early round of negotiations, despite pressure from her and Schumer to be involved in the talks. McConnell had been unhappy about how Mnuchin and Pelosi collaborated on the previous coronavirus response bill (known as “Phase 2” on the Hill), and he wasn’t going to repeat that process.  Schumer, for his part, boasts that Democrats negotiated key provisions to implement unemployment insurance “on steroids” and provide necessary oversight over federal loans to corporations, as well as securing tens of billions of dollars for hospitals as part of a so-called “Marshall Plan” for the health-care system.  “If this is a Republican bill, then I welcome the big-government, government-must-help-people, the big-government Republican Party,” Schumer quipped. “When you have a major crisis like this, the Republican mantra of ‘Let the private sector solve everything’ just won’t work, and you need large government involvement. And that’s what gave us an intrinsic advantage.”  Schumer and Democrats also pushed to create a separate fund for beleaguered state governments that have seen their revenue plummet. Democrats won $150 billion for the state fund, though they initially sought a whopping $750 billion.  Another concession for Democrats was a provision that prohibits businesses controlled by the president, vice president, members of Congress and heads of executive branch departments from receiving loans from the Treasury Department. It also bars their children, spouses and in-laws from receiving such benefits. Some Senate insiders referred to this as the “Kushner Amendment,” after senior White House adviser — and presidential son-in-law — Jared Kushner.  Republicans, though, said the final bill largely reflects the proposed legislation they introduced on Saturday, despite the ensuing several days of partisan battles. GOP aides noted the final package retains largely the same unemployment insurance and direct payments schemes originally outlined. The section on small-business loans is intact, and the GOP won fights barring Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood and other non-profits. There’s more than $23 billion in aid for farmers that Republicans sought. They also spurned Democratic efforts to cut ICE funding.  However, Democrats secured language establishing an inspector general and a congressional panel to oversee the $500 billion “Exchange Stabilization Fund” run by the Treasury Department, which will make loans to corporations and municipalities. But Republicans blocked subpoena power from being granted to the oversight board of what critics on the left and right are calling a “slush fund.”  “Certainly the Democrats were not ignored. They can't be, you can’t pass things one party only here,” McConnell said, alluding to the Senate’s 60 vote-threshold. “But this is a bill that was largely, not entirely but largely, produced by Republicans in consultation with the Democratic minority. “  But the debate over the massive stimulus package blurred ideological lines from the start. For example, it was Republicans, not Democrats, who first proposed sending checks directly to millions of Americans, an anathema to conservative doctrine. As lawmakers saw the death toll rise and witnessed confirmed coronavirus cases and unemployment claims skyrocket, it was clear that they had to take drastic action soon, meaning political pragmatism overwhelmed ideological concerns.  That meant Congress ended up doing what Congress does best: spending money. Even as the Senate was finishing work on a $100 billion, “Phase 2” coronavirus bill, Mnuchin warned Republicans at the March 17 meeting that unemployment rates could spike to 20 percent or more unless the Senate passed an even bigger bill to aid the economy. Mnuchin later walked the comments back when the frightening estimates became public, but Trump was pushing McConnell and Mnuchin for quick action.  Yet the Senate as an institution has perhaps never been so poorly equipped to handle a crisis of this magnitude quickly. The chamber has largely abdicated much of its authority, be it on oversight or foreign policy, in the Trump era. And the bitterness over Trump’s impeachment trial — which ended on Feb. 5 — remains very fresh. That the Senate was able to rise above those circumstances is a reflection of the seriousness of the crisis itself.  “What’s this country going to look like two weeks from now? Just look how much it has changed in 10 days. Imagine another five,” said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). “What we’re dealing with here is not some ordinary ideological debate during ordinary times or even during an economic downturn. It is a catastrophic collapse of the economy via government fiat.”  On March 17, Schumer proposed a “big and bold” $750 billion plan to “fight the coronavirus epidemic and economic crisis,” although the proposal contained more broad strokes than policy details. Schumer was aiming to stake out a position before McConnell and the Republicans announced their own proposal, seeking a way to increase his bargaining power. Much of the Democratic thrust would go toward beefing up the unemployment system, which already existed on the ground in all 50 states and could target those Americans who had recently lost jobs.  But McConnell and Senate Republicans had their own vision for what a coronavirus proposal would look like. The effort largely centered on hundreds of billions in direct payments to individual Americans, with checks being cut by the IRS. A one-time $1,200 payment would go out in weeks.   On March 19, McConnell rolled out his $1 trillion economic proposal that featured the direct-payments provision favored by Senate GOP leaders and the White House. But some Republicans objected to that effort, seeing beefed-up unemployment payments as a better option. Other GOP senators said the proposal unfairly cut out lower-income taxpayers. Democrats rejected the proposal as well.  In order to negotiate with the Democrats — and to help him control the process — McConnell created four bipartisan “task forces” to hash out issues and begin drafting language. McConnell told senators to work at “warp speed” and vowed to keep the Senate in session until a bill was passed. He called for passage of a completed package by Monday, setting up procedural votes for the weekend. It was a hugely ambitious schedule, and Republicans praised McConnell's accelerated timetable.  The task force roster included Rubio and Republican Sens. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Richard Shelby (Ala.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Roger Wicker (Miss.), Susan Collins (Maine), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Pat Toomey (Pa). By Thursday, they had a $1 trillion GOP proposal in hand and were ready to meet with their Democratic counterparts.  On the Democratic side were Sens. Ron Wyden (Ore.), Ben Cardin (Md.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), Dick Durbin (Ill.), Bob Menendez (N.J.), Maria Cantwell (Wash.), Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), Jack Reed (R.I.) and Patty Murray (Wash.)  Starting on March 20, Republicans and Democrats proceeded to huddle in the Senate Finance Committee offices in the Dirksen Office Building, trying to hammer out language on several fronts, including small business loans, unemployment insurance, hospital assistance and money for distressed industries.  ""The bottom line was Democrats were going to insist on four months and the $600 more per week on top of existing benefits,"" said Wyden, who stayed in close touch with Schumer.  A key portion of the final bill, a $377 billion fund to provide loans to small businesses, started out at just a fraction of that amount when senators began negotiating — around $40 billion. Rubio, who chairs the Senate Small Business Committee, said it became clear over time that in order for it to be effective, the package would have to cost “multiples of that,” especially if the Senate was unable to convene as a whole for a long period of time.  “We’re now one day, one hour, one diagnosis away from a significant percentage of the Senate being quarantined and being unable to act,” Rubio said. “What happens if 20 people get knocked out into a quarantine, or 30? Suddenly you have problems bringing people together to actually pass something, to function, given our current rules.”  Paul and Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) were in self-quarantine and missed the vote, while Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) was ""under the weather"" with a cold. One idea that got little play was Trump’s call for a payroll tax cut, a potentially hugely expensive move. Democrats were uniformly against it, and several Republicans expressed reservations about the plan, questioning whether it would help workers who needed federal assistance the most.  Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who initially proposed the idea to Trump, said the payroll tax cut quickly fell through the cracks because it became clear that such a proposal couldn’t muster bipartisan support.  “The bottom line is it didn’t have enough Republicans and Democrats to put that on the table as something that both sides would agree to. Because we needed to move quickly,” Daines said. “Every hour mattered.”  No deal was reached on Friday despite what both sides agreed was considerable progress. After meeting again on Saturday — with Mnuchin shuttling between groups of senators while talking to Trump in between — McConnell convened a GOP leadership meeting. When it was clear no deal was going to happen that day, McConnell called a halt in the negotiations late that afternoon. Republicans would draft a new bill, incorporating ideas raised in the task-force sessions plus the original GOP proposal. That new “compromise” legislation would be released Sunday, ahead of a scheduled cloture vote to move forward on the measure.  On Saturday night, Pelosi returned to Washington after a week in San Francisco. She and Schumer were upset that McConnell had cut off bipartisan negotiations the previous day and introduced a GOP-drafted package. While the legislation reflected much of the bipartisan talks senators had held, it was clear McConnell counted on Democrats feeling pressure to vote “yes” on the motion and continue negotiating until they could reach a final agreement.  But during the “Big 4” meeting, Pelosi told McConnell that the House Democrats were writing their own bill and it was incompatible with the Senate GOP plan.  “The two animals couldn’t mate,” Pelosi told the Republicans.  Schumer also objected to the GOP proposal, saying it wasn’t going to win Democratic support.   McConnell was furious with Pelosi, but Senate Democrats easily filibustered the attempt to advance the bill. They did the same on Monday as well. GOP leaders lashed out at Pelosi for the delay, but Schumer insisted he didn't have to do much lobbying to keep his members in line.  “I think the Senate was ready to go. And Pelosi threw a wrench in the machine,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a member of GOP leadership. “I really got the impression that the Democrats in the Senate had the sense of urgency. But Nancy had a different view and Schumer connected with her, and that kind of took it off the rails.”  Democrats vehemently disagree with that characterization, and they argue McConnell got ahead of himself by announcing Saturday night there was a bipartisan agreement.  “The Republicans kind of pulled back from the working groups. They started writing language that wasn’t broadly shared with Democrats and by Saturday night there was real alarm about where is this all going,” recalled Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who helped negotiate the bill’s small business provisions.   The impasse led to several hours of bitter sniping on the Senate floor on Monday, with normally low-key senators exploding in anger toward each other. Both sides accused the other of trying to include provisions that had nothing to do with fighting the coronavirus outbreak or rescuing the economy. Republicans sought money for a sexual abstinence program, for instance, while Democrats pushed for limits on greenhouse gas emissions and more collective bargaining power for unions.  Trump had tapped Mnuchin along with Ueland to lead the negotiations with congressional Democrats and Republicans. The Treasury chief spent marathon sessions at the Capitol, day and night, shuttling between meetings with McConnell and Schumer and spending time in his own makeshift hideaway off the Senate floor.  “Look, this was non-stop work for five days. Every night we thought we’d get it done, starting with Sunday night. But that’s not really how the Senate works,” said an official close to Mnuchin. “So he’d stay till midnight and the junior lawyers and staffers would keep working on language on what had been agreed to and hadn’t till 3 or 4 in the morning.”  Mnuchin was perhaps the only senior Trump administration official who could have spearheaded the talks.  Trump hasn’t spoken with Pelosi in more than five months, and their relationship is more frayed than ever, especially after Pelosi led the effort to impeach the president. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who is leaving soon, has been largely sidelined, while Vice President Mike Pence is running the coronavirus task force.   Sen. Patrick Leahy (Vt.), ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, has been engaged in direct talks with Mnuchin over the past week. Leahy recalled a recent meeting he had with Mnuchin and Mulvaney.  “Very good discussions with Secretary Mnuchin,” Leahy recalled. “And then they asked me about Mulvaney and I said, ‘Very good discussions with Secretary Mnuchin.’ And that’s what it’s been now.”  So it fell to Mnuchin, who cut deals with Pelosi over a year-long budget agreement, as well as the previous $100 billion coronavirus response bill, to close the deal. A person close to Mnuchin also noted that the secretary benefited from sharing Trump’s general disdain for hardline ideological positions. Mnuchin learned during the highly partisan tax reform debate in 2017 that building relationships with congressional Democrats really mattered — as did being viewed as speaking directly for Trump, to the limited extent that anyone but Trump himself can do that.  After the Monday cloture vote failed, Mnuchin and Ueland once again began going back-and-forth between McConnell and Schumer’s office on the second floor of the Capitol. A deal was possible, but McConnell and Mnuchin knew that Schumer had shown twice he could keep Democrats in line. They had to make some concessions.  Mnuchin and Schumer worked late into the night on Monday, with Mnuchin agreeing to an oversight board for the $500 billion fund to help distressed corporations. Mnuchin also agreed to tens of billions of dollars for hospitals, another key issue. Democrats were upset that the unemployment payments for coronavirus-related layoffs only covered three months, not four. Republicans gave ground on that as well, although they privately had said that was their intention all along.  Mnuchin and Schumer ended the night saying they were “very, very close,” and both predicted a deal on Tuesday.  The following day, Wall Street soared, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 11 percent, its second biggest day ever. The mood in the Capitol changed dramatically.  Tuesday brought another long round of talks between Mnuchin, Schumer and McConnell, with aid to states a key battleground. Republicans agreed to $150 billion for the “State Stabilization Fund” fund, above where they started but far under what Democrats sought.  At 1:37 a.m. on Wednesday, Mnuchin and Schumer announced they had a deal.  “The president said I got to live in the LBJ room for the last five days, and we couldn’t be more pleased with the unprecedented response from the Senate to protect American workers and American business in this situation,” Mnuchin said at the White House on Wednesday. Of course, it wouldn’t be that easy. A handful of Republican senators initially balked at the expanded unemployment provisions in the agreement, and then Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) threatened to retaliate. The final bill text wasn’t unveiled until after 10:00 p.m. on Wednesday, a half-hour before the vote. But after another long, stop-and-start day, a few minutes before midnight, the Senate voted unanimously to pass the bill. ""We packed months of legislative process into five days,"" Schumer declared beforehand. ""We pivoted from impeachment to 100 to nothing on this rescue package,"" McConnell added. ""This is about as flawless as you could possibly be.""

"PARIS — Only a few weeks ago, policymakers in Brussels, Washington, Paris and Berlin were spending a lot of energy trying to police Big Tech. Not anymore. The coronavirus crisis could have an unexpected consequence: A truce between Big Tech and politicians in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. Last week, Netflix, Google, Facebook and others agreed to reduce the quality of their videos to avoid internet congestion in Europe. According to Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, this could be a turning point in how big platforms behave in the future. “It’s the first time tech companies act in such a strong way. They reacted immediately, and made very important, practically spontaneous, decisions,” he told POLITICO in a phone interview. “The crisis will without doubt accelerate this [kind of behavior].” As priorities dramatically shifted, governments scrambling to deal with the coronavirus crisis called Silicon Valley to the rescue. And powerhouses such as Google, Facebook and Netflix — most of which very much need wins with policymakers — are more than happy to lend a helping hand. “Content providers understood very well the situation and the role they have to play in this crisis,” Breton said. The Frenchman also addressed criticism that the companies' moves sought to resolve a problem that did not exist. “We’re not saying European networks are saturated. But it's our role to anticipate in this unprecedented situation where one billion people all over the world are working from home and to assess whether, collectively, we can give ourselves margins for maneuver,"" he said.  While airlines and hotels are asking for government bailouts, Facebook and Netflix both announced they will provide $100 million in funding to help small businesses and the creative community. Google has rolled out online tools for teachers. Facebook, once criticized for gathering too much EU personal data, is now asked to share anonymized metadata with the Commission to help predict the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. Tech companies are aware that more than their image is at stake in this crisis. “If a large OTT [over-the-top platform] becomes responsible for the collapse of the network and people can no longer work because of that, it can create a massive controversy,” said Sébastien Soriano, the head of the French telecom regulator Arcep. “There is a willingness to be seen as good students to avoid being the straw that broke the camel's back.""  Last Wednesday, Breton arranged a call with Netflix CEO Reed Hastings — who was confined in his California home — to discuss options to help reduce internet congestion. During the hour-long conversation, Hastings said he would look into it and reconvene the following day. Less than 24 hours later, the U.S. streaming giant announced it would move to reduce traffic on European networks by around 25 percent. The EU commissioner then called Google CEO Sundar Pichai and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki with a similar request. The two executives said yes. Over the following days, Disney, Facebook, Amazon Prime Video and Amazon’s Twitch also said they would reduce the quality of their videos. According to Breton, this episode reflects how tech regulation should be in the future. “We need to build a new rationale: Regulators need to work with hard law, but also with soft law, by appealing to those companies’ sense of responsibility to be able to act quickly,” he said, arguing that reaching out directly to CEOs ensures decisions are made and implemented quickly. ""This does not mean we won't have to set very clear rules,"" Breton added. Of course, for Silicon Valley, helping with the crisis could also backfire. “It’s a double-edge sword,” said Soriano. “By collaborating, tech companies are also showing the paramount importance they have taken in our lives, that they are a public service. Can a public service be guaranteed only by goodwill?”  In France, the enemies of yesterday have scored much-needed points with the government and the local ecosystem. Netflix and Disney, who until recently were at odds with policymakers and stakeholders about their financial contribution to French content, are emerging as responsible actors. While the moves by Netflix, Facebook and Google's YouTube won't have a direct financial impact and are no threat to their business models, Disney agreed to lose income by postponing the launch of its streaming service at the government's request (Disney + launched this week in other EU countries such as Italy, Spain and Germany). ""Disney+ made the difficult decision to postpone its launch. Several content providers committed to reduce their bandwidth consumption so that everyone can benefit from the network. I salute their responsibility,"" said French Junior Digital Minister Cédric O, who last week spoke with Disney CEO Bob Chapek. Netflix's move to reduce the quality of videos also earned praise from France's powerful audiovisual collecting society. Telecom operators, also at odds with content providers because of the bandwidth their services consume, are also hoping the coronavirus crisis will be a turning point. “It’s the first time that all the internet actors, from internet service providers to content providers, are coordinated,"" said Michel Combot, director general of the French Federation of Telecoms. ""There are lessons to be learned: The question of favoring standard definition in the long run to make networks more energy efficient is relevant,"" he added.

"The left-wing environmental group Sunrise Movement will back two more liberal candidates challenging longtime Democratic congressmen in primaries this year, looking to add to progressives' modest gains so far in 2020. The group — which was instrumental to pushing the concept Green New Deal into the political mainstream and helped Bernie Sanders consolidate the left behind him in the presidential race — told POLITICO on Wednesday it is endorsing Holyoke, Mass., Mayor Alex Morse, who is running against Rep. Richard Neal, chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, along with Jamaal Bowman, a Bronx middle-school principal who is taking on Rep. Eliot Engel, chairmanof the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  Both challengers also backed by Justice Democrats, the group that launched now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign against another powerful Democratic congressman, Joe Crowley, in 2018. The group's record in 2020 primaries is mixed. A Sunrise-endorsed candidate defeated a Democratic House incumbent last week, but Sen. Bernie Sanders' candidacy has faltered in recent weeks, as most Democratic voters have rallied around Joe Biden to take on President Donald Trump this fall. “It’s an interesting moment for our movement,” said Evan Weber, the group’s political director, acknowledging some of the left’s recent losses. “It’s clear we need to build a deeper bench, and these two races are part of that long-term strategy. We just firmly believe that they would better represent their districts than their current representatives and also think they would better represent America.” Polling in both races has been scant, but both incumbents are well-known and raising more money than their challengers.  Sunrise said its endorsement would come with “leveraging tens of thousands volunteers across the country for phone banks, door knocking, voting pledges and climate education.” The group did not say whether any money or advertising would come with the endorsements though it asserted it raised thousands for their past endorsees and that its volunteers made over 100,000 calls in the lead-up to both the March 3 and March 17 primaries. While former advertising executive Marie Newman toppled incumbent Rep. Dan Lipinski in Illinois last week after Sunrise's endorsement, the group failed to oust moderate Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar in Texas earlier this month and longtime Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush in Illinois. Sunrise endorsed two other Democratic primary candidates for GOP-held congressional seats in Texas: One qualified for a primary runoff, while the other was defeated. The endorsements are the group’s most aggressive moves after the fading of Sanders’ candidacy over the past month. Sunrise and many of its left-wing allies have found success reframing the debate around climate and other issues but have been less successful winning elections.  Besides Sanders, the group's highest-profile candidate was Jessica Cisneros, who narrowly lost to Cuellar. A win in either of these races — New York will hold its primaries in June, while Massachusetts' aren't until September — would be some much-needed wind in their sails.  Weber, Sunrise's political director, believes there’s still a chance Sanders could recover but acknowledged that “it’s clear that what seemed like a very strong position for progressives has eroded, and there’s a lot of reflection to do on that.”",Climate group Sunrise Movement targets 2 powerful House Democrats,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/climate-group-targets-democrats-149498,politico

"President Donald Trump on Wednesday clashed again with reporters at one of his coronavirus task force briefings at the White House, hours after he complained that critical media coverage of his desire to reopen parts of the country by Easter was intended to hurt his reelection chances.  But apart from that confrontation, the normally combative president seemed eager to play nice, paying compliments to his usual political rivals while pulling punches on China. Here are some of the top moments from Wednesday’s press briefing:  Early in the question-and-answer portion of the briefing, Trump was asked about an earlier post on Twitter in which he’d charged that the “LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success.”  Referring to the president’s push to reopen the country by Easter, a timeline at odds with medical experts‘ advice, CBS News’ Paula Reid asked whether that goal was rooted in Trump’s “political interests.” “Just so you understand, are you ready?” Trump shot back. “I think there are certain people who would like it to not open so quickly. I think there are certain people that would like it to do financially poorly because they think that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls.”  “And I don't know if that is so, but I do think it’s so that there are people in your profession that would like that to happen, I think it's very clear,” he continued.  Trump has repeatedly accused the news media of looking to undermine his presidency, labeling journalists “the enemy of the people” countless times while deflecting blame for negative coverage on a peeved press corps. He continued to rail at Reid, accusing her and another reporter of writing “fake news” but declining to offer any evidence to back up his allegation. “They would love to see me, for whatever reason, because we've done one hell of a job — nobody's done the job that we've done,” he argued, “and it's lucky that you have this group here right now for this problem or you wouldn't even have a country left.”  But after Trump‘s spat with reporters, the president let cooler heads prevail when addressing some of his usual political rivals. Trump’s relations with the leaders of New York, the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., have been touch and go over the past several weeks as the state has grappled with coronavirus, a fact that neither Trump nor Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, have been shy to admit. But Cuomo signaled a detente on Wednesday morning, and Trump reciprocated his mollified tone at the evening briefing, acknowledging that the state where he was born and lived nearly his entire life was facing a “number of very tough weeks” but that Cuomo was doing “a very good job.”  “I want you to know that I’m doing everything in my power to help the city pull through this challenge,” Trump insisted. “I'm working hard in New York.” Though he asserted that the outbreak in the state, which has reported more than 10 times more cases than the next hardest hit state, “is by far our biggest problem,” Trump said there were “a lot of good, capable people working on it with us.”  The president also appeared eager to avoid a confrontation with congressional Democrats, declining to criticize his political rivals when asked about one of the provisions they negotiated into the $2 trillion stimulus bill working its way through Congress.  Asked about $25 million that would be set aside for D.C.’s Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Trump shrugged off concerns about the amount, chalking it up as the fruit of bipartisan compromise.  “That was not my request, but you've got to give them something,” the president explained. “It’s something that they wanted. You know, it works that way.” Trump, wary as ever of the optics of a given situation, acknowledged he was prepared for criticism of the provision. “I said that's a lousy sound bite,” he told reporters. “That's not a good sound bite, but that's the way life works.”  Despite criticizing the week’s marathon negotiations as partisan mere days ago, Trump had kind words for Democratic leaders on Wednesday after they brokered a deal with the White House and Republican leadership in the middle of the night.  “The Democrats have treated us fairly, and I really believe we‘ve had a very good back-and-forth and I say that with respect to [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer.”  The president similarly pulled his punches when asked about comments from several Republican lawmakers suspicious of laudatory comments by the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, about the way China handled the coronavirus outbreak .  Though China, where the current outbreak originated, has been accused of a lack of transparency and censorship in the earliest days of the disease, the WHO has in recent weeks commended the country‘s success in reining in the virus — in addition to other countries like South Korea that got the outbreak under control. Asked whether he saw “red flags” or felt that the WHO showed China favoritism, Trump mostly demurred.  “I think that a lot of people feel it‘s been very unfair, it’s been very much sided with China,” Trump said of the U.N.-based organization, adding that it also included “a lot of good people, a lot of good professionals” and that the director general “seems fine.”  “But the fact is that I have heard for years that that is very much biased towards China, so I don't know,” he said, then turned to his infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci.  “Fauci, you want me to get you into this political mess?” he quipped. After Fauci stepped to the lectern to defend Adhanom Ghebreyesus personally, Trump again touted his decision to bar foreigners traveling to the U.S. from China, a move he has repeatedly pointed to as proof he took the virus seriously early on.  The president applauded the decision from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to delay the summer Olympics, which were set to begin in Tokyo in July, until 2021 because of the crisis, saying he told Abe in a phone call on Tuesday night that the move was “a wise choice.”  “I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics — it was the absolute right decision to delay it for a full year,” Trump told reporters, despite his suggestions that the pandemic has turned a corner.  Now Tokyo will “have a full, beautiful Olympics,” he added, noting the rarity of the games being held in an odd year (the Olympics have only ever been canceled, never postponed). ”It’s always on an even year, they tell me. But he's going to have a fantastic success, and now he will have even more time. He didn't need any more time. Everything was perfectly ready. What a job they've done.”","Trump spars with reporter at coronavirus briefing, but plays nice with other rivals ",2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-briefing-149491,politico
"WASHINGTON — Foreign ministers from the Group of 7 leading industrialized democracies sparred Wednesday over whether to call out China as the source of the coronavirus pandemic. Meeting by video conference because of the outbreak, the ministers agreed on the need for joint efforts to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus, which causes a disease being called COVID-19. But U.S. and European diplomats said the ministers were unable to agree on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s call for the virus to be identified by name as the “Wuhan virus.” As a result, just a day after G-7 finance ministers and central bankers issued a joint communique referring to the COVID-19 virus, the foreign ministers opted against releasing a group statement. U.S, officials pointed to Tuesday’s finance ministers’ statement to reject suggestions of G-7 disunity and said the foreign ministers had never intended to release their own communique. European officials said Pompeo had insisted on identifying the COVID-19 virus as the “Wuhan virus” even though the World Health Organization and others have cautioned against giving it a geographic name because of its global nature. In recent weeks, Pompeo has stepped up his use of “Wuhan virus,” accusing China of putting the world at risk by not revealing more details about the outbreak, which was first reported in the city of Wuhan. President Donald Trump had until very recently frequently referred to the novel coronavirus as the “China virus” or the “Chinese virus,” but since the beginning of this week has steered away from those terms as critics have said they foster discriminatory sentiments and behavior against Asians and Asian Americans. In a solo news conference after the meeting, Pompeo again referred to the “Wuhan virus,” saying it was “the most pressing agenda item.” He said all the foreign ministers had “committed to fighting (it) with transparency, as is necessary all around the world.” He did not deny there had been disagreements over what to call the virus, but said all the ministers had acknowledged that China had not been forthcoming about its details early on and was now trying to shift the narrative about it. “Every one of the nations that was at that meeting this morning was deeply aware of the disinformation campaign that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in to try and deflect from what has really taken place here,” Pompeo said. Other foreign ministers were not nearly as emphatic in their own comments about the meeting, with at least one leaving open the suggestion that China is not the only country trying to use the outbreak to advance political points. French Foreign Minister Yves Le Drian said in a statement that he had “underscored the need to combat any attempt to exploit the crisis for political purposes and expressed the view that the unity of all in order to effectively combat the pandemic must now take precedence over any other considerations.” The disagreement over the virus terminology was first reported by the German publication Der Spiegel. German officials said they were more concerned about what would come from a virtual summit of the Group of 20 nations leaders that is supposed to be held on Thursday at the request of Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials meanwhile downplayed the disagreement among the foreign ministers and pointed to the G-7 finance ministers’ statement from Tuesday that did not mention either “Wuhan” or “China” in relation to the virus and instead referred to it repeatedly as the COVID-19 virus.","Pompeo, G-7 foreign ministers spar over ‘Wuhan virus’",2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/mike-pompeo-g7-coronavirus-149425,politico
"The Trump administration, state officials and even individual hospital workers are now racing against each other to get the necessary masks, gloves and other safety equipment to fight coronavirus — a scramble that hospitals and doctors say has come too late and left them at risk. But according to a previously unrevealed White House playbook, the government should’ve begun a federal-wide effort to procure that personal protective equipment at least two months ago. “Is there sufficient personal protective equipment for healthcare workers who are providing medical care?” the playbook instructs its readers, as one early decision that officials should address when facing a potential pandemic. “If YES: What are the triggers to signal exhaustion of supplies? Are additional supplies available? If NO: Should the Strategic National Stockpile release PPE to states?” The strategies are among hundreds of tactics and key policy decisions laid out in a 69-page National Security Council playbook on fighting pandemics, which POLITICO is detailing for the first time. Other recommendations include that the government move swiftly to fully detect potential outbreaks, secure supplemental funding and consider invoking the Defense Production Act — all steps in which the Trump administration lagged behind the timeline laid out in the playbook. “Each section of this playbook includes specific questions that should be asked and decisions that should be made at multiple levels” within the national security apparatus, the playbook urges, repeatedly advising officials to question the numbers on viral spread, ensure appropriate diagnostic capacity and check on the U.S. stockpile of emergency resources. The playbook also stresses the significant responsibility facing the White House to contain risks of potential pandemics, a stark contrast with the Trump administration’s delays in deploying an all-of-government response and President Donald Trump's recent signals that he might roll back public health recommendations. “The U.S. government will use all powers at its disposal to prevent, slow or mitigate the spread of an emerging infectious disease threat,” according to the playbook’s built-in “assumptions” about fighting future threats. “The American public will look to the U.S. government for action when multi-state or other significant events occur.” The guide further calls for a “unified message” on the federal response, in order to best manage the American public's questions and concerns. “Early coordination of risk communications through a single federal spokesperson is critical,” the playbook urges. However, the U.S. response to coronavirus has featured a rotating cast of spokespeople and conflicting messages; Trump already is discussing loosening government recommendations on coronavirus in order to “open” the economy by Easter, despite the objections of public health advisers. The NSC devised the guide — officially called the Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents, but known colloquially as “the pandemic playbook” — across 2016. The project was driven by career civil servants as well as political appointees, aware that global leaders had initially fumbled their response to the 2014-2015 spread of Ebola and wanting to be sure that the next response to an epidemic was better handled.  The Trump administration was briefed on the playbook’s existence in 2017, said four former officials, but two cautioned that it never went through a full, National Security Council-led interagency process to be approved as Trump administration strategy. Tom Bossert, who was then Trump’s homeland security adviser, expressed enthusiasm about its potential as part of the administration’s broader strategy to fight pandemics, two former officials said.  Bossert declined to comment on any particular document, but told POLITICO that “I engaged actively with my outgoing counterpart and took seriously their transition materials and recommendations on pandemic preparedness.” The playbook was designed “so there wasn’t piecemeal thinking when trying to fight the next public health battle,” said one former official who contributed to the playbook, warning that “the fog of war” can lead to gaps in strategies. “These are recommended discussions to be having on all levels, to ensure that there’s a structure to make decisions in real-time,” said a second former official.  An NSC official confirmed the existence of the playbook but dismissed its value. “We are aware of the document, although it’s quite dated and has been superseded by strategic and operational biodefense policies published since,” the official said. “The plan we are executing now is a better fit, more detailed, and applies the relevant lessons learned from the playbook and the most recent Ebola epidemic in the [Democratic Republic of the Congo] to COVID-19.” A health department spokesperson also said that the NSC playbook was not part of the current coronavirus strategy. “The HHS COVID-19 response was informed by more recent plans such as the foundation of the National Biodefense Strategy (2018), Biological Incident Annex (2017),and panCAP (2018) among other key plans provided by the CDC, White House Task Force, FEMA, and other key federal departments and agencies,” the spokesperson said. Trump has claimed that his administration could not have foreseen the coronavirus pandemic, which has spread to all 50 states and more than 180 nations, sickening more than 460,000 people around the world. “Nobody ever expected a thing like this,” Trump said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.  But Trump’s aides were told to expect a potential pandemic, ranging from a tabletop exercise that the outgoing Obama administration prepared for the president’s incoming aides to a “Crimson Contagion” scenario that health officials undertook just last year and modeled out potential risks of a global infectious disease threat. Trump’s deputies also have said that their coronavirus response relies on a federal playbook, specifically referring to a strategy laid out by the Centers for Disease Control.  It is not clear if the administration’s failure to follow the NSC playbook was the result of an oversight or a deliberate decision to follow a different course. The document rested with NSC officials who dealt with medical preparedness and biodefense in the global health security directorate, which the Trump administration disbanded in 2018, four former officials said. The document was originally overseen by Beth Cameron, a former civil servant who led the directorate before leaving the White House in March 2017. Cameron confirmed to POLITICO that the directorate created a playbook for NSC staff intended to help officials confront a range of potential biological threats. But under the Trump administration, “it just sat as a document that people worked on that was thrown onto a shelf,” said one former U.S. official, who served in both the Obama and Trump administrations. “It’s hard to tell how much senior leaders at agencies were even aware that this existed” or thought it was just another layer of unnecessary bureaucracy.  The NSC playbook would have been especially useful in helping to drive the administration’s response to coronavirus, given that it was intended to guide urgent decisions and coordinate the all-of-government approach that Trump so far has struggled to muster, said people familiar with the document. The color-coded playbook contains different sections based on the relative risk — green for normal operations, yellow for elevated threat, orange for credible threat and red once a public health emergency is declared — and details the potential roles of dozens of departments and agencies, from key players like the Health and Human Services department to the Department of Transportation and the FBI. It also includes sample documents intended to be used at coordinating meetings. “While each emerging infectious disease threat will present itself in a unique way, a consistent, capabilities-based approach to addressing these threats will allow for faster decisions with more targeted expert subject matter input from federal departments and agencies,” the playbook reads. The playbook lays out different strategies for policymakers based on the severity of the crisis and shares lessons gleaned from past outbreaks. For instance, one section is devoted to addressing 34 “key questions” and 21 “key decisions” as soon as there is a “credible threat” — which in the case of coronavirus would have been early-to-mid January, as it raged in China and as the first U.S. case was detected on Jan. 20 — and calls on officials to move quickly. “We recommend early budget and financial analysis of various response scenarios and an early decision to request supplemental funding from Congress, if needed,” the guide urges. But the Trump administration waited more than a month to ask for emergency funding after the timeline laid out in the playbook. The playbook also repeatedly urges officials to question official numbers about the viral spread. “What is our level of confidence on the case detection rate?” reads one question. “Is diagnostic capacity keeping up?” But across January and much of February, Trump administration officials publicly insisted that their diagnostic efforts were sufficient to detect coronavirus. Officials now privately concede that the administration’s well-documented testing problems have contributed to the outbreak’s silent spread across the United States, and health experts say that diagnostic capacity is only now in late March catching up to the need. In a subsequent section, the playbook details steps to take if there’s evidence that the virus is spreading among humans, which the World Health Organization concluded by Jan. 22, or the U.S. government declared a public health emergency, which HHS Secretary Alex Azar did on Jan. 31.  Under that timeline, the federal government by late January should have been taking a lead role in “coordination of workforce protection activities including… [personal protective equipment] determination, procurement and deployment.” Those efforts are only now getting underway, health workers and doctors say.", Trump team failed to follow NSC’s pandemic playbook,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-national-security-council-149285,politico
"MIAMI — Joe Biden lauded seven governors — drawn from both parties — by name on Monday, praising their leadership during the coronavirus crisis. On Wednesday, he singled out one for sharp criticism: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.  In doing so, Biden managed to highlight both the crucial role Florida plays in the presidential race, and the equally critical role it occupies in the national debate over responding to the coronavirus crisis. After images of drunken spring-breakers partying amid a contagion were broadcast nationally, DeSantis — a protégé of President Donald Trump — was thrust into the vanguard of Republican governors balking at issuing a broad shelter-in-place order to limit the spread of the virus. As the state’s coronavirus caseload has increased, so has the criticism of DeSantis, making him an inevitable target for Biden in a state Trump must carry in order to win the White House. “Floridians deserve science-based action from Governor Ron DeSantis,” Biden said in a written statement that faulted the “absence of leadership from President Trump.” “While other large states continue to take strong, urgent, and sweeping action to stop the spread of COVID-19, Florida has not. I urge Governor DeSantis to let the experts speak to the public and explain why this is the case,” Biden said. “In this moment of growing uncertainty and anxiety, Floridians want — and deserve — to hear from the public health officials leading the charge.” Republicans called Biden’s statement a desperate political move to damage the president by attacking DeSantis, a top ally whose successful 2018 primary campaign revolved around fealty to Trump.  Trump has since changed his residency to Florida, made sure to focus his attention deeply on the state and, on Wednesday, approved a disaster declaration to let federal aid flow more easily to the state. Florida, which has the highest percentage of 65 and older population in the nation, has been slow to test for coronavirus. But as testing has ramped up, so have reported caseloads, which surged 35 percent in a day’s time to 1,977. The president’s national poll numbers have improved since he began holding regular White House news briefings, where he occasionally praises DeSantis. At the same time, Trump has occupied the spotlight, Biden has been stuck at home, maintaining social distance as he slowly ramps up ‘virtual’ public appearances from a newly installed home studio in Wilmington, Del. “The Gallup Poll today had President Trump at a 60 percent approval for how he’s handling the crisis and the governor’s polling was pretty close last week on how he’s handling it,” said Evan Power, chairman of the council of county chairs for the Republican Party of Florida. “So it’s not a great move to criticize DeSantis or the president over this,” Power said. “It’s a cry for relevancy.” After the March 10 round of primaries, Biden has struggled to capture the media spotlight as national TV news turn its near-complete attention to coronavirus and away from the 2020 campaign trail. Over the period beginning March 11 through Wednesday, Trump has gotten 440,785 television mentions nationally compared to roughly 83,000 for Biden, according to TV Eyes, a program that tracks mentions. Biden also received a fraction of the attention Trump got on March 17, the day the former vice president won a key bloc of primary states — including Florida — and essentially ended his primary contest with Bernie Sanders. In a typical election year, that performance would have given any presidential candidate a big shot of momentum and national airtime.  That day, Biden’s name was mentioned 5,417 times nationally, compared to Trump’s 16,488. In a sign of Biden’s muted microphone, DeSantis wasn’t asked at either of his two news conferences Wednesday about the former vice president’s criticism. DeSantis went on to praise Trump for doing a “great job” but he chafed at the number of New Yorkers who are able to fly to Florida, potentially bringing the coronavirus, which would defeat some shelter-in-place containment strategies. “The policies are ineffective because you have flights,” DeSantis said. Echoing Trump, DeSantis reiterated that his cure-can’t-be-worse-than-the-disease approach accounts for the potential economic and social devastation from government-mandated social distancing. “You’re going to see not only economic consequences from that, you are going to see a lot of public health consequences from that,” he continued. “I’m worried about the mental health impact of what’s happened. I’m worried about drug abuse, based on some of the dislocations. I’m worried about suicides. I’m worried about domestic violence. And I’m worried about child abuse. In any situation like that, all this stuff goes up. This is one of maybe the most significant situations people have faced.” Biden advisers and Democrats say they expect the policies of DeSantis and Trump will ultimately lead to both a public health disaster and a bad economy for Trump, who was planning on running for reelection on his economic record. In 2016, Trump won Florida by 1.2 percentage points. Florida’s large senior population lives off investments, making coronavirus a twin threat because it kills the elderly and social distancing is damaging the stock market. “In a 1-percent state where the sitting GOP governor has been seen as slow to respond, it can make a difference,” said Greg Goddard, a Democratic consultant from the state who served as former presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar’s Southeast finance director. The Trump campaign’s Florida spokeswoman, Emma Vaughn, accused Democrats of “politicizing a national emergency ... Now is not the time for partisan politics — we are Floridians first.” Biden advisers say he’s focusing on Florida because it’s the poster child for dangerous policy rooted in political calculus, not public health. They point to editorials criticizing DeSantis, stories detailing the state’s relatively slow response and an infamous interview with drunk spring breakers expressing no worries in Miami Beach about getting coronavirus in a state with a sizable elderly population. Biden’s criticisms of DeSantis and Trump came on the heels of a new national TV ad from a pro-Biden super PAC, Unite The Country, highlighting Trump’s statements downplaying the threat of the virus earlier this month. It was followed by House Democrats from the state who sent a letter to DeSantis urging him to issue a statewide shelter-in-place order. One of the congressmen who signed the letter, Rep. Ted Deutch, said DeSantis needs to use his close relationship with the president to get more equipment and help for Florida. “The governor has a chance to use that relationship he has with the president of the United States,” Deutch said. “So, yeah. Florida’s a really important state. But if Vice President Biden is pointing out what the governor is doing wrong, it’s a fair point to raise.” Gary Fineout contributed to this report.",Biden blindsides Trump’s Florida ally ,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/biden-trump-florida-rally-149262,politico

"The biggest economic stimulus in American history is hurtling toward passage, but Washington’s colossal intervention to save the economy still chooses winners and losers among businesses and American workers. The measure includes expanded worker protections Democrats demanded along with the $500 billion rescue fund Republicans pushed for to help beleaguered U.S. industries. Many Americans will get checks of $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for married couples. The hospital industry is getting what it asked for — $100 billion in rescue funds. But the oil industry is getting nothing — and neither are the Postal Service and cruise companies. This gargantuan bill won’t make it to President Donald Trump’s desk without some last minute political angst: Sen. Bernie Sanders is threatening the bill because it doesn’t have enough restrictions on the business bailout and Republicans think the unemployment aid is too generous. Here’s a look at who’s getting what, and why that matters: What they got: People who are unemployed would get an extra $600 per week for up to four months, on top of state unemployment benefits to make up for 100 percent of lost wages. The final agreement provides an extra month of unemployment benefits than what Senate Republicans had originally sought. Why it matters: A group of GOP senators threatened Wednesday to block a fast-tracked vote on the measure, arguing that some workers would actually get a raise over their actual pay. ""We have incentivized people not to go back to work,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said. Unemployment claims are also climbing by the tens of thousands every day in states across the country, and congressional negotiators acknowledge that benefits may need yet another boost through additional relief packages. What they got: The Treasury Department would divvy up a $500 billion pot of loans to struggling industries like airlines, and even cities and states. Why it matters: Rules added to the bill will order an inspector general and accountability committee to oversee how the money is spent, rather than giving Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin broad power to cut the loan checks. Veterans of the 2008 bank bailout say, however, that the effectiveness of that oversight will only be as strong as the chosen watchdogs and how much power they really have. What they got: All U.S. residents with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 ($150,000 for married couples) would get a $1,200 ($2,400 for couples) “rebate” payment. They are also eligible for an additional $500 per child. The payments would start phasing out for earners above those income thresholds and would not go to single filers earning more than $99,000; head-of-household filers with one child, more than $146,500; and more than $198,000 for joint filers with no children. Why it matters: People who don’t pay taxes, such as those with very low incomes, may be hard to reach the way the program is designed. What they got: Health care providers would secure $100 billion in grants to help fight the coronavirus and make up for dollars they have lost by delaying elective surgeries and other procedures to focus on the outbreak. They would also get a 20 percent bump in Medicare payments for treating patients with the virus. Why it matters: This figure is exactly what three powerful groups representing physicians, hospitals and nurses had demanded, though for-profit hospitals were lobbying for much more. But there are still questions about whether there will be significant guardrails on how the money will be split up. The coronavirus will hit rural hospitals especially hard, since they already operate on thin margins and have limited staffing capacity. So some lawmakers have been working to ensure enough money goes to those sites. What they got: Airlines would receive $29 billion in grants, and $29 billion in loans and loan guarantees, as well as a reprieve from paying three of their major excise taxes on the price of a ticket, the fuel tax and a cargo tax. That funding comes with strings, though — no stock buybacks, and limits on executive compensation, to start. Half the funds would go toward “the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries, and benefits” while the other half would go to loans and loan guarantees for passenger airlines, repair stations and ticket agents — subject to conditions. Why it matters: This is the amount that the industry sought. The bill doesn’t include some conditions that Democrats wanted, like commitments to cutting emissions. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA cheered the bill, saying the grants in particular would “save hundreds of thousands of jobs.” What they got: Businesses would get a tax credit for keeping idled workers on their payrolls during the coronavirus pandemic, so long as the businesses meet certain criteria. They would get a refund for half of what they spend on wages, up to $5,000 per worker. Why it matters: To qualify, businesses have to prove they took a 50 percent loss compared to the same quarter in years past. And to keep companies from double-dipping on aid under the bill, employers won’t be able to get special SBA loans if they opt for the tax credit. What they got: The agreement would provide $150 billion for state and local governments, with $8 billion set aside for local governments, which are bleeding tax revenue as only essential businesses remain open and unemployment claims climb by the tens of thousands every day. Why it matters: Congressional negotiators are already talking about a fourth legislative relief package that could include more money for state and local governments. Governors warned this week that their states are running out of funding to fulfill the skyrocketing number of unemployment claims, and could face multibillion-dollar budget shortfalls in the weeks and months to come. The funding the stimulus provides is only a “drop in the bucket” compared to the need, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. What they got: The Defense Department would field an infusion of $10.5 billion, including $1.5 billion for the National Guard to deploy up to 20,000 on-call soldiers to help state response teams fight the coronavirus over the next six months. The bill would also spend $415 million on research and development work at the Pentagon, aimed at developing vaccines and antiviral medicine. Why it matters: The bipartisan rescue package gives the DoD well above the $8.3 billion the Trump administration requested and what House Democrats wanted. What they got: Insurers wanted an emergency fund to offset big losses stemming from the pandemic, as well as premium subsidies to help fund temporary ""COBRA"" coverage for laid-off workers. They got none of that, although the legislation aims to protect them from price-gouging on coronavirus tests. Why it matters: Officials in the health care industry don't really know how much money plans will lose during the crisis. While insurers are probably saving money from mass cancelations of expensive elective procedures, they are still bracing for unprecedented numbers of hospitalizations. Insurers also already got a $16 billion gift when Congress repealed Obamacare’s health insurance fee in December. What they got: They would get to defer the 6.2 percent tax they pay on wages that is used to fund Social Security. Why it matters: The deferred tax would have to be paid over the following two years: half by Dec. 31, 2021, and the other half by Dec. 31, 2022. What they got: The bill does not include the $3 billion Trump sought to fulfill his promise this month of filling the country's oil stockpile ""right up to the top"" as a way to aid U.S. drillers amid a price decline. Democrats also failed to clinch language extending tax breaks for renewable energy industries. Why it matters: This fight isn’t over. Congress has made plenty of deals in the past that combine something for clean energy companies with something for the oil industry — most recently in 2015 when lawmakers agreed to end a ban on oil exports and extend several tax breaks for renewable energy. What they got: The Trump administration would get $200 million for boosting Skype-style health checkups by investing in services and devices that help health care providers connect remotely with patients. Why it matters: The FCC helps run a rural health care program devoted to subsidizing the connectivity for health care providers, which gives it some stake in telehealth. The total jives with what FCC Chairman Ajit Pai requested earlier this month. This represents just the FCC's stake in telemedicine, not other parts of the government. What they got: The deal is likely to omit funding that both lawmakers and the Trump administration sought to close the ""homework gap,"" the term used for the difference between families with internet connections and equipment and those without. Democrats had wanted at least $2 billion to go directly to an FCC subsidy program that helps schools and libraries connect to the internet, while FCC Chairman Ajit Pai requested $50 million for a pilot program geared specifically toward helping schools. Why it matters: Millions of students are now stuck at home during the pandemic without a way to continue their studies online. Advocates will continue pushing for assistance. What they got: The deal does not appear to include any direct funding for the ailing cruise ship industry, which has been devastated by the pandemic. Why it matters: Trump has called the cruise industry a “prime candidate” for federal assistance and a “great and important industry,” so look for further efforts from the administration to support the struggling sector. What they got: Retailers, restaurateurs and hotels will be able to immediately deduct from their taxes what they spend on property improvements. They were supposed to get the write-off in the 2017 tax overhaul, but a glitch actually made them worse off. Why it matters: While the fix will help by letting businesses file amended refunds from prior years, it isn’t enough on its own to dig out those industries, which are among the hardest hit by mandatory shutdowns and social distancing directives. What they got: The already-underwater U.S. Postal Service won’t receive any assistance under the measure, despite House Democrats proposing $25 billion to keep the federal carrier going amid the pandemic, plus language to wipe out its $11 billion debt. Why it matters: Democrats have warned that fallout from the virus could decimate the U.S. Postal Service by June, absent action from Congress. The independent agency will likely need some financial relief in future legislative packages to stay afloat. What they got: The stimulus includes nearly $25 billion for food assistance, including nearly $16 billion for SNAP and nearly $9 billion for child nutrition. Why it matters: Senate Democrats were unable to secure a 15 percent increase to households' SNAP benefits. Congressional leaders acknowledge that they may need to provide additional rounds of food assistance in future legislative relief packages. What they got: Nearly $24 billion, including $14 billion for an obscure Depression-era financial institution that USDA has wide discretion to use to stabilize the farm economy. Another $9.5 billion would be set aside for emergency aid for the agriculture sector, including cattle ranchers and fresh fruit and vegetable growers. Why it matters: More aid might be on the way. Republican senators from major cattle producing states, like Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), initially sought to replenish the Depression-era program with $20 billion, as well as increase USDA's borrowing authority from the institution to $50 billion. What they got: The final package provides more than $30 billion in emergency education funding for colleges and universities, states and school districts. Why it matters: House Democrats initially called for double that amount and certain education groups have asked for significantly more help, urging the government to contribute far more toward special education costs, for example. What they got: Distilleries received a temporary exemption from an excise tax for alcohol they use to make hand sanitizer that’s produced and distributed within Food and Drug Administration guidelines. Why it matters: While Americans are drinking more at home with their local watering holes closed, the liquor supply may come up short.

"Since his staff announced last week that he is reassessing his campaign, Bernie Sanders has not yet definitively said whether he is still running. But he’s given every indication he’s pressing forward — and perhaps remaining in the presidential race for months to come. Despite Joe Biden’s nearly insurmountable delegate lead, the Sanders campaign said he plans to participate in an April debate, if one happens. His team has held volunteer organizing calls in the past week in New York and Pennsylvania, which are planning to hold their primaries perhaps as late as June. And his campaign is also touting that it is ramping up staff in New York, which a senior aide said is “a sign that he is still in.” Sanders, who hasn’t aired ads or fundraised since losing badly in the March 17 primaries, could still very well call things off. But one thing is certain: He’s not acting like a candidate who’s finished with the primary. “Bernie has every reason to stay in,” said James Zogby, a Democratic National Committee member who has spoken with Sanders in recent weeks and urged him to continue running. “He has a role to play in policies of course, but also continuing to be the glue that holds the progressive movement together.”  Sanders has returned to doing cable TV interviews for the first time since March 17, when he lost in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, and his campaign continues to engage in the delegate selection process in the states.  In the past week-and-a-half, Sanders has also put together six virtual events focused on the coronavirus that have received millions of views, according to his team, including town halls and rallies featuring members of the so-called “Squad” and musical acts. On “All In with Chris Hayes” Monday, Sanders said that “what we are doing is transitioning our campaign to a virtual campaign.” Some of Sanders’ aides and allies argue he could win despite the long odds, and that he has a position to fill in pushing for progressive policy, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. The moves — and that line of thinking — are infuriating to some establishment Democrats and Biden allies, who fear a repeat of 2016, when Sanders declined to drop out after it was mathematically impossible for him to win. Many party leaders believe the delay further fractured the already divided Democrats and made it more difficult for Hillary Clinton to take on Donald Trump. “It’s time to move on,” said Harold Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which endorsed Biden a year ago. “It’s time to coalesce and put all of our various groups and parts of our movement and society together and get ready for what’s going to be a hell of a battle in the general election,” he said. Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the New York Democratic Party, said he is “not meaning to push anybody out of running.” However, he said, “There’s no logical reason to extend this, because there is no viable path for anyone other than Joe Biden to get the nomination.” Biden himself also appears eager for Sanders to go away. Asked at a press briefing Wednesday if he would debate Sanders in April, Biden said he was focused on the coronavirus crisis.  “I think we’ve had enough debates,” Biden said. “I think we should get on with this.” Meanwhile, multiple allies of Sanders have encouraged him to remain in the race. But they have urged him privately to articulate his reasons for staying in, rather than to pivot entirely to the coronavirus — his current approach — a source familiar with the conversations said. The primary calendar, suddenly blown up by the coronavirus crisis, offers some incentive to continue on. Even if Sanders has little chance of catching Biden in the delegate count absent a dramatic change in voter opinion, the postponement of numerous primaries could mathematically keep him afloat for months. Biden cannot amass the delegates he needs to secure the Democratic nomination before June 2, which now includes so many rescheduled primaries that it’s beginning to rival Super Tuesday in size. “I don’t think it’s over. Lord knows what happens over the summer,” said Zogby. “The Biden campaign can implode. I don’t know. I’m not wishing anything, but it’s not over till it’s over.” Ohio, Connecticut, Indiana, Maryland, Delaware and Rhode Island have all pushed back their primaries to June 2, and Pennsylvania is on track to do the same. Kentucky has put its primary off until June 23. New York, which has more delegates at stake than any of those states, is currently scheduled to vote on April 28. But election officials there have begun pressuring Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state legislature to move it back — likely to June 23, when New York holds its congressional and state primaries. Sanders’ team has long seen New York not only as a state that he could potentially win, but also a place that is important to his narrative arc. He was born in Brooklyn, and kicked off his 2020 campaign at an event in his native borough. Four years ago, Sanders’ advisers also viewed New York as a place where Sanders could deliver a race-altering upset, entering the state on a hot streak before Hillary Clinton’s decisive victory there. But this year, said Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Sanders during his 2016 campaign, “My honest view is I think he’s way too far behind in terms of delegates to catch up. ... We were never this far behind in 2016.” In the eyes of some of his aides and allies, though, the coronavirus and economic downturn are additional reasons Sanders should stay in the race. His campaign has fully immersed itself in the issue in recent days.  In addition to his livestreams, Sanders’ team has used his giant email list to raise more than $3.5 million for coronavirus relief, and texted people to ask them to call their senators to voice support for his plan tackling the pandemic. Sanders’ organizing app has also urged users to check in on their friends during the crisis. “This is really about life and death,” said Nina Turner, Sanders’ campaign co-chair, of the coronavirus. “The senator is the only candidate in this race that has that capacity that he’s not just a candidate running for president, but he is a sitting United States senator who has an ability to weigh in on policy.” On Wednesday, Sanders wielded that power, announcing that he was prepared to hold up the Senate’s coronavirus stimulus package if a group of Republican lawmakers did not back off their objections to expanding unemployment insurance. Many on the left also believe that the pandemic has demonstrated the need to transform the nation’s health care industry and economic system.  “There seems to be a bipartisan consensus that the government should play a much more active role in the economy,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ senior adviser.",‘He is still in’: Bernie could remain in race through June,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/bernie-could-remain-2020-race-june-149215,politico
"What William McKinley was to the front porch campaign, Joe Biden is to the basement campaign. Sidelined and confined to his house by the dictates of coronavirus social distancing, the former vice president has been limited to intermittent appearances from a makeshift studio in his basement. They have been awkward and low energy, but that doesn’t really set them apart from most other Biden appearances. If there’s any candidate who could thrive by having very limited public exposure and existing mostly as a line on a ballot, it’s the longtime presidential aspirant who hadn’t won a primary until a couple of weeks ago. Biden is winning the Democratic nomination on the basis of not being Bernie Sanders and wants to get elected president on the basis of not being Donald Trump. He’s as purely a negative candidate as we’ve seen in a very long time, running largely on who he isn’t and what he won’t do. He’s the presidential candidate as cipher. Prior to his recent media mini-tour, did anyone seriously miss Biden? Wonder what he had to say? Expect him to come up with a bold, captivating coronavirus plan, or an arresting formulation? There is no Biden movement. For much of the primary campaign, he couldn’t build a crowd to save his life. He had no organization or money. There is no Biden charisma. He’s not young, handsome, eloquent, or interesting. There is no Biden catchphrase. He doesn’t have “hope and change,” or “make America great again.” For decades, he’s stayed reliably within the mainstream of the Democratic Party at any given time — hence, his recent turn further left — and his views have largely reflected center-left conventional wisdom. If the party had decided to order up a generic representative, with nothing original to say and a campaign utterly untouched by new thinking or methods, it couldn’t have done any better than Biden. He’s led on everything across the past four decades, at least according to his own account, and yet has done nothing particularly memorable. He’s the opposite of a fresh face on the scene without an extensive record to defend — think George W. Bush or Barack Obama. But he’s proving that a very old slate can be almost as invulnerable to attack as a blank slate. The length of his career means that most of his past controversial positions lost their political salience long ago. They are such artifacts of another era that they can’t be used against him any more. Kamala Harris learned this when she executed an exquisitely planned ambush on Biden on the issue of busing, which was an intense controversy … 40 years ago. President Donald Trump will want to hit Biden on the crime bill, which passed more than a quarter of a century ago, and his vote for the second Iraq War, Biden’s most contemporary legislative vulnerability since he took the vote less than two decades ago. Biden’s candidacy holds interest only to the extent he is gaffe prone. His misfires aren’t Hillary Clinton-style gaffes, laced with arrogance and an insulting dismissiveness that makes them a rallying cry for the other side — her question at a contentious Benghazi hearing, “What difference at this point does it make?”; her labeling of some Trump supporters as “deplorables.” Instead, Biden’s gaffes — the verbal tangles, incomplete sentences, weird mixups — are amusing and concerning. They will be used to make the case that he isn’t up to the job, but they don’t make anyone hate Biden. He can’t even generate strong feelings in his partisan opposition. All that said, Biden deserves credit for his insight from the beginning that the Democratic Party wasn’t defined by woke Twitter and that Obama-Biden Democrats, as he calls them, still constituted the party’s center of gravity. He correctly believed — or hoped — that African American voters would see him through. On top of this, he demonstrated the remarkable perseverance of a politician knocked down and humiliated, who got up every day and kept going. His greatest strength is obviously his ability to connect with others who have suffered personal loss. His victories on Super Tuesday and afterward showed that Democrats were willing to turn out en masse for an uninspired candidacy, and it may be that the same dynamic will hold in November. If so, Biden could do worse than stay in his basement for the duration.","Joe Biden, the Cipher Presidential Candidate",2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/25/joe-biden-cipher-presidential-candidate-149216,politico
"As the coronavirus spread and countries began closing their borders, Americans stranded abroad found U.S. embassies AWOL and began plotting their own escapes — some planned for having to bribe border guards, others paid a private security firm to fly them home — and thousands are still stuck, with no clear way to get home. The State Department didn’t ramp up fast enough to bring Americans stranded by the expanding coronavirus pandemic and its resulting travel bans and communicated poorly once it did, say lawmakers and former State officials — leaving thousands of Americans still stranded overseas to essentially fend for themselves. State has, in recent days, repatriated thousands of U.S. citizens, but it is still struggling to bring Americans home, and some have turned to alternatives like risky border crossings from Guatemala into Mexico — including bringing along enough money to potentially pay off customs officials — and chartering a jet flown by a private security firm staffed by former military and intelligence officers. ""If this administration, including Secretary Pompeo and his senior leadership team, had taken the coronavirus threat seriously and planned ahead, we may have been able to avoid some of the confusion and chaos Americans abroad encountered,"" said Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Unfortunately, that simply did not happen. As a result, the State Department now has to try to catch up and make up for lost time."" Two former State Department officials who worked at the agency under both Republican and Democratic administrations agreed that the department’s leadership reacted too slowly to the developing crisis. “I didn’t see the State Department move out sharply on this,” said one of the former officials. “There was a slowness off the mark.” An evacuation of this nature could be ordered by a number of officials, from the secretary down the ranks, and “It just seemed to me that somehow the order to move was not given” in a timely manner, the person said. In a statement, a State Department spokesperson said that the department is ""rising to meet the historic challenge"" the pandemic poses, and noted that the government has ""no higher duty than to protect American citizens."" The agency says it has repatriated more than 9,000 Americans from 28 countries, with ""thousands more in the coming days and weeks."" The spokesperson said State evacuated 800 people in January and February from Wuhan, China and brought home 1,000 Americans from Morocco in March. But several people stranded in various countries over the past two weeks told POLITICO a different story, saying U.S. embassies were unable to provide them anything beyond basic information for days at a time, and in some cases never responded beyond automated form emails. Melissa Uribe, who is pregnant and was stranded in Guatemala while in need of medical attention, made it home to California late Tuesday after a harrowing week trying to get out. She said the agency's initial response to her and others trapped there was: ""Don't rely on the U.S. government for help."" ""My mind was blown,” Uribe told POLITICO in an email. “A family member who took us to the airport told us he was so shocked at what we were going through. He, and so many Guatemalans, couldn't believe it because they always held the U.S. in such high regard, as they always seemed to take care of their own.” After Uribe and her family booked a commercial flight on Eastern Airlines, they heard from the State Department, saying they had been selected for a charter flight, but “after so much misinformation from the embassy, we didn't trust them.” Some of the agency's perceived failures can also be seen as the inevitable result of an unprecedented crisis which has stretched the agency’s resources globally and challenged virtually every aspect of society. “Part of the way that you know that you’re in a crisis is because it’s chaotic,” said another former State official. “If everything was working smoothly, that would just be a very busy day of normal.” For example, the former official said, embassies not answering phones or returning messages, which many stranded Americans reported as a typical result in countries where borders were closed, is to be expected during of a crisis of this scale. The former official said that when an earthquake hit Haiti in 2010, the embassy there was besieged by phone calls, thousands in the first hour. “That’s absolutely inevitable. There’s no way that a normal operation can answer that,” the official said — and answering individual phone calls would not necessarily be the best use of the staff’s time in that moment, regardless. But at least one other aspect of State’s response was more surprising to those who have been in those jobs before. An American Airlines plane earlier this week flew to Peru en route to pick up U.S. citizens stranded in Lima, but had to turn around after State was unable to secure permission to land from the Peruvian government. According to an email from congressional staff to Americans stuck in Peru, negotiations — which apparently failed — were ongoing while the plane was aloft. “I would say it’s probably unbelievably rare that a plane would be on its way without clearance,” the former official said. Sen. Marco Rubio, who tweeted in frustration on Tuesday about a “lack of urgency” by State to get Americans stuck in Peru, blamed “some in mid-level.” “We didn’t need you to 'track' this, we needed you to solve this,” he said. A spokesperson for Rubio said specifically that the “individual manning the Peru desk has been 'tracking' this issue for a week, but doing nothing and the Ambassador essentially abandoned the post to return to Washington.” After Rubio expressed his frustration with State, the agency sent Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Julie Chung to Peru. A State Department spokesperson confirmed that Ambassador Krishna Urs left Peru on March 20 and is “continuing to engage from Washington with senior Peruvian officials.” The former officials who spoke to POLITICO said they believe career staff are working to the best of their abilities. “I personally cannot believe that the professionals in the department didn’t know exactly what to do and reported this up the chain,” said one of the former officials. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo himself triggered frustration and sharp criticism from Democrats when he posted a picture over the weekend of him and his wife working on a puzzle and watching television as thousands of Americans remained stranded. “I have constituents stuck overseas can you get off your ass and get them home?” tweeted Arizona Democrat Rep. Ruben Gallego in response. Lawmakers, particularly Democrats, have repeatedly slammed State for not acting fast enough to get stranded citizens home as their offices are flooded with constituent pleas for help. Rep. Bill Keating, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the State Department staff that his office has talked to have been working hard. “The individuals that we’ve been dealing with are just working around the clock, doing more to try to get people home,” Keating said. “Those individuals deserve enormous credit. They’re in difficult situations and understaffed.” There are upwards of 20 constituents from his southeastern Massachusetts district who have asked his office for help, finding themselves in “really difficult straits,” Keating said. “You can’t exaggerate the stress that the families are feeling.” A number of congressional Republicans, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, sent unsolicited comments to POLITICO praising the administration's repatriation efforts — after the agency informed them about this story. ""We know there are still many Americans currently trapped overseas, but I can assure you the State Department and Secretary Pompeo are working around the clock to bring them home as quickly as possible,"" said House Foreign Affairs ranking member Michael McCaul (R-Texas) in a statement. But Americans who were or are stranded abroad also say the agency’s actions and communications have been anything but reassuring. “It was an overwhelming sense of confusion, skepticism, misinformation, fear and frustration,"" said Annie Perlick, a nurse who was stuck on a Honduran island, who was one of the 144 U.S. and Canadian citizens who paid a private security firm to get back home. Perlick said that she only turned to this nontraditional method of transportation after trying to get help from State and entreating her representatives in Congress.",Americans remain stranded abroad as State Department struggles to respond,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/americans-stranded-abroad-state-department-149148,politico
"Crises make or break presidents, and they also make or break presidential campaigns. As the nation watches President Donald Trump and state governors work their way through this crisis, former Vice President Joe Biden has lost the spotlight. He is not currently in any position of power that allows him, like his fellow Democrat, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, to legitimately showcase his leadership abilities. He can’t take any major decisions, has no natural channels of communication, and has lost the ability to hold large attention-getting events. Moreover, any Democrat who thinks Trump’s bungled early crisis response dooms Republican chances this fall should not be so complacent: Once stimulus checks start going out, Trump can take credit for the spending at a moment when many are experiencing genuinely desperate circumstances. Even now, more Americans approve of Trump’s response to the crisis than disapprove. There is one episode from recent history that holds lessons for Biden about running a presidential campaign during a moment of crisis: the story of how Ronald Reagan ran against President Jimmy Carter in 1980, when the Iran hostage crisis seemed to be bringing the country to its knees. Of course, the two crises are not comparable in detail. The hostage crisis was a blow to national psychology, not national health. We were not sitting around telecommuting from bed and silently singing happy birthday 20 times a day, and there was no ecology of alternative news sources to contend with. Still, there is much that is similar about the crises: a president seen by some as ineffectually coping, a challenger grappling with the perception that he might be too old but who is generally seen as a good guy. Even the Olympics were troubled that year as they are this year. For months during the 1980 campaign the Iran hostage crisis dominated the national conversation. Coming after years of stagflation which upended the daily lives of Americans—with nightly news showing episodes of violence erupting between customers in gas lines that were miles long, truckers blockading highways and throwing rocks at cars from overpasses, empty store shelves, school shut for a month in one state and the governor of another state threatening to arrest those who did not turn down their thermostats—the hostage crisis led to a general sense that America was experiencing what Carter characterized as a crisis of confidence. In both the economy and its foreign relations, the country seemed humiliated, and expertise itself was called into question as neither economic nor foreign policy experts really knew what to do. Carter diagnosed the problem, but had no solution to it. Reagan had to walk a fine line between criticizing the president and not appearing to politicize a national crisis. By putting together an artful campaign that presented his positive qualities as the embodiment of the hope the nation was looking for, he was able to convince voters he had the solution. The hostage crisis began in 1979, when a group of Iranian college students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and seized 52 American citizens. The act was their reprisal for the U.S. allowing the deposed shah of Iran to enter the United States and receive treatment for cancer, whereas they wanted him to stand trial in Iran for the abuses of his secret police. The hostages were held for 444 days, eventually released on the day of Ronald Reagan’s inauguration, leading to split screen newsreels showing both events. (Recently released archival evidence suggests that a Republican political operative helped to bring the ailing shah to the United States, and also worked to delay the release of the hostages to deny Carter the electoral advantage of being able to bring the issue to closure. But there is no evidence Reagan or any of his close advisers participated in or even knew about these efforts.) In the early months of the crisis, the public rallied around Carter. A poll in January found Carter leading Reagan 59 percent to 36 percent, and he was ahead among all groups—urban voters, suburban voters, rural and small-town voters, men and women, conservatives, moderates and liberals. One pro-Reagan letter writer fretted, “If Carter can keep the embassy hostages alive to the November 1980 election, he can win the nomination and election by default. … Carter’s inept and fateful blunder caused the Iranian crisis, but he is the only party reveling politically in the aftermath.” The crisis squeezed Senator Ted Kennedy, who was running against Carter in the primary, off the stage in the way Biden is being squeezed off today. Reagan made a (short-lived) vow not to criticize Carter. But as the months dragged on, the public became more hostile to Carter. Even before a rescue effort in April ended in disaster, with eight American military personnel killed, Americans were starting to say that the president had failed. All of the Republican candidates for president again were criticizing Carter, and Kennedy was again making trouble in the primary. Reagan and his advisers seized the opening, but they did so not by directly criticizing the rescue effort. Instead, Reagan called the failed mission “a symptom of a broader crisis we face. America’s credibility, leadership and strength are not only being questioned by our friends, but increasingly are being tested by our adversaries. … It is against this historic backdrop that we now enter one of the most dangerous decades of Western civilization.” By summer, Carter’s approval ratings had tanked, and Reagan could focus less on the Iran crisis and more on the economy and rising concerns about inflation — less dangerous political ground on which he could freely criticize the president. Reagan’s campaign wasn’t perfect, as shown by the on-again off-again decision not to criticize the president. But overall, Reagan performed a fine dance of criticizing Carter without seeming to politicize the issue until events lessened the urgent need to focus on it. While the historical circumstances and the specific details are different, there are nevertheless some important lessons for Biden from these events: Wait. This is a dangerous moment for Joe Biden. His team is suggesting that he will present shadow briefings to criticize Trump’s efforts. But these briefings could backfire spectacularly: They could come across as petty and political, and they could become the target of criticism if Biden’s plans start generating attention and debate. Even worse, they could actually create confusion, by presenting the specter of competing centers of power and information. If the reaction to the first briefing is any indication, they will mostly be ignored. Reagan’s vow not to criticize Carter did not actually last very long, and he had started to criticize the incumbent even before the failed rescue effort in April. But he did not seek to be the lead critic of the president’s effort, and he even stressed areas where he supported the president—for example, saying even after the failed rescue effort that he had supported it, but thought it came too late. Biden similarly needs to let the president lead. If Trump is the ineffective and irresponsible caricature that his opponents think he is, events will show it soon enough. Avoid becoming the target of criticism. Another reason for waiting is to avoid diverting criticism from the president. A memo from Reagan’s pollster, Richard Wirthlin, from just before Reagan’s debate with Carter noted this issue: “If the Governor [Reagan] succeeds Tuesday in making Jimmy Carter’s record the major issue of the debate and the campaign, we will succeed in the debate and win the general election. If, however, Carter makes Ronald Reagan the issue of the debate and the campaign, we will lose both.” The adviser Ed Meese told Wirthlin what he had heard about the Carter campaign’s own strategy: “They have stated that ‘if Jimmy Carter is the issue, we lose, but if RR becomes the issue, we will win.’” Let Trump create the record that will be evaluated by voters in November; there’s no need for Biden to jump in now and make himself a target for others to criticize. Connect the dots. While waiting for the moment for politics, build the narrative. Try to do what Reagan did when he connected the failed response to the hostage crisis with a general weakening of America. Americans today are not gripped by the same fears as in 1980, but they are frightened by the social and political polarization of the country, a consequence of increasing economic inequality and ethnic and racial divisions. Those divisions are inflamed by this president. Every aspect of his response, from the decision years ago to disband the pandemic unit to the explicit decision to pander to xenophobia in the middle of the pandemic, reminds voters who Trump is and what he stands for. After several months of this, the country may well be desperate for a figure promising experience, competence and unity. Biden has to be ready with the story of how the virus and the response to it are symptoms of Trump’s broader politics, and he has to be ready to provide his alternative vision for the nation. Draw a contrast with the incumbent that is rooted in the challenger’s personality and resonates with the broader vision. Reagan was able to project resolve, the main thing Americans were looking for. For example, when asked how he would deal with the crisis, Reagan said “the time has long passed when we should have set a date certain for their release.” (His main primary opponent, George H.W. Bush, did not project resolve, instead saying: “I have been supporting the President [Carter] because I have not been able to come up with a quick fix for the situation.”) Voters responded to these displays of resolution as a welcome contrast to the ineffectual White House, and they saw in them the promise of hope for better outcomes. Joe Biden’s great strength is the sense of everyone who interacts with him that he is fundamentally decent. Even disgruntled former aides can do no worse than complain that he doesn’t like fundraising. The challenge for the campaign is how to tell a story about his decency that lines up with the promise to make life better for Americans. The bet that many Trump supporters have made is that an indecent person can nevertheless make good policies. Biden has to be ready to prove this equation wrong. All of these considerations suggest that the only things Joe Biden should do right now are things that can actually help the crisis response. Biden is powerless to invoke the Defense Production Act or build medical surge capacity. But there are things that a well-connected and trusted politician can do even from the middle of self-isolation, such as speaking to communities and populations who distrust Trump and providing a platform to people with good ideas about what to do next. Biden doesn’t have to go into hiding, but neither does he have to become the chief critic of Trump. The time for that will come later. How he handles these issues—whether he brings creativity and experience to carve out a positive role for himself in this unprecedented situation — will be the first major test of Joseph Biden’s presidency, the one that will determine whether there is a Biden presidency.",Where’s Joe?

"The U.S. government has concluded that retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, who vanished more than a decade ago, died while in the custody of Iran, his family and administration officials said Wednesday. The circumstances and timing of Levinson's death were unclear, but White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said Wednesday evening that the U.S. believes Levinson “may have passed away some time ago."" Hours earlier, his family said information U.S. officials had received had led them to conclude he was dead. Neither the government nor the family described that information. The death is believed to have occurred before the recent outbreak of the coronavirus that has gravely affected Iran and another countries, according to a statement from Levinson's family. The government's acknowledgment of Levinson's death came hours after a White House briefing in which President Donald Trump appeared to equivocate on the news, saying, “I won't accept that he's dead."" U.S. officials communicated the news to Levinson's family in a meeting in Washington in recent weeks, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private encounter. The person said the information about Levinson had come from Iran's foreign minister. “It is impossible to describe our pain,"" the family's statement said. “Our family will spend the rest of our lives without the most amazing man, a new reality that is inconceivable to us. His grandchildren will never meet him. They will only know him through the stories we tell them.' Levinson disappeared on March 9, 2007, when he was scheduled to meet a source on the Iranian island of Kish. For years, U.S. officials would say only that Levinson was working independently on a private investigation. But a 2013 Associated Press investigation revealed that Levinson had been sent on a mission by CIA analysts who had no authority to run such an operation. The Trump administration has made it a priority to seek the release of American hostages and prisoners detained overseas. Last week, administration officials touted the release from Lebanon of a New Hampshire restaurant owner jailed on decades-old allegations and the medical furlough of a Navy veteran from an Iranian prison. The Levinson family thanked multiple U.S. officials for their help, including FBI Director Chris Wray, CIA Director Gina Haspel, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and O'Brien, who before his post as national security adviser also served as the State Department's chief hostage negotiator. But the family statement also said: “Those who are responsible for what happened to Bob Levinson, including those in the U.S. government who for many years repeatedly left him behind, will ultimately receive justice for what they have done. We will spend the rest of our lives making sure of this, and the Iranian regime must know we will not be going away."" The family said it does not know when or if Levinson's body will be returned for burial. At a White House briefing on the coronavirus, Trump resisted confirming the family's account, saying that Iranian officials had not told the U.S. about Levinson's fate and that “I won't accept that he's dead."" But he also acknowledged that “it's not looking promising” and said Levinson, who had diabetes and high blood pressure, had had “some rough problems"" prior to his disappearance. “He was a great gentleman,"" he said. Around the same time, though, the White House's acting national intelligence director appeared to confirm Levinson's death with a tweeted statement conveying condolences to the family. And by the evening, the White House issued a new statement designed to remove some of the uncertainty expressed by the president. “As President Trump said today, Iran must provide a complete accounting of what occurred with Bob Levinson before the United States can fully accept what happened in this case,"" O'Brien said. “While the investigation is ongoing, we believe that Bob Levinson may have passed away some time ago."" The family received a video in late 2010 as well as proof-of-life photographs in 2011 in which he appeared disheveled with a long beard and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit like those given to detainees at the Guantanamo Bay prison. Even then, his whereabouts and fate were not known. Iran repeatedly has said that it has no information about Levinson, though U.S. diplomats and investigators have long said they thought he was taken by Iranian government agents. In November, the Iranian government unexpectedly responded to a United Nations query by saying that Levinson was the subject of an “open case” in Iranian Revolutionary Court. Although the development gave the family a burst of hope, Iran clarified that the “open case” was simply an investigation into his disappearance. The announcement of his death comes just weeks after a federal judge in Washington held Iran liable for his disappearance, saying the country was “in no uncertain terms” responsible for Levinson’s “hostage taking and torture.” The judge's decision followed a weekslong trial of emotional testimony from Levinson's family, including from each of his seven children.",Family: U.S. believes ex-FBI agent Levinson has died in Iran,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/robert-levinson-iran-fbi-149111,politico
"Ohio lawmakers have extended mail voting in the state’s primaries until April 28 — but civil rights groups warn the plan could disenfranchise large groups of voters after coronavirus concerns delayed the state's original primary on March 17. The Ohio state legislature passed the primary changes as part of an overarching coronavirus response bill, and Gov. Mike DeWine indicated he will soon sign it. Ohio’s primaries were thrown into chaos last week after DeWine said on the eve of the election that he did not believe it was safe for voters to head to the polls. DeWine said he did not have the authority to unilaterally postpone the election, and his administration supported a lawsuit that sought to delay the primary. After an Ohio court shot down that lawsuit, DeWine's top public health office ordered polling places closed on Tuesday, effectively delaying the primary without legally pushing back the election date. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a directive last week, following the polls closure, that said the primary was postponed until June 2. But the legislature's coronavirus response package nullifies LaRose’s order, after lawmakers argued LaRose did not have that authority. The new law instructs LaRose’s office to send a postcard to every registered voter in the state to notify them of “the methods by which the elector may obtain an application for absent voter's ballots,” along with relevant deadlines. But the statute does not actually mail every voter an absentee ballot request. “Please know that if I could send an absentee request to every voter in this primary I would,” LaRose said in a tweet. “Unfortunately [state regulations] prohibits me from doing so and [this bill] did not address that.” Ballots must be received by 7:30 p.m. on April 28, or postmarked on or before April 27 and received by May 8 to count — a tight turnaround for a state whose election was marred by late confusion. An extremely limited group of voters will be able to vote in-person on April 28, including disabled voters and those without a home address, but for most people, that option won't be available. Voting rights groups immediately expressed concern over the new primary, arguing that it disenfranchised voters. “The April 28 deadline is unworkable,” tweeted Mike Brickner, the Ohio state director of the group All Voting is Local. “It will take time to print & send out postcards to 7.2 million Ohioans. Every piece of mail typically takes 3-5 days. Not sending an app directly to voters draws out already tight timeline.” Brickner's concerns were echoed by state affiliates of the ACLU and Common Cause. A petition circulated by the state affiliate of the League of Women Voters called for a primary no earlier than mid-May and urged the voter registration deadline to be extended until 30 days before the primary. In a statement, LaRose said he disapproved of the plan passed by lawmakers but would work to fulfill it. “It’s disappointing that they’ve instead chosen to significantly reduce the time provided for Ohio to bring this primary to a close,” said LaRose, a Republican. “Though I advocated for a different plan, the legislature has spoken, and I will uphold my oath of office by doing everything in my power over the next 34 days to ensure that every Ohio voter has the opportunity to safely make their voice heard.”",Ohio to run all all-mail primary through April 28,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/ohio-vote-by-mail-primary-election-149012,politico
"The IRS wants to issue as many stimulus payments electronically as it can, and a top congressional aide says that should begin in a matter of weeks. The agency will also issue paper checks to some people, though that will take longer because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service — the government office that actually makes the payments — can only process so many so quickly. Because policymakers want to issue the payments as fast as possible, the IRS is exploring whether it would be quicker to issue some payments on debit cards, instead of sending checks, the aide said. The rise in the number of people in recent years who file their tax returns electronically, complete with their banking information, means the IRS can turn around their payments quickly. “Within a matter of a few weeks,” a Republican Finance Committee aide said in a briefing today with reporters. “Paper checks take a bit longer because the Bureau of [the] Fiscal Service can only process and push out so many paper checks a week,” the aide said. “It’s a pretty significant number but it would probably take, I think they were estimating four or five weeks to get the balance out.” That’s why the IRS is looking into whether it might issue some payments instead “through debit cards or other medium.” “Theoretically it could be faster than having Fiscal Service have to cut checks,” the aide said.

"The White House removed a top public affairs official at the Department of Homeland Security in a move that shocked many in the department as it takes a lead role in handling the coronavirus pandemic, according to two former senior DHS officials familiar with the matter. Heather Swift, who was DHS’ deputy assistant secretary of public affairs, was abruptly pushed out of her position on Friday after the Presidential Personnel Office raised questions about her loyalty to President Donald Trump, said one of the former DHS officials.  The personnel office may have discovered some old social media posts that officials there did not like, this person said, though POLITICO was unable to find any examples of posts the Trump administration might find objectionable. Swift, who has not yet left the department, is moving to a top communications job at the National Endowment for the Arts, a detour well outside the administration’s power corridors.  The transfer represents a fresh blow to Swift’s career aspirations: Several months ago, after serving for a few months in an acting capacity as the top public affairs official at DHS, she angled for that job permanently — only to be disappointed when she was not promoted, according to a Trump administration official. The position instead went to Dirk Vande Beek, a veteran communications strategist who came from the Department of Energy and also worked on the 2000 Bush-Cheney campaign.  Since taking over PPO, 29-year-old John McEntee has asked Cabinet agencies to probe the records of political appointees and ferret out any who might show signs of disloyalty to the president. McEntee, a former college quarterback known for his trick plays and a longtime Trump favorite, has also come under fire within the administration for recently hiring three college seniors for sensitive jobs. One former official pushed back hard on the notion that Swift had been anti-Trump in any way and called her a Trump “acolyte” who “loves the president” and did not want to leave the department. Swift has been a good team player, was well-liked by her staff and colleagues and has worked hard to achieve the department’s mission, this person said.  Swift and DHS did not provide a comment for this story, and a White House spokesperson declined to address Swift’s transfer, citing a policy of not commenting on internal personnel matters. Swift has been in the Trump administration since early 2017, having joined as press secretary for then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke before becoming senior adviser at the department. Zinke resigned in December 2018 after several probes into whether he used his position for personal gain, however, and Swift subsequently moved to DHS last August. Previously, she had worked as Zinke’s communications director when he was a member of the House. She also worked on other Republican campaigns, including a brief stint as press secretary for former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson during his unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat in 2012.",White House abruptly transfers DHS official amid loyalty purge ,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/white-house-dhs-heather-swift-loyalty-148856,politico
"PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron called for national unity as France wages ""war"" against coronavirus, and he promised a ""massive investment plan"" in the nation's health care system. ""When we engage in a war, we engage completely, we mobilize united. I see in our country factors of division, doubts, all those who want to fracture the country when we must have only one obsession: to be united to fight the virus. I am calling for this unity and commitment,"" Macron said in a short address to the nation outside a military hospital in the eastern town of Mulhouse, which has been particularly badly affected by the virus. Macron has come under increasing pressure over the government's testing strategy as well as shortages of masks and respirators. The president saluted the work of healthcare providers whom he described as being on the ""frontline"" and announced immediate bonuses and pay rises for them as well as a ""massive investment plan"" in the nation's hospitals once the crisis ends. The health sector has been demanding a financial boost since Macron became president. He also announced a new military operation — codenamed ""Resilience"" — to provide sanitary and logistical support and protection, including the deployment of two amphibious assault ships off the coasts of French overseas territories in Guiana and the southern Indian Ocean. Macron did not announce an extension of the nationwide lockdown, though the scientific council that has been advising him on policy said on Tuesday ""confinement will, in all likelihood, last at least six weeks since it first started.""

"Justin Trudeau was long the anti-Trump when it came to borders, once telling refugees in a tweet that Canada's doors were wide open and advocating for a revamped North American free trade deal that would allow cross-border commerce to flourish. But in the age of the coronavirus, it’s Canada first. Like many of its like-minded allies in Europe, Canada is turning inward as the virus cases continue to multiply worldwide, and especially in the United States. Asylum seekers are now being turned back to the U.S. from the “irregular” crossings between brick-and-mortar ports of entry that dot the 5,525-mile-long border. They’re not alone — travelers from both countries can no longer dash across the invisible line for cheaper beer or to see friends who live a few miles away but in another country. And now, most people entering the country after Wednesday will be legally required to enter quarantine for two weeks — something the government had already been advising to returning travelers. The prime minister has signaled he's open to tightening the border further if the U.S. becomes the new epicenter of Covid-19. President Donald Trump's eagerness to stop social distancing in just weeks to help jump-start the U.S. economy could force the issue. ""We feel the measures we have taken to restrict flow across the border to ... goods and essential travel is the important thing we are doing to keep Canadians safe,” Trudeau said Tuesday. “Of course, as the situation evolves, we will be ready to shift our posture."" By Wednesday, his government announced it would invoke the Quarantine Act at midnight, requiring anyone entering Canada except for “essential” personnel to isolate themselves from society for 14 days under threat of criminal penalties. “We are, of course, thinking very carefully about additional measures,” Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Wednesday. Over about a 10-day period, Canadian ministers have shifted from arguing against wide-scale border closures to — in a matter of days — closing its doors to most non-Canadians and then to U.S. travelers not crossing for work. “This is not any kind of a shift in our government’s views,” she said. “This is about taking very practical steps to protect the health and safety of Canadians.” One reason the Trudeau government is invoking the Quarantine Act now is that many travelers returning from other countries haven’t realized the severity of the problem, Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Wednesday. “We have heard a number of reports of Canadians from individual citizens and others, and through other means, that people are not understanding that this [14-day period] is absolutely essential to protect the health of their fellow Canadians and their loved ones and their community,” she said. The Public Health Agency of Canada does not have statistics on how many Covid-19 cases diagnosed in Canada resulted from travel, including travel specifically from the U.S., a spokesperson said. Canadian border officials will take down the contact information of everyone entering the country beginning Thursday, and will then “follow up with them to be sure that they are indeed self-isolating,” Freeland said. “But let me emphasize,” she added, “you should be doing it already.” Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said Wednesday one person has been turned back from Canada to the U.S., and one individual was sent back to Canada when trying to cross into the States under the new border restrictions. ""While we are dealing with the very many challenges of containing this illness and placing appropriate restrictions for the movement of people across the Canada-U.S. border, we believe this was the right thing to do at this time,” he said. But it remains to be seen whether Ottawa might further tighten those limits around workers trying to cross the border. Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos said earlier this week in an interview with Maclean’s that “further restrictions” on “the movement of workers” will likely need to be weighed by Cabinet. ""However important the work of truck drivers is, the health and security of Canadians is the most important,” he said. Freeland thanked truck drivers specifically on Wednesday, saying the “important work” they do is necessary for Canadians “to actually survive.” Trudeau is likely to face more pressure on the southern frontier, as Trump signals he wants Americans back to life as they once knew it by mid-April. If Covid-19 cases continue to increase exponentially in the U.S., the prime minister will be left to grapple with how to balance the necessary trade of food and medical supplies that flows over the shared border with the goal of “planking” the coronavirus curve within Canada. Freeland defended the border measures taken thus far Wednesday, saying she doesn’t think they contradict the government’s “core beliefs.” ""We will always put the health and safety of Canadians first,” she said, “and I think all of us feel very clear and very confident that that is the right direction.”",Canada turns inward as pandemic surges within and beyond its borders,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/canada-coronavirus-pandemic-148846,politico
"The Covid-19 crisis is exactly the kind of moment when we need our leaders to reassure and protect us most. Instead, recent reports suggest several United States senators responded by protecting themselves first, selling stock to avoid personal financial losses from a growing public health crisis that they knew, from confidential intelligence briefings, was probably going to be much worse than the public knew at the time. Congressional filings show that some members sold millions of dollars in investments, while another sold a very significant percentage of his total net worth and privately issued a grave warning to wealthy donors while publicly taking a much more sanguine tone. The public is rightly outraged, and many are questioning whether these actions were legal or ethical. As a longtime Senate staffer, I helped draft the Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge Act, or the STOCK Act, which was designed to apply in situations just like this. While it is not clear whether these senators violated that law, it is clear this episode has undermined the public’s trust in our elected officials. And it raises an important question: Should members of Congress even be permitted to trade securities or engage in significant outside business activities at all? I don’t think they should. This isn’t the first time that members of Congress have faced accusations that they misused information they learned on the job for their personal benefit. In November 2011, “60 Minutes” released an investigative report suggesting that several had engaged in extensive stock trading after learning secret details regarding the last financial crisis, in 2008-09. The problem was that while it looked and smelled like corruption, not everyone agreed that it violated federal securities laws. (That’s a separate question from whether the trading violated Congress’ self-imposed ethics rules, which senators can be censured or even thrown out of the Senate for violating, even if they didn’t break any law.) Trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information—commonly called insider trading—is illegal. But insider trading is defined by case law, not statute. Those cases require that a duty, of trust or loyalty, be breached, or information to be otherwise misappropriated. For example, if a corporate executive learns of an impending deal for his company and trades his stock before the deal becomes public, he has likely violated insider trading law, in part because he violated the “trust” the company had in him to not exploit that information for his personal gain. But if there isn’t a duty being violated, then there isn’t insider trading. For example, suppose our executive was just a very obnoxious cellphone user. And suppose another person just happened to overhear the company’s name and the upcoming, not-yet-public deal. That lucky listener may trade on that information without violating the law because they have no direct or indirect duty to the source of the information. Regulators have recently made it clear to “corporate insiders” that insider trading rules also cover material, nonpublic information related to the effects of the coronavirus outbreak. The same should obviously hold true for governmental insiders. Members of Congress and their staffs learn a lot of information that the general public doesn’t know: They get briefings from others in government; they get selective information from large companies and trade associations. Congressional members are granted access to information precisely because they have the ability to influence outcomes, and they are entrusted to use their knowledge to make the best decisions for our country. Shouldn’t they then have a “duty” to not use the information they learn in their jobs for their own personal financial benefit? A handful of senators and staff, including myself, drafted the STOCK Act to answer that question with a resounding yes. The law clearly and directly imposes a duty on government officials to not trade while in possession of material, nonpublic information “derived” from their positions or “gained in the performance” of their jobs. Additionally, the new law requires reporting of transactions after the fact, so that we can more easily learn about potential abuses. The law is not limited to information about a specific company or companies. It covers any “material, non-public information.”  In fact, while negotiating the bill, I used an example to explain the bill to other congressional aides and their bosses. Suppose a member of the Senate learns of a credible threat of a major impending terrorist attack in New York City. The STOCK Act would make it illegal for the senator to then sell a slew of hotel stocks. That would be a betrayal of the senator’s duty. Nobody with whom I spoke— on either side of the political aisle—disagreed. Ultimately, the STOCK Act overwhelmingly passed both chambers of Congress and was signed into law on April 4, 2012. That brings us to now. I am not in a position to judge whether the recent transactions by some senators violated the STOCK Act or, for that matter, other federal laws or ethics rules. Those questions should be thoroughly investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and the Senate Ethics Committee. But given that Congress’ first obligation is to the American people and that serving that obligation so often requires having more knowledge than ordinary American investors, why should members of Congress be permitted to trade individual stocks at all? Why should we expect them to even be capable when making business decisions of separating what they know as a result of their governmental job and what they might otherwise know as private individuals? As recent events make clear, any trading by members of Congress can undermine confidence in government and our democracy. If we want members of Congress to focus on their work rather than their personal wealth, we should consider whether allowing them to be active traders of public-company stock, or even active participants in significant outside business activities, reflects the priorities the American people rightly demand of public servants. Members of Congress often have information that can mean millions, or even billions of dollars to market participants. Should they knowingly be misappropriating that information for themselves, their families, or their friends? Of course not. But it’s also unreasonable to expect members of Congress to pretend to not know something. The STOCK Act is a useful tool to combat corruption, but it isn’t sufficient. Stock trading isn’t the only way that members of Congress could be misusing the material, nonpublic information they learn. Information can also be valuable in real estate transactions, for example. Congress should consider prohibiting significant outside business activities for all members, and limit any securities trading to diversified funds, with all trades first precleared by an appropriate ethics office. That kind of process is common at investment banks and other firms where employees are often in possession of material, nonpublic information. Many compliance officers at companies like those sometimes even conclude that insiders ought to be prohibited from trading in entire industries. We should expect at least as much of members of Congress. The oath of office for a U.S. senator includes the pledge, “I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.” Those duties aren’t to their personal financial interests—but to us.",I Helped Write the STOCK Act.

"Former Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday suggested there should be no more televised debates for the remainder of the 2020 Democratic primary, signaling an unwillingness to spar on stage again with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders next month. Ater a virtual news briefing on the coronavirus pandemic conducted from his home in Delaware, Biden was asked about the Sanders campaign’s statement to The New York Times on Tuesday that the senator would appear in an April debate if the Democratic National Committee proceeded with organizing the event. Pressed on whether he, too, would participate, Biden said: “My focus is just dealing with this crisis right now. I haven’t thought about any more debates. I think we’ve had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.” Biden and Sanders last traded barbs in their first one-on-one debate of the primary cycle on March 15, and it is unclear whether there will be another such forum before the start of the general election campaign. Despite hints that he would withdraw from the Democratic nominating contest soon after falling to Biden in the latest round of state primaries last week, Sanders has defied party pressure and remained in the race — which has been transformed by the coronavirus’ rapid spread across the country. Campaign staff have begun working from home, several states have postponed primary voting, and pre-scheduled rallies and town halls have been scrapped en masse. Even the fate of the Democratic convention in Milwaukee this summer is up in the air amid the public health crisis. Meanwhile, Biden and Sanders have sought to adapt to new methods of connecting with supporters as their campaign organizations rely increasingly on digital resources. “I’m learning a lot more about how to get the message out, in terms of beyond what we’re doing,” Biden said on Wednesday, adding that there is still “plenty of opportunity to communicate” with the American people.",Biden: ‘I think we’ve had enough debates’,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/joe-biden-debates-148620,politico

"As congressional leaders haggled over a $2 trillion emergency economic relief bill Tuesday, President Donald Trump mocked House Democrats for stuffing their own rescue proposal with priorities unrelated to the coronavirus crisis—especially one priority he famously hates. “They had things in there that were terrible,” Trump complained during his virtual town hall on Fox News. “Windmills all over the place, all sorts of credits for windmills!” In fairness to the Democrats, their 1,400-page draft had nothing about windmills. But in fairness to Trump, windmills were among the few Democratic priorities that didn’t appear in the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act that the House floated Monday night. The proposal did include extra funding for workers and families, but also for Supplemental Dairy Margin Coverage, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts—even though the Kennedy Center is closed—and hundreds of other government programs and services unrelated to the emergency. Congressional leaders didn’t use the House draft as the basis for the stimulus deal they struck early Wednesday morning, but they did fund quite a few of its provisions—from modest items with little connection to the pandemic, like $12.5 million for the Bureau of Reclamation or $25 million for the Kennedy Center, to $25 billion for ravaged transit agencies. And Congress is expected to pass more stimulus bills in the coming months, so the House proposal still bears a very close look as a preview of how Democrats plan to use their leverage. It also gives Republicans some talking points about the random taxpayer-funded goodies their opponents are pushing during a crisis. What’s in it? Even though airports are virtually empty, and the Transportation Security Administration has never had less to do, the Democrats proposed $26 million for overtime for TSA employees. They also slipped in $20 million to help the TSA to buy new swabs for detecting explosives, a worthy security measure that lacks any apparent connection to the pandemic, $31 million for “bio-surveillance of wildlife,” and $45 million to help the Agricultural Marketing Service grade commodities like beef, eggs and, well, pork. Agricultural anything tends to attract bipartisan support, and the final stimulus deal included that entire $45 million request. But suffice to say that if Christmas trees were graded, the House’s draft would be USDA Prime, while the final deal would probably be closer to U.S. Standard. And in an economic crisis, congressional grab bags can be politically toxic. In 2009, Republicans successfully branded President Barack Obama’s stimulus bill as a dog’s breakfast of traditional big-government spending—including “sod on the Mall,” “smoking cessation,” “herpes prevention” and other line items that didn’t even make it into the final bill. Now some former Obama aides are afraid congressional Democrats might be walking into the same “Porkulus” trap. Obama’s $800 billion Recovery Act helped end the Great Recession, but Republicans hammered away at its laundry-list optics so relentlessly that within a year, the percentage of Americans who believed it had created jobs was smaller than the percentage who believed Elvis was alive. Like Winston Churchill’s apocryphal pudding, the Obama stimulus lacked a theme, and Democrats seem to be repeating their public relations mistakes. “Have we learned nothing?” asked Jared Bernstein, who worked on the Recovery Act as chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden in the Obama White House. It’s not just that the House bill veers away from the pandemic or even the economy. The bill simply reads like a typical congressional appropriations bill, with plus-ups like $100 million for NASA construction and environmental compliance and the Legal Services Corporation, as well as $300 million for the National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities and Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The only real difference is boilerplate language justifying most of the plus-ups “to support activities to prevent, prepare for and respond to coronavirus,” from the $20 million for the Bureau of Reclamation to the $33 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s not all relatively small-ticket items, either; the Postal Service got $25 billion, plus $11 billion worth of debt forgiveness and $15 billion in new borrowing authority, which is real money even by congressional standards. The bill included a major bailout of underfunded multi-employer pension plans that coal miners, Teamsters and other labor groups have been pushing for years, as well as a $10,000-per-borrower reduction in student loan debt. “Skimming it, I was struck by: ‘What does all this shit have to do with anything?’” another Obama White House veteran said. Last year, Republicans turned a few off-message lines in a Green New Deal memo written by a staffer to Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez into a mantra that Democrats were determined to ban cows and airline travel. Now some Democrats—including some aides to Biden, who oversaw the Recovery Act for Obama and is now the party’s presumptive presidential nominee—fear that history will repeat itself over the Democratic wish list. In fact, one message Republicans kept repeating Tuesday was that the Democrats were already trying to use the economic relief bill to pass a backdoor Green New Deal, even though the House draft had almost nothing related to energy or climate change. “This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal,” Trump tweeted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered an angry floor speech about “completely non-germane Democratic wish-list items,” in which he only specified two—tax credits for wind and solar energy, which were not even in the Democratic proposal, and emissions restrictions for bailed-out airlines, which were. “Democrats won’t let us fund hospitals or save small businesses unless they get to dust off the Green New Deal,” McConnell declared. The 2009 stimulus did include down payments on several of Obama’s long-range policy priorities, including education reform, scientific research, infrastructure and yes, green energy, which received a whopping $90 billion that helped create booms in wind, solar, electric vehicles and LED lighting. The current House bill takes a different approach, calling for modest spending increases for a grab bag of federal agencies and services but actually limiting its major investments in longstanding Democratic priorities to issues with some nexus to the current crisis. For example, the Democrats pushed for dramatic spending increases on unemployment insurance, which they got, as well as paid sick leave and family leave to help workers stuck at home during the pandemic and a national vote-by-mail system to make sure the coronavirus doesn’t prevent Americans from casting ballots in November, which they didn’t get. But other than the money for struggling transit agencies and a $1 billion program to help bailed-out airlines replace high-polluting airplanes with more efficient ones, the House bill mostly ignores the calls from climate hawks for a game-changing down payment on a Green New Deal. Some Democrats disgusted by the House bill’s cats-and-dogs approach argue that if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were going to push for anything other than containing the virus and helping cash-strapped families, she should have pushed for more transformative spending that would put Americans back to work over the coming year—like a Marshall Plan to rebuild American infrastructure, or a nationwide initiative to install rooftop solar. “If you’re going to Christmas-tree this up and spend $2 trillion, why not go big?” asked Kenneth Baer, former communications director for Obama’s budget office. Everyone in Washington knows that a crisis can be the best way to ram some pet ideas through, and the Senate Republican proposal, weighing in at a mere 247 pages, includes some efforts to use the crisis to push longstanding conservative priorities, like language limiting aid to health providers that accept Medicaid patients, promoting abstinence education and cutting taxes on certain investment income. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been using the crisis to try to tighten border restrictions, restrict asylum claims, cancel union elections and give the Justice Department the power to detain Americans indefinitely without trial during emergencies. And since the final congressional compromise includes some of the esoteric Democratic wish list, Republicans who vote for it will to some extent own it. But if the Capitol Hill negotiations exposed the GOP as the stingier party when it comes to helping workers and vulnerable families, and the more generous party when it comes to helping bailed-out companies avoid strict conditions, the House bill does reinforce stereotypes of the Democrats as the party of Big Government, exploiting a pandemic to pour taxpayer dollars into heating assistance for the poor, runaway youth programs, and subsidies for little-used airports serving smaller cities. It wouldn’t be a Democratic economic relief bill without an extra $1 billion for Head Start, even when Head Start programs are shuttered for the pandemic. In 2009, Republican mockery of random projects financed by the Obama stimulus—“turtle tunnels,” “honeybee insurance” and a drug addiction study that the GOP shorthanded as “cocaine monkeys”—helped convince the public it had nothing to do with jobs, even though subsequent studies found that it helped save millions of jobs. McConnell is the master of that game, and the Democrats who thought they could win it more than a decade ago remember that they ended up losing the House, the Senate and, eventually, the White House. “I don’t want to get into fights over either side’s wish list,” Bernstein says. “I think the politics are prohibitive, and the urgency is getting money out the door.”",‘Have We Learned Nothing?’,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/25/coronavirus-economy-stimulus-house-democrats-148512,politico
"NEW YORK — For weeks, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has mostly played nice with the Trump administration, taking a calm and measured approach toward the federal government — even as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has lashed out at Trump for neglecting his home town in a public health crisis. The differing temperaments between the two officials – Cuomo with a cool executive air bordering on aloofness, de Blasio with an us-against-them pugnaciousness – provided a stark contrast to people outside the tri-state area who were just tuning in to New York’s growing coronavirus crisis. That appeared to change on Tuesday, when Cuomo directed the full weight of his fury at the administration as the spread of coronavirus in his state threatened to spiral out of control. “The president says it’s a war,” Cuomo fumed, his voice rising at a press conference at the Javits Center, the massive Manhattan convention hall now being turned into an emergency hospital. “Well then act like it’s a war!” Faced with New York’s need for 30,000 ventilators to keep virus patients alive when the spread of the virus peaks - which could happen in as soon as two weeks - the federal government had sent 400 from its stockpile.  ""You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators,"" an angry Cuomo demanded. But within a day — after a mollifying conversation with Trump — Cuomo was back on his steady course. ""It's something our team is working on with the White House team and I want to thank the president for his cooperation and his team for their cooperation,"" Cuomo said on Wednesday, referring to the supply-chain problems facing New York’s medical authorities. Cuomo’s calculation seems to be that a softer approach would get him further with a president known for being susceptible to flattery.  “I can tell you he is fully engaged on trying to help New York. He’s being very creative and very energetic, and I thank him for his partnership,” Cuomo said last week, after chatting with Trump about a Navy ship dispatched to New York harbor to serve as an emergency hospital. That ship, the USNS Comfort, it turned out, would not be ready for weeks. And so it has gone in Cuomo’s two-step with Trump on the health crisis, where gains for New York have often been followed by setbacks.  De Blasio has been less delicate with the president, consistently berating him for a slow federal response to the spiraling health crisis. “The fate of New York City rests in the hands of one man. He is a New Yorker. And right now, he is betraying the city he comes from,” the mayor told reporters last week.  In other appearances, de Blasio has labeled Trump his generation’s Herbert Hoover for his response to the pandemic and accompanying economic crash.  As the first cases of coronavirus hit New York, both men sought to avoid panic, encouraging New Yorkers to go about their lives while taking sensible precautions. They even held a dual press conference at the beginning of the month.  That was a rare occasion for two men whose dislike of each other is well known to their New York constituents. De Blasio, who won a longshot bid for mayor in 2013, fashioned himself the progressive alternative to Cuomo's brand of centrism, but the governor seemed to delight in undermining him at every turn. In their six years in office, they've feuded over matters as grave as the spiraling homeless population and dire conditions in the city's public housing and as trivial as the fate of a single deer found in Harlem. When coronavirus hit, both shared an interest in sparing New Yorkers from the brunt of the virus. But as circumstances grew more dire, and much of New York was forced into shutdown, their approaches diverged -- and occasionally devolved into the one-upmanship that has long characterized their relationship outside times of crisis. When de Blasio warned New Yorkers last week to prepare for a shelter in place order, Cuomo quickly shot down the idea. Days later, Cuomo issued just such an order, but said he did not want to call it shelter in place because the term is alarmist.  Cuomo pre-empted de Blasio’s announcement that New York City schools would close, making the news public just moments before de Blasio did. On Sunday, the two had wildly different takes on how city-dwellers were responding to the state’s stay at home order, with Cuomo saying he was so dissatisfied that New York City needed to come up with a plan within 24 hours to ensure people followed instructions. Cuomo, who has marshaled sweeping emergency powers for himself in the midst of the crisis at the expense of localities like New York City, sought to project command of the situation and stuck with a mostly measured tone, leaving it to de Blasio to sound the alarm about the federal government’s perceived failures.  Trump seemed to notice the difference, dismissing de Blasio when he was asked about the mayor’s charges of betrayal. “I’m not dealing with him. I’m dealing with the governor. And the governor agrees with me, and I agree with him,” he said on Friday. “I guess they’re not agreeing with each other, necessarily.” Yet by Tuesday, as the fast-moving pandemic claimed more New Yorkers’ lives, the mayor and the governor were united in their anger at the Trump administration. As Cuomo lashed out in his Javits Center press conference, de Blasio warned that the few ventilators the feds have delivered would buy the city only days. “Some days you need the carrot, and some days you need the stick. Today is a stick day,” said New York political strategist Stu Loeser, who was press secretary to former Mayor Mike Bloomberg.  He said that Cuomo’s anger, deployed sparingly, could be more effective than the bashing from de Blasio, who has criticized Trump more consistently during the pandemic and lacked the same “give and take.” “I think Gov. Cuomo wakes up every morning, to the degree that he sleeps, looks at the data on infections in New York, and looks as best he can at the president’s mood, and sets his course for the day based on both of those pieces of information,” he said.  In a virtual town hall from the White House’s Rose Garden Tuesday, the tentative truce between Cuomo and the administration still seemed intact, with Vice President Mike Pence saying he’s had continued meetings with both Cuomo and de Blasio and publicly assuring leaders the federal government “will make those resources available.” Four thousand ventilators will be sent to the state in the next two days, Pence said. But Trump did not take as well to his sometime ally’s criticism. The president appeared next in the Fox News event and railed on Cuomo for “complaining,” saying the federal government is doing “definitely more than anybody else” when it comes to helping out the state. Trump referred to a report — presumably this op-ed that ran in the New York Post by former Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey, a Republican — saying that in 2015 the state declined the option to buy thousands of ventilators. “I'm not blaming him or anything else,” Trump said. “But he shouldn't be talking about us. He's supposed to be buying his own ventilators. We are going to help. But if you think about Governor Cuomo, we are building him four hospitals. We are building him four medical centers. We are working very, very hard for the people of New York. We are working along with him. Then I watch him on this show complaining.” Then Trump name-checked Cuomo on Wednesday afternoon, near the top of the White House coronavirus briefing, announcing that he spoke to the governor on Tuesday night and again on Wednesday and that he recognized “they’ve got a number of very tough weeks ahead of them.” “The governor is doing a very good job,” he said, before going on to highlight the federal response in New York. “I want you to know that I’m doing everything in my power to help the city pull through this challenge. I'm working hard in New York.“ For Cuomo, who has mobilized his resources and Rolodex to unparalleled levels this month, the tone shift on Tuesday seemed based on an inability to understand why the federal government wouldn’t similarly exhaust all avenues. The federal government can order manufacturers to build ventilators under the Federal Defense Production Act, Cuomo said. He, as governor, cannot. “Only the federal government has that power,” Cuomo said. “And not to exercise that power is inexplicable to me.”",New York reaches a coronavirus breaking point with Trump,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/cuomo-de-blasio-new-york-coronavirus-response-148462,politico
"Republican governors are following the advice of public health experts and embracing coronavirus lockdowns and business closings despite President Donald Trump's push to reopen parts of the country by Easter. Trump's press to scrap social distancing in all but the most virus-ravaged areas — and statements implying the fight to contain the disease have turned a corner — have rankled some GOP governors consumed with efforts to contain transmission and ease the burden on stressed local health systems. ""You can’t put a timeframe on saving people’s lives. We’re going to make decisions based on the scientists and the facts,"" Maryland's Larry Hogan, chairman of the National Governors Association, said on Wednesday. Hogan's frustration burst into the open Tuesday, when he blasted Trump during a CNN interview for sending ""pretty confusing"" messages on the virus that don't sync up with the experience on the ground. “Most people think we’re weeks away from the peak, if not months. That’s the advice we’re getting from the smart folks at Johns Hopkins, the National Institutes of Health, the University of Maryland, places like that,” Hogan said. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday said his state isn't expected to experience peak infections until May 1. ""The only way we slow it down is with physical/social distancing,"" he wrote on Twitter. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, who presides over a state Trump won with more than 68 percent of the vote, on Monday ordered residents to stay home after the confirmation of the first case of community transmission, in a nursing home. Justice ordered the state’s National Guard to test everyone at the facility in a bid to control further transmission. Such moves are more than a display of independence. Governors traditionally have the final say in public health crises and can declare emergencies to speed a response. New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo twice in the last decade temporarily suspended state laws and regulations to administer shots to children during season flu outbreaks. Pennsylvania Democrat Tom Wolf used similar powers to respond to the opioid crisis in his state in 2018. In the case of coronavirus, Trump's optimistic statements have been at odds with the assessments of top scientists and doctors, as well as administration officials such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, who've predicted a formidable battle that could last into the summer. Officials from the World Health Organization warned Tuesday that the United States has the potential to become the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic based on the rapid uptick in confirmed cases. Trump during a Tuesday evening appearance with members of his coronavirus task force suggested that social distancing may still apply to the hardest hit areas like New York state, which has reported over 30,000 cases as of Wednesday. He said he will decide whether to extend nonbinding federal social distancing guidelines next Monday, 15 days after his administration first made the recommendations. But Trump's suggestions that the nationwide fight may already be winding down were at odds with efforts in some Republican-led states that seem to be just starting to ramp up their mitigation strategies, with more lockdowns and stay-at-home orders on the way. Hogan this week ordered all nonessential businesses in Maryland closed, saying people weren’t taking social distancing guidelines seriously enough. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp hasn’t gone as far as issuing a lockdown order, but on Monday announced the closure of bars and nightclubs and banned public gatherings of 10 or more people. DeWine on Sunday issued a “shelter in place” order through April 6 for residents to stay in their homes for all but essential outings and closed nonessential businesses. Democratic-led states including California, Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey and New York have similar orders under effect. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, meanwhile, during a Tuesday press conference, signaled he may be open to issuing a sweeping statewide stay-at- home order, after the largest counties announced their own lockdowns. Abbott’s lieutenant governor and close Trump ally Dan Patrick created a firestorm Monday night when he suggested he’s had conversations with older constituents who said they would rather die than see the economy destroyed by the coronavirus lockdowns. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another Trump ally, has steered a more independent course, resisting political pressure to issue a shelter-in-place order but saying he would restrict visitors coming into his state from hot spots including New York. Public health experts are most concerned that lifting national guidelines could undermine local, state and federal efforts to flatten the curve of disease spread at a time when they still don't have a firm grip on who is sick and where. “When you look at the country obviously no one is going to want to tone down things when you see what's going on in a place like New York City. I mean, that's just good public health practice and common sense,” NIH infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said during the Tuesday press briefing, with Trump standing nearby. Fauci added that when testing ramps up more across the country, officials will get a better idea of whether they will need to continue federal guidelines for the whole country or if the focus will need to be in only certain, hardest hit areas. Officials in some outlying areas with comparatively few cases appear content to take a wait-and-see approach. South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday said that, based on models, her state doesn’t expect to reach peak infection rate for at least another eight weeks. She hasn’t ordered a statewide lockdown but has restricted business and hospital operations. “Whatever decisions we make ... need to be sustained in the long term,” she said.",Republican governors buck Trump and stick with social distancing,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/republican-governors-trump-social-distancing-148428,politico

"The Department of Homeland Security has been briefed that New York City’s morgues are nearing capacity, according to a department official and a second person familiar with the situation.  Officials were told that morgues in the city are expected to reach capacity next week, per the briefing. A third person familiar with the situation in New York said some of the city’s hospital morgues hit capacity in the past seven days. And a FEMA spokesperson told POLITICO that New York has asked for emergency mortuary assistance. Hawaii and North Carolina have asked for mortuary help as well, and the disaster response agency is currently reviewing the requests, according to the spokesperson. If the available morgue space in New York City fills up as the number of COVID-19 deaths increases, federal help will be available, a former senior administration official said, noting that the George W. Bush administration sent mortuary assistance in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the Sept. 11 attacks. The Department of Health and Human Services oversees the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams, which can help set up temporary morgues. The teams operate in response to requests from local authorities. For now, city officials do not seem especially alarmed. Aja Worthy-Davis, a spokesperson for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, said concerns about morgue capacity may be unfounded. OCME’s morgues can store up to 900 bodies across all five boroughs, she said. “We have the ability to expand pretty dramatically,” she said. “If you look back at what we did during 9/11, we have the ability to create mobile stations that allow us to house bodies if we run out of space.”  New York City has not dealt with mass casualties at the rate as Covid-19 in recent memory, however. “All hospitals within the city tend to have small morgue spaces, so it’s possible that with the capacity of hospitals in New York City, there may be an expectation … that they’ll run out of morgue space,” Worthy-Davis added.  In a 2008 plan for a pandemic influenza outbreak, OCME noted, “It is probable that funeral directors, cemeteries and crematoria may be unable to process remains at the same rate as the OCME, due to the large influx of deaths during a PI [pandemic influenza] outbreak.” According to the plan, the office would respond to such a crisis by enhancing its medical transport teams. The H1N1 virus, which is not nearly as deadly as Covid-19, brought hospitals “to their knees,” said Dr. Conrad Fischer, a residency program director in internal medicine at Brookdale University Medical Center in Brooklyn. An official with Bellevue Hospital said a temporary morgue outside NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan has in recent days been stood up to help house the remains of Covid-19 victims. The New York Post first reported the news. Another issue for responders will be handling significantly more burials and cremations than they usually handle. Federal assistance might be available to help with that potential challenge, and it would need to work in tandem with state and local officials.  More than 50,000 Americans have tested positive for Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, and at least 800 have died from it, according to constantly updated numbers from Johns Hopkins University. New York has been particularly hard-hit, with more than 25,000 positive cases in the state and about 16,000 in the city alone, per city and state information.  Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed New York state residents on March 20 to stay at home, and has temporarily banned “all non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason,” per an announcement on a state government website.  A spokesperson for HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether New York officials had asked for assistance from the teams; neither did a spokesperson for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Dept. of Health or New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office. Spokespersons for DHS headquarters also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Correction: A spokesperson for OCME clarified after initial publication that the city's morgues across all five boroughs can hold up to 900 bodies, not just in Manhattan.","NYC morgues near capacity, DHS briefing warns",2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/dhs-briefing-nyc-morgues-near-capacity-148259,politico
"The Senate late Wednesday unanimously approved a $2 trillion emergency package intended to stave off total economic collapse in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, bringing an end to more than five days of negotiations between senators and the Trump administration.  The measure — which comes after hours of delays over a dispute on jobless benefits — is the biggest economic rescue package in U.S. history. It includes direct checks to many Americans, a massive fund for beleaguered industries, immediate aid for hospitals and back-up cash for state and local governments. The Senate voted 96-0 in its last vote before adjourning until April 20, with an extended recess amid the pandemic. The bill now goes to the House where passage on a voice vote is scheduled for Friday. “The Senate has pivoted from one of the most contentious, partisan periods in the nation's history to passing this rescue package 100 to nothing all in one quarter of this year,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said. “Help is on the way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), noting that negotiators packed “weeks if not months” of legislative dealings into mere days. The final bill text clocked in at 880 pages, with enormously complicated new programs that will likely define the federal response to the crisis for years. “It’s been a long hard road, with a remarkable number of twists and turns. But for the sake of millions of Americans, it will be worth it,” Schumer said.  In another sign of how quickly the virus is spreading throughout the nation, the Senate grappled with the threat of an outbreak inside the Capitol after Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) tested positive for the disease — just as negotiators were furiously working toward a deal.  And just hours before the Senate voted on Wednesday, the No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Thune, left Washington with potential symptoms of the virus and decided to head home to South Dakota to self-quarantine. Two other senators — Sens. Mike Lee and Mitt Romney, both of Utah — also couldn’t vote on Wednesday because they are quarantining after possible exposure to the virus, though Romney said he tested negative for the virus. Senate leaders had hoped to vote earlier on the legislation, but the timeline slipped after Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) stalled the vote as they sought changes to a massive expansion of unemployment benefits. The GOP senators argued that the program would allow workers to be paid more on unemployment than what they were making while employed. Ultimately, McConnell agreed to put their proposed changes on the floor for a vote — but the amendment fell far short of the 60-vote threshold. One of the most urgent components of the package provides $150 billion for hospitals and other health entities that are pleading for help to contain the pandemic, relying on hand-sewn masks and donated ventilators.  It also includes hundreds of billions in direct $1,200 payments to many Americans as well as bigger unemployment checks to people whose jobs are shed in the crisis. For businesses, there are $850 billion worth of loan programs, much of which comes with careful oversight provisions demanded by Democrats.  The swift passage of the mammoth legislation will be a testament to two long-time vote-counters who are each the masters of their own parties: McConnell and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Both leaders spent much of the last several days on conference calls fielding requests and briefing their members on the plan.  Pelosi had originally hoped to bring the bill up via unanimous consent after Senate passage, a voting method that would not force lawmakers to return to Washington. But she said later Wednesday that House leaders were looking at other options, noting that at least some Republicans were on their way to Capitol Hill to object to the legislation when it moves to the House. “What I would like to see, because this is a $2 trillion bill, I’d like to see a good debate on the floor,” Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol on Wednesday. “Overwhelmingly our members want to come back.” Congressional leaders are now planning to pass the package in the House with a voice vote — similar to unanimous consent in that members aren't required to be present but the lawmakers in the chamber can verbally register their opposition or support. House Republican leaders privately acknowledged that there would have been a strong possibility that a member would have objected to a unanimous consent agreement. Multiple members would not be able to attend votes, including the two lawmakers who are battling the coronavirus — Reps. Ben McAdams and Mario Diaz-Balart — as well as several others who are self-quarantining after possible exposure.  Three additional members, Reps. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) also said Wednesday that they had developed symptoms of the virus and will be self-quarantining at home. Pelosi and her team reiterated that they will continue to fight for many of those proposals, noting there will be opportunities in the fourth stimulus bill Congress is all-but certain to craft. House Democrats were expected to be briefed on a full caucus call sometime after the Senate text was unveiled. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Pelosi said Democrats want the next phase to include stronger paid leave provisions, a pension fix and additional worker protections — many of which were left on the cutting room floor in negotiations for the previous bills. ""This is not going to be the last bill,"" Pelosi said on PBS. ""This bill is about mitigation for the [economic] damage that is being done … The next phase will be recovery."" That next legislative phase, however, could be even more difficult than this week’s $2 trillion package. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was noncommittal on Wednesday when asked about the prospects for a fourth stimulus bill. ""I'm not convinced yet that we need a fourth bill,” McCarthy said.

"The Trump administration will have wide latitude to distribute $100 billion in emergency funding to hospitals bracing for the coronavirus under a massive stimulus package congressional negotiators are racing to finish. The rescue package, according to the latest draft text and congressional aides, comes with few restrictions on how the money should be distributed to hospitals, clinics and doctors for treating infected patients and trying to mitigate financial losses stemming from the pandemic. Lawmakers will also bump Medicare payments by 20 percent for coronavirus patients. The funding, one of the last sticking points in high-stakes talks that stretched over five days, amounts to a major win for hospital lobbies, who had recently intensified calls for a rescue fund to offset huge revenue losses from cancellation of lucrative elective surgeries and major costs from a flood of Covid-19 patients needing critical care. Some cash-strapped rural and safety net hospitals have already warned about their ability to make payroll after calling off non-emergency procedures. Some congressional aides said the loose parameters on how to divide the hospital funding were primarily driven by the urgency of finalizing the nearly $2 trillion rescue package — even as the administration's oversight of a $500 billion corporate aid fund emerged as a major flashpoint in negotiations. The aides said lawmakers simply didn’t have enough time to figure out the best way to equitably divvy up the money based on need, especially since hospitals are still in the early days of managing the pandemic and hot spots are expected to keep emerging. HHS declined to comment on any discussions about how the department plans to distribute the funds. However, once Congress passes the stimulus, which lawmakers hope to do this week, the lobbying battle will likely shift to the executive branch. Lawmakers revised earlier versions of the legislation to stipulate the money can be used for medical supplies and equipment, like masks and other protective gear that's in short supply, as well as construction to help deal with a patient surge. Congress also beefed up oversight and restrictions on the $100 billion pot. Applicants will have to justify their funding requests, which will be audited by the health department's independent watchdog. The providers will also have to report to the federal government “as needed” to show they’re using the funds as intended. Providers will also be barred from double-dipping into the fund for any expenses that will be repaid elsewhere. The American Hospital Association, along with the American Medical Association and American Nurses Association, had asked for $100 billion late last week, while for-profit hospitals pushed for more than double the amount. Provider lobbyists in the past several days moved the needle considerably on funding talks, after Senate Republicans' initial plan released late last week left out direct funding. Instead, the GOP lawmakers had called for suspending the 2 percent Medicare rate cut from the ongoing sequester while boosting Medicare payments related to Covid-19 treatment by 15 percent. They later proposed $75 billion in grants and other direct funding in an amended package over the weekend, before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Monday countered with her own stimulus package that boosted the number to $100 billion. Senate Democrats led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who has close ties to his state's hospitals, had sought even more — closer to the $225 billion pushed by the for-profit hospital lobby Federation of American Hospitals. Schumer claimed Wednesday’s compromise boosted hospital funding by $55 billion over the Senate GOP’s earlier proposal. The bill also provides $1 billion to the Indian Health Service, which has had early struggles responding to the outbreak.",Congress gives hospitals $100B they demanded in coronavirus package,2020-03-25,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/congress-hospitals-coronavirus-funding-148152,politico

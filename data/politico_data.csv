"In the weeks since the coronavirus outbreak first reached the United States, @realDonaldTrump has launched a barrage of more than 50 tweets on the growing pandemic, initially offering a rosy assessment of the growing health crisis—assuring Americans that it will “all work out well,” that the outbreak was spreading “very slowly in the U.S.” and that it’s “very much under control”—even as the death toll rose and the number of cases ballooned. In recent days, Trump has taken a more serious tone about the crisis, advocating for policy responses and travel bans, but even the news conference announcing his national emergency declaration ended with a jaunty exclamation point. That’s Trump himself. But what about his Twitterverse? The president follows only 47 accounts on Twitter, a collection of family members, conservative pundits, administration officials and Trump-brand properties.  Even as health experts and mainstream reporters have grown increasingly anxious about the White House’s response to the coronavirus pandemic—and have taken to using their own Twitter accounts to share hand-washing videos and urgent warnings from doctors overseas—when Trump opens his own Twitter feed, he scrolls through something very different. The picture Trump sees, in a nutshell: That the coronavirus crisis is someone else’s fault (China, Joe Biden, etc.), that he’s doing a great job responding to it, and that a Trump-hating media is just fanning the flames.  “The American people have seen once again that President @realDonaldTrump has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people,” tweeted Vice President Mike Pence. “Remember Democrats Pushed Impeachment While Coronavirus Spread,” Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on Friday morning, with a link to a Breitbart column.  “@realDonaldTrump will use every tool available to protect the American worker as he safeguards the health of all,” tweeted Ivanka Trump on Tuesday.  As Trump faces the biggest public health crisis of his presidency, a reading of dozens of tweets from the president’s favorite Twitter users over the past week shows his allies shaping Trump’s feed into five main coronavirus narratives: While Trump has come under increased pressure to respond more forcefully to the outbreak, his allies have taken to Twitter to frame the coronavirus as a foreign threat that spiraled out of control because of a bungled international response.  “Remember, China initially REFUSED to allow the CDC into Wuhan,” conservative activist and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec said in a post retweeted into the president’s feed by his son Donald Jr.  “Inside China's high-stakes campaign to smear the United States over coronavirus,” read the headline of a Fox News article in the president’s feed.  “POTUS was right to restrict travel from China in January, and now there is more evidence that @realDonaldTrump made the right call restricting travel from Europe, too,” tweeted Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee.  “President Trump must take China on here—they created this health crisis, now they’re claiming America is to blame. Typical communist ploy. #Wuhancoronavirus,” tweeted Fox News personality Laura Ingraham.  The president’s allies were also quick to dogpile on 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, who was vice president during the 2009 H1N1/swine flu pandemic and 2014 Ebola epidemic. Even so, former President Barack Obama has remained relatively unscathed by attacks in the Trump Twitterverse, which remains focused on Biden.  “When Biden was vice president, swine flu infected 61 million Americans and killed 12,000,” Ryan Saavedra, a reporter with the conservative online outlet the Daily Wire, wrote in a post retweeted into Trump’s feed. A few hours later, Trump himself took a swipe at Biden, blaming the former vice president for the deaths of thousands of people during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.  “President @realDonaldTrump acted early and decisively... His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens’ fears,” tweeted Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, quoting the campaign's communications director.  “When @JoeBiden was faced with a public health crisis on H1N1, he pushed the panic button and the White House had to cover it,” read a message retweeted by Donald Jr.  Other tweets in the president’s news feed framed recent comments from Biden opposing xenophobia as opposition to Trump’s temporary ban on travel from China.  “If Biden had been in charge, more Americans would have contracted the virus faster,” a Trump campaign account tweeted. And in response to a Biden speech in which the former vice president criticized the president for labeling COVID-19 a “foreign virus,” Laura Ingraham tweeted: “Yeah, Joe! Let’s throw open our borders, our airports, our ports to anyone and everyone—that will really stem the infection rate!” Critique of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is largely absent from his Twitter feed. Instead, his allies have heaped praise on the administration’s response.  “Deeply impressive extraordinary partnership of America’s best and brightest business & government gathered at White House under leadership of @realDonaldTrump & @VP,” tweeted Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera after Friday’s national emergency declaration. “They and we are going to kick #Corona’s ass.” “This is a very good call,” conservative political commentator Eric Bolling tweeted on Friday in response to reports that Trump was planning to declare a national emergency.  “This is the leadership @realDonaldTrump was elected to provide,” tweeted Trump’s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, after the president’s Oval Office address on Wednesday night. “Acting early & decisively he put the U.S. on much better footing than other nations in handling the coronavirus.” “President Trump is exactly right: ‘smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow,’” tweeted Congressman Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican close to the White House. “The President’s actions are proactive and decisive. This is exactly what we need to keep Americans safe and healthy.”  And a tweet from Eric Trump shared simply the headline of an adulatory New York Post column: “Trump passes coronavirus test with flying colors.”  The president’s eldest son, Donald Jr., has led the Trump Twitterverse’s charge against the mainstream press’s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. In his posts and retweets, he’s accused news outlets of stoking panic and helping China spread propaganda. “That the US media is trying to run with the Chinese propaganda that ‘China bought us time’ is a new low even for them,” Donald Jr. tweeted in response to a New York Times op-ed. “F-you!” “The media has thrown everything at [Trump] and none of it has stuck,” said YouTube personality Dave Rubin in a tweet shared by Donald Jr. “So now they have a vested interest in spreading panic, rejoicing over market drops and sewing general chaos.” “This Chinese propaganda about the origin of the coronavirus is being directly amplified and aided by the U.S. media, which is censoring anyone who notes the Wuhan origin of the coronavirus,” said Mike Cernovich, a right-wing activist and conspiracy theorist, in a post retweeted by Donald Jr.  “CNN is literally taking its talking points from the Chinese government,” read another Cernovich tweet shared by the president’s son. Other accounts followed by the president sounded a similar tone. “Erring on the side of maximum transparency is a good thing for the White House given the mass hysteria being stoked by the partisans in media and politics with [the] goal of affecting the election,” tweeted Laura Ingraham.  “I just want to stress to politicians and the media to stop using [coronavirus] as a tool to politicize things and to scare people,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a tweet shared by McDaniel. “It's not responsible. This is not the time for this.” During a March 4 phone call with Sean Hannity, Trump falsely implied the coronavirus outbreak was not as bad as the seasonal flu—an idea he may have picked up from his Twitter followers, who have downplayed the virus’ threat. “They say the mortality rate for Coronavirus is higher than the flu,” tweeted Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. “Consider though that we have a flu vaccine and yet in 2019, 16,000 Americans died from the flu. Imagine if we did not have that vaccine. The flu would be a pandemic.”  “The word ‘pandemic’ is scary, but as @drsanjaygupta points out, it doesn’t speak to mortality rates, only to global scope of infection,” Ingraham tweeted in late February. “As @CDCgov notes, actual mortality rates or coronavirus is very low.” On Friday morning, Ingraham tweeted a link to an article headlined: “Coronavirus: Facts vs. Panic,” which stated “most people who get coronavirus have mild or no symptoms” and “most around the world diagnosed from January-March 1 have already recovered.”  “Great time to fly if not in at-risk population!” Ingraham wrote Friday from the aisle seat of a Chicago-bound United flight.",What Trump’s Twitter Feed Tells Him About the Coronavirus,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-twitter-feed-covid-19-129170,politico
"As Americans brace for the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the U.S., once-booming industries are already suffering from deadly symptoms of an economic downturn.  Consumers, after panic-buying, are expected to hunker down and limit their spending. Sporting events, concerts and other entertainment are now suspended. Businesses are canceling travel and conferences. Airlines and trains are slashing schedules.  The sudden and precipitous shutdowns across the economy are forcing the Trump administration and lawmakers to contemplate which industries need targeted rescues — to keep them from collapsing entirely — and which can get by with broader support for struggling workers across the nation. While lawmakers consider an immediate aid package for workers hashed out by Democratic leaders and the White House, Trump and his aides have been meeting with business leaders and industry groups to design an aid package — through tax relief and emergency loans — for the corporate sector. Core to their challenge: Everyone can’t get special help, so the government must pick winners and losers from a downturn — with a focus on industries whose collapse could ripple through the system most. It’s a debate that will accelerate in the coming days as the economic consequences of the crisis become clearer. Airlines were the first industry that came to mind for Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank.  While strong employment insurance systems and social safety net programs will take care of workers, he said it’s important to think about “what industries have a spillover value to the rest of the economy.”  “I think of transport — whether it’s trains or trucks or airplanes. You want to look at those and where there’s distress that you can help, you want to go in and do that because it spills over to every part of the economy,” said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “I don’t think the same case can be made for restaurants and hotels. I care about the workers and employees, but you know when you build restaurants and invest in hotels, you take business risk. And this will be a bad year for them.”  President Donald Trump has already vowed to help both the cruise line industry and the airline industry, and in a White House sit-down with top health insurance executives, said his administration is already “working very closely” with both.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers this week that the administration was considering loan guarantees and other measures to aid the airline industry amid the pandemic.  “I want to be clear: This is not bailouts. We are not looking for bailouts,” he said. Mnuchin added, “There may be specific industries that are highly impacted by travel that have issues with lending” — and “I would assume the airlines would be on the top of the list,” as well as hotels and cruise lines.  Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said industry-focused measures aren’t the solution, yet.  Instead, he said the administration should focus on people and workers to attack the crisis. “If we don’t do much to respond to it, I think it’s very likely to cause a recession,” Bivens said. If the administration does move to bail out industries such as airlines, Bivens said it should be done through loans — leaving direct fiscal aid for individuals.  “It’s really bad to have a recession, and so doing things that will actually be effective is attractive,” Bivens said. “And I think aid to people and individuals is just more effective, and behind closed doors, their own economic experts will tell them that. And I think in the case of direct cash payments to people and households, how can that not be good politics as well?”  Bivens continued, “I feel like there are some incentives pushing it potentially in the right direction on this stuff, but I think a lot of aid to industries is going to be attempted to be attached to this as well.”  Here’s a look at some of the key industries experiencing the most pain in the early stages of the crisis:  Airlines Flights are being canceled across the board as vacationers halt trips and businesses slash travel. As airlines brace for the downturn, some are comparing the impact to the aftermath of 9/11. The International Air Transport Association says the global industry could lose upwards of $113 billion in 2020. And with another travel ban, this time for foreign travelers coming from Europe, airline stocks plummeted and some companies announced temporary employee layoffs to protect themselves from insolvency. Cruise lines Social distancing does not work on giant cruise ships — especially after passengers were stranded on virus-ridden boats. Carnival stopped voyages on its Princess Cruise lines for two months and cruise ship operator Viking halted operations until May 1, actions that will hit employees and devastate the companies‘ bottom lines.  After the Trump administration pushed for a temporary cruise ship shutdown, the president tweeted late Friday: “At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry — it will be kept that way!” Sports and entertainment  The sports entertainment industry has shut down as lucrative tournaments and sports seasons like March Madness, NBA, MLB and others have been canceled or put on hold. Hundreds of thousands of workers, including vendors, referees and other staff members work events across the country in addition to the athletes.  Other key entertainment industries like film, music and theme parks will be slammed as America shuts down. From Disney World to music festivals, the entertainment industry and its workers will be among those taking the hardest hit as Americans hunker down in their homes.  Hotels Hotel operators have projected major losses as travel plans are canceled across the nation and around the world. With postponed or canceled events, hotels will suffer from fewer overnight visitors. And with a slower pace of bookings, workers will feel the pain as well as companies cut their payrolls.  Restaurants Restaurants across the country are struggling to respond to the fast-paced spread of coronavirus. Bars and restaurants in hot spots like New York and Washington have had to adjust to new state orders for social distancing and lower customer traffic, forcing some to close their doors entirely for the time being — leaving employees without work.  Manufacturing  Coronavirus has disrupted the supply chains for nearly three-quarters of U.S. companies, setting up many for lower annual revenue projections, according to a survey by the leading group for purchasing managers. Companies ranging from retail to technology are sure to feel the losses because of delays in key goods from China, the world’s hub for manufacturing, as the virus kept workers there at home. Energy   Oil and natural gas producers were hit by plummeting oil prices amid the outbreak. A price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia drove oil prices this week to their steepest intraday tumble in nearly 30 years, and numerous U.S. shale companie — already in deep debt — could be pushed out of business if the collapse becomes a prolonged crisis. While a bailout for the industry seems unlikely, Trump gave oil prices a small lift on Friday when he announced that the U.S. would buy additional oil for the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we're going to fill it up,” Trump said. “This is a good time to fill it up.”",Trump’s monumental challenge: Rescuing industries in free fall,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-industry-stimulus-129216,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",Two senators take extreme measures to show fealty to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"Joe Biden has long complained about the crowded debate stage and a restrictive format that doesn’t allow enough time for candidates to speak. Now, in his one-on-one debate Sunday with Bernie Sanders, he finally gets the debate terms he wanted — and an opportunity to convince Democrats the race is effectively over.  Expectations aren’t high for the former vice president after a series of mediocre debate performances during primary season. The Sanders campaign, among other Biden detractors, views the debate as a chance for him to fall flat on his face, reviving questions about the durability of his candidacy just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open with a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. But in years past, Biden has thrived in the one-on-one format during vice presidential debates. His plan Sunday is to focus on his electability and how he’s in sync with the Democratic electorate after winning 15 states, according to aides. In the face of aggressive questioning from Sanders, Biden can now point to record turnout in states like Virginia, which overwhelmingly supported him. Then there’s the fact that he won nearly all of the African American support in Mississippi. What’s more, Biden has won whites by big margins and racked up wins in the cities, suburbs and in rural areas, a fact that advisers hope will give him a sense of confidence against Sanders. “Success builds on success,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s top adviser in charge of debates. In the first debate since Feb. 25 — four days before the South Carolina primary that transformed Biden’s candidacy from hospice patient to juggernaut — Biden is expected to be careful not to come across as too arrogant. “The flip side is this thing, we’ve seen it change before, we’re taking nothing for granted,” Klain said. “I expect a lively contest on Sunday and a lively contest on Tuesday.” Biden is prepared for Sanders to question his shortcomings with reaching out to the youth vote, and to acknowledge he needs to make gains with young voters. But the former vice president’s advisers say he’ll also note that Sanders fell short of his own promise that he had the singular ability to attract new voters and build a coalition that would beat Trump. Biden is also expected to mention how most of the top former presidential candidates in the race endorsed him — and not Sanders. Sanders, meanwhile, is operating under some self-imposed constraints. The Vermont senator likes Biden and loathes Trump, and he doesn’t want to eviscerate Biden out of concern that it would only weaken him and therefore help Trump, Sanders advisers say. And they note the difficulty of being overtly political onstage at a time when coronavirus dominates the nation’s consciousness. Attacking Biden too much could be perceived as just out of step with the moment in which Democrats want unity and seriousness of purpose. “Bernie’s going to be careful about not looking too political — too electoral — and being the guy who says ‘well, I can get this many delegates and go on to the convention...’ No. That’s not where Americans’ heads are at,” an adviser said. “People are worrying about their families. They’re at the grocery store buying batteries.” Because coronavirus has made healthcare an even more important issue, Sanders is expected to press Biden on his opposition to Medicare for all. Sanders also wants Biden to explain why he advocated for cutting Social Security years ago only to inaccurately suggest he never did. “It’s not going to be an all-out assault. It’s going to be a policy debate. And it’s going to be a vigorous one,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders senior adviser. “But it’s going to be on policy.” Klain, said his candidate is ready for whatever Sanders throws at him. “They have met on the debate stage 10 times already. I’m pretty sure I know what Bernie Sanders’ position is on Medicare for All and I know what Joe Biden’s position is on Medicare for All,” Klain said. “If people are expecting some big new thing on Sunday, I don’t think they’re going to get it.”  Klain, who served as Biden’s chief of staff while vice president, earned acclaim as the Obama administration’s czar who successfully managed response to the Ebola virus. Biden has tapped that expertise for his coronavirus response plan, and aides believe the issue is a strength at a moment when President Trump’s unsteady performance has generated criticism. According to NPR, exit polls showed about half of Michigan voters said they believed Biden was best equipped to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 31 percent. In Missouri, 61 percent said they trusted Biden to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 26 percent. Advisers also say Biden would contrast his approach to Trump. Biden, of course, has a well-earned reputation of going off-script, misspeaking or meandering. His first debate performance was arguably his worst. That’s when then-2020 rival Kamala Harris called him out for highlighting his ability to work with Southern segregationists in the 1970s and challenged him on busing policies. The debate went so badly, Biden felt compelled to address his performance at a Chicago event the next day.  “We all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds in a debate can’t do justice to a lifetime commitment to civil rights,” Biden said. Biden’s performances stabilized over time — or critics just became accustomed to his style — and he was praised recently for televised town halls in Nevada and South Carolina as well as the strength of his debates in both of those states.  What also helped Biden was billionaire Mike Bloomberg, a candidate who promised to save Democrats upon Biden’s collapse but instead delivered a disastrous performance in Nevada when Elizabeth Warren shredded him on stage, taking the focus off the then-struggling Biden. Weaver said Biden has benefited from the big debate stages like that one in Las Vegas that have allowed him to avoid engaging in actual debate. “With eight to 10 people onstage,” Weaver said, “it’s very difficult to have the kind of back-and-forth debate that voters need to make a good decision about who they want to pick as their nominee. That’s the problem.” Last week, the two campaigns clashed over the debate format. Sanders campaign wanted a standing debate that was moderated by professionals. Biden’s campaign was more inclined for a seated town hall-style format where citizens could ask questions. Biden has tended to thrive when given more time to argue a point or explain policy ideas. In town halls, potential voters at times would express relief at seeing Biden in person, saying he was far more articulate and cogent than the candidate they’d seen on the debate stage.  Prior to this year’s crowded debates, Biden distinguished himself with several strong performances in vice presidential debates in 2008 and 2012. “Joe Biden is simultaneously the most-experienced presidential campaign debater in modern American life but has the lowest expectations,” said Michael Steel, an adviser to former Rep. Paul Ryan before his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Biden, whose performance was credited with helping to reverse the fortunes of the Obama-Biden ticket.“We expected him to be over the top. We expected him to be blarney-full, if that’s a word. And he just took it to 11.” The dispute with the Sanders campaign over the debate format came as Democrats sympathetic to Biden started privately raising concerns that Biden didn’t have the physical or mental stamina to face Sanders on stage. Rumors circulated that the Democratic National Committee was under pressure to cancel the debate, which both the DNC and Biden’s campaign denied. The debate ultimately wasn’t canceled, but it was moved to Washington, D.C., from Phoenix over concerns about coronavirus contagion. Mike Ceraso, a former adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign, said Biden has captured the feeling of the party better than his opponents, winning a different type of expectations game. “Expectations this time around isn’t about brains or performance. It’s about the story, man. Pete and Warren and Bernie’s stories are okay,” Ceraso said. “Biden’s story hits home. Loss and anger and sense of service and sadness are relatable qualities. They amplify with Trump in the background. Take the intellectual out of it. And focus on the heart. It’s cliche as hell. But...imagine if you’re someone who has a mom with Alzheimer’s or a depressed child or someone addicted to drugs.”",Biden readies plan to finish off Bernie,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/biden-sanders-2020-endorsements-129182,politico

"The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Fair Isaac, the financial company whose credit scores underlie nearly all U.S. consumer credit decisions, according to information obtained by POLITICO. The probe follows years of complaints from rivals about Fair Isaac's dominance, and comes amid efforts by Congress and financial regulators to inject more competition into the credit score market. Fair Isaac's FICO scores are a measure of risk that banks and credit card companies use to make lending decisions, and are used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to determine creditworthiness of mortgage applicants. The exact scope of the DOJ’s antitrust investigation isn’t yet known. The agency recently sent letters to Fair Issac and others in the consumer credit industry asking them to preserve documents, according to a person knowledgeable about the case who was not authorized to speak about it. Such hold-letters are the first step in an investigation. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment Friday night. Fair Isaac founded the FICO score in 1956 and has issued more than 100 billion scores, according to its website. The scores are based on information collected by the three largest credit reporting agencies, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. The credit reporting agencies also sell FICO scores to lenders. In 2006, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion introduced their own credit scoring model, known as VantageScore. Fair Isaac sued the three agencies for antitrust violations, but a court later dismissed those allegations. A federal jury later sided with VantageScore that it didn’t violate Fair Isaac’s trademarks or engage in unfair competition. Fair Isaac also sued TransUnion in 2017 for breach of contract, copyright infringement and other allegations. TransUnion countersued Fair Isaac for antitrust violations. A Chicago federal judge ruled last year that TransUnion can move forward with its antitrust allegations. Congress and regulators, meanwhile, have sought to lessen Fair Isaac's grip on the credit score market. In a 2018 law that sought to roll back some of the banking reforms in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Congress ordered the Federal Housing Finance Agency to establish rules and criteria for the credit scoring models used by Fannie and Freddie. A December 2018 proposed rule by FHFA would have effectively prohibited Fannie and Freddie from using VantageScore over concerns about conflicts of interest. But the final rule, issued in August, switched gears and allowed the government-sponsored entities to make use of VantageScore as an alternative to FICO scores. Fair Isaac and VantageScore didn’t immediately return calls and emails for comment sent after business hours Friday. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion also didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",DOJ opens antitrust probe into credit score giant Fair Isaac,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/justice-fair-isaac-antitrust-129204,politico
"President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency to combat the coronavirus — but he could go much further if he wanted.  Federal law gives Trump vast emergency powers in times of pandemic. He could direct the quarantine of people arriving in the United States who exhibit certain symptoms or even if they’re just suspected of having the virus. He could have the federal government detain individuals if their illness might wind up crossing state lines. And under regulations revised and reissued just before Trump entered office, the government can stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease. Some even interpret the statute as meaning a president could deploy the military to cordon off a city or state.  “The federal public health power is pretty awesome … awe-inspiring in its breadth,” said Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University. “But there’s also obviously a lot of danger.” Indeed, it’s an extraordinary palette of options for a president often mocked as enamored of dictatorial authority and who has claimed, “I have the right to do whatever I want, as president.” And many of these powers remain largely undefined, as they have rarely — if ever — been widely used. It’s a troubling concept for those who are pressing Trump to take more urgent action to combat the coronavirus as it infiltrates American cities, but are wary that he will go too far.  “We can’t divorce this from the context of a president who has shown a willingness to abuse emergency power,” said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.  The conflict was on display Friday as Trump declared a national emergency to unlock funding and bypass regulations to accelerate the lagging development of coronavirus testing options. While even some of Trump’s most ardent opponents praised the move, they were anxious about what might come next. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. Fresh discussion of Trump’s power to isolate regions of the U.S. was spurred Thursday by his comments in response to a question about whether he was considering travel restrictions to the states experiencing some of the most widespread infections, such as Washington and California. “We haven’t discussed that yet. Is it a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,” the president said during an Oval Office photo-op with the Irish prime minister. While experts say such measures would be ineffective — diverting resources better devoted to scaling up hospitals and aiding people in dire straits due to other impacts of the virus — they might be legally possible. Under the Public Health Service Act, federal authorities can quarantine individuals arriving in the U.S. by air, land or ship if they are suspected of infection with a list of diseases and syndromes set by executive order. The law also gives federal officials the power to try to check the spread of disease between states, although this authority is almost never used to fight human illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control, however, maintains that its quarantine powers go quite far. Regulations finalized by the Obama administration claim that federal officials can detain individuals if their illness could spread to other states. The rules essentially give the federal government the authority to stop and seize commuters in a bid to halt the spread of contagious disease. Whether it could allow a president to use the military to cordon off a city or a whole state is less clear, but experts say that the statutes and regulations could be read to allow for that. “The ability to restrain interstate travel is something that could be done, but the question is would it be done?” said Jennifer Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “These are the kinds of scenarios that you think would never happen but here we are.” But in this situation, Nuzzo said, it’s too late for that extreme measure. “There would be no public health benefit,” said Nuzzo, who studies government responses to health crises. “Over 40 states are reporting cases. … The horse is out of the barn. The disease is already here.” On Friday, Trump invoked his first significant emergency power since the coronavirus first appeared in January, declaring a national emergency.  In its declaration, the White House cited two laws — the 1988 Stafford Act, a disaster relief law, and the 1976 National Emergencies Act, the law Trump used to divert government funds to build a southern border wall.  For days, though, Trump had balked at exercising the power, even as he faced a chorus of calls from health groups, disaster relief specialists and Democrats to do so. According to people familiar with the situation, Trump had been reluctant to take the step because it could undermine his contention that the coronavirus outbreak is similar to seasonal flu. But he insisted on Thursday that he was more than willing to invoke any of his emergency authorities. “We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act. … And if I need to do something, I'll do it,” he said, adding cryptically, “I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.”  Trump has not previously been bashful about exercising his emergency powers. He was only seven days into his tenure when he issued the hugely controversial travel ban, sharply restricting the flow of people to the U.S. from mostly-Muslim countries. A series of court rulings blocked enforcement of the original ban, prompting the administration to redraft the order several times. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld a substantially pared-back version of the initial order. The policy — which critics called a “Muslim ban” — was based on the same legal authority Trump has since used to exclude foreign travelers from China and, now, from much of Europe, in response to the current virus. Many White House statements about the new virus-related travel restrictions go out of their way to explicitly cite the precise legal authority tapped in both instances, giving the president the power to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” The mentions seem to echo arguments the Justice Department made in the “Muslim ban” case. Lawyers repeatedly warned judges to be wary about restricting the power because it may be needed in a crisis.  Perhaps Trump’s most aggressive executive actions have involved money, namely his moves to spend billions of dollars on construction of a border wall with Mexico despite Congress’s unwillingness to fund that project — a signature of his 2016 campaign — at anywhere near the levels he has sought. Trump’s lawyers have cited powers Congress gave the president to reallocate military construction funds and to tap other funds for counter-drug activities.  Lower courts halted more than $6 billion of the funding, questioning Trump’s claims of an emergency and noting Congress’s rather explicit refusal to fund expansion of the wall. But the Supreme Court stepped in last year to allow Trump to proceed with the spending as litigation continues. Historically, officials at the state and local level have taken the most aggressive measures to address public health emergencies. In 1899 and 1900, officials in Honolulu and San Francisco cordoned off those cities’ Chinatown districts in a bid to control the bubonic plague, a move now viewed as heavily tainted by racism. Authorities in Hawaii even lit one home on fire in order to try to squelch the disease, but in the process burned down much of the neighborhood. Nothing similar has happened yet in the U.S. during the coronavirus outbreak, although governors are increasingly flexing their legal muscle.  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Thursday ordered the closure of all public schools in the state for two weeks. On the same day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued an executive order directing residents to eschew non-essential gatherings of more than 250 people. Newsom also tapped the state’s power to “commandeer” hotels, if needed, as temporary hospitals or quarantine centers.  And In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared a “containment zone” in New Rochelle, N.Y., to combat a virulent cluster of corona cases there. He even called out the national guard to assist with food distribution and other logistics in the city. Trump weighed in on the move at his photo-op Thursday, noting it isn’t a flat-out ban on movement or work. While he called the action “not very strong,” he seemed to welcome the fact that it would give locals the feeling “they’re being watched.” Some of the more severe travel limits the federal government can impose are quietly wielded in individual cases.  The CDC maintains a little publicized “do-not-board” list for domestic and international airline travel. Details on the list are thin, but it has included people with tuberculosis and measles. In 2015, CDC formally declared that individuals could be added to the list if they were suspected simply of being exposed to hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola. Back in 2007, an Atlanta lawyer drew national attention when he flew to Paris to get married and returned to the U.S. while suffering from drug-resistant tuberculosis. Doctors said they told him not to travel, but he insisted they never told him he could be contagious. He was eventually put under a federal quarantine order, but it turned out his disease was not the type most resistant to treatment. Typically, however, federal officials have relied on state and local health departments to address most disease outbreaks, even sometimes asking them to detain individuals who refuse to cooperate with doctors’ recommendations. But Trump has hostile relationships with the Democratic governors of the most affected states — Washington, California and New York. And if he wanted, he could have the CDC step in. Federal regulations give the CDC sweeping powers if a state’s measures “are insufficient” to prevent a disease from spreading into another state. The CDC chief is authorized to do what he or she “deems reasonably necessary” under those circumstances. Whether that includes widespread restrictions on movement is unclear. Parmet, the Northeastern University law professor, stresses that the Constitution still applies. Aggressive federal government action on such vague authority could face legal challenges, especially if the moves don’t have a scientific basis.  On the other hand, in a crisis judges tend to defer to executive authorities, including health officials. “The real danger is that these moves are taken just for show,” Parmet said. “At this point, where we are in the curve of this pandemic, there’s no magical legal elixir.”",What more could he do?

"The head of the U.S. Agency for International Development will leave the job at the end of this month, two people familiar with the move confirmed Friday, marking a high-level departure from one of the agencies tasked with responding to the global coronavirus outbreak.  Former GOP Rep. Mark Green is expected to submit his resignation to President Donald Trump early next week, according to a senior administration official, who said USAID Deputy Administrator Bonnie Glick, a Trump loyalist and former State Department foreign service officer, will take Green’s place as acting head.  Green already informed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, with whom he has worked closely on women’s global development programs, of his decision to step down.  “His plans have been in place for awhile, but he began telling folks last week,” said a person familiar with Green’s departure.  The outgoing USAID chief, who has been with the agency since Aug. 2017, is expected to be named president of the McCain Institute for International Leadership. Green previously served as president of the International Republican Institute, an organization once chaired by the late Arizona Sen. John McCain. The D.C.-based think tank lost its executive director Kurt Volker, who served as Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, amid the fallout from the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry last fall after he stepped down following his appearance as a witness in the probe.  “I believe the recent media focus on my work as U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations risks becoming a distraction from the accomplishments and continued growth of the Institute,” said Volker, who was involved in the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against Ukraine. The McCain Institute could not be reached for comment.  Green’s exit from the agency, which has been at the center of the Trump administration’s efforts to divert Middle East aid to religious minorities in the region, comes weeks after he announced a $37 million commitment to 25 countries that have been affected by COVID-19, which reached pandemic levels this week and has topped 1,000 confirmed cases inside the United States.  Earlier Friday, Trump declared a national emergency that could free up to $50 billion to fight the rapidly spreading virus by boosting containment efforts and the availability of test kits.

"Suspended schedules. Darkened stages. Empty arenas. As the worsening spread of the coronavirus has forced shot callers in sports, entertainment and politics to nix games, parades, conventions, campaign pit stops and gatherings of almost every sort and size, Donald Trump over these past few dizzying days essentially and begrudgingly has made the same decision—even if he hasn’t made an official announcement. After holding more than 300 rallies during the 2016 campaign and nearly 100 more since he was elected—after going last month to Iowa and New Hampshire and Nevada and South Carolina to “troll” Democrats in the runups to the primaries—the president was not in Michigan, Missouri or Mississippi this past week, and he won’t be in Ohio or Illinois or Florida or Arizona ahead of Tuesday’s votes. He has canceled events in Las Vegas, Denver and Milwaukee. And for the first time in a long, long time, Trump has on his typically merry-go-round docket of rallies … nothing. All of a sudden, we live in a world without crowds. And for Trump, it’s an existential threat—as much a threat as a sinking economy or the virus itself. Because Trump doesn’t just love crowds. He needs them. He needs crowds because of their political utility. Needs them to mine “data gold.” Needs them to be rolling, roiling, visceral focus groups—listening to the ebbs and flows of their roars, serving them what they want, scrapping what they don’t, stoking support with a skilled evangelist’s call and response. He is, after all, at his best and most effective riffing to the rank and file as opposed to monotonously reciting from a teleprompter all alone in the solemnity of the Oval Office. And he needs crowds, too, and perhaps most importantly, on account of psychological necessity. “They are his lifeline,” Bandy Lee, a Yale University psychiatrist and the editor of The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, told me this week. “He’s very good at this,” she said, referring to the catalog of his performances at his rallies, “because his life depends on it, not just the life of his presidency but the life of his psyche.” In the estimation of Lee and other experts of her ilk, as well as the many people who have known him and worked with him for years, the way Trump is ties back to the way he was raised. The “complete emptiness inside,” the “bottomless void” that “can never be filled,” the “psychological defects” and “pathologically narcissistic traits”—all of this, says Lee, is a result of the core particulars of Trump’s upbringing: his distant and demanding father, the disruptive near-death experience of his mother when he was just a toddler, his banishment to military school when he was barely a teenager. “The lack of love translates into desiring accolades,” Lee explained. “And the rallies are really the most critical crutches that he’s had. He needs his followers more than his followers need him.” Trump biographer Gwenda Blair calls “a live audience” his “oxygen machine.” “The crowds,” former Trump casino executive Jack O’Donnell told me the other day, “get him through the night.” And it’s always been like this. Starting in the 1970s and ‘80s, the foundationally lonely Trump cultivated transactional relationships with reporters and gossip columnists, in the same manner as his mentor, Roy Cohn. At times, he used a fake name to do his own PR. He decorated the walls of his office with magazine covers bearing images of his own face. In Atlantic City, at his casinos, he jaunted across gaming floors, feasting on the clamor of the throngs. “They cheered him,” recalled Alan Marcus, a former Trump publicist. “In front of a big crowd, and a big crowd could’ve been 25 people or 25,000 people, he can shine. Because he’s got that Trump persona. The Trump persona takes over the room.” By the middle of the aughts, when the success of “The Apprentice” erased the stain of his personal failures and business busts of the ’90s, he obsessed about the reality show’s ratings. “Ratings,” said Marcus, “are crowds.” And Trump’s political ascent? Implausible to the point of impossible without crowds. In the couple years before 2015, on the precampaign campaign trail, at off-year cattle calls of would-be candidates, Trump tested out talking points. “He would put forth his position or his feelings, and he would judge the level of response,” the late political strategist Pat Caddell once told me. He monitored not internal polling but Twitter mentions and tallies of retweets. He gauged what sizzled on conservative talk radio so he could channel it back. At his campaign kickoff at Trump Tower, when he glided down the escalator to say that he was running, the crowd was so important he paid some people to be there. The next month, he drew approximately 4,000 people to a rally in Phoenix. A month after that, the crowd was roughly five times that size in Mobile, Alabama, where he had his plane circle the stadium to a standing ovation and the wild-eyed appeal of his candidacy became hard to ignore. “Trump’s campaign,” Roger Stone would write, “was centered around a ‘set piece rally.’” At one of them, in New Hampshire, he told the people he had lots of friends, and rich friends, but who no longer would be his friends if and when he got elected. “You know who my friends are?” he said. “You’re my friends.” The crowd. Their cheers. And ever since, all the way up to his last rally, in Charlotte, on the second night of this month, Trump has engaged in an almost hypnotic version of the same, over and over again, using every one of his signature events to draw red-capped crowds, and to talk about the size of the crowds—whether or not, of course, the specifics are true—seldom missing a chance to employ the crowds and their counts as an ongoing contrast to cudgel his Democratic opponents. “An integral, main part of the campaign,” Trump’s campaign spokesman has said. “The driving force,” according to the campaign’s COO. But as America shuts down, as Broadway goes dark and Disney World goes dormant and March Madness goes poof, Trump at the moment has been stripped of arguably his most potent political strength. Entering a new, utterly altered reality, mere weeks after he traveled to India to revel in the adoration of a crowd of 110,000, Trump sat in the White House at a desk called Resolute and appeared out of his element and underprepared—while Joe Biden, his presumptive opponent in the general election, stood the next afternoon in front of a bank of American flags in a hotel in Delaware and spoke to mostly just clicking cameras and seemed not frail or poorly supported but serious and up to the task. Biden’s (small) crowds and Trump’s (large) crowds hardly matter because now there are no crowds at all. “Rallies are important to the Trump campaign, and I’d worry about losing them,” former Trump aide Michael Caputo said, “because it would tilt a bit to Biden’s advantage.” Another former Trump aide pushed back on the premise. “It’s very early in the presidential cycle,” Sam Nunberg told me. “He’s still going to be able to hold rallies eventually, calling the guy ‘Sleepy Joe’ and making fun of him … one way or the other.” Nunberg stressed that Trump still has television and Twitter, platforms on which he has an irrefutable record of mastery of a certain sort, and that his flush campaign is a Facebook juggernaut, too, and that he always has possessed a blithe capacity for surviving crises and skirting consequence. All valid points. He made a prediction. “Trump will end up doing rallies,” Nunberg said. “Pandemic or not, Trump will end up doing rallies.” “What are your plans, Mr. President,” a reporter asked him on Thursday, “about campaign rallies?” “I think the Democrats won’t be having rallies, but nobody shows up to their rallies, anyway,” Trump said. “So, what difference does it make?” “But what about you, sir?” “My rallies are very big,” he said. “On the rallies, we’ll make that decision,” he continued. “But at this moment, we don’t have …” He stopped himself—as if he couldn’t quite bring himself to say it out loud. “I was going to Las Vegas. … I was going to Colorado …” He fantasized about a rally in Tampa on March 25 that reportedly was being planned but had not been publicly announced. That didn’t prevent him from dropping highly dubious details. “All sold out,” Trump said. “We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think we’ll probably not do it because people would say it’s better to not do.” No more rallies. No more crowds. “It’s like, if Don Rickles performed to a room of three people, would he have been funny? You know, insult comics, they need the energy of the discomfort they create for the jokes to work, for the act to work,” Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio told me this week. “It’s very bad for Trump to not have crowds. And I think he knows it.”",What Is Trump Without His Crowds?,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-crowds-129048,politico
"OTTAWA — Over five extraordinary hours on Friday, Canada’s federal government suspended Parliament, delayed its federal budget, imposed new restrictions on international travel and promised a major fiscal stimulus package, while the Bank of Canada slashed interest rates as the country collectively braces for the impact of coronavirus. The announcements rolled out, one after another, while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remained in isolation at his home in Ottawa, dealing with the fallout of a global pandemic that has turned personal — his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Thursday, though her symptoms are mild. Trudeau has no symptoms of the virus, which has so far infected 157 people in Canada and caused one death. Speaking from outside his home at Rideau Cottage, Trudeau assured Canadians the government will take any measures necessary to slow the spread of the disease and to cushion them against its economic impacts. “We do not want any Canadians to have to worry about whether or not they’re going to be able to pay their rent,” he said. “We need to make sure that Canadians have the options and the ability to follow the best public health advice and keep themselves safe.” Friday’s announcements mark a dramatic escalation in the government’s response since the World Health Organization labeled the coronavirus a pandemic two days ago, and a stark change in tone — on Thursday evening, Finance Minister Bill Morneau was still saying the budget would be tabled on March 30, as planned. But on Friday morning at 10 a.m., all five of Canada’s major political parties agreed to a motion to adjourn the House of Commons until April 20, in response to the spread of Covid-19. The suspension could be extended if necessary. Parliament has also passed spending-related bills that will allow the government to keep cash flowing while the House of Commons and Senate aren’t sitting. “We will face this together, and we will get through this together,” Government House Leader Pablo Rodríguez told reporters. The parties have agreed to a process to allow Parliament to be recalled over the coming weeks, if needed, with a skeleton crew of members present — likely those who live within driving distance. Before Parliament shut down, MPs and senators rushed to pass the USMCA, which received royal assent on Friday afternoon, making Canada the last country to endorse the new North American free trade pact. A few procedural steps remain before Canada formally ratifies the deal, and it will be several more months before it goes into force. President Donald Trump said Friday that Trudeau told him during a phone call the day before that Canada was on the cusp of approving the trade deal. The all-party motion on Friday also delayed the federal budget, previously scheduled for March 30. Morneau did not say when the budget might now be introduced, or whether that could happen before April 20. The budget, however, has suddenly become an afterthought as Morneau turns his attention to the far more urgent task of keeping the economy afloat. In an exceptional act of coordination Friday, Morneau held a rare joint press conference with Stephen Poloz, governor of the politically independent Bank of Canada, to introduce emergency measures in an attempt to buttress the economy before it suffers significant damage. Poloz made the biggest splash by introducing an unscheduled interest rate cut of half a percentage point — his second 50-basis-point reduction in nine days — to cushion the economy from the effects of coronavirus and battered crude prices. The governor left the door open to do more, if necessary. Morneau also provided a boost of C$10 billion in available credit for businesses through two business development agencies. Jeremy Rudin, the superintendent of financial institutions, joined them to announce changes that will effectively add more than C$300 billion in lending capacity for major banks. Morneau promised that more help is on the way. Ottawa will unveil a ""significant"" fiscal stimulus package next week, he said, including direct support for individuals. The new measures will come on top of a C$1 billion support package the government unveiled on Wednesday, which included money for provincial health care systems. The finance minister said another volley of economic support could come out of a phone call scheduled for Monday between Trudeau and his fellow G-7 leaders. He added the G-7 is looking for a coordinated approach. Ottawa is also taking new steps to limit the spread of Covid-19 to Canada from beyond its borders. Transport Minister Marc Garneau said international flights arriving in Canada will be restricted to a smaller number of airports to allow for screening of all passengers. The list of airports has not yet been released. Garneau also said all cruise ships carrying more than 500 people, including crew, will not be allowed to dock in Canada before July 1. Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said Canadians should postpone or cancel international travel, and should practice social distancing, including by avoiding crowded places, waving or touching elbows instead of shaking hands and staying two meters away from other people. She warned that anyone who travels internationally will be subject to any new rules suddenly imposed in those countries. “Your one-week trip may become much longer,” she said. However, as of yet there seems to be little discussion of any possible closures along the Canada-U.S. border. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said conversations with U.S. counterparts on Thursday highlighted “how important that border is for both of our countries,” while Trump told reporters the border had not come up during his conversation with Trudeau. “I think what we have to remember is that viruses don't know borders,” Health Minister Patty Hajdu said. “A border is not going to contain the virus.” The new measures come less than 24 hours after Trudeau’s wife tested positive for Covid-19 after returning from a trip to the U.K. and exhibiting mild, flu-like symptoms. Grégoire Trudeau is currently in quarantine, and the prime minister and their three children will remain in isolation for 14 days. Trudeau has no symptoms and therefore has not been tested for the virus. Other parliamentarians, including International Trade Minister Mary Ng and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, are also in self-isolation after experiencing symptoms, though they have not been diagnosed with the virus. Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan had also shown symptoms, but tested negative for coronavirus on Friday. The federal government’s new approach to the coronavirus comes in the wake of tighter restrictions imposed by a number of provinces during the past 48 hours. All four of Canada’s largest provinces have now recommended canceling events with more than 250 people or have banned them outright, and Quebec and Ontario have both closed schools for at least two weeks. Trudeau spoke with provincial and territorial premiers on Friday afternoon, but at least one premier has already made clear he believes Ottawa isn’t doing enough. In a news conference before the call, Quebec Premier François Legault called on Trudeau to ""rapidly limit the entry of visitors to Canada."" On Parliament Hill in Ottawa, the announcements came in a rush, landing in a city that has only seen a few cases of the virus so far, and where there’s a sense that the storm must be coming but somehow isn’t quite real. Just before noon, ministers and public health officials clustered together on a stage in the National Press Theatre, telling Canadians to stand two meters apart and not to gather in large groups. A large group of journalists faced them, sitting side-by-side, passing around a couple of microphones that got a quick wipe-down between each question. And then, a few hours later, everything was quiet on the Hill, except for the strange vestiges of business-as-usual that hadn’t yet ground to a halt. At 3 p.m., two small groups of tourists were being led through the galleries overlooking the empty House of Commons, one numbering just three people. They were among the last visitors to be allowed in, before the building closes to the public. Two floors below, the House of Commons cafeteria was shutting down for the day and staff were getting ready to leave. They didn’t know when they’d be back.

"President Donald Trump on Friday deflected blame for his administration’s lagging ability to test Americans for the coronavirus outbreak, insisting instead — without offering evidence — that fault lies with his predecessor, Barack Obama. “I don't take responsibility at all,” Trump said defiantly, pointing to an unspecified “set of circumstances” and “rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.”  The remarks from the president came in response to questions at a Friday press conference about the lack of widespread access to testing, an aspect of his administration's coronavirus response that has been the subject of widespread, steady criticism. Administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the U.S. tested about 11,000 people during the first seven weeks of the outbreak — roughly as many as South Korea is testing each day.  And Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee on Thursday that “the system is not really geared to what we need right now” in and called the testing system “a failing.”  But Trump, who spent weeks downplaying coronavirus before declaring it a national emergency on Friday, argued that the health care system was not designed for an outbreak on the scale of coronavirus, “with the kind of numbers that we are talking about.”  The president kept his criticism lighter and more forward-looking at first, declaring that his administration is “leaving a very indelible print in the future in case something like this happens again.”  “That's not the fault of anybody — and frankly the old system worked very well for smaller numbers, much smaller numbers but not for these kind of numbers,” he added. But then Fauci stepped up to the mic to clarify his position, arguing that the CDC’s testing system, “for what it was designed for, it worked very well,” and maintaining that an “embrace” of the private sector was necessary for testing at the kind of scale needed for the fast-spreading coronavirus.  Then, Trump began pointing fingers.  “If you go back — please, if you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. they didn't do testing like this,” he interjected, referencing the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that sickened more than 60 million people between April 2009 and 2010. Trump asserted that the Obama administration “didn’t do testing” and that when “they started thinking about testing,” it was “far too late.” He reiterated a claim made on Twitter earlier in the day, calling the Obama administration’s response to the swine flu outbreak “a very big failure,” though the H1N1's fatality rate of .02 percent is much lower than the lowest fatality estimates for the coronavirus thus far.  Trump later got testy with another reporter who pressed him on whether he bore any responsibility for the surge in cases, noting that he’d disbanded the White House’s pandemic office. Trump told the reporter, PBS NewsHour's Yamiche Alcindor — with whom he's butted heads with in the past — that her inquiry was a “nasty question.”  After noting that his administration had quickly acted to restrict travel from China, where the coronavirus outbreak originated, the president said he personally was not responsible for dissolving the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which had been part of the National Security Council until his administration disbanded it and rolled its officials into another office. “And when you say me, I didn't do it. We have a group of people. I could ask — perhaps in my administration — but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don't know anything about it.” Trump said. “You say we did that. I don't know anything about it.” He continued: “I don't know, CDC, perhaps they do that — let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. You know, things like that happen.” Trump then began to move on, before returning to defend his administration’s response.  “We are doing a great job,” he insisted, referencing the health officials and business executives gathered behind him. “Let me tell you, these professionals behind me and these great incredible doctors and business people — the best in the world — and I can say that whether it's retailers or labs or anything you want to say. These are the best in the world.”  He also pointed to the number of fatalities in the U.S. attributed to the virus, which has hit 40 in the several weeks since the first reported case in the U.S., and is significantly lower than other countries hit hardest by the disease.  “Compare that with other countries that are many, many times that amount,” Trump said. “One of the reasons we have 40 and others have and, again, that number is going up just so you understand.” Trump’s criticism of the Obama administration on Friday wasn’t limited to its response to its own pandemic. At another point in the press conference, Trump appeared to work in a shot at healthcare.gov, the website created by the Obama administration for the rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges that was infamously marred by connectivity issues almost instantly when it debuted. Announcing that Google had offered to assist the White House in the creation of a website to better help Americans determine whether they needed to be tested for coronavirus and where to get tested if so, Trump quipped that the tech “is helping to develop a website that will be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past.”",'I don't take responsibility at all': Trump deflects blame for coronavirus testing fumble ,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-coronavirus-testing-128971,politico

"President Donald Trump's emergency declaration on the coronavirus aims to jump-start a lagging federal response by expanding testing, giving hospitals more capacity to deal with a potential flood of new patients and expanding telehealth, so patients in hot spots can be treated virtually. It reflected a growing acknowledgment of the scope of the public health crisis, with Trump himself saying at a Rose Garden rollout of the plan that he will ""most likely"" get tested, without committing to share the results. At the same time, Trump rejected blame for any shortcomings in a testing system that critics say has contributed to community spread of the respiratory disease, saying “I don’t take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.” The various policy moves left many questions unanswered, among them whether a website Trump said Google is developing to screen and test patients could compromise their privacy. Here are some key features: The president said the administration is working with pharmacies and other retailers to make drive-thru testing available ""at critical locations."" And he announced a series of partnerships with private labs to boost testing capacity just one day after top federal infectious disease official Anthony Fauci told House lawmakers that the federal government’s current testing system had been a “failing.” The president said there would be another 1.4 million tests available by next week and 5 million within the months, adding, “I doubt we’ll need anywhere near that.” Public health experts would disagree: Multiple tests are often used on one person, and while federal officials have been hesitant to project case numbers, Fauci himself warned lawmakers that a complacent mitigation response could boost case numbers to the “many, many millions.” Administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that 11,000 Americans had been tested. The FDA approved the first high-volume coronavirus test today. The president also appeared to oversell an effort by an affiliate of Google to help develop a website that will aid the administration’s efforts to screen and test for people with the virus. Trump suggested a sweeping effort, saying Google had 1,700 engineers working on the project and had made ""tremendous progress"" — and that the site will be able ""to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. ... We have many, many locations.""  But Verily, the life-sciences arm of Google's parent company Alphabet, later said in a statement that the website is in ""the early stages of development"" and would be initially tested in the Bay Area, ""with the hope of expanding more broadly over time."" Vice President Mike Pence said the administration by Sunday evening will ""be able to give specific guidance"" on when the website will be available.  The announcement instantly raised red flags for patient privacy groups, which have pushed for greater scrutiny of Google’s use of health data. “It sounds like @Google just figured out how to get the personal health data of every single American,” tweeted Kyle Plotkin, chief of staff for Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), after Trump made the announcement. Trump outlined emergency measures hospitals can take under the declaration, most of which would free up beds for a potential surge in coronavirus patients. “Critical access” hospitals that are limited to 25 beds and get higher Medicare rates can boost their capacity and extend patient stays now limited to 96 hours. The order lifts rules for where hospitals can treat patients within their facilities and lets them add doctors as needed. The hospital industry supports these steps and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to release more detailed guidance later Friday that could expand on Trump’s list. The declaration lets HHS Secretary Alex Azar waive certain laws to expand the use of telehealth, which public health experts say can help reduce risk of transmission. The new order appears to let Azar waive federal licensing requirements so out-of-state doctors can treat patients virtually in states with the greatest need. The $8.3 billion coronavirus emergency funding package Trump signed last week also allows Azar to waive restrictions on Medicare payment for telehealth, as Congress has typically done for past emergencies. Telehealth groups and lawmakers, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the committee overseeing Medicare, have encouraged Azar to activate that authority. Trump in his Rose Garden remarks called telehealth a “fairly new and incredible thing,"" though health care providers have used the technology for over a decade.

"Even as he declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, President Donald Trump couldn't help but shake hands. “I want to encourage everyone to follow the guidelines we have issued by CDC and these common sense measures,” Trump told reporters at a Rose Garden press conference with top health officials and healthcare, retail and pharmacy CEOs. “A lot of it is common sense.”  The CDC’s website says to “avoid touching high-touch surfaces in public places — elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, handshaking with people.” But as Trump introduced CEOs and members of his coronavirus taskforce, he couldn’t resist extending his hand.  First, he grabbed the mic and adjusted it for Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.  He later reached out to Walmart CEO Doug McMillion, who looked down at the president’s hand before grabbing it to shake.  Trump shook hands with three others before Bruce Greenstein, executive vice president of the LHC Group, put a stop to the hand shaking. Greenstein instead offered an elbow bump to the president.  “I like that,” Trump said, after elbow-bumping. “That’s good.”  Trump, who indicated Friday that he had not been tested but ""most likely"" would be, has been exposed to people with the illness. While Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro has disputed a media report that he initially tested positive for the virus less than a week after meeting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, his press secretary, who took photos with Trump, tested positive for coronavirus this week.  Aside from his meeting with Bolsonaro in Florida, Trump has also been exposed to multiple Republican lawmakers who have self-quarantined after their own exposure to someone who tested positive for coronavirus at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump said he had not experienced any symptoms of the disease, but was consulting with his doctors on whether, and when, to get tested.  ""I think I will do it anyway,"" the president said, though he did not commit to sharing the results of a possible test. ""We are working out a schedule.""",Trump can't resist handshakes as he declares a coronavirus national emergency,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-cant-resist-handshakes-as-he-declares-a-coronavirus-national-emergency-128950,politico
"The full bench of the powerful D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to weigh in on two legal fights critical to President Donald Trump: whether the House can use the courts to enforce a subpoena for testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn, and whether the House can sue to block Trump's effort to fund border wall construction over Congressional objections. The Friday afternoon announcement wiped out a major victory Trump scored last month when a smaller panel of the same court ruled, 2-1, that the courts should not wade into subpoena fights between Congress and the White House. The appeals court said it will hear arguments, en banc, April 28 in both the McGahn and border wall disputes. There seems to be little chance that the Supreme Court will resolve the issues definitively before the November election, but rulings in the House's favor could lead the justices to intervene with a stay in the coming months. Prospects for Trump prevailing in the cases at the D.C. Circuit look grim. While the active bench of that court leans toward Democratic appointees by a 7-4 margin, the order Friday indicated that both of Trump's nominees--Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao--have recused themselves from both cases.  As a result, the en banc court for McGahn will have only two Republican appointees. One additional GOP appointee, Judge David Sentelle, will join the en banc court considering the border wall funding dispute, the order said. The renewed debate at the D.C. Circuit over critical separation-of-powers issues is set to play out about a month after the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on a trio of cases involving demands for access to Trump's personal financial records.  Two of those cases involve subpoenas from House committees. The third was triggered by a subpoena that a local grand jury in New York City issued for Trump's tax and business records. A decision from the Supreme Court in those cases is expected by the end of June. The majority opinion the D.C. Circuit issued last month in the McGahn case said the courts should butt out of subpoena fights between Congress and the executive branch because intervening would effectively shut down the usual process of negotiation between the branches and instead send both sides running to court.  Judge Thomas Griffith, an appointee of President George W. Bush, also said blessing the subpoena was likely to trigger endless eddies of litigation over individual questions lawmakers wanted to ask McGahn in connection with their investigation into alleged efforts by Trump to obstruct Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. However, House lawyers pleaded with the full D.C. Circuit to rehear the case, arguing that bowing out of such fights actually amounts to siding with the White House, since it typically has considerable leverage over testimony and records lawmakers want. House Counsel Douglas Letter also warned that trying to foreclose subpoena litigation could lead to more unpleasant conflicts, like efforts by the House to arrest uncooperative witnesses. The Justice Department contended that McGahn, as a close presidential adviser, was absolutely immune from subpoena. Griffith didn't endorse that position. Judge Karen Henderson, who was on the panel and will be the only other GOP appointee on the en banc court, rejected the absolute immunity argument, but concurred with Griffith that courts shouldn't referee such fights. The only dissenter last month was Judge Judith Rogers, an appointee of President Bill Clinton. She said the court was gutting the House's impeachment powers by refusing to enforce the subpoena. The other appeal stems from the House's unsuccessful effort to challenge the plan Trump' announced in 2019 to use over $6 billion from military construction and counterdrug budgets to fund border wall construction even though Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for barrier projects and put strict limits on that money. The move, backed in part by a presidential emergency declaration, spurred a flurry of lawsuits from environmental and human rights groups, states, border residents, and the House itself. All said Trump's actions violated the power of the purse granted to Congress by the Constitution. The House's lawsuit, filed in Washington, found no traction. Last June, U.S. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden tossed it out, finding that Congress had no standing to sue Trump administration officials over allegedly unauthorized spending.  The House appealed that ruling, setting in motion arguments that took place before a three-judge D.C. Circuit panel last month and now scheduled to be reprised before the larger, 10-judge court in April.  No decision was rendered by the three-judge panel before Friday's order taking the border wall case en banc. The order said the issue of the House's standing is ""common"" to that case and the dispute over McGahn's testimony. Other suits aimed at blocking Trump's unusual border wall funding plan found greater purchase in the federal courts. Groups suing in California managed to get an injunction against construction, as did by El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights in a suit brought in Texas. However, those victories proved to be short lived, as the Supreme Court blocked the injunction out of California and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the one in Texas. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.","Full appeals court to hear McGahn, border wall cases",2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/appeals-court-don-mcgahn-border-wall-cases-128914,politico
"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders acknowledged Friday that the novel coronavirus public health crisis had ""radically"" altered the nature of his White House bid ahead a slate of crucial primaries. The remarks from the Vermont senator came after a roughly 15-minute speech he delivered from his hometown of Burlington, where he discussed the “lessons” Americans could learn from the coronavirus and argued that its rapid spread demonstrated the need for his “Medicare for All” policy proposal. But following his brief address, Sanders was pressed by reporters on what the brutal political realities of the pandemic meant for his campaign. “That’s why I’m here today,” he said with a wink and a smile, before turning somber. “You’re right, it has significantly impacted our campaign, as all of you know,” Sanders said, describing his “love” for the massive rallies and more intimate town hall meetings his campaign has begun canceling in the wake of the burgeoning outbreak.  “That is changing, as you’ve indicated correctly,” he said. “Our staff is now, by and large, working at home. So it has radically changed our campaign.”  Leading up to the next four nominating contests Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, Sanders indicated that he would be relying increasingly on the various digital resources of his campaign apparatus in his primary battle against former Vice President Joe Biden.  “What I think we have going for us — which we have always had going for us, but we’re going to have to utilize even more — is our internet capabilities,” Sanders said. He cited his “many, many, many millions” of followers on Twitter and other online platforms, as well as his campaign’s ability to livestream events like his speech Thursday.  “We are in the process of thinking this through,” he added. “But this coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way that we do. And that’s hurting.” Sanders was also asked about his goals moving forward in the primary campaign, and whether the worsening coronavirus threat had forced him to rethink his role in the race given the calls he has already faced from some senior Democrats to concede the nomination to Biden. “Well my long-term goal is to win. The short-term goal is to figure out how we deal with the issues that you guys are appropriately raising,” Sanders replied, conceding that “under normal circumstances, I would not be in Burlington today.”  “I would be probably in Ohio, Florida or another state where a primary is coming up. But we can’t do — we’ve decided not to do under the advice of public health officials, not to do rallies, and that’s the right decision,” he continued. “So we are figuring out a way as to how we can best communicate with people, which will certainly be in a very strong way utilizing our social media capabilities.”",Sanders: Coronavirus has 'radically changed our campaign',2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/bernie-sanders-campaign-coronavirus-128767,politico
"Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both acknowledged discussing potential aid from Washington to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, amid a crisis in air travel unlike anything the industry has seen since Sept. 11, 2001. Delta also announced it is cutting 40 percent of its flight capacity, the steepest in its history. The news comes two days after President Donald Trump announced a monthlong halt to U.S.-bound passengers from most of Europe, a stoppage that in one blow decimated many of the industry’s most lucrative international routes. “We are in discussions with the White House and Congress regarding the support they can provide to help us through this period,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees obtained by POLITICO. ""I’m optimistic we will receive their support."" A spokesperson for American Airlines also said Friday that the carrier was involved in early discussions with the government. Airlines have been struggling financially for weeks because of a steep slump in passenger demand as the global pandemic has spread. But Trump’s European travel restrictions pushed them even further into crisis. (Trump said Friday that he may expand the restrictions to include people coming from the United Kingdom.) ""The speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we’ve seen,"" Bastian wrote, noting that bookings are net negative— meaning canceled bookings are more than new bookings — at Delta. ""We’re currently seeing more cancellations than new bookings over the next month,"" added. On Thursday, an administration official told POLITICO that ""Congress really will have little choice to act or face a significant extinction moment for the airline industry."" Trump's economic aides have been studying how the President George W. Bush administration propped up the airline industry after 9/11. Bastian warned in his memo, though, that the ""form and value"" of help from the government is unpredictable. ""We can’t put our company’s future at risk waiting on aid from our government.""

"President Donald Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump stayed home from work at the White House on Friday as a precaution after meeting with an Australian official who has coronavirus.  “The White House is aware that [Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton] tested positive for COVID-19. He was asymptomatic during the interaction,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. ""Exposures from the case were assessed and the White House Medical Unit confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that Ivanka is exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine. She worked from home today out of an abundance of caution until guidance was given.” Last week Ivanka, Attorney General William Barr and Trump aides including Kellyanne Conway met with Dutton in Washington for a meeting about online child exploitation. In a statement released on Friday on Twitter, Dutton said he “woke up with a temperature and sore throat” and confirmed he has the coronavirus.  “I immediately contacted the Queensland Department of Health and was subsequently tested for COVID-19. I was advised by Queensland Health this afternoon that the test had returned positive,” Dutton said in a statement.  In a photo posted on Twitter by the Australian Embassy in the U.S., Dutton is seen standing next to Ivanka and the other officials. Barr also stayed at home on Friday, according to Department of Justice spokesperson Kerri Kupec, who said he is “feeling great and not showing any symptoms” and has consulted with the CDC. “CDC is not recommending he be tested at this point,” Kupec said.  Ivanka and Barr are the latest people close to the president who have potentially been exposed to the virus and have stayed home as a precaution. Republicans close to the president -- Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rep. Matt Getz of Florida, Rep. Doug Collins of Florida, and incoming Chief of Staff Mark Meadows – all self-quarantined after being exposed to a person with the virus at CPAC.   Trump was in contact last weekend with at least two people who have now tested positive for COVID-19 after a meeting with Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro at his home and sanctuary in Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago. One of Bolsonaro’s aides, communications secretary Fabio Wajngarten, and the Mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, were both at Mar-a-Lago and said they have the virus, although they are reportedly doing well.   Despite the close encounters, the White House has not signaled that the president has been tested for the virus, which has now infected over 1,000 people in the United States and has spread to almost every corner of the world.   Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the lead experts on Trump’s coronavirus task force, said on MSNBC Friday that “yes,” someone who has been exposed to a person with the virus should isolate themselves and find a test, but would not speak directly about the president’s situation.  “You know, I leave that to the president’s physician,” Fauci said. “They have very good White House physician and physician staff there, so when you have a situation of a patient doctor relationship, the advice for that should come from the White House physician.”",Ivanka Trump stayed home from White House after exposure to person with coronavirus ,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/ivanka-trump-coronavirus-exposure-128721,politico
"At 73 years old, President Donald Trump is a prime target for a contagious disease that falls hard on the elderly. Multiple people in the Trump orbit are infected. Trump posed for a picture alongside an aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro who has tested positive. (Bolsonaro, who is in the same picture, denies reports that he’s positive.) The president spoke at the CPAC conference earlier this month where, as was later reported, an attendee carrying a gold-plated VIP ticket was later diagnosed as virus-positive. Other attendees of the conference, including incoming chief of staff Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), and Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) exercised medical caution with self-quarantine. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.),who was at Mar-a-Lago at the same time as the Brazilian visitors, is also self-quarantining. And both Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump recently spent time with an Australian minister who subsequently tested positive. It’s almost as if the virus has circled Trump. At this point, it’s not morbid, just good planning, to say the administration has no excuse not to start making plans for the chance that the virus might incapacitate Trump. The White House has not exactly been transparent about whether Trump has been tested. But his age and his clinical obesity mean that his system would be fighting an infection from a trench: It can put older patients on ventilators, sometimes for four weeks, even if they do recover. The Constitution has a provision for this, of course: The 25th Amendment allows an orderly transfer of power if the president can’t execute his duties. The obstacle to such a smooth transition isn’t the system: It’s Trump. Trump himself never admits weakness. As a businessman and a leader, he resists looking too far ahead, and is known for simply dodging and weaving to keep bad news at bay—a quality that has already served him badly in handling the biggest crisis of his presidency. As for the people around him: He hand-picks his staff for personal loyalty over any particular principles, and replaces them when they fail to exhibit the blind allegiance he desires. The 25th Amendment has been invoked only a few times, always voluntarily by presidents themselves when they’ve undergone surgery. If it’s hard to imagine Trump himself ceding power for any reason, it’s even harder to imagine the amendment’s powerful Section 4 being invoked, transferring power from the president without his consent. It requires consensus of the people close to him—specifically, “the vice president and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide.” The idea that Pence and the Trump Cabinet would automatically step in and unseat their boss should Trump contract the virus—and, say, be hospitalized without handing over the reins—cannot be assumed. Even if they did get together and agree to hand Pence control, it is Trump, and no one else, who has groomed and cultivated the political base that would likely flip out and scream “coup” the moment it happened. The 25th Amendment has already come up in Trump’s presidency. It received heavy review and inspection in the early semesters of Donald Trump’s term when top White House aides fretted that the chief executive might have only one oar in the water. Trump’s erratic, impulsive, unstable ways—his firing of FBI Director James B. Comey; his divulging of classified information to Russian diplomats in the Oval Office; his request for “loyalty” from Comey, in particular—reportedly prompted discussions about using the 1967 amendment to replace him with Vice President Mike Pence. But just because Trump, Pence and the Cabinet might not do the right thing doesn’t mean we shouldn’t secure a promise from them that an orderly transition of power is being sketched out should serious illness strike the president. To prevent a destabilizing vacancy in the most powerful office in the world, Trump must volunteer that he will use the 25th Amendment to turn over the powers of the presidency to Pence if he becomes seriously ill. Under the amendment, he can retrieve these powers by simply writing a letter expressing that he has regained sufficient health to serve as president. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush used the amendment to temporarily delegate presidential powers during medical incidents during their terms. Trump must also encourage Pence to exercise a transition of power should he become gravely ill.  Invoking the 25th Amendment is nowhere near staging a coup, as Trump ultraloyalists might holler.

"President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday to offset lagging coronavirus testing and unlock billions of dollars — accelerating a response plan that has faced weeks of criticism. Trump touted partnerships with private companies that he claimed would allow patients to learn if they need to be tested and locate a testing site, some of which will be drive-thru facilities at big box retailers across the country. “To unleash the full power of the federal government under this effort today, I'm officially declaring a national emergency,” he said at an announcement in the Rose Garden. “Two very big words.” Trump insisted the move would eradicate the testing shortcomings that health experts say hindered the country’s ability to contain the virus when it first appeared on American shores. In recent days, Trump’s health officials have warned Americans to expect the situation to worsen, spurring much of the country’s public spaces to shutter — professional sports have been suspended, concert halls are closed until further notice and many Americans have been asked to self-isolate. Yet even as Trump unleashed $50 billion in government funding, the announcement had a distinct market-first flavor. Trump outlined a series of agreements with private companies, including Google, Target and Walmart, to facilitate swifter coronavirus testing for Americans. Target and Walmart said they will set aside parking lot space for testing sites, while Google pledged to set up a website to determine whether a person needs a test, and where one is available. “Very soon, Americans will be able to go to these drive-in sites,” said Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump put in charge of the administration’s coronavirus task force. Trump said he expected 1.4 million additional tests to be available next week and 5 million within a month — even as he cautioned against everyone rushing to get tested. “We don’t want everybody taking this test,” he said. “It’s totally unnecessary.” Trump has faced condemnation over the administration's failure to provide adequate testing and resources for the coronavirus, which has killed more than 5,000 people worldwide and infected tens of thousands. Health specialists have also reprimanded Trump for repeatedly downplaying what has now been deemed a global pandemic. “I don’t take responsibility at all,” Trump said of the government’s struggles to produce enough tests, blaming existing rules set by prior administration for limiting his options. “We were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.” And he claimed to not know that a pandemic preparedness team within the National Security Council was scrapped in 2018. Trump called a question about it “nasty” at a news conference.  “I didn’t do it,” he said. Still, Trump's executive actions on Friday received a positive response on Wall Street and even among Democrats. A faltering stock market swiftly rebounded as Trump was speaking, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring nearly 2,000 points, or more than 9 percent, the largest percentage gain since the 2008 crisis. The comeback reversed nearly all of Thursday’s tumble, which was the worst since the 1987 market crash. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y,), who had urged Trump to act more forcefully, offered rare praise for the president but warned him not to go too far. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” he said in a statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) offered no comment. In addition to his executive actions, Trump has pressed Congress for an economic stimulus package that could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars. Late Friday, Pelosi announced that she had clinched a deal with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a package meant to provide paid leave for workers, expand food aid and support widespread testing for the illness at no cost to patients. Only hours earlier, Trump had said during his press conference that he did not yet support the latest version of the bill.  “We just don't think they're giving enough,” he said. “We don't think the Democrats are giving enough.” Friday's national emergency declaration was considerably different than one the White House earlier this week had signaled was being prepared. A White House aide involved in the coronavirus response told POLITICO on Wednesday that Trump would sign a limited emergency declaration that only addressed the faltering economy by unleashing billions of dollars for loans to small businesses and to cover missed paychecks for hourly workers. But Democrats and many health care industry leaders were pressuring Trump to declare a more expansive emergency to help hard-hit states build mobile hospitals and shelters, while assisting with public safety and other issues.  White House documents referenced both the Stafford Act, which is designed to activate the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Emergencies Act, the same law he invoked last year to repurpose government funds for construction of a southern border. But the president only said his order would increase the powers of the Department of Health and Human Services, the lead agency thus far in the administration's coronavirus response. Under Friday's order, HHS will be able to waive certain Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program requirements in an effort to bypass time-consuming regulations. Separately, Trump said the federal government will waive interest on federal student loans and would purchase additional crude oil for the nation’s reserves. “This will pass,” he said. “This will pass through. We're going to be even stronger for it. We learned a lot, a tremendous amount has been learned.” Previously, Trump had been reluctant to declare a more sweeping national emergency, fearful of stoking panic with such a dramatic step. But his thinking evolved as the American coronavirus caseload soared past 1,600 this week, with public health officials warning the country to expect a spike in the coming days. For weeks, Trump has tried to reassure Americans that the widening outbreak is under control. But the situation has escalated in recent days. The stock market has dropped in record numbers not seen since the 2008 recession, and much of the country — from Disney World to professional sports leagues, museums and concert halls — has shut down. Across the U.S., the coronavirus has now killed more than 40 people and health officials have warned that the situation will worsen. Trump made another attempt to calm Wall Street during a brief prime-time Oval Office address on Wednesday. But he instead caused more confusion when he misrepresented the contours of a 30-day ban on foreign visitors from Europe and misstated that insurance companies had promised to fully pay for people’s coronavirus treatment. Friday's declaration builds on a previous, agency-specific ""public health emergency"" declaration HHS made in January. The move unlocked some initial federal money and resources. But Friday’s two designations are much broader. Still, some disaster management experts were disappointed that Trump on Friday did not appear to task FEMA — the agency that oversees hurricane, tornado and flood response — with leading the government’s coronavirus response plan. “FEMA has an important role in coordinating the larger response to the crisis,” said Tim Manning, a former FEMA deputy administrator. “If there's an emergency, FEMA needs to be involved. I’m not sure how it could be done mechanically or legally without FEMA.” FEMA has previously helped with government responses to other insidious dangerous outbreaks, including SARS, MERS and Ebola. While previous presidents have made emergency declarations “virus threat” disasters — Bill Clinton did it for West Nile virus under the Stafford Act — it is rare, former FEMA officials say.",Trump declares national emergency in latest bid to combat coronavirus,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/coronavirus-emergency-declaration-trump-128530,politico
"Asia’s richest man announced his intention on Friday to ship 500,000 testing kits and 1 million masks to the U.S. in an effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic.  Jack Ma’s charitable foundation and his China-based company's foundation, the Alibaba Foundation, have also sourced and donated supplies to other countries being hit by the virus, including Japan, Korea, Italy, Iran and Spain.  The donation comes amid testing delays across the U.S. as state officials scramble amid a shortage of lab materials — sparking concerns that health officials are undercounting the number of Americans with the virus.  “Drawing from my own country’s experience, speedy and accurate testing and adequate personal protective equipment for medical professionals are most effective in preventing the spread of the virus,” the statement said. “We hope that our donation can help Americans fight against the pandemic!” Ma’s announcement also comes as Trump aides and allies cast blame on China, with some officials calling it “the Wuhan virus” — a reference to the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the disease. National security adviser Robert O’Brien has accused China of covering up a health crisis, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has labeled the outbreak the “Wuhan coronavirus.”  “The crisis presents a huge challenge to all humankind in a globalized world. The pandemic we face today can no longer be resolved by any individual country,” Ma said in the statement. “Rather, we need to combat the virus by working hand-in-hand. At this moment, we can’t beat this virus unless we eliminate boundaries to resources and share our know-how and hard-earned lessons.”","Chinese businessman to donate 500,000 test kits and 1 million masks to the U.S. ",2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/jack-ma-coronavirus-test-kits-128522,politico
"Louisiana will postpone its presidential primary, which was originally scheduled for April 4, as part of the state government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. The state is the first in the nation to postpone a primary since the outbreak of the virus. Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced the contest will be delayed until June 20.  “Safe and secure elections also mean safety to the people of Louisiana,” Ardoin said at a press conference. Several states are voting before Louisiana, including four holding primaries on Tuesday: Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. But officials in those states indicated that Election Day will go on as planned. “Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,” a joint statement from Arizona Secretary of State Kathy Hobbs, Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee, Illinois Elections Board Chairman Charles Scholz and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose read. The Wyoming Democratic Party, which is holding its caucuses on April 4, also canceled the in-person portion of their upcoming vote. “Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe. Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy, so this is the responsible course of action,"" the state party wrote in a statement. “Voters are highly encouraged to vote by mail; as of now, voters may still vote via ballot pickup and drop off on March 28 and April 4. We will continue to work with public health officials, and assess local conditions, to ensure voters’ health and safety.” Louisiana moving its primary could cause a major headache for the state for the Democratic National Convention. As written, the national party’s delegate selection rules mandate that states hold their nominating contests by June or face delegate penalties. ""We will continue to work with every state party as they adjust their delegate selection plans around coronavirus,” a Democratic National Committee spokesperson said in a statement. “This change would violate our rule on timing which provides that all states hold their contests by June 9th. Any violation of our rules could result in a penalty that would include a state losing at least half of its delegates. This change will be reviewed by the Rules and Bylaws Committee."" State election officials around the country have been scrambling to make adjustments ahead of their primaries, including moving polling places away from locations concentrated with high-risk individuals, like nursing homes. The top election official in Arizona's Maricopa County, where just under 60 percent of the state's registered Democrats live, announced that his office would mail ballots to ""traditional Election Day voters"" eligible to vote in Tuesday's Democratic primary but who do not normally get absentee ballots mailed to them. Voters are encouraged to not mail the ballots back. Instead, officials say mailing out ballots before Election Day will allow voters to drop off already filled-out ballots in an effort to limit interactions and promote social distancing. Ohio, which is holding its primary on Tuesday, is moving nearly 150 polling places. Similar measures have been taken by some municipalities in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, which will also vote that day. “We’re seeing that this public health moment presents challenges for elections officials,” Kristen Clarke, the president & executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said. “And its having a cascading effect … By next week, on Tuesday, we’ll see coronavirus having an even broader impact on how elections are playing out.” Aaron M. Sellers, a spokesperson for the Franklin County Board of Elections in Ohio, said he started receiving panicked calls over the weekend from directors of elder care facilities.  “They want to limit residents’ exposure to visitors because that’s such a vulnerable population,” he said in an interview with POLITICO.  The Centers for Disease Control recently issued guidance targeted to election officials that urges states and counties to encourage mail-in voting and early voting as much as possible, in an effort to “minimize direct contact with other people and reduce crowd size at polling stations.” The CDC also urged poll workers to routinely clean and disinfect polling stations, “limit nonessential visitors” and encourage as much social distancing as possible. Election administrators and party officials in most states have also been pushing voters to take advantage of early and mail voting, when possible. However, laws regulating voting in any other way other than in person, on Election Day, vary wildly by state. “Staffing [flexibility], more utilization of mail ballots, being concerned about infection, providing disinfectant, all of these things are ideas that supervisors of elections are trying to implement,” Ion Sancho, a former longtime supervisor of elections in Leon County, Fla., said. “And at the last second, this is not going to be simple. This is not going to be easy. But we're going to get through it.” But the last-minute changes present significant challenges as well. In Ohio, Sellers said his county was not able to find replacement polling sites on such short notice, and will instead consolidate with neighboring precincts.  “It’s incredibly difficult to find good locations that are ADA-compliant and have ample parking on such short notice, plus they have to want us to be there,” he said.  Election administrators are also grappling with another coronavirus-related challenge: a dependence on elderly poll workers. “We’re getting people calling us who are apprehensive, saying, ‘Hey I just don’t feel comfortable working the polls,’” Sellers said. “So we’re finding additional people to chip in.”",Louisiana postpones primary as states scramble to adjust to coronavirus,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/louisiana-postpones-presidential-primary-due-to-coronavirus-128514,politico
"The leader of a libertarian-leaning tech group is stepping down as its president after tweeting that it would be “poetic justice” if President Donald Trump died from the coronavirus, the group confirmed Friday. Berin Szóka, president of Washington-based think tank TechFreedom, will be taking an indefinite sabbatical to write a book on tech policy, as first reported by POLITICO earlier Friday. Shane Tews, a longtime member of the group's board, will lead the organization in his stead.  The move deals a blow to one of the tech industry’s staunchest defenders in Washington, where Szóka has served as its combative and outspoken leader for nearly a decade. Szóka and TechFreedom, which receives funding from at least one tech giant, Google, have been relentless allies of Silicon Valley, particularly as it has faced calls for increased regulation in Washington in recent years. The group has opposed efforts to create more stringent rules for privacy and online speech, among other issues. But Szóka has also been a frequent critic of the president, delivering at times scathing rebukes of his actions on social media. The planned shake-up comes just four days after Szóka prompted a firestorm of criticism online by suggesting that the president succumbing to the virus would be fitting. “Serious question: could there possibly [sic] any greater poetic justice in the universe than for Trump to die of the #CPACvirus?” Szóka tweeted late Monday. Recent reports that an attendee at the Conservative Political Action Conference was later diagnosed with Covid-19 sparked fears that the president may have been exposed to the virus. Reps. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had contact with the president as well before entering self-quarantine due to possible exposure. The Szóka tweet immediately drew condemnations online, racking up hundreds of negative replies within minutes and some calls for his resignation. Szóka later deleted the tweet, and has since issued an apology. “Earlier this week, I sent a thoughtless tweet making an inappropriate comment about the President that I deeply regret,” he tweeted Thursday. “I was wrong to tweet it and deleted it. Again, I apologize.”",Tech think tank chief to step down after Trump death tweet,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/think-tank-chief-to-step-down-after-trump-death-tweet-128397,politico
"In the early hours of Friday, U.S. and British aircraft conducted multiple airstrikes on the missile storage sites of the Iraqi militia group Kataib Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian group that was also hit by unclaimed airstrikes in Syria the day before. Until Wednesday, when a rocket attack killed two Americans and one British service member on a sprawling base north of Baghdad, there hadn’t been much noise from Tehran since its reprisal in early January after the U.S. killed Qassem Soleimani. This week’s attack, which was meticulously planned and clearly not the work of the ramshackle remnants of the Islamic State, changed that. A truck with two rows of rocket-launching tubes discreetly installed in the flatbed, approached the base undetected and fired the rockets in one sudden salvo.  As someone who has gotten lost while walking around the maze of concrete barriers that make up the 15-square-mile Camp Taji base, I can attest to the great accuracy of the strike. Taji is massive, and the strike hit at just the right moment and just the right spot, probably guided by a drone or human agent.  The next day, Kataib Hezbollah (KH), the Iraqi Shiite militia closest to Iran, praised the attack as an act of the pro-Iranian “resistance” against U.S. “occupation”, a surefire sign that pro-Iranian militias were behind the strike and the Shiite militia version of “humble bragging.” By that stage, either U.S. or Israeli aircraft had already struck back at KH and other Shiite militias, albeit just over the border in Syria late on Wednesday, killing around two dozen fighters and wounding many more. The strikes, and the subsequent round launched very early Friday morning, were reminiscent of the United States’ retaliatory attacks in late December on KH after the militia group caused the last U.S. death in Iraq in a rocket attack on December 27.  Friday morning’s strikes may not be the end in a new tit-for-tat cycle that has the potential to spark a wider conflict. Iran is escalating through its Iraqi militias because it wants to raise pressure to evict U.S. forces from Iraq and to threaten Iraqi leaders ahead of next week’s selection of a replacement for resigned Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdal-Mahdi. As U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said on Thursday: “You don't get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it.” But how can deterrence be established quickly to end the cycle of attacks and prevent further loss of American lives? The deaths of two U.S. personnel—one military, one contractor—at Taji comes days after the March 8 deaths of two U.S. Marine special forces operators in a firefight with the Islamic State in northern Iraq. The two episodes underline the complexity of what the U.S. military is attempting to do in today’s Iraq. The mission of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR, or the coalition, for short) is still to defeat the last remnants of the Islamic State. In recent weeks, the coalition has ramped up its special forces raiding alongside Iraqi commandos, achieving significant successes against Islamic State leadership targets. When the U.S. gets on a roll, triggering new raids on the basis of data from laptops and phones recovered in each prior raid, terrorists face the most unrelenting foe in the world. But boosted effectiveness comes at a cost of added risk, as the March 8 deaths illustrate. To complicate matters, Iran-backed militias like KH are seeking to lever the U.S.-backed coalition out of Iraq by any means necessary, regardless of the coalition’s contribution to the anti-Islamic State struggle. Militias like KH sought the removal of international forces long before they killed an American on December 27, before they themselves were struck on December 29, and before their patriarchs, Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia chieftain Aby Mahdi al-Muhandis, were killed by the U.S. on January 3 in a Baghdad drone strike. Now the militias are doubling their efforts, including issuing warnings to Iraqi officials and soldiers to distance themselves from the coalition (which they did not). In recent months, KH has threatened Iraqi MPs to vote to remove U.S. forces (enough of them resisted this call to prevent a vote with quorum) and threatened Iraq’s president Barham Salih if he met with President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum (he met Trump anyway).  Now KH is also issuing statements vetoing certain candidates for Iraq’s imminent selection of a new prime minister, suggesting which candidate should be picked (current premier Adel Abdal-Mahdi), and explicitly suggesting how the country’s most senior religious leaders should rule on the matter.  This is all unprecedented territory in Iraq, particularly the openness of the threats, similar to Iran’s recent elections where the regime blocked over 7,000 candidates for Parliament and invalidated a third of sitting MPs from seeking reelection.  The U.S. has clearly not yet deterred the militias from killing Americans and the result is that U.S. forces in Iraq are not being protected by either the Iraqi government or, ultimately, by our own government. This is not a sustainable situation. What can change? Last night’s strikes on KH missile and rocket bases were an attempt to take the high road, but the lack of large secondary explosions suggests that KH had evacuated its valuable weapons long before the strike. Iran’s militia proxies in Iraq can trade empty buildings or even two dozen of their own rank and file for three Anglo-American fatalities all day, every day. This a game we will lose. The right approach probably lies somewhere between the high and low roads, with very prompt, decisive and unclaimed attacks demonstrated against some senior Iraqi militia leaders in order to make others think very seriously about their personal future. But high-value leadership targets — which Iran and the militias do value — are generally not available to hit the day after Americans are killed: they are keeping their heads down. Congress and the administration need to sit privately and agree to some ground rules for the use of military force that allow the U.S. military to delink the timing of deterrent strikes, so that we can strike the right targets when they become available, to deter militia attacks that are highly likely to come otherwise. In parallel, the U.S. should toughen its mindset, quietly bringing the force protection assets into Iraq that it needs (i.e., Patriot missiles and anti-rocket close-in defenses) without further consultation with an Iraqi government that would rather adopt a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach.  And finally, the U.S. should let the militias keep over-reaching, keep showing their hand as would-be dictators under Iran’s control, while the U.S.-led coalition keeps helping Iraq to defeat the Islamic State. This is a game we can win.",How the U.S. Can Stop the Surge of Deadly Rocket Attacks in Iraq,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/13/iraq-airstrikes-shiite-militias-islamic-state-128210,politico
"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued Friday that the coronavirus pandemic presents ""a great investment opportunity,"" insisting that global markets spooked by the public health crisis will rebound eventually. ""This is a short-term issue. It may be a couple of months, but we're going to get through this, and the economy will be stronger than ever,"" Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview. ""You know, I look back at people who bought stocks after the crash in 1987, people who bought stocks after the financial crisis,"" he continued. ""For long-term investors, this will be a great investment opportunity."" Despite the secretary's optimism, international anxiety over the coronavirus has provoked a historically negative reaction in recent days from Wall Street, alarmed at least in part by President Donald Trump's management of the mushrooming outbreak.  Following the president's prime-time address to the nation Wednesday evening, during which he announced a 30-day ban on foreign visitors from most of Europe, panicked investors triggered a marketwide trading halt for the second time this week and only the third time in history.  But Trump asserted Thursday that drastic measures to protect American lives justified any potential economic downturn and offered rosy predictions of a market recovery.  ""It's taken a big hit, but it's going to all bounce back, and it's going to bounce back very big at the right time,"" he told reporters at the White House. Mnuchin's remarks Friday echoed a similar assessment made last week by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who urged investors to capitalize on the faltering stock market amid coronavirus fears.

"The White House is holding up the nomination for one of the Pentagon’s top intelligence jobs because the official is not considered sufficiently loyal to the president, according to three current and former administration officials. Kathryn Wheelbarger, who has been serving as acting assistant secretary of Defense for international security affairs since November 2018, would become the deputy undersecretary of Defense for intelligence if the nomination moves forward. But the holdup comes as President Donald Trump continues a post-impeachment loyalty purge that has already felled two senior Pentagon officials in recent weeks. The post that Wheelbarger would fill is one of 21 senior positions at the Pentagon that are empty or filled on a temporary basis, a record high for the Trump administration. Lawmakers have raised concerns in recent weeks that the department doesn't have enough qualified people in place to tackle the nation's biggest national security problems as it faces a host of crises, from the spread of the coronavirus to a new spike in tensions with Iran. The White House announced its intent to nominate Wheelbarger for the No. 2 position at the Pentagon overseeing military intelligence on Feb. 13, but it has not yet submitted her paperwork to the Senate, a spokesperson for the Senate Armed Services Committee confirmed. By contrast, William Gillis, who the president announced would be nominated for assistant secretary of Defense for sustainment on the same day, had his confirmation hearing on Tuesday. Wheelbarger, through a Pentagon spokesperson, referred comment to the White House, which declined to comment. In her current acting role, Wheelbarger has been the Pentagon’s point person on a host of issues, from the conflict in Syria to relations with NATO. On Tuesday, she testified alongside U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Frank McKenzie and U.S. Africa Command head Gen. Stephen Townsend on the U.S. peace agreement with Afghanistan, terrorist threats in West Africa and more. In particular, Wheelbarger has been “instrumental and a driving force behind the president’s efforts to seek 2 percent defense funding from NATO allies,” one administration official told POLITICO. “She hammered that message repeatedly.” But the White House is not satisfied that Wheelbarger is sufficiently loyal to the administration, the three current and former officials said. The people pointed to Wheelbarger’s two years spent working for the late Sen. John McCain, who feuded publicly with Trump before his death in 2019, as the root of the current tension. But the administration official said the White House is wrong about Wheelbarger, noting that she has worked for Trump for 50 percent longer than she did for McCain. Wheelbarger also declined to testify before Congress during the impeachment inquiry, the official said, explaining that she and her lawyer convinced congressional staff that she would not be able to provide additional information for the case. This is not the first time the White House has intervened on Pentagon personnel issues. The Trump administration demanded the ouster of John Rood, then-undersecretary of Defense for policy, in February, and has since rejected several of Defense Secretary Mark Esper’s choices to replace him. The White House personnel office, which is led by Trump loyalist John McEntee, put forth its own candidate to replace Rood: Elbridge Colby, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of Defense and is one of the primary authors of the National Defense Strategy. The White House also recently withdrew the nomination of Elaine McCusker to be Pentagon comptroller after emails emerged showing her questioning the administration’s suspension of military aid to Ukraine, an issue at the heart of the impeachment. “Unless you are here to support him personally, he’d rather have gaps,” said one former administration official.",White House holding up DoD nomination amid Trump loyalty purge,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/defense-nomination-trump-loyalty-128244,politico

"President Donald Trump on Friday said that he would eliminate the interest on federal student loans ""until further notice"" as part of a package of emergency executive actions designed to address the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. “To help our students and their families, I’ve waived interest on all student loans held by federal government agencies and that will be until further notice,” Trump said during a Rose Garden address where he declared a national emergency. “That’s a big thing for a lot of students that are left in the middle right now. Many of those schools have been closed.” The unprecedented move will provide relief to the more than 42 million Americans who owe more than $1.5 trillion in outstanding federal student loans. But it did not go as far as what some Democrats had proposed, which was a suspension of monthly loan payments or loan forgiveness. The department was considering instructing loan servicers to lower the interest rate on federal loans to zero percent, according to individuals familiar with the plan. Under that approach, a borrower's monthly payment amount would not automatically change, though any payments the borrower did make would likely pay down a greater share of the principal balance. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ""is proud to work with the President in taking decisive action to help students and parents during this national emergency,"" department spokesperson Liz Hill said in a statement. The new policy will be implemented by the Education Department, which was scrambling on Friday to issue instructions and guidance to the companies it hires to manage the monthly payments of borrowers. A department official said that the interest waiver would be automatically applied to all borrowers, effective Friday, even though it may take some another week to fully ""operationalize"" the policy. It's not clear how much money the interest waiver will save borrowers, but it could be billions of dollars, depending on how long the Trump administration keeps the policy in place. In fiscal 2019 alone, the Education Department reported that it charged more than $100 billion in interest on all federal student loans. Federal student loans already offer options for borrowers to defer payments under certain circumstances, including an economic hardship, though interest can continue to accrue. Trump's suspension of interest payments, combined with those existing benefits, could mean that some Americans would be able to put their student loans on hold interest-free. Democrats and consumer advocacy groups who have long pushed for sweeping student debt relief from the federal government have said in recent days that the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the need to provide assistance to Americans struggling with monthly loan payments. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a tweet that Trump's action was ""not enough"" to help student loan borrowers. ""Donald Trump & @BetsyDeVosED need to cancel student loans, not just waive interest or suspend payments,"" she said. ""Suspending payments or interest just delays the pain."" However, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) tweeted that it was a ""good step"" and that ""With so much uncertainty in the economy, we need to continue to look at every available means of providing relief."" Senate Democrats earlier this week included a six-month moratorium on some federal student loan payments on their list of items they’d like to see in an economic rescue legislative package. The National Consumer Law Center, which represents low-income student loan borrowers, has also called for a moratorium on student loan payments. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that pausing student loan payments was among the ""list of 50 different items"" that Trump's advisers planned to present to him to shore up the economy and financial markets due to the coronavirus pandemic. “That’ll be something we’re looking at,” Mnuchin said during an interivew on CNBC. “We have lots of authorities,” Mnuchin said, adding that on “things where we don’t have authorities, we’re going to work with both the House and Senate on a bipartisan basis. I can assure you the president is all about action, action, action.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has called for sweeping student loan forgiveness, tweeted earlier in the day that she was ""thankful"" that the Trump administration was ""taking pausing student loan payments seriously."" She called it ""a decisive move that will help stabilize millions of people. We should do it now. There is much more to be done, but every step counts."" The Education Department on Friday was still determining the mechanics of how to carry out Trump's announcement. The department has decided that the policy will automatically apply to all borrowers with federal direct loans, federally held Family Federal Education Loans and federally held Perkins Loans, according to a department official. Borrowers whose loans are in income-based repayment or in forbearance will still qualify. ""This will be operationalized over the next week or so, and it will be retroactive back to today,"" the official said. Borrowers could potentially seek a recalculation of their monthly payment under income-driven repayment plans or some would qualify for forbearance options, which would now be a way to put their student loans on hold interest-free. Much of the implementation will fall to the nine companies that the Education Department hires to collect and manage the payments of federal student loan borrowers. “Servicers and the Department have already begun discussions on how to implement this response to the current situation and we look forward to being able to provide more information to borrowers very shortly,” said Scott Buchanan, the president of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, the trade association that represents the companies. “Servicers will be updating websites in the coming days with information as soon as it becomes available.”",Trump to waive interest on federal student loans 'until further notice',2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-administration-student-loan-payments-suspension-128181,politico
"The House passed sweeping legislation Saturday to respond to the coronavirus outbreak battering the nation, an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote to expand access to free testing, provide $1 billion in food aid and extend sick leave benefits to vulnerable Americans. The bill's bipartisan passage, 363-40, was virtually assured when President Donald Trump backed the measure — largely hammered out by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — and urged Republicans to support the bill. Trump's tweet, just before 9 p.m., capped several days of whiplash as Democrats and the White House appeared, at times, inches from a deal only to see it yanked away amid technical disputes and inconsistent signals from the president. Trump's backing, though, was essential to ensure support from congressional Republicans for the multi-billion dollar plan.  Democrats put the bill on the floor shortly after midnight under an expedited process and passed it in the early hours of Saturday morning, sending it to the Senate, which is expected to take it up as early as Monday.  The bill is the product of a painstaking effort by Pelosi to pass a measure with bipartisan support rather than a doomed Democrat-only bill that the Senate would have immediately spiked.  ""[W]e thought it would be important to show the American people, assure the American people, that we are willing and able to work together to get a job done for them,"" Pelosi said. ""So we thank our Republicans — those who will be supporting the bill. We appreciate the president joining us with his tweet."" Pelosi said the final bill came together slowly because of a laborious review process in the executive branch, which required approvals from multiple agencies and officials. Pelosi praised Mnuchin for his cooperation, and she acknowledged she never directly spoke with Trump about the bill. ""There was no need for that,"" she said. Alongside Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he expected House committees to be working through next week's recess on a new bill meant to address the economic damage wrought by coronavirus, which has devastated the airline, hospitality and entertainment industries. For now, though, Democrats said they were pleased to pass a bipartisan plan that they expect to pass overwhelmingly in the House and move through the Senate by Monday. ""I think this was a very good sign of bipartisanship and working together, that we can overcome this virus. We’ve done much bigger things before,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Friday night, minutes after the deal was announced.  On Saturday morning, Trump tweeted: ""Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see!"" Trump's approval came after a hard-fought — and chaotic — day of negotiations, with Democrats and Republicans alike unsure whether the president was on board with the proposal. For several hours before Trump's tweet, talks had devolved into a state of confusion, with key officials on both sides directly contradicting each other on whether a deal exists. ""Because it was essential for us to have legislation pass the House by this weekend, it required intense and constant negotiations for what could have been an elusive agreement,"" Pelosi said in a letter to fellow Democrats after 10 p.m. on Friday, thanking them for their patience amid the frenetic back-and-forth with the administration. Pelosi had announced to her members shortly after 6 p.m. that she had reached a deal. But House Republicans — and even Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat — had said talks were still ongoing and a deal had not yet been reached. Key Republicans cautioned that there were still lingering issues related to a tax credit for paid family sick leave. McCarthy later confirmed that Republicans sought more flexibility for small business owners who would be forced to offer paid leave to affected workers.  Adding to the confusion, Mnuchin surprised even members of his own party by announcing on Fox Business that he had reached an agreement with Pelosi. The Treasury secretary had huddled with Trump just minutes before — a meeting that delayed his appearance on the network for so long that Mnuchin ran out of time to speak before the program ended. Trump eventually tweeted his support hours later, delivering long-awaited relief to hundreds of members and aides who had spent 48 hours in limbo awaiting any updates about the status of the funding package. ""I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening,"" Trump tweeted. ""I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt. I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!"" One of the other major obstacles involved the president's personal demand for a payroll tax cut in this package. That idea has little support on Capitol Hill, and Democrats have already said it would be debated as part of future coronavirus crisis-related legislation at a later date. McCarthy, who met with Trump and Mnuchin multiple times in the last 24 hours, confirmed that Trump had sought the last-minute addition, and said Republicans would push for it in Congress's next tranche of economic relief, which could come later this month or in April. ""I believe this will not be the only one,"" McCarthy said, alluding to future aid packages related to the outbreak. ""This is something that the president wants, we would have liked to have that as well. I think that would have taken a little more time."" Mnuchin earlier in the talks had also expressed concerns that a tax credit to offset the cost of Democratic-proposed sick leave provisions wouldn't work as advertised.  During Trump's White House press conference to announce a national emergency declaration on Friday afternoon, the president complained, ""We don't think the Democrats are giving enough,"" even as Capitol Hill Republicans had been framing the differences as largely technical. Pelosi and Mnuchin then got on the phone again to try to finalize an agreement. The last remaining issues came down to how businesses can receive a tax credit for providing paid sick days and emergency leave for workers who are suffering from the coronavirus or helping take care of family members who contract the disease.  Pelosi and Mnuchin exchanged at least 20 phone calls on Thursday and Friday as they tried to hammer out a proposal that Trump could support.  Both Republicans and Democrats in the House insisted that they would not leave Washington until they could approve the massive package, which would work to both stem the outbreak by offering free testing and offering paid time off, while shoring up support systems for low-income workers, including school lunch meals and unemployment insurance. The legislation includes 14 paid sick days for employees, as well as three months of paid emergency leave throughout the coronavirus crisis. Employers will be reimbursed for some of these costs through tax credits. At GOP insistence, the emergency leave provision will expire in a year. And Republicans were able to insert language exempting smaller businesses from the requirements. The legislation helps provide free food for children whose schools are closed during the crisis, as well as other initiatives to make sure seniors and food banks get help as well. One of the biggest provisions involves free testing — which has been one of the major shortcomings in the U.S. response to the outbreak so far. ""This legislation is about testing, testing, testing,"" Pelosi said in a letter to her colleagues announcing the agreement. ""To stop the spread of the virus, we have secured free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured. We cannot fight coronavirus effectively unless everyone in our country who needs to be tested can get their test free of charge."" The House plans to go into recess for a week. That break, though, may be extended if the coronavirus crisis worsens. Hoyer, who sets the floor schedule, has said Democrats and Republicans are taking the situation day by day and consulting with medical experts and Capitol safety officials. The package comes amid a sense of deep unease on Capitol Hill with both the growing outbreak and the chaotic way that negotiations were led. Several House Democrats expressed complaints about the process, including Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who wrote on Twitter: ""We have ~46% of the House awaiting the @potus to tweet support before they’ll vote, and 100% of the House afforded an hour or so to read and consider one of the most important measures on which we’ll ever vote. It’s not how good governance should work, even during a pandemic."" Pelosi acknowledged that the negotiations were not ideal, suggesting that future legislation would be drafted and approved in a different fashion. ""As we proceed with further legislation, we will do so happily under a different timetable and continue to welcome any suggestions you have,"" Pelosi wrote in her Friday night letter to colleagues. The anxiety has also been compounded by the growing numbers of lawmakers and aides who are intentionally isolating themselves after potential exposure to the virus. A staffer for Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) has tested positive for coronavirus, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced Friday morning that he would be extending his self quarantine until March 17 “out of an abundance of caution.” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told POLITICO he is consulting with doctors on what he should do after news came out that a Spanish right wing politician, Santiago Abascal, he met with on March 2 tested positive for the coronavirus. He said he’s sure he shook Abscal’s hand but added he “feels fine.” He’s currently staying home and has canceled all events in his home state.  A spokesman for Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), who also met with Abascal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what Smith is doing.  More than 1,400 people in the U.S. have been infected, though many health experts fear that number is dramatically undercounted given the lack of availability of testing.

"The U.S. is shoring up its defenses in the Middle East after tit-for-tat attacks between the U.S. military and an Iran-backed Shia militia group stoked new tensions in the region this week, the top U.S. general in the region announced Friday. Following the Wednesday rocket attack on Camp Taji, Iraq, that killed U.S. and British service members and a retaliatory U.S. and British airstrike on five locations in Iraq on Thursday, the U.S. military will continue to operate two aircraft carrier strike groups in the region, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the USS Harry S. Truman, Gen. Frank McKenzie told reporters at the Pentagon Friday. This is the first period of extended dual U.S. carrier operations in the Middle East since 2012, he said. McKenzie stressed the symbolic significance of keeping two U.S. carriers in the region, noting that the vessel ""is a floating piece of American sovereignty."" ""We know the Iranians watch them very closely,"" he said. In addition, the U.S. is moving Patriot missile defense systems, which are designed to defend against cruise and ballistic missiles of the type used by Iran, into Iraq. They may be joined by more weapon systems for countering rockets, artillery and mortars, known as C-RAM, McKenzie said. C-RAM is designed to knock down lower-altitude weapons such as the 107mm Katyusha rockets fired at Camp Taji on Wednesday, but they ""are not a panacea,"" he cautioned. Roughly 90,000 U.S. forces are operating in the area overseen by U.S. Central Command, including the Middle East and Afghanistan, up from the 80,000 that were there before the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. airstrike in January. The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported that some of these troops had begun to head home after several months without a significant attack; it is not yet clear if this reduction will continue. McKenzie declined to directly blame Iran for the attack, but noted that Kataib Hezbollah, the Shia militia group that launched the rocket barrage on Wednesday, is ""closely linked"" to Tehran. Kataib Hezbollah has been involved in 12 rocket attacks against coalition forces in the last six months, including a December attack on Kirkuk that killed an American contractor and led to a series of escalations that brought Washington and Tehran to the brink of war. The U.S. and British airstrikes launched on Thursday successfully hit and destroyed all five targets, all of which were Kataib Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, McKenzie said, noting that he expects minimal collateral damage. ""We believe that this is going to have an effect on deterring future strikes of this nature,"" McKenzie said.

"As Americans brace for the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the U.S., once-booming industries are already suffering from deadly symptoms of an economic downturn.  Consumers, after panic-buying, are expected to hunker down and limit their spending. Sporting events, concerts and other entertainment are now suspended. Businesses are canceling travel and conferences. Airlines and trains are slashing schedules.  The sudden and precipitous shutdowns across the economy are forcing the Trump administration and lawmakers to contemplate which industries need targeted rescues — to keep them from collapsing entirely — and which can get by with broader support for struggling workers across the nation. While lawmakers consider an immediate aid package for workers hashed out by Democratic leaders and the White House, Trump and his aides have been meeting with business leaders and industry groups to design an aid package — through tax relief and emergency loans — for the corporate sector. Core to their challenge: Everyone can’t get special help, so the government must pick winners and losers from a downturn — with a focus on industries whose collapse could ripple through the system most. It’s a debate that will accelerate in the coming days as the economic consequences of the crisis become clearer. Airlines were the first industry that came to mind for Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank.  While strong employment insurance systems and social safety net programs will take care of workers, he said it’s important to think about “what industries have a spillover value to the rest of the economy.”  “I think of transport — whether it’s trains or trucks or airplanes. You want to look at those and where there’s distress that you can help, you want to go in and do that because it spills over to every part of the economy,” said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “I don’t think the same case can be made for restaurants and hotels. I care about the workers and employees, but you know when you build restaurants and invest in hotels, you take business risk. And this will be a bad year for them.”  President Donald Trump has already vowed to help both the cruise line industry and the airline industry, and in a White House sit-down with top health insurance executives, said his administration is already “working very closely” with both.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers this week that the administration was considering loan guarantees and other measures to aid the airline industry amid the pandemic.  “I want to be clear: This is not bailouts. We are not looking for bailouts,” he said. Mnuchin added, “There may be specific industries that are highly impacted by travel that have issues with lending” — and “I would assume the airlines would be on the top of the list,” as well as hotels and cruise lines.  Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said industry-focused measures aren’t the solution, yet.  Instead, he said the administration should focus on people and workers to attack the crisis. “If we don’t do much to respond to it, I think it’s very likely to cause a recession,” Bivens said. If the administration does move to bail out industries such as airlines, Bivens said it should be done through loans — leaving direct fiscal aid for individuals.  “It’s really bad to have a recession, and so doing things that will actually be effective is attractive,” Bivens said. “And I think aid to people and individuals is just more effective, and behind closed doors, their own economic experts will tell them that. And I think in the case of direct cash payments to people and households, how can that not be good politics as well?”  Bivens continued, “I feel like there are some incentives pushing it potentially in the right direction on this stuff, but I think a lot of aid to industries is going to be attempted to be attached to this as well.”  Here’s a look at some of the key industries experiencing the most pain in the early stages of the crisis:  Airlines Flights are being canceled across the board as vacationers halt trips and businesses slash travel. As airlines brace for the downturn, some are comparing the impact to the aftermath of 9/11. The International Air Transport Association says the global industry could lose upwards of $113 billion in 2020. And with another travel ban, this time for foreign travelers coming from Europe, airline stocks plummeted and some companies announced temporary employee layoffs to protect themselves from insolvency. Cruise lines Social distancing does not work on giant cruise ships — especially after passengers were stranded on virus-ridden boats. Carnival stopped voyages on its Princess Cruise lines for two months and cruise ship operator Viking halted operations until May 1, actions that will hit employees and devastate the companies‘ bottom lines.  After the Trump administration pushed for a temporary cruise ship shutdown, the president tweeted late Friday: “At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry — it will be kept that way!” Sports and entertainment  The sports entertainment industry has shut down as lucrative tournaments and sports seasons like March Madness, NBA, MLB and others have been canceled or put on hold. Hundreds of thousands of workers, including vendors, referees and other staff members work events across the country in addition to the athletes.  Other key entertainment industries like film, music and theme parks will be slammed as America shuts down. From Disney World to music festivals, the entertainment industry and its workers will be among those taking the hardest hit as Americans hunker down in their homes.  Hotels Hotel operators have projected major losses as travel plans are canceled across the nation and around the world. With postponed or canceled events, hotels will suffer from fewer overnight visitors. And with a slower pace of bookings, workers will feel the pain as well as companies cut their payrolls.  Restaurants Restaurants across the country are struggling to respond to the fast-paced spread of coronavirus. Bars and restaurants in hot spots like New York and Washington have had to adjust to new state orders for social distancing and lower customer traffic, forcing some to close their doors entirely for the time being — leaving employees without work.  Manufacturing  Coronavirus has disrupted the supply chains for nearly three-quarters of U.S. companies, setting up many for lower annual revenue projections, according to a survey by the leading group for purchasing managers. Companies ranging from retail to technology are sure to feel the losses because of delays in key goods from China, the world’s hub for manufacturing, as the virus kept workers there at home. Energy   Oil and natural gas producers were hit by plummeting oil prices amid the outbreak. A price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia drove oil prices this week to their steepest intraday tumble in nearly 30 years, and numerous U.S. shale companie — already in deep debt — could be pushed out of business if the collapse becomes a prolonged crisis. While a bailout for the industry seems unlikely, Trump gave oil prices a small lift on Friday when he announced that the U.S. would buy additional oil for the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we're going to fill it up,” Trump said. “This is a good time to fill it up.”",Who gets saved and who collapses?,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-industry-stimulus-129216,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is widely thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",Two senators take extreme measures to show allegiance to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"Joe Biden has long complained about the crowded debate stage and a restrictive format that doesn’t allow enough time for candidates to speak. Now, in his one-on-one debate Sunday with Bernie Sanders, he finally gets the debate terms he wanted — and an opportunity to convince Democrats the race is effectively over.  Expectations aren’t high for the former vice president after a series of mediocre debate performances during primary season. The Sanders campaign, among other Biden detractors, views the debate as a chance for him to fall flat on his face, reviving questions about the durability of his candidacy just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open with a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. But in years past, Biden has thrived in the one-on-one format during vice presidential debates. His plan Sunday is to focus on his electability and how he’s in sync with the Democratic electorate after winning 15 states, according to aides. In the face of aggressive questioning from Sanders, Biden can now point to record turnout in states like Virginia, which overwhelmingly supported him. Then there’s the fact that he won nearly all of the African American support in Mississippi. What’s more, Biden has won whites by big margins and racked up wins in the cities, suburbs and in rural areas, a fact that advisers hope will give him a sense of confidence against Sanders. “Success builds on success,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s top adviser in charge of debates. In the first debate since Feb. 25 — four days before the South Carolina primary that transformed Biden’s candidacy from hospice patient to juggernaut — Biden is expected to be careful not to come across as too arrogant. “The flip side is this thing, we’ve seen it change before, we’re taking nothing for granted,” Klain said. “I expect a lively contest on Sunday and a lively contest on Tuesday.” Biden is prepared for Sanders to question his shortcomings with reaching out to the youth vote, and to acknowledge he needs to make gains with young voters. But the former vice president’s advisers say he’ll also note that Sanders fell short of his own promise that he had the singular ability to attract new voters and build a coalition that would beat Trump. Biden is also expected to mention how most of the top former presidential candidates in the race endorsed him — and not Sanders. Sanders, meanwhile, is operating under some self-imposed constraints. The Vermont senator likes Biden and loathes Trump, and he doesn’t want to eviscerate Biden out of concern that it would only weaken him and therefore help Trump, Sanders advisers say. And they note the difficulty of being overtly political onstage at a time when coronavirus dominates the nation’s consciousness. Attacking Biden too much could be perceived as just out of step with the moment in which Democrats want unity and seriousness of purpose. “Bernie’s going to be careful about not looking too political — too electoral — and being the guy who says, ‘Well, I can get this many delegates and go on to the convention...’ No. That’s not where Americans’ heads are at,” an adviser said. “People are worrying about their families. They’re at the grocery store buying batteries.” Because coronavirus has made health care an even more important issue, Sanders is expected to press Biden on his opposition to Medicare for all. Sanders also wants Biden to explain why he advocated for cutting Social Security years ago only to inaccurately suggest he never did. “It’s not going to be an all-out assault. It’s going to be a policy debate. And it’s going to be a vigorous one,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders senior adviser. “But it’s going to be on policy.” Klain said his candidate is ready for whatever Sanders throws at him. “They have met on the debate stage 10 times already. I’m pretty sure I know what Bernie Sanders’ position is on Medicare for All and I know what Joe Biden’s position is on Medicare for All,” Klain said. “If people are expecting some big new thing on Sunday, I don’t think they’re going to get it.”  Klain, who served as Biden’s chief of staff while vice president, earned acclaim as the Obama administration’s czar who successfully managed response to the Ebola virus. Biden has tapped that expertise for his coronavirus response plan, and aides believe the issue is a strength at a moment when President Trump’s unsteady performance has generated criticism. According to NPR, exit polls showed about half of Michigan voters said they believed Biden was best equipped to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 31 percent. In Missouri, 61 percent said they trusted Biden to lead in a crisis to Sanders’ 26 percent. Advisers also say Biden would contrast his approach to Trump. Biden, of course, has a well-earned reputation of going off-script, misspeaking or meandering. His first debate performance was arguably his worst. That’s when then-2020 rival Kamala Harris called him out for highlighting his ability to work with Southern segregationists in the 1970s and challenged him on busing policies. The debate went so badly, Biden felt compelled to address his performance at a Chicago event the next day.  “We all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds in a debate can’t do justice to a lifetime commitment to civil rights,” Biden said. Biden’s performances stabilized over time — or critics just became accustomed to his style — and he was praised recently for televised town halls in Nevada and South Carolina as well as the strength of his debates in both of those states.  What also helped Biden was billionaire Mike Bloomberg, a candidate who promised to save Democrats upon Biden’s collapse but instead delivered a disastrous performance in Nevada when Elizabeth Warren shredded him on stage, taking the focus off the then-struggling Biden. Weaver said Biden has benefited from the big debate stages like that one in Las Vegas that have allowed him to avoid engaging in actual debate. “With eight to 10 people onstage,” Weaver said, “it’s very difficult to have the kind of back-and-forth debate that voters need to make a good decision about who they want to pick as their nominee. That’s the problem.” Last week, the two campaigns clashed over the debate format. Sanders campaign wanted a standing debate that was moderated by professionals. Biden’s campaign was more inclined for a seated town hall-style format where citizens could ask questions. Biden has tended to thrive when given more time to argue a point or explain policy ideas. In town halls, potential voters at times would express relief at seeing Biden in person, saying he was far more articulate and cogent than the candidate they’d seen on the debate stage.  Prior to this year’s crowded debates, Biden distinguished himself with several strong performances in vice presidential debates in 2008 and 2012. “Joe Biden is simultaneously the most-experienced presidential campaign debater in modern American life but has the lowest expectations,” said Michael Steel, an adviser to former Rep. Paul Ryan before his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Biden, whose performance was credited with helping to reverse the fortunes of the Obama-Biden ticket.“We expected him to be over the top. We expected him to be blarney-full, if that’s a word. And he just took it to 11.” The dispute with the Sanders campaign over the debate format came as Democrats sympathetic to Biden started privately raising concerns that Biden didn’t have the physical or mental stamina to face Sanders on stage. Rumors circulated that the Democratic National Committee was under pressure to cancel the debate, which both the DNC and Biden’s campaign denied. The debate ultimately wasn’t canceled, but it was moved to Washington, D.C., from Phoenix over concerns about coronavirus contagion. Mike Ceraso, a former adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign, said Biden has captured the feeling of the party better than his opponents, winning a different type of expectations game. “Expectations this time around isn’t about brains or performance. It’s about the story, man. Pete and Warren and Bernie’s stories are okay,” Ceraso said. “Biden’s story hits home. Loss and anger and sense of service and sadness are relatable qualities. They amplify with Trump in the background. Take the intellectual out of it. And focus on the heart. It’s cliche as hell. But...imagine if you’re someone who has a mom with Alzheimer’s or a depressed child or someone addicted to drugs.”",Biden readies plan to finish off Bernie,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/biden-sanders-2020-endorsements-129182,politico
"The National Education Association announced Saturday that it is backing Joe Biden for president, handing the Democratic frontrunner a prized endorsement ahead of Tuesday’s big-state primaries as he aims to wipe out his last remaining major opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Lily Eskelsen García, president of the 3 million-member teachers union, praised the former vice president as a “tireless advocate for public education"" who understands the nation’s “moral responsibility to provide a great neighborhood public school for every student in every ZIP code.” The NEA is the nation's largest labor union. “For the past two years, the #RedforEd movement has proven the power of the National Education Association and the collective voice of our members to advocate for stronger public schools and opportunity for all students,” Eskelsen García said in a statement. “Now, with so much at stake in this election, educators are determined to use their voice to propel Joe Biden to the White House.” The endorsement precedes Tuesday’s key primaries in Florida, Arizona, Illinois and Ohio. NEA has members in every congressional district, including battleground states. Biden and Sanders (I-Vt.) are set to debate Sunday night just as Biden is poised to break the race wide open if he makes a four-state sweep in the March 17 primaries. The union’s members traditionally serve as national convention delegates and they have a high voter turnout rate. In the last presidential election, 89 percent of registered NEA members voted, according to the union. NEA endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Sanders early in the 2016 Democratic primary, though the move roiled Sanders backers in the union ranks. This time, union leaders waited to see how candidates performed in early primaries. “I'm not going to bring a recommendation before we see who actually can deliver votes,” Eskelsen García told POLITICO in January. The union's move on Saturday follows a lengthy process that included a questionnaire, videotaped interviews and multiple presidential forums. Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, also an educator and an NEA member, have built “broad support” among members, a news release said. In her statement, Eskelsen García also lauded Biden’s support for better pay for teachers and increasing funding for support staff and paraprofessionals. “And Biden will fire Betsy DeVos and replace her with an education secretary who comes from a public school classroom and believes that educators must have a seat at the table when crafting education policy,” she said. Last month, the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers union announced that it would encourage its local and state affiliates to back or endorse the presidential bids of Biden, Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

"The Trump administration is struggling to win back the confidence of hospital leaders after three years of pitched battles, with the industry pushing for urgent help from the White House as the coronavirus crisis begins to swamp emergency rooms. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma on Friday announced new moves to roll back industry regulations, two days after hospitals pled their case to Verma in a White House meeting that left many unsatisfied. Among the changes: Streamlined deployment of doctors, fewer time-consuming inspections and less red tape around how hospitals run operations during a crisis. “It gives hospitals and providers on the front lines the maximum flexibility so that they can focus on patients that need help,” Verma said on “Fox and Friends” on Saturday. The American Hospital Association hailed the moves as a “solid step.” But hospital leaders say that the new announcements only touch the surface of their needs, as they worry about shortages of crucial supplies, risks to their workers and the possibility of an industry bailout as coronavirus patients swarm their facilities. An expert on an American Hospital Association webinar last month predicted as many as 1.9 million ICU admissions from the coronavirus outbreak over the next few months, swamping existing facilities. There are only about 100,000 ICU beds across the U.S. health system. Meanwhile, the cost of care for some severely ill coronavirus patients has already been estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, as hospitals deploy significant measures to keep the patients alive while protecting their own workers against infection. At least three hospital systems in Seattle, the center of the nation's most extensive outbreak, have already announced a halt on elective procedures in order to devote more resources toward the coronavirus patients already swarming their facilities. “I think there will be hospitals that could be pushed to the edge financially,” said Chip Kahn, head of the for-profit Federation of American Hospitals, warning that hospitals will absorb a surge of coronavirus cases while postponing elective procedures that tend to be better for hospitals’ bottom lines. Some hospital leaders have quietly floated that they’ll need federal funding to pay for rented hotels or other arrangements as their hospital wards are quickly overrun by the coronavirus outbreak. The risk of failure is severe: Public health experts have warned that the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, which is in its early days, could be on track to resemble the increasingly dire situation in Italy, where patients have overwhelmed that nation’s health system. That’s left hospitals calling for extreme measures from the White House and scrambling to prepare emergency steps of their own while they wait for a response. But in the face of the looming crisis, hospital executives said that leaders were underwhelmed by their Wednesday meeting with Verma, who spent much of the hour-long session taking notes but failed to calm industry fears about swamped emergency rooms and medical supply shortages, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence briefly joined the meeting but departed to join other officials as they worked to prepare the president for his Oval Office address. “For our guys, it did not scream confidence,” said one individual briefed on the meeting. “We came out of it with bigger questions about whether the administration has done its homework to protect the supply chain,” as hospitals try to stock up on masks, swabs and other key materials that could quickly become hard to find, said another individual. Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, compared the current situation to a “World War II mentality, where we’re going to have to put extra shifts on in manufacturing and get this stuff out the door.” “The only one that can do that is the federal government, and we need the president and vice president to make a priority of that,” he said. Kahn, who was among the attendees at Wednesday’s meeting, praised Verma but put responsibility for the administration’s slow start on the White House, contending that federal health officials had to wait for authorization to get started on a series of initiatives. But hospital leaders haven’t had time alone with President Donald Trump — even as leaders of other health sectors, like the insurance industry, the pharma industry and the lab industry, have been granted extended face-to-face meetings with the president and Pence. CMS didn't respond to questions about the meeting with Verma, but defended its efforts to engage the hospital industry. A spokesperson pointed to a new weekly call to brief hospitals on coronavirus — with the first call with FDA Commissioner Steve Hahn drawing more than 1,600 listeners — and other steps to build closer ties. ""CMS created a strategic working group with the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals which began meeting last Monday,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the group included a ""small number"" of hospital CEOs. ""We believe that for the health system to respond adequately to the coronavirus, the entire health system must be engaged,"" the spokesperson added. The tensions between hospitals and the Trump administration have persisted for years. The hospital industry went to war with the White House in 2017 over Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying that rolling back the sweeping health law would harm patients and do damage to their bottom lines. They’ve continued that fight as Trump has tried to strike down the law in court, with American Hospital Association CEO Rick Pollack calling the position “misguided.” Hospitals also have fought over numerous Medicaid changes spearheaded by Verma, including a new “fiscal accountability” proposal that would tighten hospitals’ ability to collect Medicaid funding. Hospitals currently use a variety of financial arrangements to pump up their Medicaid revenue, such as supporting state taxes that allow them to draw down even more money in federal matching funds. Verma has called the arrangements industry-friendly gimmicks and wants to do away with them. “Hospitals were already concerned about the rule — and moreso with coronavirus staring them in the face,” said Joel McElvain, a partner in King & Spalding’s health care group who’s represented hospitals in lawsuits against the administration. McElvain warned that states would need to come up with new financial arrangements to support hospitals if the rule, a top priority for Verma, is finalized during the coronavirus outbreak. “It’s a time when rural hospitals are already struggling and facing real difficulty if worst-case scenarios come true in the coming weeks,” McElvain said. Meanwhile, hospitals have spent years fighting back against a slew of Trump administration funding cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and public health initiatives. Among Trump’s most recent proposals: an $18 million cut to the federal health department’s own hospital preparedness program, announced just last month, on the eve of the coronavirus outbreak. “The hospital preparedness program exists so hospitals prepare for this exact thing,” said a former HHS official. “The whole point is to prepare them so they can respond to all hazards - from hurricanes to pandemics to biological attacks.” While Trump’s battles with the pharmaceutical industry have gotten considerable headlines, some of his aides have believed that hospitals were a larger problem, citing the costs that ever-larger systems have passed along to patients and pointing to policies that they say gamed the system. They also haven’t agreed with hospitals’ warnings that their bottom lines have suffered under this administration. “The argument is so ridiculous,” said Brian Blase, who advised Trump on health policy before leaving the White House last year. “I don’t think there are a lot of policies that came out that took revenue away from hospitals,” he added, noting that hospitals successfully sued to blockTrump’s billion-dollar cut to a drug-discount program and other regulations opposed by hospitals have been similarly stalled. Amid the historic public health threat, hospital officials are loath to renew a public battle too and criticize the administration. “We have been very clear that we have had serious concerns with a number of other policies from the Administration, including the issues of Medicaid expansion and cuts to hospital outpatient department visits,” a spokesperson for the American Hospital Association told POLITICO. “Right now, of course, our focus is on working with the government and other stakeholders at all levels to address the current emergency.” But some hospital leaders did express frustration on Saturday after Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that hospitals may need to postpone elective surgeries to handle the crush of coronavirus patients. “Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!” Adams tweeted on Saturday, adding that such procedures could further the coronavirus spread, tax medical stockpiles and put further pressure on doctors and nurses. The message from the nation’s top doctor was seen as alarmist and premature, worrying hospital officials that it would prompt patients to postpone crucial care. “I do think it’s unfortunate what the surgeon general said,” said Kahn, adding that he hoped Adams and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who similarly warned of the need to cancel some procedures, would walk back their statements. “I don’t think we’re anywhere near a point where we know we would have to do something like that.” The coronavirus outbreak has served as justification of hospitals’ yearslong warnings over federal policies that the industry saw as hamstringing their finances and preparedness, executives said. Now, the same government that sought to cut pay rates and layer on new regulations is relying on hospitals as the nation’s chief defense against the pandemic. “Governments tend to, on a day-to-day basis, underestimate the importance of the health care community and look at it not so much as an economic contribution as an economic deficit,” Raske said, emphasizing that the attitude extends well beyond the Trump administration. “That tendency hits reality in a crisis.” Hospital leaders also have warned about the dearth of ventilators to treat the sickest patients — an issue that Verma has failed to directly address in multiple interviews, including being grilled by Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday night over whether hospitals will have enough. ""You know, Tucker, I don't want to make drastic predictions here, right?"" Verma said. ""Because this situation is changing every single day. And based on the information we have, we know that we have to be aggressive,"" she added, touting yesterday's moves to increase flexibility for hospitals and relax regulations. “That was one of the most incompetent and absolutely incoherent responses to what’s going on right now,” Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease expert, told Carlson a few minutes later. CMS did not directly respond to questions about whether there is a dearth of ventilators. Meanwhile, hospital executives have noted the dark irony of Washington’s sudden focus on mass treatment capacity after years of efforts to crack down on hospital reimbursement prompted providers to shrink their facilities. “I’m really worried about how, when this finally blows over, what Congress does,” said one lobbyist. “Are we actually going to learn from this?” “We love hospitals,” countered Blase, Trump’s former health policy adviser. “Hospitals are going to be at the front lines of this and have an enormous job. But there shouldn’t be policies that give them advantages they shouldn’t have.”",Trump now needs the hospitals he's alienated,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-hospitals-coronavirus-129743,politico

"Georgia has delayed its presidential primary due to coronavirus. The primary, which was originally scheduled for March 24, will now be held on May 19. Georgia is the second state to delay its presidential primary. Louisiana rescheduled its April 4 primary to June 20 on Friday. The virus, which has infected more than 2,700 people across the United States, has prompted school closures, the cessation of professional sports and, in many places, a prohibition on large public gatherings.  “Events are moving rapidly and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers, their families, and the community at large,” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement, originally issued to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The presidential primary in the state will now be held on the same day as primaries in the state for local, state and congressional offices.  In-person early voting has also been halted. A statement from state Sen. Nikema Williams, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia, indicated that in-person and absentee ballots that have already been cast in the presidential primary will count. However, election officials in four states that are voting on Tuesday — Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — said on Friday their primaries will go on as scheduled. “Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,” a joint statement from top election officials read. After Tuesday, only one other state or territory has a presidential primary scheduled for the month of March: Puerto Rico. But party officials in the state have also requested the primary be moved. A statement from the Puerto Rico Democratic Party said Chairman Charles Rodriguez requested that the territory’s legislature postpone its primary until April 26, with the potential for the primary to be held later if the virus is still not contained.  Some election watchdogs fret that delaying primaries is a step too far, expressing worry that moving primaries could effectively suppress voters’ rights. “We all agree that the safety and health of the public is paramount, but steps can, and must be taken to protect voters and poll workers while also ensuring that the democratic process marches ahead,” read a joint statement issued after Louisiana's decision from dozens of groups, including The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the NAACP. “Sudden changes to election times, locations, and more have been proven to create barriers to, and in some instances the denial of, citizens their right to vote.” Election administrators in the four states voting on Tuesday have been scrambling to minimize risk to voters and poll workers. Polling sites in high-risk places like nursing homes have been moved, and officials are instructing poll workers to routinely clean and disinfect voting areas. Voters have also been strongly encouraged to take advantage of early and mail-in voting as much as possible. However, early, mail, and absentee voting laws vary widely state-by-state. Some states — like Washington, which voted earlier this week — allow for expansive mail voting, limiting the amount of disruption the outbreak can cause for an election. But others only allow absentee votes with a valid excuse and have limited (or no) early voting, adding a barrier for some voters that likely cannot be lifted without legislative action from state lawmakers or executives. Elected officials and activists have started pushing for states to have more expansive absentee and mail-in voting in later primary states and for the general election, as fears over the long term effects of the virus’ spread builds.

"President Donald Trump assured Americans on Wednesday the deadly coronavirus was on the brink of disappearing. Two days later, he admitted it wasn’t. In the span of 48 hours this week, from the moment markets plunged after a confusing and stiff Oval Office address to his national emergency declaration from the Rose Garden, Trump watched his own assessment of the viral outbreak transform in extraordinary fashion, forcing him into a course correction. The unprecedented shutdown of the world’s largest economy — a nation of 330 million people — will mark the most consequential stretch of Trump’s presidency and transform how Americans think about their government. For Trump himself, the journey appeared to represent a recognition that his earlier path threatened to engulf a nation he oversees with a spreading pandemic and diminish hope for reelection this fall. Trump’s do-over approach — he unlocked $50 billion in government funding on Friday to address the growing crisis and threw his support behind House Democrats’ aid package hours later — followed weeks of the president shrugging off the coronavirus threat and making statements about the availability of tests, the severity of the virus and the development of a COVID-19 vaccine that his own officials had to correct, sometimes within minutes of being made. During a visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Trump said the virus “will go away” and said his response was “really working out.” Instead, the forecast grew worse. State and local leaders, business executives and tens of millions of ordinary Americans leapfrogged their president — without waiting for White House guidance — to shut down public spaces, schools, offices and other gathering spaces and encourage millions of Americans to hunker down for a fast-spreading, invisible threat. Even as the stock market rebounded Friday in response to Trump’s release of emergency funding, the week ended with a mystery about whether America’s 73-year-old commander-in-chief, who has downplayed concerns about a virus that disproportionately impacts the elderly, could potentially be the world’s highest-ranking vector. During a rare appearance in the White House briefing room on Saturday, donning a “USA” ball cap, Trump said he was tested Friday night for COVID-19, and has started receiving temperature checks. The news came hours after a top Brazilian official at Mar-a-Lago last weekend — who dined with the president and many of his top aides — tested positive for the virus. (The White House physician said late Saturday that Trump’s test was negative.) The White House began administering temperature checks this weekend to “any individuals who are in close contact” with Trump or Pence, a spokesman said. This included members of the press corps who were stopped by a staff physician at the entrance to the James S. Brady briefing room Saturday afternoon. “SOCIAL DISTANCING!” Trump tweeted prior to the news conference and one day after he was seen repeatedly shaking hands with corporate CEOs and health officials during his televised remarks from the Rose Garden.  Rebuffing the precautionary isolation measures his own aides were taking, Trump will now spend the weekend sifting through options with White House staff — some of whom are fresh off self-quarantines — about the mechanics of a bailout for industries devastated financially by the virus outbreak. White House aides headed into the complex early Saturday morning for the next round of urgent discussions, a recognition of the tight timeline they’re facing to rescue key sectors of the economy such as transportation and tourism. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are assembling a list of options for Trump to consider as he looks to rescue crumbling industries and protect their workforces, according to two senior administration officials.  At Saturday’s briefing, Mnuchin specifically cited the airlines, cruise ships and hotels as industries that have faced significant challenges from the abrupt crash in global travel and tourism.  Trump’s desire to leap to the assistance of certain industries stems in part from witnessing an upward swing in U.S. markets after he designated the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency on Friday. The declaration had been in the works already, but was pushed up amid historic volatility in financial markets — much of which stemmed from an Oval Office address Wednesday night in which Trump stated he was banning all travel and imports from Europe, which the administration had to later clarify did not block all products and included only the 26-member countries of the unrestricted travel Schengen zone. (The ban will be extended to the U.K. and Ireland, which aren’t members of Schengen.) Trump also claimed insurers would cover the full cost of testing and treatment — generating alarm from health plans that never agreed to waive all patient costs. Outside the White House, many of the president’s political allies viewed Wednesday’s Oval Office address as a speech that quickly needed a do-over. Staring directly into a camera while seated with his hands crossed was not the best format for the president, Trump’s own aides later admitted.  The crushing response on Thursday prompted the White House to schedule Friday’s press conference in the Rose Garden, a favorite venue of the president thanks to its natural lighting and the more free-wheeling format of a back-and-forth press conference, according to two White House officials familiar with the matter.  The president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — among the few officials to maintain the president’s trust throughout his term — also became much more deeply involved in the coronavirus response efforts later in the week as it became clear the White House needed a more forceful response, a senior administration official said.  Internally, aides started to blame officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for flawed testing kits and the amount of time it took to get results back. The administration’s internal criticism of the CDC has made the agency the latest scapegoat as Trump’s team sought to deflect blame and cushion the president from what could become devastating political blowback against the president and his party in the coming months. Morale inside the White House bottomed out on Friday, said a third senior administration official, but turned a corner once the Food and Drug Administration approved a new COVID-19 detection test from the pharmaceutical company Roche as part of an emergency authorization. “They reached the conclusion this week that they had to communicate a sense of seriousness about what was going on and had to reassure the country that they were taking it very seriously,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who remains a close ally of Trump. “Having major companies like Wal-Mart, CVS, etc. involved means suddenly you begin to see how you can move to scale for a country for our size.” The Friday Rose Garden speech, where Trump announced a public-private partnership on testing and the immediate opening of emergency operation centers across the U.S., also helped propel a stock market surge in the final hour of trading. One official later bragged the speech alone caused the “biggest market jump ever.” Trump has repeatedly boasted about the stock market’s rebound after the S&P 500 recorded its best single-day performance since 2008 on Friday — a 9% gain, reversing a Thursday plunge that marked the worst day since 1987’s “Black Monday” crash. On Saturday, an unusually jovial Trump said he was “honored” to see positive movement in the markets following his news conference the day before — even joking that he should up the volume of his public appearances to further boost investor confidence.  “I think we should do one of them every day perhaps. Maybe five times per day. That was something to watch,” he said.  But not every element of the president’s course correction has gone smoothly.  Representatives from Google said they were caught off guard on Friday when Trump said the tech company was “helping to develop a website … to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location” for Americans who suspect they may have contracted the coronavirus. In a statement shared on Twitter from Verily, a subsidiary of Google, the company said it is still “developing a tool to help triage individuals for COVID-19 testing” that would initially only be available in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Elsewhere in his remarks, Trump disavowed involvement in disbanding a pandemic unit within the White House National Security Council and about the travel restrictions he has imposed on European countries. The president, more than three years into a presidency in which he has eagerly ejected pre-Trump officials, also blamed the Obama administration for testing shortages in the U.S. that have undermined containment efforts and sowed chaos at some hospitals. “I don’t take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time,” Trump told reporters, while complaining that his predecessor “didn’t do testing” during the 2009 swine flu outbreak. (In fact, diagnostic kits shipped just weeks after the CDC identified the first case of the virus in April 2009.) Indeed, blaming his predecessors for troubles with his own administration's handling of the current pandemic has become a common tactic of late. He accused former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary, on Thursday of overseeing “one of the worst [responses] on record” to a nationwide health epidemic, in reference to that H1N1 outbreak during Obama’s first year in office.  Trump also claimed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been working with top Trump aides this week on an emergency aid package, was “trying to create a panic” when his administration faced criticism in late February about its slow response to the coronavirus outbreak.  He blamed Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell for contributing to the economic pullback by refusing to cut interest rates — despite historic action by the central bank this week to combat chaos in financial markets and an emergency rate cut last week.  As economic relief legislation stalled in the House on Friday, Trump said it was congressional Democrats’ fault because “all of a sudden they didn’t agree to certain things that they agreed to.”  “He has never accepted blame for things that have gone wrong under his watch. Why would he do so now?” said one Republican close to the White House, who claimed the tactic “has worked in the past” for the president.  Although White House aides felt confident about Trump’s message on Friday about testing and the stimulus package passed by the House early Saturday, aides also acknowledged that the next step in rescuing the economy — deciding which industries to bail out — will be much harder politically.  The potential cost of an industry bailout could upset Republican lawmakers who have grumbled for years about the ballooning national debt under their watch after fighting the Obama administration over even smaller deficits and debt levels.  “It quickly devolves into industry vs. industry and parochial stuff,” said one former senior administration official. Trump also remains intent on pushing for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year, continuing to drop it into his public remarks.  “If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!” he tweeted on Friday.  Democrats and Senate Republicans have been cool to that idea, in part because of the eye-popping price tag ($950 billion according to one estimate) and concerns among economists about whether it would be effective in preventing a severe economic downturn. As the president entered the weekend, however, he appeared intent on striking a more unifying tone. Before meeting with members of the coronavirus task force at the White House, Trump commended the “good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats” that led to the House’s passage of a bill that will expand paid emergency leave and provide tax credits for workers and employers affected by the coronavirus crisis. The legislation also includes $1 billion in food aid for low-income Americans.  “People really pulled together. Nice to see!” Trump tweeted. He even praised the media — whom he accused last week of trying to “inflame the CoronaVirus situation far beyond what the facts would warrant” — for recent coverage of his administration’s response to the crisis. “Over the past 24 hours, I think the representation has been very fair. It’s been very fair,” Trump told reporters on Saturday.",From complacency to emergency: How Trump changed course on coronavirus ,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/how-trump-changed-course-on-coronavirus-129528,politico
"Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday that he still plans to offer more details about a planned website to help screen people for coronavirus symptoms — a day after President Donald Trump's description of it as a massive Google project appeared to surprise even the company. ""Tomorrow, 5 o'clock, we'll have a very specific description tomorrow about when the website will be available,"" Pence told reporters at a White House news conference, adding that he thought the site would be available Monday. ""As we expand testing across the country, we want people to be able to go to a website,"" Pence added in response to a later question. ""There will be a questionnaire there to determine whether or not a test is in order, because we want to make sure that people are being tested that have the symptoms."" Trump had announced the project during a Rose Garden address Friday afternoon, saying that for people who may have coronavirus symptoms, the website will help ""determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location."" Trump added that ""we have many, many locations. ... We cover this country and large parts of the world."" But later on Friday, Google tweeted a statement from its life sciences affiliate, Verily, that described the project as having a more modest scope, at least initially. ""Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time,"" said the company, which is owned by Google's parent, Alphabet. Google appeared to walk that back Saturday night by posting a Twitter thread much more consistent with the White House's description: ""Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information,"" it wrote, adding that this was in addition to ""Work being done by our sister company Verily to launch a pilot website that will enable individuals to do a risk assessment and be scheduled for testing at sites in the Bay Area."" Google was also taking steps such as ""[p]romoting authoritative information through Google Search and YouTube"" and weeding out ""phishing, conspiracy theories, malware and misinformation."" Neither Google and Verily responded to attempts to reconcile their various statements with the administration's accounts. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said Saturday that the site will incorporate ""everything they have learned about symptoms and screening"" for the virus. ""It's not just a simple checkbox website,"" she said. ""It's actually going to go through critical symptoms, and that's why we're giving ourselves the weekend to get it put up."" Friday's announcement instantly raised red flags among patient privacy groups, which have pushed for greater scrutiny of Google’s use of health data. Google recently came under fire over a deal with Ascension Health that grants the tech giant access to millions of patients' identifiable medical information. While Google contends the deal complies with federal privacy protections for health data, a Wall Street Journal report on the deal triggered an investigation by the HHS civil rights office and landed the company in the crosshairs of congressional privacy hawks. “It sounds like @Google just figured out how to get the personal health data of every single American,” tweeted Kyle Plotkin, chief of staff for Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), after Trump made the announcement. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) have demanded answers from Google and Ascension. Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said it’s critical for consumer privacy that Google doesn’t gather any personally identifiable information from the coronavirus website, and that it shouldn’t keep IP addresses or use any other “covert tracking techniques.” The White House has sought the tech industry's help bolstering its response to the expanding outbreak. U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios held a conference call Wednesday with representatives from large tech firms, including Google, Facebook and Amazon, to discuss their efforts to combat coronavirus-related online misinformation and ways artificial intelligence could be used to analyze medical research on the virus. “Cutting-edge technology companies and major online platforms will play a critical role in this all-hands-on-deck effort,” Kratsios said in a statement after the call. “Today’s meeting outlined an initial path forward and we intend to continue this important conversation.” Mohana Ravindranath, Darius Tahir and Steven Overly contributed to this report.",Pence promises more details on virus screening website,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/pence-coronavirus-website-129530,politico
"The White House is expanding its travel ban to passengers from the United Kingdom and Ireland in an attempt to stem the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S., a further expansion of restrictions on air travel that haven’t been seen since Sept. 11, 2001. The administration had previously banned foreign nationals from flying into the United States from the 26 countries in the Schengen Area free movement zone, but not the U.K. and Ireland, despite the existence of the coronavirus in those countries. The ban on travel from other parts of Europe began at midnight on Saturday, White House officials said at a press conference on Saturday. The ban on the two new countries will be implemented at midnight Monday night, Eastern Daylight Time. Trump spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday, according to a readout released by the White House.  The move is sure to push airlines further into crisis after they have been struggling financially for weeks amid a steep slump in passenger demand. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said economic aid could soon be coming for airlines and cruise lines after Congress passed two pieces of coronavirus relief legislation that didn’t include provisions for those industries. ""We have a lot more we need to do with Congress, and the speaker and I have acknowledged that we will be working starting immediately,” Mnuchin said. “The airlines industry in particular, no different than after 9/11, has a very unique circumstances — the cruise industry, the hotel industry. I would say we’ve got a lot more work to do.” Airlines are already struggling with massive losses, with some carriers having more canceled flights than new bookings for April and May. Delta Air Lines announced Friday that it is slashing 40 percent of its flight capacity, a massive cut. The reduction in flights is the steepest in Delta's history, including the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks. A senior TSA official said Saturday that there has been a ""significant"" drop in the number of both domestic and international air travelers. ""This can be as much as 30 percent — some locations, higher,"" the official said. However, the White House and airlines have been in discussions about the impact the coronavirus is having on their businesses, and what aid might be needed. Nothing has been finalized or made public, but those discussions, for now, appear to be centered around letting airlines keep some of the excise taxes passengers pay as part of the price of a ticket. However, one of those charges typically is funneled to airports to help pay for capital improvements, and airports, themselves looking at billions in losses as travel continues to slump, are likely to fight such a change. Similarly, one of the taxes — about 7.5 percent of the cost of an airline ticket — is used to help pay to run the Federal Aviation Administration, which Congress may not endorse if it is waived for anything longer than a few months. The European travel ban does not apply to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents or their family members, but they will be directed to one of 13 airports with enhanced screening procedures in place. Some domestic travel restrictions may also be under consideration. When asked Saturday whether he was “considering other travel restrictions, perhaps domestically,“ President Donald Trump answered: “Specifically from certain areas, yes we are, and we’re working with the states and we’re considering other restrictions.”  On a call with reporters later Saturday, a senior DHS official said domestic travel restrictions weren't expected ""at this time."" Though the administration has been intensely focused on reducing flights from coronavirus-exposed countries, there are indications that health screenings for international travelers arriving at U.S. airports have been spotty. Passengers returning from coronavirus hotspots around the globe have reported that despite coming straight from countries with rampant coronavirus outbreaks, Customs and Border Protection officers and health officers in U.S. airports did not ask them questions about their travel histories, take their temperatures or check them for coronavirus symptoms.

"President Donald Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, the White House physician said Saturday evening after the president held a press briefing on the administration's latest moves to combat the outbreak. The president consented to a test Friday night, Navy Cdr. Sean Conley said in a statement, and he remains symptom-free one week after dining with a Brazilian government delegation, some of whose members have tested positive for the illness, at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The statement did not say if Trump will be re-tested. Trump said that he has been tested for coronavirus after being questioned about it during a Rose Garden address on Friday. “I also took the test last night,"" Trump said during the White House briefing. ""And I decided I should, based on the press conference yesterday. People were asking, 'Did I take the test?'"" Asked when test results would be returned, he said: ""A day, two days. They send it to a lab."" Trump also touted the bipartisan congressional funding package passed early Saturday and the rise in the stock markets following his Rose Garden address. ""I was honored to see that the stock market, you were mostly there with us, set a record in a short period of time, over 45-minute period that we had the press conference yesterday in the rose garden,"" Trump said. ""That was a record. All-time record. I think we should do one of them every day perhaps. How about five times a day? We'll do one five times a day."" He also announced that the White House is expanding its travel ban to passengers from the United Kingdom and Ireland, also hinting that relief for the airline and cruise industry would be coming soon. The president was joined at the press event by Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Housing Secretary Ben Carson and health officials, including Seema Verma, Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, who have been leading the administration's response to the outbreak. Not present was Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, whose standing has been diminished in the wake of the outbreak.  ""Secretary Azar was at the coronavirus task force meeting this morning. He's back to work, and we will have a changing round-up of these presentations so we can get quickly to your questions,"" Pence said in response to a question about the absence of the administration's top health official. ""But secretary Azar is doing a remarkable job, and working seven days a week for the American people and making a difference."" The vice president, pressed on the messaging discrepancies from the White House around whether Trump needed to get tested, told reporters he’d consult with the White House physician on getting a diagnostic himself after today’s briefing. “Mrs. Pence and I will be more than happy to get tested,” he said, after stating that the physician on Friday night had said Pence and his wife didn’t have the “symptoms or contacts that would necessitate testing.” He also said he’d had his temperature checked earlier. White House staff barred at least one person from the press briefing room after checking the temperatures of journalists who gathered for the event Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel experienced a fever and flu-like conditions Friday evening and went to a Michigan hospital for treatment, according to the RNC. She is self-quarantining at home with her family. The president has been criticized for repeatedly shaking hands in public and on camera despite the advice of public health officials to refrain from the practice.  At the press briefing, he defended his actions but also said that ""getting away from shaking hands is a good thing."" Late Friday, press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a memo from Conley saying Trump had dined at Mar-a-Lago with a person who has since tested positive for coronavirus. Conley did not recommend testing the president as a necessity. Conley on Saturday said he had been in touch with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House Coronavirus Task Force and that his office is “encouraging the implementation of all their best practices.” Earlier Saturday, Trump hailed the bipartisan deal on a congressional coronavirus funding package on Twitter, adding that he'd attended a series of coronavirus-related meetings in the White House that morning.  He also tweeted: ""SOCIAL DISTANCING!"" As of Saturday, the U.S. had reached 50 reported coronavirus-related deaths and over 2,200 confirmed cases. Despite Trump’s announcement that’s he’s been tested, health officials at Saturday’s press conference urged Americans to begin isolating themselves instead of rushing to get tested if they’re not experiencing symptoms.  Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator said said Quest and LabCorp — two private labs currently running diagnostics — are reporting 98 percent to 99 percent of their tests are coming back negative for coronavirus.  Though early missteps have prevented widespread testing necessary to track the spread of the virus and isolate sick individuals, Birx and other administration health officials said they were optimistic about the steps the administration is taking to ramp up testing. The administration on Friday announced steps that would allow some labs that have been processing tens or hundreds of samples a day to instead handle thousands. The U.S. tested about 11,000 people during the first seven weeks of the outbreak — roughly as many as South Korea can test in a day. Pence said the administration would release more details at a briefing Sunday evening on progress in the effort to expand testing. Health officials Saturday said they were optimistic that the new measures will allow the U.S. to begin understanding how the disease is spreading. “Now it's all systems go,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “As we get knowledge about new testing, we'll alleviate the anxiety that we have in the world about, we don't know what's going on.” “Now it's all systems go,” Fauci said. “Let's look forward.” Alex Isenstadt contributed to this report."," Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, White House physician says",2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-coronavirus-test-129444,politico

"The nation's top doctor on Saturday urged a widespread halt of hospital elective procedures amid mounting concern that the health system doesn't have enough beds to manage a potential surge of coronavirus cases. ""Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!"" U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted this morning.  He warned that every elective surgery could spread coronavirus within the facility, use up protective medical gear as public officials worry about shortages and burden a hospital workforce who ""may be needed"" to respond to COVID-19. Adams was responding to new recommendations from the American College of Surgeons issued Friday. The group said hospitals, health systems and surgeons should ""thoughtfully review"" all their scheduled operations and consider canceling or postponing them ""until we have passed the predicted inflection point"" in the disease spread and ""can be confident that our health care infrastructure can support a potentially rapid and overwhelming uptick in critical patient care needs.""

"Local officials from around the country are worried about the readiness of the U.S. public health system, citing a sharply limited number of ventilators to help some of the sickest coronavirus patients and an inadequate supply of critical care beds in a hospital industry that has gone through years of cutbacks in inpatient beds. As they prepare for an expected influx of patients, local public health officials painted a picture of a system with only a limited “surge” capacity, and stressed the importance of social distancing as a crucial way to keep the numbers of patients at a level the system can handle. ""It's about our supply of ventilators, our supply of beds, and of course we have to worry about our health care workers and the general stress on our health care system,"" said Dr. Amy Acton, the head of the Ohio Department of Health. ""If we stay below a certain threshold, we can try not to overwhelm our health care system. So we need to take aggressive measures now."" Ventilators, which provide mechanical breathing assistance and can make the difference between life and death for those patients who need them, represent the clearest limitation on the health system’s capacity to handle the outbreak. U.S. hospitals have a total of 160,000 ventilators — 62,000 full-featured ventilators, and 98,000 more basic ones that can be used in an emergency, according to a 2020 study by Johns Hopkins University. And it’s not just the machines. The respiratory therapists who treat these critically ill patients are also in short supply, several doctors and hospital leaders point out. There is little the government or local officials can do to increase the ventilator numbers in time to address the coronavirus outbreak: There are believed to be around 20,000 additional ventilators in the national emergency stockpile, according to Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery and the University of Cincinnati and critical care expert who got an overview of the supply when he had a role with a manufacturer. The government has not made public details about the emergency stockpile. That might not be nearly enough. Covid-19 is a brand new disease, and a lot of the needs assessments are based on long-ago flu pandemics. But estimates range from a manageable 64,000 ventilators, if this outbreak is like the 1957 flu, to around 740,000 if it’s more like the 1918 Spanish flu. Based on early data from China, a little more than 2 percent of coronavirus patients require ventilators. Trump’s Medicare chief, Seema Verma, avoided a direct response when pressed about whether the country had enough ventilators during a Fox News interview earlier this week. Verma on Friday pointed to Trump’s announcement the government would increase ventilator purchases, saying that measure — along with the national stockpile and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus — would reduce pressure on hospitals. “The whole reason why we’ve taken all these aggressive mitigation strategies — whether the travel bans, the recommendations for people, for communities, for employers — the reason why we’ve taken those aggressive measures is to mitigate the spread so we don’t put stress on the health care systems,” Verma said. But after the testing delays, followed by the increasing spread of the disease and a still-unknown level of transmission, some officials are willing to entertain bleak scenarios. “I believe that if we have a major outbreak, we are definitely vulnerable to shortages,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a House panel on Wednesday, referring to ventilators. Some local officials suggested that, if the ongoing efforts to keep people from congregating fall short, America’s immediate future might look like Italy’s present day: An overwhelmed system, a fearful populace and highly restrictive emergency measures. That’s partly because, after years of reducing hospital beds to treat more illnesses at home or in outpatient settings, there are worrisome limitations on critical care beds and the number of health care workers to staff them, public health officials said. Many hospitals have come close to the breaking point even in a bad flu season. This is shaping up to be far worse. “The fears that the United States could become like Italy — that’s the worst case scenario that people worry about,” said Elaine Batchlor, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves mostly poor patients in South Los Angeles. She and other health officials stressed that bungled testing and flawed travel screening policies have allowed the disease to spread already and cost precious time. Rapidly training large numbers of health workers about coronavirus — including drawing in some who would not normally be frontline in a respiratory illness — is an ongoing challenge, they said. Given the social restrictions to limit the spread of the disease, they can’t fly to a Covid-19 conference or watch a PowerPoint presentation over a buffet. “The main thing for the health care work force is not just how do you screen a person under investigation and get them safely into the appropriate isolation and care that they need,” said Dr. Vineet Arora, who specializes in training at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine. “It’s also, do you make sure the workforce protects themselves, with both personal protective equipment and social distancing in the hospital setting.” Hospitals can reconfigure themselves to take in more coronavirus patients — but even expanded capacity is finite. “If the number of people infected who go to a hospital cannot be treated at the hospital — that’s what you want to plan for now,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. He said New York is looking for other structures and facilities it can tap as temporary Covid-19 centers to prepare for a surge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City might end up putting temporary treatment sites on parking lots. Some of the larger hospital systems and academic medical centers can quickly expand capacity. New York’s Mount Sinai Health System, which has eight hospitals, for instance, could turn ambulatory surgical centers into acute care units, and by halting elective procedures could free up more beds, said its president and CEO, Ken Davis. The system was already tested after catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. Batchlor’s much smaller MLK Community Hospital in Los Angeles can also reconfigure beds, but that may not be enough. “We’re planning for where we will put patients if we have a large influx,” Batchlor said. That could meaning putting some non-coronavirus patients in hallways, if they don’t need to be isolated, and erecting tents for triage and treatment. Brent James, a nationally known health care quality expert who spent most of his career at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, said a competent, well-managed hospital system should be able to expand bed capacity by 30 to 50 percent. But “competent,” he said, is the magic word. Rural hospitals are more crunched, no matter how well-run they are. “We are actually very concerned about surge capacity,” Maggie Elehwany, vice president for government affairs at the National Rural Health Association, said in an email. The organization has written to lawmakers about urgent needs, including more telemedicine and small business loans. Rural populations are older and sicker than the rest of the country, making them high-risk for severe coronavirus. Meanwhile, hospital associations in hard-hit areas like California and Washington state are sharing lessons learned in real time with their counterparts elsewhere. “They literally have just been sending us everything that they’ve put together,” said Patti Davis, Oklahoma Hospital Association president, who said it’s extremely helpful as her state prepares for “the great unknown.” One of the most powerful tools to address the high-tech medical shortage is decidedly low-tech — getting people to stay home and not congregate in crowds, that “social distancing.” The NBA’s decision to suspend its season and the growing list of celebrities who have been infected by Covid-19 may have catalyzed more people to change their behavior than any number of public service announcements from people in white coats, some health officials said. Changing behavior is essential — and some preliminary research shows it could help at least slow down the spread of the virus, so that not so many people get sick all at once and flock to hospitals. It’s hard to model an unprecedented situation, but one group of scientists did some estimates on the impact of social distancing in Seattle — and found that even rather minor changes in behavior can save a lot of lives. The Seattle-area Institute for Disease Modeling found that even relatively minor changes in social interaction can save lives. For instance, if there were 400 deaths in Seattle by early April, a 25 percent reduction in social interaction could bring those deaths down to 160. A 75 percent reduction — of course, much harder to achieve — could bring it to 30.

"President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency to combat the coronavirus — but he could go much further if he wanted.  Federal law gives Trump vast emergency powers in times of pandemic. He could direct the quarantine of people arriving in the United States who exhibit certain symptoms or even if they’re just suspected of having the virus. He could have the federal government detain individuals if their illness might wind up crossing state lines. And under regulations revised and reissued just before Trump entered office, the government can stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease. Some even interpret the statute as meaning a president could deploy the military to cordon off a city or state.  “The federal public health power is pretty awesome … awe-inspiring in its breadth,” said Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University. “But there’s also obviously a lot of danger.” Indeed, it’s an extraordinary palette of options for a president often mocked as enamored of dictatorial authority and who has claimed, “I have the right to do whatever I want, as president.” And many of these powers remain largely undefined, as they have rarely — if ever — been widely used. It’s a troubling concept for those who are pressing Trump to take more urgent action to combat the coronavirus as it infiltrates American cities, but are wary that he will go too far.  “We can’t divorce this from the context of a president who has shown a willingness to abuse emergency power,” said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.  The conflict was on display Friday as Trump declared a national emergency to unlock funding and bypass regulations to accelerate the lagging development of coronavirus testing options. While even some of Trump’s most ardent opponents praised the move, they were anxious about what might come next. “As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. Fresh discussion of Trump’s power to isolate regions of the U.S. was spurred Thursday by his comments in response to a question about whether he was considering travel restrictions to the states experiencing some of the most widespread infections, such as Washington and California. “We haven’t discussed that yet. Is it a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,” the president said during an Oval Office photo-op with the Irish prime minister. While experts say such measures would be ineffective — diverting resources better devoted to scaling up hospitals and aiding people in dire straits due to other impacts of the virus — they might be legally possible. Under the Public Health Service Act, federal authorities can quarantine individuals arriving in the U.S. by air, land or ship if they are suspected of infection with a list of diseases and syndromes set by executive order. The law also gives federal officials the power to try to check the spread of disease between states, although this authority is almost never used to fight human illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control, however, maintains that its quarantine powers go quite far. Regulations finalized by the Obama administration claim that federal officials can detain individuals if their illness could spread to other states. The rules essentially give the federal government the authority to stop and seize commuters in a bid to halt the spread of contagious disease. Whether it could allow a president to use the military to cordon off a city or a whole state is less clear, but experts say that the statutes and regulations could be read to allow for that. “The ability to restrain interstate travel is something that could be done, but the question is would it be done?” said Jennifer Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “These are the kinds of scenarios that you think would never happen but here we are.” But in this situation, Nuzzo said, it’s too late for that extreme measure. “There would be no public health benefit,” said Nuzzo, who studies government responses to health crises. “Over 40 states are reporting cases. … The horse is out of the barn. The disease is already here.” On Friday, Trump invoked his first significant emergency power since the coronavirus first appeared in January, declaring a national emergency.  In its declaration, the White House cited two laws — the 1988 Stafford Act, a disaster relief law, and the 1976 National Emergencies Act, the law Trump used to divert government funds to build a southern border wall.  For days, though, Trump had balked at exercising the power, even as he faced a chorus of calls from health groups, disaster relief specialists and Democrats to do so. According to people familiar with the situation, Trump had been reluctant to take the step because it could undermine his contention that the coronavirus outbreak is similar to seasonal flu. But he insisted on Thursday that he was more than willing to invoke any of his emergency authorities. “We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act. … And if I need to do something, I'll do it,” he said, adding cryptically, “I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.”  Trump has not previously been bashful about exercising his emergency powers. He was only seven days into his tenure when he issued the hugely controversial travel ban, sharply restricting the flow of people to the U.S. from mostly-Muslim countries. A series of court rulings blocked enforcement of the original ban, prompting the administration to redraft the order several times. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld a substantially pared-back version of the initial order. The policy — which critics called a “Muslim ban” — was based on the same legal authority Trump has since used to exclude foreign travelers from China and, now, from much of Europe, in response to the current virus. Many White House statements about the new virus-related travel restrictions go out of their way to explicitly cite the precise legal authority tapped in both instances, giving the president the power to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” The mentions seem to echo arguments the Justice Department made in the “Muslim ban” case. Lawyers repeatedly warned judges to be wary about restricting the power because it may be needed in a crisis.  Perhaps Trump’s most aggressive executive actions have involved money, namely his moves to spend billions of dollars on construction of a border wall with Mexico despite Congress’s unwillingness to fund that project — a signature of his 2016 campaign — at anywhere near the levels he has sought. Trump’s lawyers have cited powers Congress gave the president to reallocate military construction funds and to tap other funds for counter-drug activities.  Lower courts halted more than $6 billion of the funding, questioning Trump’s claims of an emergency and noting Congress’s rather explicit refusal to fund expansion of the wall. But the Supreme Court stepped in last year to allow Trump to proceed with the spending as litigation continues. Historically, officials at the state and local level have taken the most aggressive measures to address public health emergencies. In 1899 and 1900, officials in Honolulu and San Francisco cordoned off those cities’ Chinatown districts in a bid to control the bubonic plague, a move now viewed as heavily tainted by racism. Authorities in Hawaii even lit one home on fire in order to try to squelch the disease, but in the process burned down much of the neighborhood. Nothing similar has happened yet in the U.S. during the coronavirus outbreak, although governors are increasingly flexing their legal muscle.  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Thursday ordered the closure of all public schools in the state for two weeks. On the same day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued an executive order directing residents to eschew non-essential gatherings of more than 250 people. Newsom also tapped the state’s power to “commandeer” hotels, if needed, as temporary hospitals or quarantine centers.  And in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared a “containment zone” in New Rochelle, N.Y., to combat a virulent cluster of corona cases there. He even called out the national guard to assist with food distribution and other logistics in the city. Trump weighed in on the move at his photo-op Thursday, noting it isn’t a flat-out ban on movement or work. While he called the action “not very strong,” he seemed to welcome the fact that it would give locals the feeling “they’re being watched.” Some of the more severe travel limits the federal government can impose are quietly wielded in individual cases.  The CDC maintains a little publicized “do-not-board” list for domestic and international airline travel. Details on the list are thin, but it has included people with tuberculosis and measles. In 2015, CDC formally declared that individuals could be added to the list if they were suspected simply of being exposed to hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola. Back in 2007, an Atlanta lawyer drew national attention when he flew to Paris to get married and returned to the U.S. while suffering from drug-resistant tuberculosis. Doctors said they told him not to travel, but he insisted they never told him he could be contagious. He was eventually put under a federal quarantine order, but it turned out his disease was not the type most resistant to treatment. Typically, however, federal officials have relied on state and local health departments to address most disease outbreaks, even sometimes asking them to detain individuals who refuse to cooperate with doctors’ recommendations. But Trump has hostile relationships with the Democratic governors of the most affected states — Washington, California and New York. And if he wanted, he could have the CDC step in. Federal regulations give the CDC sweeping powers if a state’s measures “are insufficient” to prevent a disease from spreading into another state. The CDC chief is authorized to do what he or she “deems reasonably necessary” under those circumstances. Whether that includes widespread restrictions on movement is unclear. Parmet, the Northeastern University law professor, stresses that the Constitution still applies. Aggressive federal government action on such vague authority could face legal challenges, especially if the moves don’t have a scientific basis.  On the other hand, in a crisis judges tend to defer to executive authorities, including health officials. “The real danger is that these moves are taken just for show,” Parmet said. “At this point, where we are in the curve of this pandemic, there’s no magical legal elixir.”",What more could he do?

"Scott Gottlieb left the Trump administration nearly a year ago — but from Twitter to TV, he’s become the face of truth-telling about the coronavirus pandemic. The 47-year-old former Food and Drug Administration commissioner is providing blunt reality checks on talk shows and in congressional chambers, where his warnings about undetected outbreaks and testing delays starkly contrast with current administration officials’ assurances that the risk from the fast-spreading virus remains very low. “And all I say is, ‘Be calm.’ We have the greatest people in the world,” President Donald Trump told reporters on March 6 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “You never really know when something like this is going to strike and what it’s going to be.” Gottlieb had a different take. “People will suffer and die. The most vulnerable are at greatest risk,” Gottlieb tweeted the next morning. “We must all work together to protect them. The next few months will be hard, but we will preserve life, and eventually conquer this pathogen.” Gottlieb’s hard truths were finally embraced on Thursday morning by the president, who retweeted a series of Gottlieb’s warnings hours after Trump’s prime-time coronavirus address was widely panned. “We need to sacrifice some of the trappings of normal life to reduce the scope and severity of what’s ahead,” Gottlieb wrote — and Trump retweeted — in a series of tweets that also took shots at the ""void left by policy makers.” Gottlieb’s emergence has made him the rare Trump administration insider who’s found ways to critique his old colleagues’ decisions from outside while still maintaining respect in Trump's inner circle. In some ways his plain-spoken warnings mirror those of Anthony Fauci, the 79-year-old NIH infectious disease expert who’s become a mainstay at congressional and White House task force briefings even as he contradicts the president’s reassurances or optimistic timelines. Widespread mistrust of the administration’s take on the coronavirus has enhanced the role of an outsider like Gottlieb. And his ubiquity has made his estimates even more valued. Some have pointed to a coronavirus testing tracker that Gottlieb and the free market American Enterprise Institute established this week to estimate how many people could be tested for the infection each day — an initiative that aggravated some government health officials, despite Trump’s retweets. Gottlieb also suggested that health systems could run coronavirus tests on a high-volume platform developed by drug giant Roche weeks before the administration authorized the strategy on Friday. The Monday morning quarterbacking, especially around early testing stumbles, has particularly ruffled some feathers in the health department, where HHS Secretary Alex Azar is already dealing with criticism from White House officials — and where current FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has been virtually invisible on television during the crisis. “I don’t know what his endgame is,” said one official, criticizing Gottlieb’s high profile, arguing that some of it’s come at the expense of his successor. “What’s he trying to prove, and why does he keep stepping on Hahn?” Some officials also grumbled after Gottlieb penned Wall Street Journal editorials about preparedness in January and early February, claiming that his warnings about silent coronavirus spread were too alarmist — even if they’ve turned out to be true. It’s set up the media-savvy former FDA chief — who remains in frequent conversation with the White House and won as much bipartisan support as any Trump appointee while in office — for inevitable run-ins with current health officials who don’t have the latitude to make the same kind of policy pronouncements. “He can say things that maybe the government would like to say because he has an authority,” said a source close to HHS. But at the end of the day: “They are making decisions that are going to affect 350 million Americans. He’s not.” Others on the inside of the coronavirus battle say Gottlieb has been indispensable to the White House and Pence in particular on response strategy. They say consternation is rooted in Azar’s insecurity about his role and concerns that he could be undercut by Gottlieb, who had been rumored as a shortlist pick for a so-called coronavirus czar. “I think good leaders want to bring the strongest, smartest minds in and surround themselves,” said one administration official. “But that’s not what they’re doing [at HHS].” A source close to Azar disputed that characterization and frustration with Gottlieb, and the idea Azar that has been sidelined.  Gottlieb was seen at the White House ahead of Trump's emergency declaration on the coronavirus pandemic, according to a source, and he later praised Trump's Rose Garden event. Gottlieb declined to comment for this story. He now divides his time between a fellowship at the American Enterprise Institute, serving on a handful of drug company boards and a career as a talking head who has the rare ability to explain complicated science in a way ordinary people can understand. Some of that has been to the administration’s adversaries on Capitol Hill. The libertarian doctor’s activist agenda as FDA chief, on everything from e-cigarettes to nutrition, often put him at odds with the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory approach. But Gottlieb sold his proposals well — and left the administration on rare good footing with the White House and lawmakers from both parties in Congress. “You do have big shoes to fill,” Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.) told Hahn, Gottlieb’s successor, at a House hearing Wednesday where Democrats grilled him on the flawed White House response to the coronavirus. Just one day earlier, Gottlieb gave his take on the state of the outbreak to Pocan and the rest of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at their invitation. “We don’t have a whole lot of, honestly, Trump appointees, American Enterprise Institute employees, come by to brief the Progressive Caucus. But he got it because we respect him so much,” Pocan told Hahn. Meanwhile, HHS has said it doesn’t know how many tests have been done, and the CDC has dropped its own count from its website. Instead, the administration has been updating how many tests have been shipped to labs, not how fast the troubled testing program can turn them around. Azar said the CDC is working to get its own testing tracker up. Gottlieb also has stepped into a void around Hahn, who has kept a low profile throughout the crisis — posting relatively few coronavirus tweets, making no appearances on prime-time TV programs, and waiting a month before the White House even added him to its coronavirus task force. And when asked about the testing numbers his predecessor is projecting, Hahn said it’s complicated. “I would want to get you the most accurate information possible,” he told lawmakers. Hahn, a cancer doctor and health system administrator, is constrained in ways that Gottlieb is not, allies argue. Two administration officials said that early testing delays were rooted in Azar’s decision early on to leave Hahn off the coronavirus task force, where he could have coordinated more easily with CDC Director Robert Redfield to let private labs roll out their own tests. “He wasn’t given the opportunity to be involved and that’s what created the problems,” said one administration official. Hahn was eventually brought on the task force, along with Surgeon General Jerome Adams and CMS Administrator Seema Verma, after Vice President Mike Pence was tapped to take the lead. An HHS spokesperson said Hahn has been involved in briefing Azar and others from the very beginning and Azar is pleased he is part of the task force. “We are and have been focused on addressing this public health emergency, and not who was appointed to the task force or when,” Hahn said in a statement to POLITICO. Yet what looked like early stumbles and confusion among administration officials has driven frustration among lawmakers — and now they are turning to Gottlieb. “I just feel that there's been such confusion and miscommunication at the presidential level that we're constantly playing catch-up,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) whose state has reported at least nine cases of coronavirus. “Even though he's on the conservative side, you know the ideas that he's pushing forward are important and they've been smart,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who attended Gottlieb’s closed-door briefing with progressive members and whose state has become the U.S. epicenter of the outbreak. “His deep-seated interest in public health issues is genuine, it’s who he was before. It’s just getting more attention, it’s magnified now,” said a former HHS official. “What’s the long game? He’s going to keep writing op-eds.” Adam Cancryn contributed to this report.",The shadow coronavirus czar,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/shadow-coronavirus-czar-scott-gottlieb-129563,politico
"Virtually the entire Democratic presidential primary has been predicated on one underlying assumption: the eventual collapse of Joe Biden. More than a dozen of his erstwhile opponents bet their campaigns on it, and he’s proven them all wrong. But his last serious opponent standing, Bernie Sanders, is still clinging to the same belief — and that it will finally happen on Sunday night, under the bright lights of their one-on-one debate. To revive his campaign, Sanders needs to prove he’s the best candidate to take on President Donald Trump and lead the country at a time of duress, his aides and allies say. But they also acknowledge privately it’s going to take more than that — namely, for the gaffe-prone Biden to stumble. “In the best-case scenario, Bernie dominates the debate and the arguments. He has one or two good one-liners,” said Mark Longabaugh, a former senior adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign. “And obviously the flip side would be Biden has a lackluster debate and maybe makes a mistake. All that coming together maybe causes some pause and hesitation on the part of voters.” It’s a tall order: Biden has won 14 of the 20 states that have voted this month, and he’s polling about 20 to 40 percentage points ahead of Sanders in the states that cast ballots on Tuesday. To make matters worse for Sanders, Tuesday was going to be difficult for him even in the best-case scenario: Its biggest delegate prize is Florida, home to many older, moderate Democrats and Cuban exiles who eschew his left-wing politics. It is also a closed primary where only Democrats can vote, and Sanders typically performs better in races where independents can participate. The reality of the situation isn’t lost on Sanders’ aides. “We’re not naïve,” said Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ campaign manager. “It’s going to be a hard path.” During an all-staff call Thursday evening, Sanders’ national organizing and field director, Misty Rebik, admitted to the team that it was facing an uphill battle — but it has always been that way, she tried to assure them. Sanders himself has appeared less confident on the campaign trail in the last few weeks, even looking downcast at a round-table with workers in Michigan, which is the type of event where he usually seems most upbeat. At the same time, Sanders’ staffers truly believe the trajectory of the race could change — that the campaign that somehow found itself in a stronger position after Sanders suffered a heart attack last fall could have another improbable comeback. They argue that the primary has been volatile, and that Biden himself trailed in the first three primary and caucus states before leapfrogging to frontrunner. They also point out that former presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar have surged in polls after strong performance debate performances. “I don’t know if you’ve seen Joe Biden lately, but he doesn’t like to be told he’s wrong,” said a Sanders adviser. “We’re going to take him on around the issues and make him defend his record. He’s deflected on those in earlier debates because there’s so much chatter happening on the stage. But when you’re one-on-one, you change the dynamic.” It’s unclear how aggressive Sanders will be with Biden. Some of Sanders’ staffers and supporters have been frustrated by what they see as his light touch with his former Senate colleague, whom Sanders likes and considers a friend. Even with Hillary Clinton, Sanders often lacked a killer instinct, famously telling her in a 2015 debate that “the American people are sick and tired about hearing about your damn emails!” Sanders, who doesn’t practice in mock debates while readying for showdowns, did not change his strategy during debate prep last week. “I know it’s shocking for you to hear that Bernie Sanders remained consistent in his approach,” joked Shakir. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group closely aligned with Elizabeth Warren, urged Sanders to stay in the race to debate the former vice president and prevent a “quick Biden coronation.” Given that Sanders this week laid out several questions he plans to ask Biden during the debate, Green doesn’t “expect Bernie to attempt a knockout punch like Elizabeth Warren did to Michael Bloomberg.” But, he added, “In this new coronavirus world, he has a very legitimate case that Democrats defeat Trump if we stand for universal free health care, paid sick leave, student debt cancellation, and a government that actually works for people. If he presses Biden in good faith to agree, he both makes Biden more electable and proves himself more electable — a win-win that lessens objections to him staying in the race this month."" In the Sanders campaign’s ideal world, aides said, he would win the debate, which would give him enough momentum to carry at least one of the four states voting on Tuesday. His aides see Arizona — partly because he has performed strongly among Latino voters — and Illinois as the best possibilities. In their view, that could change the narrative about Sanders’ campaign being all but done, and allow them to potentially win states voting later this primary, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and New York. To gain steam, ""you have to do it by initially suggesting the storyline was wrong about Bernie"" being finished, said Shakir. “Right now, I’m not sure that anyone — correct me if I’m wrong — is suggesting that we will win in any of those four states. Hopefully we can turn that around.” Another reason the Sunday debate looms so large in the Sanders team’s mind is because his aides believe that voters who have seen Biden up close in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire have not supported him. A Biden adviser said of that notion, ""South Carolinians have seen Joe Biden up close for decades. They chose him overwhelmingly."" For Sanders, the debate is also an opportunity to nudge Biden to the left, a familiar position for the politician who successfully pulled Clinton in his direction during his unsuccessful 2016 bid. Sanders sees the coronavirus outbreak as a red flag that America’s health care system is dysfunctional, and that the country needs “Medicare for All” and other liberal policies. “There are 28 million people who are currently uninsured. How are we going to pay for their treatment and their testing? How are we going to deal with seniors who are seeing their retirement accounts hit, other than by expanding Social Security?” asked Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair. “The coronavirus and the uncertainty around it, the economic uncertainty, gives a way of having Sen. Sanders talk about his policies. Not just in an aspirational, abstract sense, but in a way of here and now.” During the Thursday all-staff call, Shakir and other senior aides said that campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic meant that they would need to focus more on their digital operation and “distributed organizing” strategy, which, they argued, are superior to Biden’s.  The digital gap between the two campaigns was on display Friday, when the Biden operation struggled with technical difficulties during its first virtual town hall. Since Sanders first announced he was running in 2020, his team has livestreamed almost every public event. But if the coronavirus has shifted voters toward a candidate so far, it’s Biden. Exit polls found Democratic primary voters trust Biden more than Sanders to lead during a crisis by double-digit margins. Sanders’ team aims to change that — and everything else — on Sunday. ""You don't run for president if you're not in it to win,” said Khanna. ""He’s hoping the debate will change the dynamic.” Laura Barron-Lopez contributed to this report.",Sanders bets on Biden debate implosion,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-129418,politico
"SEATTLE, Wash.—As of Friday, the coronavirus outbreak is officially a national emergency. But while most Americans are only just becoming familiar with social distancing and quarantining, Washington state has been dealing with the crisis since the first U.S. case was discovered there on January 20. The Seattle area, in particular, has become Ground Zero in the United States after the first death from the epidemic on February 29. Now, the buzzing birthplace of Starbucks and home of tech giants like Amazon has, in large part, shut down, foreshadowing what could come for the rest of the country. In Washington’s most populated city, large events and entire sports seasons are being cancelled or postponed; schools, libraries, community centers and the zoo are closing; some hospitals and prisons have banned visitors; and public health officials are urging businesses to allow employees to work remotely. Governor Jay Inslee has banned gatherings of 250 or more people in three counties, including Seattle’s King County. A usually bustling city is now eerily silent and still. Over the last week, Seattle-based photographer Chona Kasinger documented the ghost town that it’s become. Text by Ruairí Arrieta-Kenna. Pike Place Market is usually a hub of activity, filled with locals and tourists buying fish, flowers or produce. But what would usually be a busy weekend for the century-old farmers’ market was instead a sleepy Sunday on March 8—after the statewide total of known coronavirus cases crossed into triple digits and the number of deaths into double digits. Since King County officials urged employers on March 4 to allow people to work remotely, the once traffic-heavy city of Seattle has come to a near standstill. While many restaurants and shops remain open, many would-be patrons are staying home, and some businesses are starting to close. According to the Seattle Times, more than 50 restaurants and bars, including a dozen by local celebrity chef Tom Douglas, have already shut their doors in the past two weeks. In Seattle, much like other parts of the country, stores have been marked by long lines and low supplies as people stock up on provisions. The coronavirus is known to be deadlier to people over 60, with the vast majority of the 32 deaths in King County as of Saturday linked to a single retirement community. While young people have generally been spared from the virus’ worst symptoms and might feel less hesitant to avoid public places, state officials are weighing even more drastic measures to make sure they don’t become carriers of the disease.",America’s Coronavirus Ground Zero,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/15/seattle-ghost-town-coronavirus-ground-zero-128720,politico
"TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s official leading the response to the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East on Sunday acknowledged that the pandemic could overwhelm health facilities in the country, which is under severe U.S. sanctions. Muslim authorities, meanwhile, announced that the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam, would be closed indefinitely due to concerns about the outbreak, with prayers continuing to be held on the sprawling esplanade outside. Similar measures have been taken at the nearby Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, where outdoor prayers continue but only 10 people at a time are permitted in enclosed areas, in keeping with measures taken by the Israeli government. Iran is battling one of the worst outbreaks outside China. On Sunday the Health Ministry reported 113 more deaths, bringing the country’s death toll to 724 amid 13,938 confirmed cases. The real number of infections could be even higher, as questions have been raised about the government’s transparency. “If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity,” Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak, was quoted as saying earlier by the state-run IRNA news agency. Iran is believed to have around 110,000 hospital beds, including 30,000 in the capital, Tehran. Authorities have pledged to set up mobile clinics as needed. Zali also acknowledged that “many” of those who have died from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus were otherwise healthy, a rare admission by local authorities that the virus does not only prey on the sick and elderly. Health Ministry figures show that while 55% of fatalities were in their 60s, some 15% were younger than 40. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Most people recover in a matter of weeks. The virus has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,800. More than 70,000 people worldwide have recovered after being infected. In Iran, the virus has infected a number of senior officials, including the senior vice president, Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, Revolutionary Guard members and Health Ministry officials. Authorities have nevertheless been slow to adopt measures taken by other hard-hit countries. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday ruled out a general quarantine and said the government was working to keep the borders open. Dalia Samhouri, a senior regional official with the World Health Organization, said both Iran and Egypt, two of the most populous countries in the Middle East, were likely underreporting cases because of the nature of the virus, which can be spread by individuals who show no visible symptoms. “We can easily say that the current figures are an underestimation of the actual figures,” she said. Iran has struggled to respond in part because of crippling sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. The U.S. says it has offered humanitarian aid but that Iran has rejected it. Countries across the Middle East have imposed sweeping travel restrictions, canceled public events and in some cases called on non-essential businesses to close for the coming weeks. In the skyscraper-studded city of Dubai, a global business and travel hub in the United Arab Emirates, authorities announced on Sunday that all movie theaters, arcades and gyms would be closed through the end of the month. Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, also shut down its amusement parks and museums through the end of the month, including Louvre Abu Dhabi. The UAE’s central bank meanwhile announced a $27 billion stimulus package directed at supporting banks and said regulatory limits on loans will be eased. Saudi Arabia announced its own $13 billion stimulus plan. Al-Aqsa is the latest in a series of religious sites where access has been halted or strictly limited. Saudi Arabia has halted the umrah pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina and could be forced to limit or cancel the much larger haj later this year. On Sunday, it announced the temporary closure of all mosques and called off Friday prayers. Sheikh Omar Kiswani, the director of the Al-Aqsa mosque, said Sunday that the closure of the mosque and other buildings on the compound, including the iconic golden Dome of the Rock, would continue indefinitely. The religious site is also the holiest in Judaism because it was the location of the two Jewish temples in antiquity. Israel occupied and annexed east Jerusalem in the 1967 war in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state, and the religious site has often been a flashpoint in the decades-long conflict. Israel imposed sweeping travel and quarantine measures more than a week ago but has seen its number of confirmed cases double in recent days, to around 200. On Saturday, the government said restaurants, malls, movies, gyms and daycare centers would close. Schools and universities have already been shut down until next month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s trial on serious corruption charges, which was supposed to begin this week, was postponed for two months due to restrictions on public gatherings. Netanyahu has meanwhile been pressing for an emergency unity government with his main rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, following three inconclusive elections and more than a year of political deadlock. Gantz has appeared open to the idea. Jordan, which had previously reported just one infection in a man who later recovered, confirmed six new cases. Four are French tourists while the other two are Jordanians, Health Minister Saad Jaber said Sunday. Jordan has suspended all flights into and out of the kingdom except for aid workers and diplomats, and has closed schools for two weeks. It has also banned the smoking of hookahs, or water pipes, in cafes.",Iran says worsening outbreak could strain health facilities,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/iran-says-worsening-outbreak-could-strain-health-facilities-129895,politico
"Bernie Sanders is facing a host of questions before Sunday’s debate. How directly will he challenge Joe Biden? Is he betting on a miraculous turnaround in Florida, Illinois and Ohio? Or is he effectively conceding the nomination, and staying in the race just to try to convince Biden to embrace more of the Sanders agenda? But Biden is the 2020 candidate who faces the more consequential question in this debate: How far will he go to embrace Sanders out of a desire for party unity, and how much of a risk is he taking by doing so? Here, history provides a cautionary lesson. When the presumptive presidential nominee of a political party goes too far to placate a noisy ideological minority, the results can backfire—and might even presage defeat in November. Back in 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon was in a position not all that different from Biden’s. He was on a glide path to the Republican presidential nomination. His most likely challenger, New York governor Nelson Rockefeller, had taken himself out of the running at the end of 1959, declaring that “this decision is definite and final.” But by the summer of 1960, Rocky was showing unmistakable signs that he might be changing his mind. In June, after a White House meeting, he issued a blistering statement arguing that “those now assuming control of the Republican Party have failed to make clear where the party is heading and where it proposes to lead the nation. … I find it unreasonable in these times that the leading Republican candidate for the presidential nomination has firmly insisted upon making known his program and his policies not before, but only after nomination by this party.” He called Ike the next day to test the possibility of a presidential endorsement of his candidacy. There was, in fact, virtually no support within the Republican establishment for a Rockefeller run, just like there is very little support in the Democratic establishment for a Sanders presidency today. But that did not stop the New York governor from challenging his party, specifically on its platform, on issues ranging from defense spending (he wanted a lot more) to civil rights to medical care. And that challenge was one Richard Nixon desperately wanted to avoid. So, without consulting his advisors, Nixon sought a personal meeting with Rockefeller. It was granted, on terms that very much made Nixon look like a supplicant. He had to publicly ask for the meeting, which also had to be at Rockefeller’s Fifth Avenue triplex in Manhattan. And most important. when Nixon left the meeting at 3 a.m., he and Rockefeller had signed onto platform language that more or less repudiated Eisenhower and the Republicans across a range of concerns—especially on the civil rights. On that issue, the Compact’s strong language (“aggressive action to remove the remaining vestiges of segregation or discrimination in all areas of national life” and “support for the objectives of the sit-in demonstrators”) was admirable, but it undermined the tightrope Nixon was intending to walk between his party’s Northern liberals and its Southern whites. The document—labeled “the Compact of Fifth Avenue”—was the political equivalent of a hand grenade. Conservatives, who carried a deep antipathy toward the deep-pocketed Eastern internationalist wing of the GOP that had denied them a presidential nomination for two decades, were furious that Nixon had bent the knee to the symbolic leader of that wing. Some were angry enough to place in nomination the name of an emerging conservative hero, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Addressing the convention that summer, Goldwater said: “Let’s grow up, conservatives. … If we want to take this party back—and I think we can someday—let’s go to work.” Just four years later, Goldwater won the nomination before going down to a landslide loss in November to President Lyndon Johnson. The Republican Party did not adopt the Nixon-Rockefeller language on civil rights, but that language did cause Nixon a significant headache as he sought to replicate the gains in the South that Eisenhower, who carried Texas and Louisiana in 1956, had made in previous elections. So what’s the lesson here for Biden? It’s that he needs to walk a fine line between respecting Sanders and his base, and accommodating too many of their ideas, which Biden has explicitly opposed throughout the campaign. When they were offered a clear, binary choice between Sanders and a less militantly left candidate, Democratic voters went for the relative centrist by significant margins. Seemingly out of nowhere, a broad coalition emerged—led by landslide majorities of African-Americans—that that rejected the idea that a “political revolution” was the key to winning the White House. They support comprehensive immigration reform and protection for “the Dreamers”—but they do not necessarily support free health care and college tuition for the undocumented. They favor restoring voting rights for felons who have served their time; they do not necessarily support voting rights for felons who are still in prison. They favor expanded health care, but they do not favor a plan that would effectively abolish all private health insurance. For the presumptive nominee of a party—which is what Biden is very close to becoming—there is a point where reaching out to unify the party crosses over into appeasement. Something like that almost happened in 1980, when Ronald Reagan came close to offering former president Gerald Ford the vice presidential slot on his ticket. Emissaries for Ford, including Henry Kissinger, were busily negotiating a range of duties for Ford that would have amounted (in Walter Cronkite’s words) to “something of a co-presidency”. It would have been a confession of weakness, a signal that Reagan doubted his own capacity for the job of chief executive. Luckily for the Gipper, the deal fell apart. Biden should recognize the spirited campaigns Sanders has run, the passion of his followers, and his achievement in forcing the Democratic Party to confront the nation’s yawning inequality, which requires major repair. And he should highlight his own ideas about increased taxes on the wealthy, criminal justice reform, and an ambitious health care plan that address some, but not all, of concerns of the Sanders’ supporters. But Biden also needs to act in a way that reminds his party and his country who is winning the most votes from Democrats and who will almost surely prevail when the convention assembles in Milwaukee. One more point: when and if the two meet for an endorsement rally, it would be wise to hold it in Wilmington, not Burlington.",Why Biden Shouldn’t Unify Too Much with Sanders,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/15/biden-sanders-debate-2020-128731,politico
"The Trump administration is struggling to win back the confidence of hospital leaders after three years of pitched battles, with the industry pushing for urgent help from the White House as the coronavirus crisis begins to swamp emergency rooms. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma on Friday announced new moves to roll back industry regulations, two days after hospitals pled their case to Verma in a White House meeting that left many unsatisfied. Among the changes: Streamlined deployment of doctors, fewer time-consuming inspections and less red tape around how hospitals run operations during a crisis. “It gives hospitals and providers on the front lines the maximum flexibility so that they can focus on patients that need help,” Verma said on “Fox and Friends” on Saturday. The American Hospital Association hailed the moves as a “solid step.” But hospital leaders say that the new announcements only touch the surface of their needs, as they worry about shortages of crucial supplies, risks to their workers and the possibility of an industry bailout as coronavirus patients swarm their facilities. An expert on an American Hospital Association webinar last month predicted as many as 1.9 million ICU admissions from the coronavirus outbreak over the next few months, swamping existing facilities. There are only about 100,000 ICU beds across the U.S. health system. Meanwhile, the cost of care for some severely ill coronavirus patients has already been estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, as hospitals deploy significant measures to keep the patients alive while protecting their own workers against infection. At least three hospital systems in Seattle, the center of the nation's most extensive outbreak, have already announced a halt on elective procedures in order to devote more resources toward the coronavirus patients already swarming their facilities. “I think there will be hospitals that could be pushed to the edge financially,” said Chip Kahn, head of the for-profit Federation of American Hospitals, warning that hospitals will absorb a surge of coronavirus cases while postponing elective procedures that tend to be better for hospitals’ bottom lines. Some hospital leaders have quietly floated that they’ll need federal funding to pay for rented hotels or other arrangements as their hospital wards are quickly overrun by the coronavirus outbreak. The risk of failure is severe: Public health experts have warned that the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, which is in its early days, could be on track to resemble the increasingly dire situation in Italy, where patients have overwhelmed that nation’s health system. That’s left hospitals calling for extreme measures from the White House and scrambling to prepare emergency steps of their own while they wait for a response. But in the face of the looming crisis, hospital executives said that leaders were underwhelmed by their Wednesday meeting with Verma, who spent much of the hour-long session taking notes but failed to calm industry fears about swamped emergency rooms and medical supply shortages, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence briefly joined the meeting but departed to join other officials as they worked to prepare the president for his Oval Office address. “For our guys, it did not scream confidence,” said one individual briefed on the meeting. “We came out of it with bigger questions about whether the administration has done its homework to protect the supply chain,” as hospitals try to stock up on masks, swabs and other key materials that could quickly become hard to find, said another individual. Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, compared the current situation to a “World War II mentality, where we’re going to have to put extra shifts on in manufacturing and get this stuff out the door.” “The only one that can do that is the federal government, and we need the president and vice president to make a priority of that,” he said. Kahn, who was among the attendees at Wednesday’s meeting, praised Verma but put responsibility for the administration’s slow start on the White House, contending that federal health officials had to wait for authorization to get started on a series of initiatives. But hospital leaders haven’t had time alone with President Donald Trump — even as leaders of other health sectors, like the insurance industry, the pharma industry and the lab industry, have been granted extended face-to-face meetings with the president and Pence. CMS didn't respond to questions about the meeting with Verma, but defended its efforts to engage the hospital industry. A spokesperson pointed to a new weekly call to brief hospitals on coronavirus — with the first call with FDA Commissioner Steve Hahn drawing more than 1,600 listeners — and other steps to build closer ties. ""CMS created a strategic working group with the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals which began meeting last Monday,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the group included a ""small number"" of hospital CEOs. ""We believe that for the health system to respond adequately to the coronavirus, the entire health system must be engaged,"" the spokesperson added. The tensions between hospitals and the Trump administration have persisted for years. The hospital industry went to war with the White House in 2017 over Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying that rolling back the sweeping health law would harm patients and do damage to their bottom lines. They’ve continued that fight as Trump has tried to strike down the law in court, with American Hospital Association CEO Rick Pollack calling the position “misguided.” Hospitals also have fought over numerous Medicaid changes spearheaded by Verma, including a new “fiscal accountability” proposal that would tighten hospitals’ ability to collect Medicaid funding. Hospitals currently use a variety of financial arrangements to pump up their Medicaid revenue, such as supporting state taxes that allow them to draw down even more money in federal matching funds. Verma has called the arrangements industry-friendly gimmicks and wants to do away with them. “Hospitals were already concerned about the rule — and moreso with coronavirus staring them in the face,” said Joel McElvain, a partner in King & Spalding’s health care group who’s represented hospitals in lawsuits against the administration. McElvain warned that states would need to come up with new financial arrangements to support hospitals if the rule, a top priority for Verma, is finalized during the coronavirus outbreak. “It’s a time when rural hospitals are already struggling and facing real difficulty if worst-case scenarios come true in the coming weeks,” McElvain said. Meanwhile, hospitals have spent years fighting back against a slew of Trump administration funding cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and public health initiatives. Among Trump’s most recent proposals: an $18 million cut to the federal health department’s own hospital preparedness program, announced just last month, on the eve of the coronavirus outbreak. “The hospital preparedness program exists so hospitals prepare for this exact thing,” said a former HHS official. “The whole point is to prepare them so they can respond to all hazards - from hurricanes to pandemics to biological attacks.” While Trump’s battles with the pharmaceutical industry have gotten considerable headlines, some of his aides have believed that hospitals were a larger problem, citing the costs that ever-larger systems have passed along to patients and pointing to policies that they say gamed the system. They also haven’t agreed with hospitals’ warnings that their bottom lines have suffered under this administration. “The argument is so ridiculous,” said Brian Blase, who advised Trump on health policy before leaving the White House last year. “I don’t think there are a lot of policies that came out that took revenue away from hospitals,” he added, noting that hospitals successfully sued to block Trump’s billion-dollar cut to a drug-discount program and other regulations opposed by hospitals have been similarly stalled. Amid the historic public health threat, hospital officials are loath to renew a public battle too and criticize the administration. “We have been very clear that we have had serious concerns with a number of other policies from the Administration, including the issues of Medicaid expansion and cuts to hospital outpatient department visits,” a spokesperson for the American Hospital Association told POLITICO. “Right now, of course, our focus is on working with the government and other stakeholders at all levels to address the current emergency.” But some hospital leaders did express frustration on Saturday after Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that hospitals may need to postpone elective surgeries to handle the crush of coronavirus patients. “Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!” Adams tweeted on Saturday, adding that such procedures could further the coronavirus spread, tax medical stockpiles and put further pressure on doctors and nurses. The message from the nation’s top doctor was seen as alarmist and premature, worrying hospital officials that it would prompt patients to postpone crucial care. “I do think it’s unfortunate what the surgeon general said,” said Kahn, adding that he hoped Adams and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who similarly warned of the need to cancel some procedures, would walk back their statements. “I don’t think we’re anywhere near a point where we know we would have to do something like that.” The coronavirus outbreak has served as justification of hospitals’ yearslong warnings over federal policies that the industry saw as hamstringing their finances and preparedness, executives said. Now, the same government that sought to cut pay rates and layer on new regulations is relying on hospitals as the nation’s chief defense against the pandemic. “Governments tend to, on a day-to-day basis, underestimate the importance of the health care community and look at it not so much as an economic contribution as an economic deficit,” Raske said, emphasizing that the attitude extends well beyond the Trump administration. “That tendency hits reality in a crisis.” Hospital leaders also have warned about the dearth of ventilators to treat the sickest patients — an issue that Verma has failed to directly address in multiple interviews, including being grilled by Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday night over whether hospitals will have enough. ""You know, Tucker, I don't want to make drastic predictions here, right?"" Verma said. ""Because this situation is changing every single day. And based on the information we have, we know that we have to be aggressive,"" she added, touting yesterday's moves to increase flexibility for hospitals and relax regulations. “That was one of the most incompetent and absolutely incoherent responses to what’s going on right now,” Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease expert, told Carlson a few minutes later. CMS did not directly respond to questions about whether there is a dearth of ventilators. Meanwhile, hospital executives have noted the dark irony of Washington’s sudden focus on mass treatment capacity after years of efforts to crack down on hospital reimbursement prompted providers to shrink their facilities. “I’m really worried about how, when this finally blows over, what Congress does,” said one lobbyist. “Are we actually going to learn from this?” “We love hospitals,” countered Blase, Trump’s former health policy adviser. “Hospitals are going to be at the front lines of this and have an enormous job. But there shouldn’t be policies that give them advantages they shouldn’t have.”",Trump now needs the hospitals he's alienated,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/trump-hospitals-coronavirus-129743,politico
"Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton, a freshman senator up for reelection in November, launched a highly unusual new TV ad this week.  The content was standard, pro-Trump, anti-Democrat fare. What was very atypical was that it aired hundreds of miles from his home state, in Ohio.  As it turns out, the ad had nothing to do with Cotton’s current campaign, and everything to do with the one he’s eyeing four years from now — for the White House. He and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are running commercials aimed at raising their profiles in key electoral battlegrounds and — perhaps more important — ingratiating themselves with President Donald Trump and his supporters, who could prove critical in any future Republican presidential primary contest. The twin offensives underscore how the 2024 Republican presidential primary is already underway even as Trump is battling for a second term. Republicans with future national aspirations are hitting early primary states, jockeying to win the favor of major donors, and auditioning before conservative activists. Cotton has started running a hard-hitting spot in Ohio targeting Joe Biden over his policies toward China. He is expected to ramp it up even further with a forthcoming commercial assailing the former vice president for his criticism of Trump’s response to the coronavirus, which is widely thought to have originated in the country. Scott has run a pair of commercials, one in Iowa going after Biden on his family’s ties to Ukraine and the other in his home state, savaging Bernie Sanders for his past praise of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.  Aside from getting Trump's back, Cotton and Scott are using the spots to introduce themselves to voters. Both appear prominently: While Scott is face-to-camera, Cotton’s features a side-by-side shot of him with the president. Cotton, an Iraq War veteran, is seen wearing combat uniform with a machine gun strapped to his chest. In separate interviews, neither Scott nor Cotton explicitly denied interest in running for president in four years. They deflected questions about whether their efforts could help position them for presidential runs down the line, saying they were just interested in bolstering Trump. “We know that we’re a closely-divided country when it comes to politics,” Cotton said. “And any person that Democrats nominate, the president is going to take seriously [and] I personally take seriously.” Cotton said he was considering expanding his advertising campaign to other battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have lost manufacturing jobs to China. Cotton is spending five figures to air the new ad, which began running on Ohio TV stations this week. It will also appear as a digital spot nationally. He is expected to invest six figures on the upcoming coronavirus-focused spot. The 42-year-old Arkansas senator is a sure bet to win reelection, allowing him to use his war chest to assist the president and Republicans running down-ballot. He has more than $4.5 million in his campaign account, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. “I can focus on helping the president win reelection and helping my colleagues in difficult states win reelection as well,” said Cotton, who for a time was mentioned as a potential Trump pick to be CIA director. “Let’s just say that I have more time on my hands.” Scott drew notice in January when he began airing an anti-Biden spot in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. In response, the former vice president joked that Scott was “so interested, as a senator from Florida, whether or not I should win an Iowa caucus.”  “Isn't that fascinating?” Biden asked. “Pretty amazing.""  Scott, a multimillionaire former hospital executive, spent five figures on both of his spots. His second commercial, a Spanish language spot, is running in his home state of Florida. Scott said he was open to taking other steps to engage in the 2020 presidential contest. He is also working to establish goodwill with his Senate colleagues. Last week, he invited a half-dozen Republican candidates up for election in 2020, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, onto his private plane to hopscotch across Florida for a series of fundraisers. The events netted about $1.7 million, which will be distributed to each of the candidates running in November. Some of those on the jaunt speculated that Scott might be interested in serving as a future National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, a perch that would give the Florida senator entrée to a wide swath of prominent GOP donors. By taking the unexpected step of running pro-Trump ads, Cotton and Scott are making a clear play for the president’s supporters at a time when fealty to the commander-in-chief defines the party. Regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, many in the party are convinced that Trump will play an outsize role in determining the future of the party — including who sits atop the 2024 ticket. “Primary voters pay attention to these things,” said Jim McLaughlin, a veteran Republican pollster who is working on Trump’s reelection effort. McLaughlin, who worked on a pro-Scott super PAC during the 2018 midterms, said the Florida Republican’s move helped him “stand out, which is not always easy to do when you’re a senator.” Cotton and Scott are also filling a vacuum. While Democratic primary candidates clog the TV airwaves, the president has gotten relatively little cover. Trump’s reelection campaign has focused much of its advertising on digital outlets, while the main super PAC supporting the president is husbanding its resources for later. The senators said they had each spoken with the Trump team about their efforts. Cotton noted that he had personally chatted with the president about his belief that China would play a central role in the general election. “Sen. Scott and Sen. Cotton have been strong allies of the president,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. “Their support is much appreciated.” Both men have taken other steps to position themselves for 2024. Later this spring, Cotton is slated to headline a political dinner in New Hampshire, a key early primary state. He is also helping one of the state's Republican Senate candidates, Don Bolduc. Cotton has filmed a TV ad for Bolduc that is expected to run later this spring. Scott visited the state prior to last month’s New Hampshire primary to stump for Trump. The Florida senator indicated he hadn’t given much thought about 2024 or how his efforts might affect what unfolds in the coming years. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said. “There’s always a risk-reward, right?""",2 senators take extreme measures to show allegiance to Trump,2020-03-14,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/14/cotton-scott-trump-128972,politico
"America’s top infectious diseases expert expressed concern over the crush of travelers stuck in airports trying to return home in light of new travel restrictions from Europe, urging Americans to remain calm and so not overwhelm the world’s airports. This weekend’s implementation of the new restrictions announced only days earlier has spurred a mad dash for Americans abroad to return home, causing backups and massive crowds in airports across the country. In response to the mess at Chicago‘s O’Hare Airport, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together.“ But Anothony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that the bottleneck is “countermanding” efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. “We would like to not see crowds like that,” Fauci told “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace, promising that Americans need not worry about being able to get back into the country.  “I think what people need to understand is if you're an American citizen, if you are a family member you can get back. You don't need to rush back, you will be able to get back,” he pledged. While Fauci called the panic “understandable,” he admitted that “unfortunately” the rush is unlikely to abate. The rollout of the Trump administration’s new travel restrictions barring foreigners from Europe — which the World Health Organization this weekend called the new “epicenter” of the pandemic — faced a torrent of criticism and backlash from stranded travelers and officials alike over the weekend. The White House was panned first for its lack of clarity surrounding who the ban applied to, prompting administration officials to pan out on television to do clean up duty for President Donald Trump's initial announcement.  Trump implemented similar restrictions for foreigners from China and Iran earlier in the year as the virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, quickly began to spread across the globe. But those restrictions were put in place before the respiratory disease really took hold within the U.S., which has since seen thousands of cases. But Fauci said Sunday that there are much more worrying considerations than the inconvenience of travelers during a time when Americans have been asked to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “Obviously whenever you have crowds — that's the thing we've been talking about that we really want to implement is to have that kind of social separation,” he said. Airport crowding “is countermanding that, and hopefully people understand you don't have to rush back.”  Asked whether there was anything airports could do to try and mitigate the rush, Fauci said he wasn’t sure, other than “to try and encourage people to tell them that if you are an American citizen, you will be able to get back, it's not going to be a problem.” ",Fauci to Americans abroad: ‘You will be able to get back’,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-travel-airports-130104,politico
"If you’re in angst-ridden quarantine, you’ll probably be finding it hard to take your mind off things. One high-risk strategy — not for those of a nervous disposition — is to dive headlong into some of literature’s most horrific plagues, from Sophocles to Camus, to put things in perspective. There’s some solace in the unity of human experience over the centuries. Big themes — terrifying incomprehension, the vulnerability of doctors and the emergence of cynical profiteers — recur across the centuries. Do you feel guilty about your obsessive addiction to the daily tolls of infections and deaths? Well, the English writers Samuel Pepys and Daniel Defoe shared exactly the same fascination. If you are ever feeling really down, remember Giovanni Boccaccio’s cheery observation from the 14th century that in plague-infested days “a dead man was then of no more account than a dead goat.” See, you must be feeling better already … Here are some feel-good classics: The quintessential novel about how the human psyche reacts in times of plague, confinement and fear of death. The characters in Camus’ story reflect the entire spectrum of behavior, ranging from the scientific, matter-of-fact approach of Rieux, a doctor who combats the plague ravaging the Algerian port city of Oran; to the profiteering Cottard, who relishes in the collective misfortune but eventually goes mad; and Father Paneloux, who finds solace in God’s will but is eventually taken ill. “The Plague” is an ode to humanity in its darkest times. Camus was a fan of Defoe, and owes much to the Englishman’s compelling piece of faux journalism, where plague-ridden London in 1665 is the seething ant colony of human foibles that comes under the magnifying glass. (It is written as a supposed eyewitness account, but Defoe was only five at the time.) The narrator muses on everything from the divine will and the rise of conmen to the rights and wrongs of shutting people in their houses. There are vivid vignettes including a brutal scene where blaspheming boozers at the Pye Tavern in Houndsditch taunt a distraught man who has just seen his wife and children flung into a mass grave. Defoe ends on the bleak note that the survivors’ gratefulness to God would prove short-lived, and that they would slide back into their old habits. Unlike Defoe, the debonair and adulterous diarist Pepys is a bona fide witness to the horrors of the bubonic plague of 1665 that killed a quarter of Londoners. It’s a haunting vision of depopulation, fires in the streets and the ceaseless tolling of bells. Famously declaring “God preserve us all!” he loses close acquaintances including his baker to the pestilence, and chews tobacco in the hope that it is an antidote. While extremely careful in some respects, Pepys is also an oyster-slurping playboy with a penchant for extra-marital liaisons, who takes astonishing risks in visiting his mistress, whose servant died of plague. His career goes from strength to strength and he finally describes 1665 as a year in which he “never lived so merrily.” Compulsory reading for Italian high school students, “The Betrothed” gives a historically accurate account of the bubonic plague that wiped out a quarter of Milan’s population in 1629-1631. Particularly poignant is Manzoni’s description of the crowd’s descent into a collective psychosis and the public lynching and unfair prosecution of people wrongly accused of intentionally spreading the plague, the so-called “untori.” Parallels with recent attacks on people of Asian descent are painfully obvious. In a lighter approach to the plague theme, Boccaccio imagines a group of 10 youths fleeing the Black Death ravaging Florence and finding refuge in the Tuscan hills. They entertain themselves by narrating a tale a day for 10 days, giving 100 stories ranging from the tragic to the facetious and ribald (Decameron means “10 days” in Greek). If you can’t find a copy in your solitary confinement, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1971 movie adaptation, with music by the old maestro Ennio Morricone, is an excellent alternative. A writer develops an obsessive, unrequited love for a beautiful youth. Meanwhile, a mysterious cholera from the Ganges quickly spreads through Venice’s maze of canals. Mann’s novella is less about the plague than about the tension between Apollonian restraint and Dionysian abandon, but it is obligatory reading, and you will succumb to Mann’s beautiful writing. “The Last Man” by Mary Shelley, who’s better known for Frankenstein, is often described as English literature’s first apocalypse novel. It takes place in the late 21st century (as described by someone living in the early 19th century — the Ottoman Empire’s still going strong in her vision of the future) when a deadly plague of unknown nature sweeps across the world. The book is heavily inspired by tragic events in Shelley’s life, such as the death of her husband and children, which is reflected in the novel’s grim ending: Humans die by the millions, until only the titular last man is left alive. The Greek historian Thucydides wins his place on our list for being not only an eyewitness but also a survivor of the plague that tore through Athens from 430 B.C. There’s no consensus about what the disease was, but it was vicious: It caused unquenchable thirst, fever, spasms, ulcers, vomiting and total memory loss. It weakens Athens in its war with Sparta, and claims the life of the city’s great statesman Pericles. Thucydides notes that it also sparks a breakdown in law and morals, with people frittering their money away on life’s pleasures. In his tragedy Oedipus Rex, performed in 429 B.C., Sophocles opens the action in a city brought low by plague. “The fire-bearing god, the most hateful pestilence, hath swooped down on our city,” as the playwright puts it. And that’s before things turn truly tragic! In this brief and powerful book, a young physical education teacher in Newark, New Jersey tries to keep a level head as polio consumes his community. Panic gradually takes hold in the 1950s Weequahic neighborhood, with no cure in sight and no understanding of how the disease spreads. When a research satellite crashes in Arizona, everyone in a nearby town dies from a mysterious ailment that either clots their blood or causes them to commit suicide in bizarre ways.

"Top health official Anthony Fauci said Sunday that after strict containment and mitigation, China’s coronavirus outbreak is “coming down right now.” On ABC’s “This Week,” the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that it takes several weeks to a few months for the outbreak to dwindle, pointing to China and South Korea as examples.  China, where COVID-19 first set off alarms, passed through the worst, Fauci said. According to a Johns Hopkins University database, the country has had the bulk of the cases and fatalities: nearly 81,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,200 deaths.  Recently, China reported just 11 new cases — minuscule compared to the numbers it used to see, Fauci said. South Korea’s coronavirus spread is also starting to flatten. “If you look at that bracket, all of that was a couple of months, a month-and-a-half for China,” he said Sunday. “The way you interfere with that … depends on the effectiveness in which you do the kinds of controls that we've been talking about, the containment and the mitigation.”  China, Fauci added, really dramatically practiced “social distancing” when officials shut down the country. Now, all eyes are on what happens as people resume normal life.  “It's over for now and hopefully for good,” Fauci said. “As they start getting back to normal personal interaction, I hope we don't see the second blip, but it's possible.”  The worst may also be over in South Korea, Fauci said. “Korea is starting to flatten and maybe come down a little,” he said. Worldwide, there are over 156,000 confirmed cases and over 5,800 deaths. In the United States, there have been more than 2,900 cases and 57 deaths. Many public spaces, schools and offices have closed as millions of Americans are encouraged to reduce close contact with others.  On Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted to reinforce that message: “SOCIAL DISTANCING!”",Top U.S. health official: China’s situation is improving,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-china-korea-130027,politico
"The nation’s top infectious disease expert warned Sunday that Americans should prepare to take far more drastic steps to blunt the rapid spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, which has sickened thousands of Americans across the country and prompted calls for a wide-scale withdrawal from public life. “I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview airing on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” His warning comes as the virus has caused the cancellation of events across the globe, as well as travel bans — and in some countries, domestic travel restrictions. Health officials have warned Americans to practice social distancing to limit the amount of community transmission and avoid overwhelming an already-strained health care system.  Asked Sunday whether he would favor the kind of national lockdown ordered by Italy’s prime minister, Fauci said he would rather err on the side of being “overly aggressive.”  “You know, I would prefer as much as we possibly could,” Fauci responded. “I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting.” Fauci said he’d broached these concerns with the White House, which has taken increasingly significant steps over the last week as the number of U.S. cases exploded. He said that there had not been pushback to his suggestions, noting that “in fairness, they listen and they generally go with what we say.” While Fauci said “much more” needed to be done on the social distancing front, he conceded that some Americans would ultimately do what they please. “I mean, obviously, you're going to have people who are going to go to restaurants anyway,” he said, when asked by “Meet the Press” anchor Chuck Todd about packed restaurants and bars as people celebrated St. Patrick’s Day over the weekend. “But for the most part, and particularly, if I can say this, this is particularly appropriate and relevant for people at the higher risk. The elderly and those who have underlying conditions right now should really hunker down.” He reiterated, though, that it was better to be safe than sorry.  “The golden rule that I say is that, when you think you are doing too much, you are probably doing enough or not enough,” he argued, urging Americans not to be “complacent.”  “Don’t even, for a second, think that I am saying we shouldn’t — I like to be criticized,"" he added. ""When I say oh, you are being too overactive, that is good for me.”",Fauci: Americans should be prepared to 'hunker down' even more,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/coronavirus-fauci-americans-hunker-down-130035,politico
"Voters are divided along party lines on how President Donald Trump is handling the burgeoning coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., according to a new poll out Sunday that shows a majority predicting it won’t change their lives in a significant way. Nearly half of voters in the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 45 percent, approve of the job Trump is doing in handling the outbreak, slightly fewer than the 51 percent who disapprove. That nearly matches Trump’s overall approval rating of 46 percent, which is statistically unchanged from a month ago. The partisan split on Trump’s handling of the virus is wide: While 81 percent of self-identified Republican voters approve of how the president is handling the situation, 84 percent of Democrats disapprove. Among independent voters, 43 percent approve, and 52 percent disapprove. More strikingly, a significant share of voters, mostly Republicans, say they don’t expect the outbreak to have major effects on their daily lives — a view that runs counter to the recommendations of public-health officials. The poll was conducted March 11-13, surveying 900 registered voters. It went into the field the day of Trump’s address to the nation on the outbreak on Wednesday, the same day the NBA suspended its season after a player, Utah’s Rudy Gobert, contracted the virus and actor Tom Hanks announced he and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, had also tested positive for coronavirus. Only 15 percent of voters say they expect the virus to change their lives “in a very major way,” and an additional 26 percent say they think it will change their lives “in a fairly major way.” But 39 percent expect only “small” changes, and 17 percent say it won’t change their lives in any way. The combined 41 percent who expect major changes to their lives includes 56 percent of Democrats, but only 26 percent of Republicans. Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say they have or will be canceling travel plans (47 percent, versus 23 percent) or plan to stop eating at restaurants (36 percent, versus 12 percent). “Simply put, it is very clear that partisanship has infected our views of the coronavirus,” Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt told NBC News. Voters do expect things to get worse: Roughly six-in-10, 60 percent, said the worst is yet to come. But 6 percent said the worst was already passed, and 31 percent said they don’t expect coronavirus to be a major problem in the U.S. And despite the effects already seen — a wave of cancellations of public events, the tumbling stock market and the strain on the health care system — the share of voters saying the country is headed in the right direction (37 percent) is statistically unchanged from last December (35 percent). Voters are split on their confidence in Trump to handle the crisis: 48 percent say they have a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in Trump, while 50 percent no or “not very much” confidence in him. By contrast, voters are more confident in their state government (75 percent great deal or fair amount of confidence), their local government (72 percent) or the federal government as a whole (62 percent). The poll also tested opinions of Democratic voters following last week’s presidential primaries. Former Vice President Joe Biden is the first choice of Democrats, with 61 percent saying they would favor him if a primary were being held in their state today. That’s nearly double the percentage choosing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), 32 percent. Four percent of Democrats choose Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). In hypothetical general election matchups, both Biden and Sanders lead Trump, though Biden’s 9-point advantage, 52 percent to 43 percent, is slightly larger than Sanders’ 4-point lead, 49 percent to 45 percent. The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points for all registered voters, and 4.7 percentage points for Democratic primary voters.",Poll: Voters split on Trump’s handling of coronavirus outbreak,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/poll-voters-coronavirus-outbreak-130033,politico
"Illinois’ governor complained late Saturday that new travel restrictions in place because of the coronavirus pandemic have led to an impossible situation at Chicago’s biggest airport. “The crowds & lines O’Hare are unacceptable & need to be addressed immediately,“ Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted Saturday. He added: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW.“ Enhanced screening for returning travelers from Europe is creating massive logjams at U.S. airports, with travelers waiting hours in long lines to get their luggage and clear customs. Having travelers stuck in huge crowds — while public health officials urgently advise people to keep their distance — is also creating concerns that the virus could spread at airports. “To the frustrated people trying to get home, I have spoken with the mayor and our Senators and we are working together to get the federal government to act to solve this. We will do everything within our power to get relief,” the governor tweeted. Mayor Lori Lightfoot echoed Pritzker’s criticisms on Twitter: “This is unacceptable.

"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday dodged questions about whether the coronavirus pandemic could plunge the U.S. into a recession, insisting that the reeling stock market would eventually get back on track and that the Trump administration is more focused on targeting short-term relief to those most impacted by the fast-spreading disease.  In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” the secretary repeatedly sought to avoid getting pinned down on a number of issues relating to the surge of coronavirus cases in the U.S. after he spent the last week negotiating with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the details of an economic aid package that he referred to as just the “second inning” of relief. “I wouldn't focus on the technical issue of whether we are going to be in a recession or not,” Mnuchin told host Chris Wallace, arguing that the administration is more concerned about what it can immediately do to blunt the impact of the outbreak. The virus has prompted the shuttering of schools, the cancellation of sporting and entertainment events and outright travel bans, while fears over the novel coronavirus have contributed to a turbulent month on Wall Street.  The stock market over the last few weeks has shattered records for its greatest one-day gains but also for point drops, posting numbers not seen since the 1987 crash and ending an 11-year bull market run. The Federal Reserve has already stepped in to try and calm investors' fears, but those moves have gotten bowled over by new developments in the outbreak.  But “if the medical professionals are correct and we are doing all the things, I expect we’ll have a big rebound later in the year,” Mnuchin continued, arguing that the current market rout has very different origins than the Great Depression and other past declines — and thus wasn’t comparable. “This will have an end to it as we confront the virus,” he argued. Mnuchin said his primary focus at the moment was the passage of the congressional aid package, which passed the House after midnight on Friday and which President Donald Trump has pledged to sign if it passes the Senate. That legislation would act as a complement to an $8.3 billion emergency aid bill that Congress approved earlier this month, and would precede a stimulus package aimed at propping up the hard-hit travel industry on which he said negotiations would begin this week.  “We need to get economic relief to the people that are impacted by this, and as I have described this, we are in the second inning. The first inning was the $8 billion, the second inning we passed bipartisan legislation to make sure that workers that need to be home and small and medium-size businesses will get paid,” he said. “We are now going back to Congress and focusing this week on the airlines industry, the hotel industry, the cruise ship -- there's no question that the travel industry has been impacted like we've never seen before.”  He declined to put a price tag on the latest aid package, pointing to the unknown extent of the virus’ spread and how many workers would need the paid sick leave included in the latest stimulus bill. The cost would be “significant,” he said, “but not huge.”  The secretary also would not predict how much of a hit the economy would take, instead reiterating that investors “need to focus on the long term” and pushed back on the idea that the relief measures currently under consideration should be classified as a bailout, a term the Trump administration has sought to avoid. Unlike the 2009 recession, which was underpinned by the burst of the housing bubble and other structural weaknesses in the financial sector, Mnuchin argued that there were no such issues contributing to the current market tumble. “If you are providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you’re taking collateral and you have security, that's not a bailout,” Mnuchin reasoned. “To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted, again — our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted it.”  While he stressed that there will be businesses “that will be severely impacted” by the collapse of consumer spending while Americans are urged to exercise social distancing, “we are focused on helping those businesses that need liquidity.”",Mnuchin dodges on specifics of coronavirus' economic impact,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/mnuchin-coronavirus-economic-impact-130163,politico

"America’s top infectious diseases expert expressed concern over the crush of travelers stuck in airports trying to return home in light of new travel restrictions from Europe, urging Americans to remain calm and not overwhelm the world’s airports. This weekend’s implementation of the restrictions announced only days earlier has spurred a mad dash of Americans abroad returning home, causing backups and massive crowds in airports across the country. In response to the mess at Chicago‘s O’Hare Airport, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together.“ But Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned the bottleneck is “countermanding” efforts to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak. “We would like to not see crowds like that,” Fauci told “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace, promising that Americans need not worry about being able to get back into the country.  “I think what people need to understand is if you're an American citizen, if you are a family member, you can get back. You don't need to rush back — you will be able to get back,” he pledged. While Fauci called the panic “understandable,” he admitted that “unfortunately” the rush is unlikely to abate. The rollout of the Trump administration’s travel restrictions barring foreigners from Europe — which the World Health Organization this weekend called the new “epicenter” of the pandemic — faced a torrent of criticism and backlash from stranded travelers and officials alike over the weekend. The White House was panned first for its lack of clarity surrounding who the ban applied to, prompting administration officials to pan out on television to do clean up duty for President Donald Trump's initial announcement.  Trump implemented similar restrictions for foreigners from China and Iran earlier in the year as the virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, quickly began to spread across the globe. But those restrictions were put in place before the respiratory disease really took hold within the U.S., which has since seen thousands of cases. Fauci said Sunday there are much more worrying considerations than the inconvenience of travelers during a time when Americans have been asked to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “Obviously whenever you have crowds — that's the thing we've been talking about that we really want to implement is to have that kind of social separation,” he said. Airport crowding “is countermanding that, and hopefully people understand you don't have to rush back.”  Asked whether there is anything airports could do to try to mitigate the rush, Fauci said he wasn’t sure, other than “to try and encourage people to tell them that if you are an American citizen, you will be able to get back — it's not going to be a problem.” ",Fauci to Americans abroad: ‘You will be able to get back’,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-travel-airports-130104,politico
"Virtually the entire Democratic presidential primary has been predicated on one underlying assumption: the eventual collapse of Joe Biden. More than a dozen of his erstwhile opponents bet their campaigns on it, and he’s proven them all wrong. But his last serious opponent standing, Bernie Sanders, is still clinging to the same belief — and that it will finally happen on Sunday night, under the bright lights of their one-on-one debate. To revive his campaign, Sanders needs to prove he’s the best candidate to take on President Donald Trump and lead the country at a time of duress, his aides and allies say. But they also acknowledge privately it’s going to take more than that — namely, for the gaffe-prone Biden to stumble. “In the best-case scenario, Bernie dominates the debate and the arguments. He has one or two good one-liners,” said Mark Longabaugh, a former senior adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign. “And obviously the flip side would be Biden has a lackluster debate and maybe makes a mistake. All that coming together maybe causes some pause and hesitation on the part of voters.” It’s a tall order: Biden has won 14 of the 20 states that have voted this month, and he’s polling about 20 to 40 percentage points ahead of Sanders in the states that cast ballots on Tuesday. To make matters worse for Sanders, Tuesday was going to be difficult for him even in the best-case scenario: Its biggest delegate prize is Florida, home to many older, moderate Democrats and Cuban exiles who eschew his left-wing politics. It is also a closed primary where only Democrats can vote, and Sanders typically performs better in races where independents can participate. The reality of the situation isn’t lost on Sanders’ aides. “We’re not naïve,” said Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ campaign manager. “It’s going to be a hard path.” During an all-staff call Thursday evening, Sanders’ national organizing and field director, Misty Rebik, admitted to the team that it was facing an uphill battle — but it has always been that way, she tried to assure them. Sanders himself has appeared less confident on the campaign trail in the last few weeks, even looking downcast at a round-table with workers in Michigan, which is the type of event where he usually seems most upbeat. At the same time, Sanders’ staffers truly believe the trajectory of the race could change — that the campaign that somehow found itself in a stronger position after Sanders suffered a heart attack last fall could have another improbable comeback. They argue that the primary has been volatile, and that Biden himself trailed in the first three primary and caucus states before leapfrogging to frontrunner. They also point out that former presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar have surged in polls after strong performance debate performances. “I don’t know if you’ve seen Joe Biden lately, but he doesn’t like to be told he’s wrong,” said a Sanders adviser. “We’re going to take him on around the issues and make him defend his record. He’s deflected on those in earlier debates because there’s so much chatter happening on the stage. But when you’re one-on-one, you change the dynamic.” It’s unclear how aggressive Sanders will be with Biden. Some of Sanders’ staffers and supporters have been frustrated by what they see as his light touch with his former Senate colleague, whom Sanders likes and considers a friend. Even with Hillary Clinton, Sanders often lacked a killer instinct, famously telling her in a 2015 debate that “the American people are sick and tired about hearing about your damn emails!” Sanders, who doesn’t practice in mock debates while readying for showdowns, did not change his strategy during debate prep last week. “I know it’s shocking for you to hear that Bernie Sanders remained consistent in his approach,” joked Shakir. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group closely aligned with Elizabeth Warren, urged Sanders to stay in the race to debate the former vice president and prevent a “quick Biden coronation.” Given that Sanders this week laid out several questions he plans to ask Biden during the debate, Green doesn’t “expect Bernie to attempt a knockout punch like Elizabeth Warren did to Michael Bloomberg.” But, he added, “In this new coronavirus world, he has a very legitimate case that Democrats defeat Trump if we stand for universal free health care, paid sick leave, student debt cancellation, and a government that actually works for people. If he presses Biden in good faith to agree, he both makes Biden more electable and proves himself more electable — a win-win that lessens objections to him staying in the race this month."" In the Sanders campaign’s ideal world, aides said, he would win the debate, which would give him enough momentum to carry at least one of the four states voting on Tuesday. His aides see Arizona — partly because he has performed strongly among Latino voters — and Illinois as the best possibilities. In their view, that could change the narrative about Sanders’ campaign being all but done, and allow them to potentially win states voting later this primary, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and New York. To gain steam, ""you have to do it by initially suggesting the storyline was wrong about Bernie"" being finished, said Shakir. “Right now, I’m not sure that anyone — correct me if I’m wrong — is suggesting that we will win in any of those four states. Hopefully we can turn that around.” Another reason the Sunday debate looms so large in the Sanders team’s mind is because his aides believe that voters who have seen Biden up close in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire have not supported him. A Biden adviser said of that notion, ""South Carolinians have seen Joe Biden up close for decades. They chose him overwhelmingly."" In a statement, the Biden campaign signaled that the former vice president is not planning on hammering away at contrasts with Sanders and instead wants to focus on Trump. Biden is ""honored to share the stage with Sen. Sanders, who he considers a good friend and whose values and leadership he admires,"" said Andrew Bates, Biden’s rapid response director. For Sanders, the debate is also an opportunity to nudge Biden to the left, a familiar position for the politician who successfully pulled Clinton in his direction during his unsuccessful 2016 bid. Sanders sees the coronavirus outbreak as a red flag that America’s health care system is dysfunctional, and that the country needs “Medicare for All” and other liberal policies. “There are 28 million people who are currently uninsured. How are we going to pay for their treatment and their testing? How are we going to deal with seniors who are seeing their retirement accounts hit, other than by expanding Social Security?” asked Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair. “The coronavirus and the uncertainty around it, the economic uncertainty, gives a way of having Sen. Sanders talk about his policies. Not just in an aspirational, abstract sense, but in a way of here and now.” During the Thursday all-staff call, Shakir and other senior aides said that campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic meant that they would need to focus more on their digital operation and “distributed organizing” strategy, which, they argued, are superior to Biden’s.  The digital gap between the two campaigns was on display Friday, when the Biden operation struggled with technical difficulties during its first virtual town hall. Since Sanders first announced he was running in 2020, his team has livestreamed almost every public event. But if the coronavirus has shifted voters toward a candidate so far, it’s Biden. Exit polls found Democratic primary voters trust Biden more than Sanders to lead during a crisis by double-digit margins. Sanders’ team aims to change that — and everything else — on Sunday. ""You don't run for president if you're not in it to win,” said Khanna. ""He’s hoping the debate will change the dynamic.” Laura Barron-Lopez contributed to this report.",Sanders bets on Biden debate implosion,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-129418,politico
"Massive lines ballooned across several U.S. airports this weekend as European travelers made a mad dash for home — a situation created by the quick rollout of the Trump administration’s European travel ban and exacerbated chronic airport staffing shortages.  U.S. officials promised Sunday to address the most visible sign of the chaos — the jam-packed terminals where Americans returning to the U.S. are waiting hours for virus screening at several major airports, including Chicago O'Hare, Dallas Fort Worth and Dulles International. But those lines are just one of a series of pressure points that have undermined the administration’s efforts to keep the virus from entering the country — and now threaten to hasten its spread: — The administration’s European travel ban, which President Donald Trump announced Wednesday and went into effect Friday night, sent Americans abroad scrambling to find plane tickets back home. U.S. officials eventually clarified that the ban didn't apply to American citizens or permanent residents — but by then, panic-buying most likely inflated the number of people trying to reenter at once. — The administration also dramatically narrowed the number of places where air travelers returning from Europe could enter the U.S. — currently just 13 airports. At the same time, Customs and Border Protection and health officials on Friday began doing ""enhanced screening"" for those passengers, consisting of temperature checks and questions about travel history and symptoms, without having enough staff on hand to process them quickly. — Customs staffing levels have been inadequate for some time. The union representing Customs screeners said at a hearing in December that the force was short 2,700 officers, partly as a result of the administration’s decision to temporarily reassign people to the U.S.-Mexican border. — In the early weeks of the outbreak, the administration was slow to ramp up screening at international airports, even for travelers re-entering the United States from known coronavirus hot spots. Harvard public health researchers warned in early March that the screening procedures in place then would miss as many as two-thirds of U.S.-bound passengers entering the U.S. Now, public health officials are expressing concern that the passengers crammed shoulder-to-shoulder in airport screening lines are at higher risk for catching and then spreading the virus. “It’s not good public health policy to have crowds of people in tight spaces, especially people who are returning from places where we know there’s widespread transmission occurring,” said John Auerbach, president and CEO of Trust for America’s Health. He added that there should be serious consideration of unintended consequences of the policies being implemented. Illinois leaders blamed the Trump administration for the latest mess, saying it was apparently unprepared to carry out its own orders. “Appears source of delays all federal and Admin was unprepared after Presidential ban on travel from Europe,” said Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin on Twitter. The state’s governor, JB Pritzker, wrote: “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW.” Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said Saturday that the added screenings are only taking around 60 seconds per passenger. But that doesn’t help if not enough screeners are on duty. And some passengers complained on social media that they waited as long as six or seven hours to be screened. CBP's acting commissioner, Mark Morgan, said in a statement Sunday that the agency is ""working diligently to address the longer than usual delays"" and several airports are already improving. A spokesperson was not able to provide details about any specific steps the agency had taken to get lines under control. ""We appreciate the patience of the traveling public as we deal with this unprecedented situation,"" Morgan said. ""We’re continuing to balance our efficiencies with ensuring the health and safety of all American citizens through enhanced medical screening."" The thousands of people who have been jammed into close quarters while waiting for their bags and customs checks could be at a greater health risk because of the situation. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Fox News Sunday the crowds are “countermanding” the administration’s own mitigation efforts. Public health officials have frequently stressed the importance of social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. “What people need to understand is if you're an American is if you're an American citizen, you can get back,” Fauci said. “You don't need to rush back, you will be able to get back but it's understandable how when people see the travel ban, they immediately want to hunker and get home. “Hopefully we don't have more of that, but I think we probably unfortunately will see that,"" he said. Mike Fraser, executive director for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the large crowds at ports of entry are concerning. “While travel home is essential for these individuals, I would hope federal and airport authorities would work with the airlines and state and local health agencies to practice appropriate infection control measures everywhere, but especially in places were crowds are gathered and recommend staggered arrivals to reduce the number of people congregating in one place, ""Fraser said. “At this time, the goal is to prevent transmission of disease. Any crowded space — churches, grocery stores, airports — all increase the probability of transmission,” said Joyce Johnson, a senior retired U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer. These enhanced screenings are also starting too late, following weeks while the virus was already rapidly spreading around the world. The administration’s initial screening efforts focused on travelers from China, even after it had become clear that the virus had spread to other countries. Marc Lipsitch, head of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, has said the lax screening of infected travelers may have led to the outbreak in Washington state, the first U.S. state the virus swept through. Before this weekend, alarmed passengers had reported on social media what they considered lax screening as they returned to the U.S. Jenn Bartick, a California attorney, told POLITICO that she flew back from Italy two weeks ago and went through “no screening of any type."" She said no one asked her if she had been in the parts of Italy that have been hardest hit by the virus, a spread that since prompted Italian authorities to shut down the entire country. She said when she boarded the plane in Italy, “they asked if I had been to China in the past 14 days. No further screening.” She’s been unable to get a test because she doesn’t have symptoms and is self-quarantining. A U.S. businessman who flew recently from Hong Kong told POLITICO that the screening he underwent at Los Angeles International Airport was ""a joke."" “As opposed to all arrivals and departures at all Asian airports there was no temperature taking,” said the businessman, who has lived in China and other Asian countries for decades and requested anonymity because he doesn't want to “get blacklisted on flights” to the United States added: “No questions, nothing. Couldn’t get rid of the passengers fast enough.” Customs officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment about those passengers’ accounts. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) has asked the federal government to expand screening beyond air travel, by requiring temperature checks for all passengers boarding not just airplanes but mass transit. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, told lawmakers last week that passenger screening “bought us time” but said travel restrictions and screenings were never “intended to be a hermetically sealed process.”",Terminal crush: Air passengers caught in Trump's travel ban,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/air-passengers-crush-coronavirus-trump-130251,politico
"The nation’s top infectious diseases expert has a stern warning to young people: Don’t get complacent about statistics showing that serious coronavirus cases and fatalities are skewed toward the elderly and those with underlying health issues.  “You are not immune or safe from getting seriously ill,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” when asked if younger Americans should be concerned about contracting the virus, which Fauci has repeatedly said is more lethal than the average flu.  “Even though when you look at the total numbers, it's overwhelmingly weighted toward the elderly and those with underlying conditions,” he explained, “the virus isn't a mathematical formula. There are going to be people who are young who are going to wind up getting seriously ill.”  In addition, Fauci said it was critical for young people to understand that they can be a carrier for the virus and spread it without showing symptoms or feeling ill themselves.  “Even though you don't get seriously ill, you could bring it to a person who would bring it to a person that would bring it to your grandfather, your grandmother, or your elderly relative,” he argued. “That's why everybody's got to take this seriously, even the young.” In appearances on every major Sunday morning talk show, Fauci preached the importance of practicing social distancing for containing the spread of coronavirus cases, which have exploded in the U.S. in recent weeks as well as other hot spots all over the globe, including Italy, Iran and South Korea.  He and other health officials have pleaded for people to hunker down in an attempt to blunt the spread and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. When asked about crowds still heading to restaurants and bars over the weekend, Fauci said that there was serious room for improvement. “I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and in bars,” he said. “Whatever it takes to do that, that's what I would like to see.”  Some local governments and businesses have stepped up to attempt to force social separation, banning mass gatherings and slashing business hours. The issue was unavoidable over the weekend for scores of travelers who tried to rush back to the U.S. in the wake of a new travel ban by the administration, crowding airports across the country, which Fauci called “unfortunate” and “not what you like to see.”  But where social interaction is able to be avoided, Fauci said that sacrifices in people’s lifestyles are imperative to heading off a crisis the likes of which countries like Italy are grappling with. “Certainly it is conceivable that if we don't do that you could get as bad as Italy,” he warned. “But I don't think we're going there, if we do the kind of things that we're publicly saying we need to do. We need to be very serious about, for a while, life is not going to be the way it used to be in the United States. We have to just accept that if we want to do what's best for the American public.” ",'Everybody's got to take this seriously': Fauci warns against coronavirus indifference among young people ,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/fauci-coronavirus-young-people-130229,politico

But “if the medical professionals are correct and we are doing all the things, I expect we’ll have a big rebound later in the year,” Mnuchin said, arguing the current market rout has disparate origins than the Great Depression and other past declines — and thus isn't comparable. “This will have an end to it as we confront the virus."" Mnuchin said his primary focus at the moment is the passage of the congressional aid package, which passed the House after midnight on Friday and which President Donald Trump has pledged to sign if it passes the Senate. That legislation would act as a complement to an $8.3 billion emergency aid bill Congress approved earlier this month, and it would precede a stimulus package aimed at propping up the hard-hit travel industry on which he said negotiations would begin this week.  “We need to get economic relief to the people that are impacted by this, and, as I have described this, we are in the second inning. The first inning was the $8 billion, the second inning we passed bipartisan legislation to make sure that workers that need to be home and small- and medium-size businesses will get paid,” he said. “We are now going back to Congress and focusing this week on the airlines industry, the hotel industry, the cruise ship — there's no question that the travel industry has been impacted like we've never seen before.”  He declined to put a price tag on the latest aid package, pointing to the unknown extent of the virus’ spread and how many workers would need the paid sick leave included in the latest stimulus bill. The cost would be “significant,” he said, “but not huge.”  The secretary also would not predict how big of a hit the economy would take, instead reiterating that investors “need to focus on the long term” and pushing back on the idea that relief measures under consideration should be classified as a bailout, a term the Trump administration has sought to avoid. Unlike the 2008 recession, which was underpinned by the burst of the housing bubble and other structural weaknesses in the financial sector, there are no such issues contributing to the market tumble, Mnuchin argued. “If you are providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you’re taking collateral and you have security, that's not a bailout,” Mnuchin reasoned. “To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted, again — our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted it.”  While he stressed that there will be businesses “that will be severely impacted” by the collapse of consumer spending while Americans are urged to exercise social distancing, “we are focused on helping those businesses that need liquidity.”",Mnuchin dodges on specifics of coronavirus' economic impact,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/15/mnuchin-coronavirus-economic-impact-130163,politico
"If you’re in angst-ridden quarantine, you’ll probably be finding it hard to take your mind off things. One high-risk strategy — not for those of a nervous disposition — is to dive headlong into some of literature’s most horrific plagues, via Sophocles to Albert Camus, to put things in perspective. There’s some solace in the unity of human experience over the centuries. Big themes — terrifying incomprehension, the vulnerability of doctors and the emergence of cynical profiteers — recur across the centuries. Do you feel guilty about your obsessive addiction to the daily tolls of infections and deaths? Well, the English writers Samuel Pepys and Daniel Defoe shared the same fascination. If you are ever feeling really down, remember Giovanni Boccaccio’s cheery observation from the 14th century that in plague-infested days “a dead man was then of no more account than a dead goat.” See, you must be feeling better already … Here are some feel-good classics: The quintessential novel about how the human psyche reacts in times of plague, confinement and fear of death. The characters in Camus’ story reflect the entire spectrum of behavior, ranging from the scientific, matter-of-fact approach of Rieux, a doctor who combats the plague ravaging the Algerian port city of Oran, to the profiteering Cottard, who relishes in the collective misfortune but eventually goes mad, and Father Paneloux, who finds solace in God’s will but is eventually taken ill. The Plague is an ode to humanity in its darkest times. Camus was a fan of Defoe and owes much to the Englishman’s compelling piece of faux journalism, in which plague-ridden London in 1665 is the seething ant colony of human foibles that comes under the magnifying glass. (It is written as a supposed eyewitness account, but Defoe was only 5 at the time.) The narrator muses on everything from divine will and the rise of con men to the rights and wrongs of shutting people in their houses. There are vivid vignettes including a brutal scene in which blaspheming boozers at the Pye Tavern in Houndsditch taunt a distraught man who has just seen his wife and children flung into a mass grave. Defoe ends on the bleak note that the survivors’ gratefulness to God would prove short lived and that they would slide back into their old habits. Unlike Defoe, the debonair and adulterous diarist Pepys is a bona fide witness to the horrors of the bubonic plague epidemic of 1665 that killed a quarter of Londoners. It’s a haunting vision of depopulation, fires in the streets and the ceaseless tolling of bells. Famously declaring “God preserve us all!” he loses close acquaintances including his baker to the pestilence and chews tobacco in the hope that it is an antidote. While extremely careful in some respects, Pepys is also an oyster-slurping playboy with a penchant for extramarital liaisons who takes astonishing risks in visiting his mistress, whose servant died of plague. His career goes from strength to strength and he finally describes 1665 as a year in which he “never lived so merrily.” Compulsory reading for Italian high school students, The Betrothed gives a historically accurate account of the bubonic plague that wiped out a quarter of Milan’s population in 1629-1631. Particularly poignant is Manzoni’s description of the crowd’s descent into a collective psychosis and the public lynching and unfair prosecution of people wrongly accused of intentionally spreading the plague, the “untori.” Parallels with recent attacks on people of Asian descent are painfully obvious. In a lighter approach to the plague theme, Boccaccio imagines a group of 10 youths fleeing the Black Death ravaging Florence and finding refuge in the Tuscan hills. They entertain themselves by narrating a tale a day for 10 days, giving 100 stories ranging from the tragic to the facetious and ribald (Decameron means “10 days” in Greek). If you can’t find a copy in your solitary confinement, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1971 movie adaptation, with music by the old maestro Ennio Morricone, is an excellent alternative. A writer develops an obsessive, unrequited love for a beautiful youth. Meanwhile, a mysterious cholera from the Ganges quickly spreads through Venice’s maze of canals. Mann’s novella is less about the plague than about the tension between Apollonian restraint and Dionysian abandon, but it is obligatory reading, and you will succumb to Mann’s beautiful writing. The Last Man by Mary Shelley, who’s better known for Frankenstein, is often described as English literature’s first apocalypse novel. It takes place in the late 21st century (as described by someone living in the early 19th century — the Ottoman Empire’s still going strong in her vision of the future) when a deadly plague of unknown nature sweeps across the world. The book is heavily inspired by tragic events in Shelley’s life, such as the death of her husband and children, which is reflected in the novel’s grim ending: Humans die by the millions, until only the titular last man is left alive. The Greek historian Thucydides wins his place on our list for being not only an eyewitness but also a survivor of the plague that tore through Athens from 430 B.C. There’s no consensus about what the disease was, but it was vicious: It caused unquenchable thirst, fever, spasms, ulcers, vomiting and total memory loss. It weakened Athens in its war with Sparta and claimed the life of the city’s great statesman, Pericles. Thucydides notes that it also sparked a breakdown in law and morals, with people frittering their money away on life’s pleasures. In his tragedy Oedipus Rex, performed in 429 B.C., Sophocles opens the action in a city brought low by plague. “The fire-bearing god, the most hateful pestilence, hath swooped down on our city,” as the playwright puts it. And that’s before things turn truly tragic! In this brief and powerful book, a young physical education teacher in Newark, New Jersey, tries to keep a level head as polio consumes his community. Panic gradually takes hold in the 1950s Weequahic neighborhood, with no cure in sight and no understanding of how the disease spreads. When a research satellite crashes in Arizona, everyone in a nearby town dies from a mysterious ailment that either clots their blood or causes them to to kill themselves in bizarre ways. The race is on for scientists from the Wildfire task force to contain the alien micro-organism and understand why two very unlikely people appear to be immune.

"Bernie Sanders is facing a host of questions before Sunday’s debate. How directly will he challenge Joe Biden? Is he betting on a miraculous turnaround in Florida, Illinois and Ohio? Or is he effectively conceding the nomination and staying in the race just to try to persuade Biden to embrace more of the Sanders agenda? But Biden is the 2020 candidate who faces the more consequential questions in this debate: How far will he go to embrace Sanders out of a desire for party unity, and how much of a risk is he taking by doing so? Here, history provides a cautionary lesson. When the presumptive presidential nominee of a political party goes too far to placate a noisy ideological minority, the results can backfire—and might even presage defeat in November. In 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon was in a position not all that different from Biden’s. He was on a glide path to the Republican presidential nomination. His most likely challenger, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, had taken himself out of the running at the end of 1959, declaring that “this decision is definite and final.” But by the summer of 1960, Rocky was showing unmistakable signs that he might be changing his mind. In June, after a White House meeting, he issued a blistering statement arguing that “those now assuming control of the Republican Party have failed to make clear where the party is heading and where it proposes to lead the nation. … I find it unreasonable in these times that the leading Republican candidate for the presidential nomination has firmly insisted upon making known his program and his policies not before but only after nomination by this party.” He called President Dwight D. Eisenhower the next day to test the possibility of a presidential endorsement of his candidacy. There was, in fact, virtually no support within the Republican establishment for a Rockefeller run, just like there is very little support in the Democratic establishment for a Sanders presidency today. But that did not stop the New York governor from challenging his party, specifically on its platform, on issues ranging from defense spending (he wanted a lot more) to civil rights to medical care. And that challenge was one Nixon desperately wanted to avoid. So, without consulting his advisers, Nixon sought a personal meeting with Rockefeller. It was granted, on terms that very much made Nixon look like a supplicant. He had to publicly ask for the meeting, which also had to be at Rockefeller’s Fifth Avenue triplex in Manhattan. And most importantly, when Nixon left the meeting at 3 a.m., he and Rockefeller had signed on to platform language that more or less repudiated Eisenhower and the Republicans across a range of concerns—especially on civil rights. On that issue, the compact’s strong language (“aggressive action to remove the remaining vestiges of segregation or discrimination in all areas of national life” and “support for the objectives of the sit-in demonstrators”) was admirable, but it undermined the tightrope Nixon was intending to walk between his party’s Northern liberals and its Southern whites. The document—labeled “the Compact of Fifth Avenue”—was the political equivalent of a hand grenade. Conservatives, who carried a deep antipathy toward the deep-pocketed Eastern internationalist wing of the GOP that had denied them a presidential nomination for two decades, were furious Nixon had bent the knee to the symbolic leader of that wing. Some were angry enough to place in nomination the name of an emerging conservative hero, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Addressing the convention that summer, Goldwater said: “Let’s grow up, conservatives. … If we want to take this party back—and I think we can someday—let’s go to work.” Just four years later, Goldwater won the nomination before going down to a landslide loss in November to President Lyndon B. Johnson. The Republican Party did not adopt the Nixon-Rockefeller language on civil rights, but that language did cause Nixon a significant headache as he sought to replicate the gains in the South that Eisenhower, who carried Texas and Louisiana in 1956, had made in previous elections. So what’s the lesson here for Biden? It’s that he needs to walk a fine line between respecting Sanders and his base and accommodating too many of their ideas, which Biden has explicitly opposed throughout the campaign. When they were offered a clear, binary choice between Sanders and a less militantly left candidate, Democratic voters went for the relative centrist by significant margins. Seemingly out of nowhere, a broad coalition emerged—led by landslide majorities of African Americans—that that rejected the idea that a “political revolution” was the key to winning the White House. They support comprehensive immigration reform and protection for Dreamers—but they do not necessarily support free health care and college tuition for undocumented immigrants. They favor restoring voting rights for felons who have served their time; they do not necessarily support voting rights for felons who are still in prison. They favor expanded health care, but they do not favor a plan that would effectively abolish all private health insurance. For the presumptive nominee of a party—which is what Biden is very close to becoming—there is a point where reaching out to unify the party crosses over into appeasement. Something like that almost happened in 1980, when Ronald Reagan came close to offering former president Gerald Ford the vice presidential slot on his ticket. Emissaries for Ford, including Henry Kissinger, were busily negotiating a range of duties for Ford that would have amounted (in Walter Cronkite’s words) to “something of a co-presidency”. It would have been a confession of weakness, a signal that Reagan doubted his own capacity for the job of chief executive. Luckily for the Gipper, the deal fell apart. Biden should recognize the spirited campaigns Sanders has run, the passion of his followers and his achievement in forcing the Democratic Party to confront the nation’s yawning inequality, which requires major repair. And he should highlight his own ideas about increased taxes on the wealthy, criminal justice reform, and an ambitious health care plan that address some, but not all, of concerns of Sanders supporters. But Biden also needs to act in a way that reminds his party and his country who is winning the most votes from Democrats and who will almost surely prevail when the convention assembles in Milwaukee. One more point: When and if the two meet for an endorsement rally, it would be wise to hold it in Wilmington, Delaware, not Burlington, Vermont.",Why Biden Shouldn’t Unify Too Much with Sanders,2020-03-15,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/15/biden-sanders-debate-2020-128731,politico
"The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Fair Isaac Corp., the financial company whose credit scores underlie nearly all U.S. consumer credit decisions, according to information obtained by POLITICO. The probe follows years of complaints from rivals about Fair Isaac's dominance, and comes amid efforts by Congress and financial regulators to inject more competition into the credit score market. Fair Isaac's FICO scores are a measure of risk that banks and credit card companies use to make lending decisions, and are used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to determine creditworthiness of mortgage applicants. The exact scope of the DOJ’s antitrust investigation isn’t yet known. The agency recently sent letters to Fair Issac and others in the consumer credit industry asking them to preserve documents, according to a person knowledgeable about the case who was not authorized to speak about it. Such hold-letters are the first step in an investigation. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment Friday night. But Fair Isaac, also known as FICO, confirmed the existence of the probe Sunday, saying it focuses on “potential exclusionary conduct."" “FICO intends to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice and looks forward to a constructive dialogue about the state of competition in our industry,” the company said in a statement. “FICO is confident the Department will conclude that it has not engaged in any exclusionary conduct.” The company noted that it is also involved in an antitrust suit brought by credit reporting agency TransUnion, which that company filed after Fair Isaac sued it for unpaid royalties. Fair Isaac founded the FICO score in 1956 and has issued more than 100 billion scores, according to its website. The scores are based on information collected by TransUnion and the other two large credit reporting agencies, Experian and Equifax. The credit reporting agencies also sell FICO scores to lenders. In 2006, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion introduced their own credit scoring model, known as VantageScore. Fair Isaac sued the three agencies for antitrust violations, but a court later dismissed those allegations. A federal jury later sided with VantageScore that it didn’t violate Fair Isaac’s trademarks or engage in unfair competition. Fair Isaac also sued TransUnion in 2017 for breach of contract, copyright infringement and other allegations. TransUnion countersued Fair Isaac for antitrust violations. A Chicago federal judge ruled last year that TransUnion can move forward with its antitrust allegations. Congress and regulators, meanwhile, have sought to lessen Fair Isaac's grip on the credit score market. In a 2018 law that sought to roll back some of the banking reforms in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Congress ordered the Federal Housing Finance Agency to establish rules and criteria for the credit scoring models used by Fannie and Freddie. A December 2018 proposed rule by FHFA would have effectively prohibited Fannie and Freddie from using VantageScore over concerns about conflicts of interest. But the final rule, issued in August, switched gears and allowed the government-sponsored entities to make use of VantageScore as an alternative to FICO scores. VantageScore didn’t immediately return calls and emails for comment sent after business hours Friday. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion also didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",DOJ opens antitrust probe into credit score giant Fair Isaac,2020-03-13,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/justice-fair-isaac-antitrust-129204,politico

"Social distancing hit the set of President Donald Trump's favorite morning cable news show Tuesday, with the three hosts of ""Fox & Friends"" scattered across their New York studio in an effort to demonstrate best practices amid the coronavirus pandemic.  ""To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart — same studio, plenty of distance,"" co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers at the top of the broadcast.   The right-leaning talk show, which airs weekdays from 6-9 a.m. ET and has achieved outsized influence under Trump's administration, is the latest TV news program to employ the preventative measure as the outbreak tears across the United States. Although the CDC recommends that Americans maintain a distance of six feet to help thwart the coronavirus' rapid spread, co-host Steve Doocy said that he and his colleagues usually sit only about 18 inches apart on the signature ""curvy couch"" of the ""Fox & Friends"" set. Tuesday morning, however, Doocy was alone on the mezzanine-level sofa, while Kimeade anchored ""the big plastic desk"" one floor below and co-host Ainsley Earhardt was stationed at a lectern nearby in the studio's ""fish bowl area."" ""We're doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is stay away from each other because you don't want to get infected and you don't want to spread infection,"" Doocy said. ""We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,"" Earhardt added. ""And so if you can keep your distance and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly and help our country as a nation.""  The new seating configuration reflects the seriousness with which President Donald Trump and his staunchest allies, both in media and politics, are now taking the nature of the coronavirus threat after previously being dismissive of its risk to Americans. The on-air talent and guests at Fox News have drawn special scrutiny for downplaying the disease in recent weeks. Just last Friday, Earhardt remarked that it was ""actually the safest time to fly"" despite advisories against nonessential travel, and conservative religious leader Jerry Falwell Jr. appeared on the program to accuse people of ""overreacting"" to the coronavirus. ""It makes you wonder if there's a political reason for that,"" Falwell said. ""You know, impeachment didn't work, and the Mueller report didn't work, and Article 25 didn't work. And so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.""",The president’s favorite morning show starts social distancing,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fox-and-friends-social-distancing-133619,politico

"Few Americans trust President Donald Trump when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, and less than half of respondents believe the federal government is taking sufficient steps to combat the public health crisis.  An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Tuesday shows that only 37 percent of those polled have either “a good amount” or “a great deal” of trust in the the information they hear from the president about the coronavirus, while 60 percent say they do “not very much” or “not at all” trust Trump’s words on the subject.  The president’s trust ratings regarding the coronavirus rank lower among those surveyed than other prominent sources of information, including the news media, state and local governments, and public health experts. More Americans than not disapprove of the way he is handling the pandemic, by a margin of 49-44 percent, and his overall job approval rating rests at 43 percent. The poll’s results come after the White House spent weeks downplaying the coronavirus’ threat to the United States, even as public health officials within the administration sounded alarms over its risk to the country and warned of its rapid rates of transmission. Only recently has Trump adopted a more somber tone when discussing the crisis, acknowledging Tuesday that “this is a very bad one” and cautioning Americans that “we have an invisible enemy” in the coronavirus.  The more dire rhetoric from the president was accompanied by a new series of increasingly stern guidelines from the administration, which recommended avoiding group gatherings of more than 10 people, working or attending school from home whenever possible, and abstaining from eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts. It remains to be seen whether the latest measures will bolster public confidence in the administration’s ability to fight the coronavirus. Just 46 percent of Americans believe the federal government is doing enough to prevent the disease’s spread, down from 61 percent in February. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll was conducted March 13-14, surveying 835 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",Poll: Most Americans don’t trust Trump on coronavirus information,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/poll-americans-lack-trust-in-trump-on-coronavirus-information-133576,politico

"There’s an easy way to tell that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi negotiated a bad deal on the bipartisan coronavirus response bill that Congress is expected to pass this week. It’s not the liberal complaints that she let the White House limit paid sick leave to about one-fifth of U.S. workers. It’s not the Republican complaints that the bill doesn’t provide tax relief and cash for businesses and individuals hurt by the pandemic. It’s not even the general consensus that this initial legislation will need to be followed up by a much more aggressive economic stimulus bill. No, the easy way to tell Pelosi negotiated a bad deal for Democrats is that she negotiated a deal at all—rather than dictating the terms and telling President Donald Trump to take them or leave them. The lesson of the last congressional response to an economic emergency, President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill, is that when a president desperately needs legislation to address a crisis, anyone with the power to stop him can decide what’s in it. When Obama took office, in the midst of the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression, Democrats controlled the House and Senate as well. But they needed 60 votes to break a Republican filibuster in the Senate, and there were only 57 Democratic senators, which meant Obama had to recruit three Republicans to vote for a stimulus bill. In just his second week in office, his blunt-spoken chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, had to pose a blunt-spoken question to Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania: Whaddya want? Specter’s ask was simple, and by Washington horse-trading standards, noble. He wanted $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health. Then he would vote for the Obama stimulus. “Are you f---ing kidding me?” Emanuel exploded. Emanuel assumed $10 billion-with-a-b was just Specter’s initial bid, a shock-tactic negotiating ploy. But Specter gruffly said no, that was his final offer, take it or leave it. “What the f--- does a vote cost around here?” Emanuel screamed. In Specter’s case, it cost precisely $10 billion. He understood that Obama needed his vote to fix the economy, so he held all the leverage. But today’s congressional Democrats don’t seem to understand that at all. Right now, after initially downplaying the threat of coronavirus, then bungling the response to the pandemic, then watching the swift demise of the bull market he had hailed as proof of his leadership, Trump absolutely needs congressional action to limit the public health disaster and mitigate the economic damage on his watch. House Democrats can pass whatever bill they want, and if Republicans aren’t willing to go along with it, another lesson of American crisis politics is that it’s Trump who will suffer the consequences. Some Democrats have fretted that they might suffer politically if they don’t help Trump clean up the mess, but the opposite happened in 2009. The Republican minority in the House unanimously refused to support Obama’s stimulus, even though the crisis had exploded on his Republican predecessor’s watch, and the very next year those same Republicans took back the majority in the House. In fact, the only Republican in Congress who paid a political price was Specter, who had to switch to the Democratic Party after a GOP backlash over his vote for Obama’s stimulus, and ended up losing his seat anyway. In 2020, Democrats are not acting like a party with that kind of leverage. Instead, Pelosi frantically hashed out a compromise on Friday over 13 phone calls with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who accepted Democratic proposals to expand free COVID-19 testing and unemployment benefits, along with a modest boost in food aid for the poor, but made it clear that permanent legislation mandating universal sick leave was a “non-starter” for Republicans. Trump ratcheted up the pressure by complaining publicly that Democrats weren’t “giving enough” in the negotiations, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the House proposals as “an ideological wish list.” Ultimately, Democrats accepted a temporary mandate that only applies to companies smaller than 500 employees, and allows companies smaller than 50 employees to seek exemptions.  “Democrats preferred to have something rather than nothing,” a Democratic source explained to CNN’s Jake Tapper. “That was the choice we faced.” That was not the choice Democrats faced. Unlike the Republicans in 2009, who only had a filibuster-proof minority in the Senate, they also have a majority in the House, where they could have attached anything they wanted to the must-pass coronavirus testing and dared Republicans to say no.  If the president was unwilling to approve measures to help contain a pandemic and limit the economic fallout because he didn’t want sick workers to be guaranteed paid leave, he could have explained that to the public. He’s the president, the head of state, the “I alone can fix it” guy. He’s the one who will be judged by the outcome of the crisis that he initially insisted was not a crisis, then declared was under control thanks to his leadership. After all, Obama was held responsible for an economic crisis that erupted on George W. Bush’s watch, and the party that fought his efforts to fix the crisis ended up taking back the House, the Senate and eventually the White House. The public doesn’t follow the details of legislation on Capitol Hill, but it blames presidents for bad outcomes. The public also tends to blame presidents for partisan paralysis, while giving them credit for bipartisan cooperation; that’s why McConnell understood he could make Obama look partisan by fighting him, even though Obama’s stimulus was stuffed with tax cuts and other Republican priorities. It is true that Democrats would be accused of trying to exploit the crisis if they tried to load up a coronavirus bill with unrelated priorities such as, say, a Green New Deal to fight the climate crisis—although it’s worth noting that Trump and McConnell have already accused them of trying to exploit the crisis just for trying to mandate sick leave during a pandemic. But they still have the leverage to shape legislation just about any way they want if they’re willing to take the heat. In 2009, Republican Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine used her leverage to demand that the Obama stimulus include a technical fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax that added $70 billion to the price tag while providing virtually no economic stimulus. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine insisted on stripping a school construction initiative out of Obama’s stimulus—along with, ironically, an $870 million line item for pandemic preparedness. The 57 Democrats in the Senate also had the power to extract concessions for their votes; Obama had wanted a stimulus without congressional earmarks, but Dick Durbin of Illinois managed to include one for a $1 billion carbon-capture plant that never ended up getting built. Setting aside the question of whether Democrats should try to exploit the leverage to advance long-term policy priorities, they can absolutely exploit their leverage to address the short-term crisis. If they think universal sick leave will help, they should demand universal sick leave. Meanwhile, with Louisiana and Georgia already postponing primaries over the virus, why shouldn’t Democrats attach provisions guaranteeing that Americans will be able to vote by mail in November? Jeff Hauser, director of the left-leaning Revolving Door Project, doesn’t understand why the Democrats didn’t insist on provisions restoring congressional oversight powers to help them ride herd on the administration’s response to the virus, ensuring that Trump and his aides can no longer defy subpoenas for documents and witnesses. Again, if Trump thinks it’s so important to prevent Americans from voting by mail and preventing Congress from overseeing his administration that he would block measures to accelerate the pandemic testing that his own team has botched, he can try to convince the public. “House Democrats don’t have some leverage,” Hauser says. “They have complete leverage.” By giving Trump the emergency measures that he needs most without insisting on the worker protections that Democrats wanted most, Pelosi has sacrificed some of that leverage. She has also helped the president look like a bipartisan consensus-builder, while essentially confirming the GOP talking point that Democrats have a responsibility to meet Trump’s demands in order to avoid a partisan stalemate. In 2009, Republicans simply ignored all the pundits warning that they would pay a huge political price for refusing to help the first black president fix an economic mess he had inherited—and the pundits turned out to be wrong. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders argue that it’s their duty to help Trump save lives and jobs in 2020, even though Republicans didn’t help Obama in 2009, even though Trump routinely calls them traitors, even though an economic downturn could doom his reelection. They’re pro-government people; they’re not inclined to stand in the way of government action during a crisis. When the Great Recession was just getting started in January 2008, Pelosi negotiated a quick bipartisan stimulus bill with Bush’s Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, and within months Americans were receiving $1000 checks from the federal government. It’s an honorable approach, even though it also probably reduces Pelosi’s leverage. It’s hard to win a game of chicken when the other driver knows you’re committed to avoiding a crash. Once Trump signs this emergency response bill, he’ll start clamoring for a much larger economic stimulus bill loaded with tax cuts for airlines, cruise lines, his own hospitality industry and other Republican-friendly businesses, along with payroll tax cuts that can help get him reelected. And Democrats will find that many of the same Republicans who mocked the idea of using taxpayer dollars to stimulate the private economy as big government when Obama was in the White House—even though they had supported that bipartisan stimulus bill under Bush—will rediscover the attraction of Keynesian economics when it suits their party’s interests. Democrats will have to decide whether to meet Trump in the middle, or whether to risk the obstructionist label by holding out for what they want in a time of economic pain. They will also have to decide exactly what it is they want. Some of Obama’s top economists have publicly called for Congress to send checks to American citizens, which would help the economy and also Trump’s reelection prospects. Again, that’s honorable and responsible, especially since Trump is sure to denounce the Democrats as obstructionists no matter what happens, but it’s not clear it squares with Democratic rhetoric about the danger of Trump’s reelection, especially if they don’t get anything in exchange for helping to rescue the sinking Trump economy. In any case, Trump won’t be able to pass a stimulus bill without them. At a minimum, one thing they can demand for their cooperation is legislative assurance that economic stimulus can no longer be something that only happens routinely under Republican presidents. They should insist on more robust “automatic stabilizers” so that any time the economy craters, no matter who’s in the White House, Washington will automatically spend far more on food stamps, unemployment insurance and other aid to vulnerable families, and perhaps automatically roll back payroll taxes and other economic burdens. That way, members of Congress will no longer have the power to take the economy hostage during crises. For now, though, Democrats absolutely have that power. They need to choose their ransom wisely.",Pelosi Has Trump Over a Barrel,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/17/nancy-pelosi-trump-stimulus-132388,politico
"Much of American public life is at a standstill. But not the Democratic presidential race — not yet at least. While some future voting has been postponed due to the burgeoning outbreak of coronavirus across the U.S., primaries in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois are still on for Tuesday. Polling places in Ohio, which was set to vote Tuesday, have been closed down by public health officials after the governor pushed to delay the primary amid the public health crisis. Despite that, think of the vote as Super Tuesday, Jr.: The 441 delegates up for grabs in the three states still voting today makes it the third-largest delegate haul on the calendar, behind only March 3 and the slate of primaries planned for April 28. But between the coronavirus beginning to ravage the nation, the unprecedented, widespread closures that have shuttered public spaces across the country and Joe Biden’s now-commanding lead over Bernie Sanders — in polls released on the eve of the March 17 contests, Biden holds double-digit leads across all four states — the primaries are flying below the radar for many Americans. Last week, officials in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio rejected calls to postpone Tuesday’s primaries, saying that they would make accommodations, including extending early-voting hours, to prevent large crowds from gathering. But on Monday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asked a court in Columbus for a last-minute postponement of the primary. When the court refused, saying it was too late to postpone, the state’s health department ordered the polling places shuttered — despite a lack of clarity about how, or even if, voters might be able to cast ballots in the primary. The Ohio Supreme Court later effectively upheld the decision to close the polls. Here’s a state-by-state look at the map for Tuesday: Democrats are hoping that Tuesday’s presidential primary is the springboard to flipping Arizona in November. President Donald Trump won the state by just 4 points in 2016, and polls conducted there show Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are both competitive against Trump in the general election. Arizona will likely be the closest of the four states voting on Tuesday, according to pre-election polls. But Biden still holds a double-digit lead over Sanders in poll after poll — despite Sanders’ enduring, though not overwhelming, advantage among Latino voters. Clinton defeated Sanders in Arizona four years ago. 56 percent to 41 percent, and carried all nine of the state’s congressional districts. Polls suggest Biden is on pace for a similar victory, barring a surprise. The state is going ahead with its primary despite the coronavirus outbreak. Many voters cast their ballots by mail, but there is still significant disruption. In Maricopa County — which includes Phoenix and is home to roughly 60 percent of registered voters — most polling places are closed for safety reasons. Instead, the county is operating about 150 vote centers on Tuesday, where voters can cast their ballots regardless of where they live within the county. Bernie Sanders was blown out by Hillary Clinton in Florida in 2016 — and his prospects are no more promising in 2020. Polls show Joe Biden with a two- or three-to-one advantage over Sanders, whose lack of support from older Democrats makes him particularly ill-suited for a state that is a magnet for retirees from the eastern third of the nation. Moreover, Sanders’ advantage with Latino voters in other states doesn’t translate to Florida, where many Hispanics are either immigrants or descend from immigrants from Caribbean and Latin American countries whose leftist leaders they despise. Polls show Sanders, who has praised some of the actions of those authoritarian governments, trailing Biden among Hispanic voters in Florida. The state has shuttered and consolidated a number of polling places because of the coronavirus outbreak. The state Democratic Party on Monday identified 91 precincts that were closed after GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered elections officials not to house polling places in nursing homes or assisted-living facilities. But DeSantis resisted calls to reschedule the presidential primaries. “We’re definitely voting,” he told reporters in Tallahassee last Friday. “They voted during the Civil War. We’re going to vote.” Polls close in virtually all of Florida at 7 p.m. Eastern — but remain open an hour later in portions of the Panhandle in the Central Time Zone. Bernie Sanders had the Democratic establishment on edge four years ago when he stormed out of Michigan victorious and nearly beat Hillary Clinton in her home state of Illinois a week later. But in 2020, neighboring Michigan delivered a 16-point rout for Biden and has deflated the Vermont senator’s campaign here. Mike Bloomberg had started to make inroads here but when he, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar folded their campaigns, most of their moderate supporters — and their donors — joined the Biden camp. Gov. J.B. Pritzker also delivered his endorsement to Biden on primary eve. A WGN-TV/Emerson College poll last week showed Biden leading Sanders by 20 percentage points among likely voters in Illinois. Sanders recently rallied in Chicago with Rep. Chuy Garcia and other local Latino officials to help shore up his support. But the cloud hanging over the Tuesday primary is the coronavirus outbreak. Schools have been ordered closed and polling stations are being moved out of senior centers as the number of cases tick up, so it’s unclear what voter turnout will look like. The saga of Ohio’s primary adds significant uncertainty to a race that otherwise seems one-sided. Biden led Sanders in the latest poll by 23 points — in a state Clinton carried by 13 points four years ago, winning all but 15 of the state’s 88 counties. Gov. Mike DeWine’s Monday night order closing the polling places came only about eight hours before they were set to open. DeWine said Secretary of State Frank LaRose would petition the courts “to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.” But it’s unclear how that opportunity would be extended, or when. The ambiguity extends beyond the presidential race. Ohio was set to hold all its primaries for the 2020 elections on Tuesday, including for Congress and state legislature.",How to watch Tuesday’s primaries like a pro,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/how-to-watch-tuesdays-primaries-133318,politico
"Bernie Sanders’ path to the Democratic nomination is closing, but a quick exit is far from guaranteed — even if he gets wiped out Tuesday. From his debate posture to staffing moves to the “virtual rally” he convened Monday evening, the Vermont senator is signaling that he may not be ready to concede.  If Sanders remains in the race, it will be in part to keep his “political revolution” alive. According to people familiar with his thinking, Sanders will not only consider what’s best for his campaign, but also the progressive movement. Many of Sanders’ aides and allies also expect him to press onward after Tuesday. They see a benefit in amassing as many delegates as possible in order to influence the party platform at the Democratic National Convention this summer — even if Sanders himself can’t win the nomination. “I think there’s a very good chance that he will stay in,” said Larry Cohen, chair of Our Revolution, a group founded by Sanders in 2016. “The number of delegates you have, the number of people on the platform committee is absolutely critical.” Notably, Sanders has staff in place for states that vote as late as April 28, according to a campaign adviser, including New York. Sanders’ aides have long thought that he would have a good shot in the Empire State, which is rich in delegates. Earlier this month, Sanders’ team announced it was opening five offices in Pennsylvania, a state seen by many local and state officials as Joe Biden’s second home. A former aide close to the Sanders campaign said that a senior staffer argued as recently as last week that there is still a path to victory even if Sanders suffers major losses Tuesday. “I think he’s in. Who is going to advise him to drop out?” the person said, adding that current aides can “work for whatever group Bernie starts next.” At Sunday’s debate, Sanders not only tried to push Biden’s agenda to the left, but also litigated his past votes extensively. When the former vice president offered him an olive branch by adopting a plan to make college free for families earning less than $125,000 annually, Sanders said it didn’t go far enough. “What I know about Sen. Sanders’ thought process and focus is, it’s all about representing the movement and leading what he initially called the political revolution,” said Kurt Ehrenberg, Sanders’ longtime political strategist in New Hampshire until last year. “And not letting down the people who have been with him all along. I think that’s the most important consideration for him.” The fact that states are postponing their primaries to combat the coronavirus outbreak could provide Sanders more incentive to stay in the race. Georgia, Louisiana and Kentucky, which had previously been scheduled to vote in March, April and May, respectively, have rescheduled their primaries. Party officials in Puerto Rico are in the process of requesting a delay.  If Puerto Rico reschedules its March 29 primary, it will be more than two weeks until the next regularly scheduled primaries.  At the same time, the pandemic and looming possibility of a recession — or even a full-fledged depression — could make it more likely that Sanders stays in because the stakes are so high. “In these very uncertain times, we need a president who is going to put the interests of everyday people over every other consideration — and that’s Bernie Sanders,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ senior adviser. “How do we know that? Because that’s been his consistent life’s work.” If Sanders continues his bid after Tuesday, he will face an onslaught of pressure from establishment Democrats and even some progressives to drop out. Many are wary of a long, divisive primary after 2016, and eager to take on President Donald Trump with the benefit of a united party. Jim Clyburn, whose endorsement helped fuel Biden’s comeback victory in South Carolina, said on the day of the March 10 primaries that the Democratic National Committee should “shut this primary down” and cancel debates if the former vice president swept the races, which he went on to do. Sanders’ electoral prospects are bleak. Momentum — and the delegate count — have shifted to Biden, who looks poised to win another string of contests decisively on Tuesday. “I think it could be much, much more constructive if he gets out earlier,” said Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Sanders during his 2016 campaign. “He’s still going to have roughly 1,000 delegates going into the convention, and that’s all the leverage that you need to influence the platform.” But Sanders often doesn’t follow the unwritten rules of campaigning that other politicians abide by. When he had a heart attack last year — the kind of event that would force most candidates out of an election — he stayed in the race. He also declined to bow out of the 2016 primary even after it was mathematically impossible to win the nomination, instead successfully pushing for a more progressive party platform and major rule changes. And at the same time that Sanders faces pressure from mainstream Democrats to exit, many on the left are encouraging him to stay in. Some Sanders supporters still remember when Biden was badly down in the primary before South Carolina, and envision a turnaround for their own candidate. “My urging to the campaign has been, ‘We’ve got to play this out,’” said Gil Cedillo, a Los Angeles city councilman and prominent Sanders ally. “We’ve got to play the whole game … I’m suggesting we don’t quit simply because now they’re up. Why should we?” Progressive activists see Sanders’ continued candidacy as significant to their movement, even if his chances narrow to almost impossible margins. Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the political action committee Democracy for America, said there is a “real question” about whether either Biden or Sanders can reach the delegate threshold necessary to secure the nomination outright and that the tumultuous nature of the race suggests Sanders should stay in. “I don’t think anyone can predict for sure what’s going to happen between now and the end of this primary contest,” he said. “There’s plenty of time, plenty of delegates left, and this game can change at any minute.” The Democratic Party, he said, “shouldn’t be about shutting it down” before more states vote. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is closely aligned with Elizabeth Warren, urged Sanders to remain in the race through at least March. “Not only should Bernie stay in, but it would actively hurt Democrats’ chances against Trump if he got out prematurely,” he said. “Because especially during this crisis, we need to know that our candidate is tested and stands for bold ideas like paid sick leave, free universal health care and canceling student debt as the right way to put money into the economy.” At the same time, Sanders loathes Trump and considers Biden a friend, which will also likely factor into his decision of whether to continue his bid for the White House after Tuesday. One thing is certain: Only Sanders and his wife, Jane, who has played an instrumental role in his 2020 operation, know for sure if he will carry onward. “All of the important decisions come from Bernie and Jane, as they should,” said Ehrenberg.",‘Who is going to advise him to drop out?’: Bernie may not be ready for quick exit,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-sanders-not-going-quietly-132641,politico
"For the second time in two years, Rep. Dan Lipinski — one of the last members of a dwindling breed of conservative House Democrats who oppose abortion rights — is at risk of losing his seat in a primary. The Illinois lawmaker faces a rematch Tuesday against Marie Newman, a progressive upstart who nearly unseated him in 2018. But what should have been the left’s clearest shot yet at the incumbent is mired in uncertainty, with high-profile progressives distracted by Sen. Bernie Sanders's floundering presidential campaign and the election itself enveloped by the coronavirus crisis. Both camps are at a loss for how to handicap the race. “I personally don’t know,” said Pete Brodnitz, a veteran Democratic pollster working with Lipinski. “You love to say you’re a guru about these things, but there’s too many things we don’t know the answer to.” Lipinski is liberals' highest-profile 2020 primary target. Lining up behind Newman are Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and the Justice Democrats.  Ousting him would be a much-needed victory for these progressives who have struggled to recapture the magic of 2018, including Ocasio-Cortez's defeat of a leading House Democrat, amid a series of roadblocks throughout the primary season. Their latest loss came on Super Tuesday, when Jessica Cisneros, a liberal challenger boosted by the Justice Democrats, failed to oust a moderate Democrat in South Texas. Other progressive Senate candidates also fell short in primaries in Texas and North Carolina. Lipinski's primary may have been their best chance for victory— before the coronavirus outbreak. Newman began March with clear momentum: She was outspending the incumbent on TV by a two-to-one margin, and Lipinski supporters were nervous enough that they had begun urging Republican-leaning voters to pull a Democratic ballot and cast it for the incumbent. The biggest question mark now is turnout. Both campaigns are operating under the assumption that it could be at a historic low, with leaders, including Illinois' governor, urging citizens to be cautious about venturing out into public spaces. Lipinski admitted in an interview last week he was combating a lot of unknowns. “We’ll see where the presidential primary is,” he told reporters in the Capitol. “You don’t know what’s going to happen, don’t know what the coronavirus — what impact that could have. So, just wait and see.” The Newman campaign has urged supporters to vote early, is prioritizing phone banking and canceled its election night party. Both teams could make a plausible case that low turnout is to their benefit, depending on the age and ideology of who shows up. Lipinski’s team thinks he could have an edge with older voters, who tend to be more reliable and may be more likely to go to the polls. Yet the coronavirus disproportionately affects those 60 and older and public health officials urged that demographic should remain in their homes as much as possible. Other liberal challengers, such Ocasio-Cortez, have won low-turnout races where the electorate is smaller and more ideological. The 2018 midterms brought roughly presidential-level primary turnout, and Newman came within 2,200 votes short of ousting Lipinski. Though a new policy by the House Democratic campaign arm that blacklists consultants who work with primary challengers cost her some top campaign talent, Newman said she feels better prepared this cycle. “As you can imagine, your first time out you learn a lot. And I did. And there’s things that I didn’t do well,"" she told reporters in a phone call last week.  Now ""we have an amazing voter outreach program,"" she said. ""I started fundraising a lot earlier this time.” Her campaign, she said, has knocked over 110,000 doors and made 90,000 phone calls. She had outraised Lipinski by more than $400,000 as of late February, and that contrast is particularly stark on television. Newman has funneled about $900,000 on television advertising, while Lipinski has dropped less than $450,000, according to an analysis obtained by POLITICO. Plus a coalition of pro-abortion-rights groups, including EMILY’s List, NARAL Pro-Choice and Planned Parenthood, have dropped about $1 million in TV ads knocking Lipinski. And outside allies who spent for Lipinski in 2018, such as the bipartisan group No Labels, have largely stayed out this cycle, leaving a stark disparity. “She’s got significantly more independent-expenditure resources than she had last time, and we have significantly less,” said Dave Heller, a media consultant for Lipinski, “which is the only reason why we’re worried.” Lipinski is reviled by the liberal wing of the party for a slew of positions and votes that range from defunding Planned Parenthood, to his 2010 opposition to the Affordable Care Act. (He is now notably running an ad touting his efforts to protect that law, attacking Newman for supporting a single-payer health care plan.) Still, Newman has centered her campaign more squarely around other issues like reducing gun violence and making health care affordable. She supports Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal. Lipinski has pitched himself as more in line with the district and suggests Newman is too extreme: ""We should remain focused on what’s important. What really holds us all together as Democrats: the type of agenda that we have had in the House with our majority in this Congress."" Yet there’s evidence to suggest his allies are leaning on independent and Republican voters to boost him in the Democratic primary. An internal campaign strategy document accidentally leaked in November suggested “GOP surrogates” could help Lipinski court Republican voters. Then this weekend, a Newman volunteer received what appeared to be an automated text message mobilizing GOP-leaning voters to ""stop"" Newman and Cook County (Ill.) prosecutor Kim Foxx. Asked last week about the possibility of courting Republican voters — Illinois doesn't have party registration, so voters can pull whichever party's primary ballot they request — Lipinski said it was not the focus of his outreach but suggested he would take their support. “I think it’s good to have more people vote in the Democratic primary, bring them into the Democratic Party,” he said. Lipinski was first elected in 2004, after his father, then-Rep. Bill Lipinski, announced his surprise retirement and persuaded the state Democratic Party to nominate his son to replace him on that fall's ballot. The younger Lipinski could benefit from Chicago machine politics that boosted him and his father in the past. He will need to run up the margins in the Chicago part of the district, as he did two years ago, while Newman is banking on support in the southwest suburbs. A win by Newman on Tuesday would bring a surge of energy to progressives disheartened by a stinging loss earlier this month against Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who has also opposed abortion rights.  Cuellar and his fellow moderates have hailed his victory over Cisneros, a 26-year-old immigration attorney, as an indicator that their caucus is still a big-tent party. “It bodes well for moderates and centrists,” said Cuellar, who said he had discussed his race with Lipinski. “A lot of members were very happy I won because they felt that, if I would have lost, then that would have created a momentum.” Sanders’ dismal performance in recent primaries has relieved some Lipinski supporters, who worried Sanders could drive out young and more left-leaning voters out to the polls, and that they would be more likely to support Newman. Interviewed last week at the Capitol as the House scrambled to cobble together a program to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, some top progressives suggested they had not been closely monitoring Lipinksi’s race or were otherwise preoccupied. ""Obviously, I’ve been very busy with the Sanders campaign,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a top Sanders surrogate. “But I’m supportive of her; we did some fundraising for her.” “I don’t know any of the day-to-day detail stuff,” said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who endorsed Newman, when asked if he was following the race. The scaling back of large gatherings precluded any kind of final-weekend rally with big-name headliners like Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez — though it’s not clear if any would have materialized without the outbreak. Neither campaigned for Cisneros in South Texas. “I was always a little bit worried about this dynamic,” said Sean McElwee, the founder of a liberal think tank. “The extent to which the top of the ticket was going to swamp out interest in the down-ticket stuff was always a danger for these primary challengers this cycle.”","This anti-abortion rights, Obamacare-opposing House Democrat is in trouble",2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/dan-lipinski-primary-133226,politico

"The return of the snowbird is a sign of spring in Canada — though this year, those returning from states with coronavirus cases are causing concern rather than celebration. Hundreds of thousands of retired Canadians spend their winters in warm American climes, timing their return with the melt of the snow back home. Heightened concerns about the rapid spread of COVID-19 are prompting Canadian officials to openly question whether the travelers may bring home more than memories and souvenirs. It's unclear if border agents are prepared to manage their arrival or if the travelers know about the self-quarantine precautions they’re supposed to take when they get to Canada.  Many of those “snowbirds” live part of the year in Florida, which has seen a stark increase in the number of diagnoses and at least 141 positive cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus that’s spread across the globe. Those retirees are among the most vulnerable populations affected by the upper respiratory disease. With rising concern about the outbreak, politicians and health officials are wondering aloud how they'll handle the influx as cases of the virus continue to rise in the country. Ontario Chief Medical Officer David Williams said Monday that the province was “trying to get some direction from the federal government” on how to manage the snowbirds' return. “We’re seeing a number of Ontarians at least coming back in ever-increasing numbers,” he said. “Unfortunately, a number of them, after a few days, have been found to be positive from different parts of the USA.” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said Sunday he's instructed the province's tourism arm to redirect advertising toward Canadians, including snowbirds, to inform them of the new protocols upon arrival in the country from abroad. Just as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was appealing for Canadians abroad to return home as soon as possible, many of these older citizens were notified by their medical insurers that their coverage for COVID-19 will expire in the next week if they remain away. Trudeau said Monday that anyone showing symptoms associated with the illness won't be permitted to board flights to Canada beginning Wednesday, adding another potential complication to anyone trying to leave the U.S. Evan Rachkovsky, a spokesperson for the Canadian Snowbird Association, said his group has emailed more than 100,000 members with up-to-date information on Canadian government recommendations, including that they will be expected to self-isolate upon return. “We are doing everything that we can do to flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus,” Rachkovsky said when asked how members were receiving the instructions, adding that the group has been providing the details about self-isolation for more than a week. “The response has been positive in the sense that ... they’re obviously being cautious, and they want to return home as quickly as possible,” he said. He did not have information on whether any members have tested positive for the virus. The Canada Border Services Agency announced new coronavirus screening questions Monday after being criticized for an apparently haphazard approach to evaluating inbound travelers for possible symptoms and to advising them on the strongly encouraged 14-day self-isolation period upon arrival. Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said every Canadian returning home — including snowbirds arriving by car — will receive information telling them to self-isolate. “People who ... maybe spent the winter down in Florida or in Arizona, many of them will be driving back,” he said Monday. “That same information will be provided to them as they cross into Canada ensuring that they understand the need to self-isolate for 14 days.” Florida and Arizona are the most popular states among snowbirds, Rachkovsky said. St. Petersburg and Clearwater boast “several thousand” Canadians come wintertime, and many also flock to the Phoenix and Mesa areas of Arizona, he said. It’s difficult to estimate how many snowbirds will return to Canada in the coming days, Rachkovsky said. “But you’re definitely dealing with hundreds of thousands of people"" who are being asked to leave as quickly as possible, he added.",Return of Canada's 'snowbirds' raises COVID-19 concerns,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/canada-snowbird-coronavirus-133062,politico
"Bernie Sanders has run up the score among young voters in state after state, but his efforts have hit a wall in South Florida.  In a place where young Cuban-Americans joined their elders in the streets with pots and pans to celebrate Fidel Castro’s death, the Vermont senator’s Democratic socialism and past refusals to wholeheartedly condemn Castro and other Latin American authoritarian leaders are proving costly. “I’m more progressive than Biden, but I also don’t want to stand next to the dummy in the Che Guevara T-shirt at a rally, and that’s true here regardless of age,” said Carmen Pelaez, a founding member of Project Cafecito, a grassroots initiative in Miami that leads get-out-the-vote efforts for progressive candidates.  For Sanders, who posted big margins among young and Latino voters in places like California, Nevada and Texas, the resistance he’s encountering among young Latinos is a harbinger of a rough election night in the state that serves as the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries.  It’s not that Joe Biden is wildly popular among younger Latinos, just that he’s a more palatable alternative for many of them. “Are we excited about Biden’s candidacy? I don’t think so. But it’s just what Bernie represents to those here in South Florida that could be catastrophic, especially in a general election matchup,” said Toni Rodriguez, national political director for College Democrats.  “Here in South Florida, Bernie Sanders’ message is disconnected. And that’s telling people, ‘No, we need to vote for Biden because Bernie won’t resonate here in Florida,” Rodriguez, a student at Barry University in Miami Shores, Fla., added.  Cuban-Americans — known for their high voter turnout rates — have for decades been the largest group of Latinos in South Florida, with more than half of the state’s 2 million Cubans living in the region. But it’s only been in the past 20 years that Cuban-Americans have started playing a big role in Democratic politics as voters under 50 — many born in the U.S. — have broken with the Republican Party and embraced more liberal views than their parents and grandparents.  That generational change was reflected in the last presidential election: In 2004, George W. Bush won 78 percent of Florida’s Cuban-American vote, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of exit polls. By 2016, Donald Trump only managed to capture just over half of that vote. The red-to-blue evolution has its limits, however.  Pelaez points out that other Latino groups in South Florida, like Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, also favor Biden in the primary because of their family and friends’ history with socialist and authoritarian regimes — a sign of their different background and experience than Latinos in the Southwest, where Sanders had more widespread support.  “We come from countries where we’ve seen the slogan ‘Socialismo o muerte’ on the walls. We either survived socialism or have grandparents that did and have grown up with those stories,” Pelaez said. “Other Latinos don’t have that frame of reference.” That difference was reflected in a Florida poll last week that showed Sanders trailing Biden, 48 percent to 37 percent, among Hispanic voters.  Only 18 percent of Florida Hispanics — from Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Central and South America — said they would vote for a self-described socialist, while 70 percent said they would not, according to the survey conducted for Telemundo Station Group by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy.  More than 50 percent of Florida Hispanic voters under 50 years old said they would not vote for a socialist candidate, compared with 31 percent who said they would.  To some Florida Latinos, those numbers are proof that Biden would be a stronger rival to Trump in November — and would provide more top-of-the-ticket protection for Latino down-ballot candidates. “A lot of people in Florida know in order to win you have to have a more moderate standpoint. That’s been known,” said Mayra Macías, executive director of Latino Victory Project, an organization that endorsed Biden and is dedicated to electing Latinos up and down the ballot. Macías explained that in a state like Florida, voters are thinking beyond the presidential matchup, given the history of close races for national, state and local offices. She pointed to the reelection campaigns for Democratic Reps. Debbie Mucarsel Powell and Donna Shalala, both of whom flipped their South Florida districts in 2018 from Cuban Republicans and are up against two well-known Cuban Republican opponents again. Trump took to Twitter to endorse Mucarsel Powell‘s GOP opponent, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, just hours after he launched his campaign in January. “It’s all these candidates that would get affected … and hurt by a campaign’s inability to distinguish their brand of Democratic socialism from the socialism that many folks in Florida fled from or have a negative perception of,” Macías said.  Democrats have chronically struggled to get more Latino candidates on the ballot — the only Cuban-Americans in the Florida congressional delegation are Republican: Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Díaz Balart.  It’s critical for Biden to court Latinos “who came of political consciousness post the Obama years,” Macías said. “It’s going to be extremely important for the campaign to articulate a vision for them.”",Meet the young voters who refuse to vote for Bernie,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-florida-youth-132928,politico
"The voice of the woman, introducing herself as “Elisabeth … you know, Poldi’s mom,” sounded genuinely concerned. A friend of hers, who was a doctor at the university hospital of Vienna, had called her with a warning, she said in German. The clinic had noticed that most patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus pandemic, had taken the painkiller ibuprofen before they were hospitalized. Tests run by the university’s laboratory, she added, had found “strong evidence that ibuprofen accelerates the multiplication of the virus.” With lightning speed, an audio recording of the message spread among German-language users of WhatsApp, the messenger service owned by Facebook. Quickly, similar recordings referring to alleged research from Vienna in other languages like Slovak also began circulating on the service. But the WhatsApp message was based on fake information. “Nonsense,” said Johannes Angerer, a spokesperson for the Medical University of Vienna. “We neither discussed this internally, nor do we conduct any research into the potential effects of ibuprofen on COVID-19.” While there have been warnings against the use of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen to treat coronavirus-like symptoms, including by France’s health minister, everything the voice recording said about research efforts at the medical school had been made up, he stressed. The university released statements to flag the messages as fake within hours after first hearing about them Saturday morning. But the proverbial horse had bolted: German-language Google searches for the keywords “ibuprofen” and “Corona” spiked on Saturday around noon, according to data from the search giant. Over the weekend, the university’s website collapsed temporarily. The case provides an example of how, as the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, a wildfire of false and unverified information about the pandemic is following in its wake. On private messaging services like WhatsApp, well-intentioned but fearful individuals are forwarding messages with misleading or doctored information. Other cases range from warnings over made-up extraordinary measures governments might take to keep people in their homes to false numbers of deaths and the level of preparedness of medical services. “We are aware of an increasing number of false information about the COVID-19 outbreak appearing in public discourse, including on social media,” European Commission Vice President Věra Jourová, whose portfolio includes the EU’s efforts to fight fake news, told POLITICO in an email. But she also acknowledged that “we need to understand better the risks related to communication on end-to-end encryption services.” The Vienna fake is far from an isolated case of such digital misinformation — and others often follow a similar pattern that involves people claiming to share insider information with friends and family that they’ve gained access to. Among Belgian WhatsApp users, an audio message has been circulating with a woman claiming the hospital she worked in had triggered “the maximum pandemic plan.” Other voice recordings warned people of a complete lockdown of the country and urged them to stock up on food. Poland was hit by a wave of rumors about the government introducing zoning to cities and cutting off transportation to Warsaw. One audio message, recorded by a man who claimed he had a journalist friend with close ties to political decision-makers, said that as of last Sunday, the president would introduce an “emergency state” and that people wouldn’t be able to leave their houses for three weeks. In France, users forwarded an audio message of a woman who said that she has “a very very very well placed uncle” with ties to national ministers from whom she got information that the whole country would soon be in full quarantine. And in Portugal, a widely circulated voice message suggested that information on the number of infected people in the country was downplayed by official sources, with a man saying: “Forget the numbers the television is talking about. There are thousands of infected in Portugal, confirmed.” In Ireland, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar pleaded with people on Twitter: “I am urging everyone to please stop sharing unverified info on What’sApp groups. These messages are scaring and confusing people and causing real damage.” Jourová, who is drafting new proposals on how to protect EU democracies from misinformation, warned that her office was “concerned that some [false claims] can lead to public harm, such as false claims that drinking bleach cures the virus, or abuse the situation for material gain.” Her office is “is in regular contact with online platforms” to address the issue, she added. Experts have warned that, as Facebook has clamped down on misinformation on its main platform, its messenger service WhatsApp, which was bought in 2014, is increasingly becoming a key arena for the spread of misinformation. The social networking giant has invested millions of euros to clamp down on falsehoods on its main network, so people have turned to WhatsApp because it is less regulated and allows people to share personal messages with large numbers of people. In a statement, the company said that it is “committed to doing our part to tackle viral messages,” among other things by “reducing the number of people you can forward a message to.” In recent years, Facebook has limited the ability of people to forward WhatsApp messages in an attempt to stop misinformation from spreading like wildfire, and has teamed up with governments to help them share official announcements on the platform. “We encourage all users to check the facts online before sharing messages that have been forwarded to them, and we encourage users to engage directly with trusted and official sources for important information,” a company spokesperson added. Still, the rise of WhatsApp represents the latest turn in the cat-and-mouse game between those spreading misinformation — often people who are doing so unwittingly — and the global platform’s ability to thwart such activities. For Claire Wardle, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who has tracked WhatsApp’s role in spreading falsehoods, the platform allows people to share personal details — something many are eager to do in a time of crisis. “So much of this is about emotion, and audio is an emotive medium,” she said. “That phenomenon, which dates back to what we saw in India, is finally coming to Western Europe. People are turning to WhatsApp because they have more to say, and they want to speak directly to their friends and family.”", The coronavirus fake news pandemic sweeping WhatsApp,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/coronavirus-fake-news-pandemic-133447,politico
"Before markets started spiraling like 1987’s “Black Monday” crash, and even before President Donald Trump heard from state governors and G-7 leaders trying to stave off deaths at home, the president received a series of fresh warnings about the scale of the calamity poised to wash over America.  His coronavirus task force presented new information based on overseas models showing how quickly the virus could spread without swift action. And new data he was shown from China overnight highlighted that country’s economic collapse — plunging factory activity and soaring unemployment — despite its draconian measures to combat the coronavirus crisis.  Faced with a reality that the nation he oversees needs to take dramatic action or follow in the footsteps of deeply troubled nations abroad, the president took on a newly somber tone about a virus outbreak he spent months downplaying.  “I’m glad to see that you’re practicing social distancing,” Trump quipped as he stepped up to the lectern in an unscheduled appearance at the sparsely populated James S. Brady briefing room in the White House, where reporters were arranged with open seats between them. It was a short moment of levity for Trump before he laid out dramatic new guidelines aimed at curbing the spread of the virus and saving lives. He instructed people to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people, stay home from work or school if possible, avoid travel and nursing homes.  In just 24 hours, the president went from telling people filling up their pantries to just “relax,” to acknowledging the economy might be careening toward a recession and warning the public they have a narrow window of 15 days to stop the spread of a lethal disease. “It’s bad. It’s bad,” Trump said. “But we’re going to be hopefully a best case, not a worst case. And that’s what we’re working for.” It was a dramatic change in tone from his Oval Office address, which was riddled with mistakes; his Rose Garden news conference, where he went against expert recommendations and shook hands with everyone in sight; and his Sunday appearance with the vice president, when he rattled off a list of CEOs he talked to on the phone only to turn on his heels without taking questions. “Each and every one of us has a critical role to play,” Trump said Monday, flanked by members of his task force. “If everyone makes these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus.” The shift represented a new understanding by the White House of the risk that the U.S. could soon be overwhelmed by a disease explosion.  “Look, we could have a spike in these cases or we could blunt the curve,” national security adviser Robert O’Brien told POLITICO. “And if we can blunt the curve we can end up with a situation where our health care system can handle the crisis. We don’t want a spike the way we’ve seen in Italy.” The president, who just one day before said the virus would quickly pass, said Americans should brace for the coronavirus to affect daily lives as late as July or August. And he appeared disturbed to hear that some of his closest allies, like GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, had bucked the advice of the health professionals standing at his side by encouraging people to go to restaurants. “Well, I would disagree with it,” Trump said. “It's adverse to what the professionals are saying.” Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer called it a “striking difference.”  “This was sobering, serious, realistic and modest. This is what the doctor ordered,” Fleischer said. The 180-degree turn came after Trump was urged by allies privately and publicly to do more as the crisis careened out of control.  Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, an outside adviser to Trump, penned an op-ed in The New York Times on Monday that didn’t criticize the president but did push him to act more aggressively by directing governors to close all schools and prohibit attendance at public facilities, including restaurants and bars, until at least May 11, among other suggestions.  “More must be done to prepare for increasing case numbers and to effectively communicate what must be done to reduce the threat,” he wrote. “I fear Americans are not yet taking this virus seriously enough.” And Newt Gingrich, another ally of the president, whose wife is the ambassador to the Holy See in Vatican City, wrote a chilling first-person account of what he saw in Italy.  “Faced with a pandemic threat, history teaches us it is far better to be overprepared than underprepared,” Gingrich wrote in Newsweek. “The lesson of Italy is that the sooner you act, the fewer lives you will lose and the less damage you will do to your economy.” On Sunday, the president hoped that the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its target interest rate to near zero would help blunt the market’s nosedive and for once lavished praise on an institution he regularly lambastes on Twitter. “That makes me very happy,” he said in a news conference.  But a former adviser said Trump realized Monday when the financial markets continued to fall that he had to do more. “The Fed obviously didn’t help” calm the waters, the person said. Trump was also deeply alarmed by the economic collapse in China that became apparent early Monday, according to two people close to the White House. Data released late Sunday showed a 13.5 percent decline in China’s industrial output in January and February from a year earlier, as well as a dramatic spike in unemployment. The country has also experienced a widespread suspension of manufacturing since the coronavirus outbreak began in China’s Hubei province in December.  “The president understands numbers and they were explaining to him some of the China economic numbers over the weekend and now he knows what’s coming here,” said one person close to Trump, adding that the drop in manufacturing truly startled the president. “This is a communist country that sealed off everyone in their apartments and is still seeing those numbers, so it made him realize there’s no way for the U.S. not to suffer those consequences and what he needs to do is whatever he can to get us through this as quickly as possible,” the person added.  News of China’s economic free fall came just days after the president and his team boasted about gains in U.S. markets following his declaration of a national emergency — during the Rose Garden ceremony last Friday at which Trump surrounded himself with corporate executives.  Up until Saturday, officials inside the White House Office of Legislative Affairs were “trying to project as much confidence” as possible in their conversations with the president, a tone that began to shift Sunday morning as more governors implemented lockdowns on non-essential businesses and ordered their residents to avoid gatherings of 50 people or more.  “It’s smart what he’s done. He’s made a decision to downplay expectations,” said a second person close to the White House after watching Trump’s appearance at the White House briefing Monday afternoon. Another official noted that the new White House guidelines gave some governors political cover to call for curfews and closures that have been met with groans by some small businesses bearing the brunt of the new rules or eye-rolls from younger Americans who may be less susceptible to the physical damage of the virus.  “I think the media has to recognize why he was hired by the American people — he’s not going to be consoler-in-chief,” said Jason Miller, a senior adviser on Trump’s 2016 campaign and an unofficial adviser. “They want him to go and get it done. What he’s realized here from the markets to society … they react to big bold leadership.” Fleischer said the president was able this time to be “reassuring and realistic.” “When events are this big, this serious, and this scary, the president’s communications job is twofold: One, be reassuring. And two, be realistic. And those two reinforce each other. The more realistic a president is, the more a country will believe his reassurances.” Still, Trump didn’t let go of his old approach completely.  When asked by a reporter Monday to rate his response on a scale of 1 to 10, the president answered in Trumpian fashion: “I’d rate it a 10. I think we’ve done a great job.”",A chastened Trump presents a newly somber tone,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-coronavirus-133278,politico
"Even before Congress has finished work on a second stimulus bill to deal with the coronavirus crisis, senators from both parties and the White House are already talking about a third package, which will come with a price tag that runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  And few people, from President Donald Trump on down, are complaining about the cost — knowing the country faces a potentially unprecedented economic hit from the pandemic.  But perhaps the most shocking fact is that the normally slow-moving Senate could pass the “Phase 3” bill this week, according to several GOP senators.  Following a meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, acting budget chief Russ Vought, and White House legislative affairs Director Eric Ueland, Senate Republicans said the Trump administration will present them with proposals on Tuesday for the latest response to the economic calamity caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  GOP senators said Mnuchin wants to funnel money to small businesses hit by the crisis, perhaps tens of billions of dollars.  And the U.S. airline industry, which has taken a huge hit as passengers disappear, could also get some financial help from the federal government. While the administration doesn't want to call it a bailout, the airline industry has warned that some carriers may face a ""potential valley of death"" if action isn’t taken quickly. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other top Democrats will roll out their own $750 billion-plus package on Tuesday, and what Trump and Senate Republicans will propose may equal or top that.  “I’m not going to comment on the specific numbers right now. I’ll be talking to the Republicans at lunch tomorrow. But it’s a big number,” Mnuchin said after huddling with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other senior Republicans for more than an hour in the Capitol on Monday.  “And we’ll be looking for support for small and medium-sized businesses, we’ll be looking for support for certain industries that we’ve talked about that are particularly hard hit. I’ve talked about airlines, hotels, others. And we will be looking at a general stimulus.”  “The president has instructed his team to look very expansively at what we have to do, and not be impeded by the potential price tag for what’s necessary here,” Ueland added.  A multibillion-dollar measure crafted by Mnuchin and Speaker Nancy Pelosi to provide some paid sick leave, expand free coronavirus testing, and boost food aid and unemployment insurance is expected to be taken up in the Senate as early as Tuesday. Congress already passed an $8.3 billion bill to combat the virus. Mnuchin is supposed to attend a Senate GOP luncheon on Tuesday and offer specific proposals for the next piece of congressional action.  Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who attended the session with Mnuchin and other administration officials, said the Senate could move to a new rescue package as early as this week. In fact, Rubio said many senators made it clear they want to move ahead on that drastically accelerated timeline. “I don’t think we can assume that we can keep reconvening the Senate every week like we did this week. I don’t think we can make that assumption,” Rubio said. “With what might happen to airlines or travel schedules, with individual members having to go into quarantine or being exposed — I don’t think we can operate as if we can just bring the Senate and House back whenever we want.”  McConnell’s office wouldn’t comment on the possibility of passing the Phase 3 bill, although a Senate GOP aide noted, “The discussions are too premature to say at this point. But now that FISA is out of the way, it opens up more floor space for possible consideration.” Ueland also noted that Trump wants quick action as well.  “We can’t let weeks and months get under our feet here,” Ueland said. “Again, we have a real focus on urgent action, and I’m hopeful there could be swift consideration of consensus ideas as quickly as possible.”  Senators in both parties acknowledged they were concerned about the current government deficit, which was already projected to be more than $1 trillion before the coronavirus hit and derailed the economy.  But now, they point out that only the federal government can respond to this emergency with the financial power needed to address the present emergency.  “The reason having a massive deficit is a problem is that in a crisis, only the federal government can frankly provide support to state and local governments that have to balance their budgets,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.).  Senate Democrats blamed the 2017 GOP tax cut — engineered by Mnuchin, McConnell and other Republican leaders — for the huge deficit, yet warned it shouldn’t matter now.  “We wouldn’t have that trillion-dollar deficit if we didn’t do a totally unnecessary tax cut,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). “But if we go into a recession or a depression, we’re talking trillions of dollars there.”  Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a deficit hawk, said he would offer an amendment to cut spending from other programs for every dollar added in stimulus spending.  “I think that all spending should be offset by cutting less important spending, so I will offer an amendment to pay for it,” Paul said. “I think anytime we choose to spend money, no matter what the cause is, we should pay for it.”  Paul predicted such “pay for” amendments will be allowed because party leaders won’t want to get bogged down in a procedural fight that could disrupt quick action on the package.

"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden narrowly won the Washington primary, keeping a lead over fellow candidate and progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to the Associated Press. Washington was one of six states that voted last Tuesday — including Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, North Dakota and Idaho — but was the last to have a winner declared Monday evening. Washington votes entirely by mail-in ballots.  Biden secured victories in all states except North Dakota, which went to Sanders. His Washington win continues a surge for the former vice president that initially started with a rocky trail behind Sanders.  Biden won by more than 21,000 of the over 2 million votes cast, according to the AP. Though 13 candidates were on the ballot, Biden and Sanders were the main candidates after a litany of prominent Democrats — including Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren — dropped out of the race. Sanders won the state's caucuses in 2016, beating out Hillary Clinton. Washington later had a non-binding primary that year that did not have an impact on the state's delegates, which Clinton won.

"As hospitals grapple with more coughing and feverish emergency-room visitors than they can test, the White House has deployed a SWAT team of fixers and technocrats to ramp up coronavirus testing, in an implicit acknowledgment that the Trump administration’s response has continued to fall short of what is needed. About 100 staffers and outside advisers, split between the health department and the White House, are currently working on teams to rapidly increase supplies of test kits and cope with shortages across the country, said four people with knowledge of the strategy. “This is the A-team of people who get shit done,” said one official, who’s worked with some of the staffers leading the effort. “We’ve got to show the American people that we can deliver on the testing promises” after weeks of President Donald Trump vowing that “anybody who needs a test can get a test” — a claim that doesn’t match the growing number of doctors, hospitals and patients who have said they’re still waiting for access and results. The lack of testing remains — despite Vice President Mike Pence’s assurance that drive-thru testing centers should be operative later this week — the greatest immediate danger to the U.S. response to the crisis, public health experts have warned. While Johns Hopkins University on Monday reported more than 4,287 confirmed cases of coronavirus across the United States, the true number could easily be more than 10 times higher at this point. That’s complicated medical professionals’ efforts to focus their resources and hurt public health officials’ effort to marshal a response. “We are far behind where we need to be,” tweeted Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, who changed his Twitter name to read ""Ashish 'We super duper need testing for COVID' Jha."" While the Harvard expert this weekend guessed that at least 40,000 people may be infected, ""we can't know without testing"" how big the problem is, he added. The SWAT-team effort is being overseen by Brett Giroir, the HHS official who was tapped as the nation’s testing coordinator on Friday, and Adam Boehler, a former HHS official who was drawn in to the coronavirus response last week. Brad Smith, a health-industry entrepreneur who only joined the administration in January, is serving as the operational leader. Outside experts in health care delivery and technology, like Flatiron Health CEO Nat Turner, also have been brought in as advisers. The officials have spent the past five days in round-the-clock war rooms and strategy sessions, gaming out ways to deploy drive-thru testing as Pence and Trump have promised this week. The initial testing centers will prioritize health workers and vulnerable populations, like people over 65, with a focus on the states that are hardest hit by the coronavirus. The new SWAT-team approach is similar to the emergency effort to repair HealthCare.gov in 2013, three officials said, although drew distinctions between the Obama-era recovery strategy — to fix the rollout of a long-scheduled website — and the frantic response to a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. “This shit hasn’t happened before,” said one senior administration official. “It’s not like we planned for coronavirus, and six months later we had a coronavirus.” Tapping officials like Giroir and Boehler, who have steered multiple administration priorities like President Donald Trump’s HIV/AIDS strategy and kidney-care overhaul, and a technocrat like Smith, is a tacit acknowledgment of management failures with the existing strategy, said two individuals, with the Trump administration cycling through multiple leaders and tactics — and officials trading blame for why testing has run so far behind. Much of the Trump administration’s initial strategy rested on coronavirus tests distributed by the Centers for Disease Control, which turned out to have manufacturing problems. CDC Director Robert Redfield has been widely faulted inside the administration for problems with his agency’s tests and miscommunicating to senior officials when replacement tests would be ready. HHS Secretary Alex Azar, who led the initial response, is frustrated with Redfield, said two people familiar with the situation, and dispatched Giroir earlier this month to the CDC to quietly investigate the problems within the agency, said three individuals briefed on the effort. The health secretary also elevated Giroir and another official, emergency-preparedness chief Robert Kadlec, to take over the department’s coronavirus response. Meanwhile, two officials blamed Azar himself for not doing more to coordinate the overall response across January and February, leaving the administration well short on the number of necessary tests. Some of the strategies taken in recent days, like working with private labs to ramp up tests, could have been pursued nearly two months ago under Azar’s leadership, the officials said. Vice President Mike Pence took over the response from Azar about three weeks ago, amid frustrations about the state of the effort and whether Azar's public health deputies had been too alarmist in their messages. But Pence has focused on coordinating the larger message and his office has lacked operational support to execute on specific initiatives, said two individuals. The new SWAT team is also a reflection of the growing involvement of White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, in the administration's coronavirus response. Kushner is a longtime friend of Boehler, who led the Medicare innovation center until taking a new role as chief of U.S. international development finance chief last fall, and is viewed as an apolitical Silicon Valley veteran. Meanwhile, Smith is a Boehler ally who inherited his job at the Medicare innovation center before being pulled in to coordinate the SWAT team response. Asked about the shifting roles and responsibilities, an HHS spokesperson touted the decision to bring on more operational experts like Giroir. “The Trump Administration has activated a whole of government response to COVID-19 and all of our leaders bring highly valuable experience and expertise to this effort,” the spokesperson said. “The American people should know that the entire government is working around the clock to prepare for and protect against COVID-19.” The White House also defended the CDC’s role and response, despite problems with the agency’s tests that led to weeks of limited information about the spread of coronavirus. “CDC is doing what they could, given their tools and resources,” said Katie Miller, a spokesperson for Pence. “Given the increased demand, the administration is doing as much as to add additional capacity in an expedited manner.” The nation’s inadequate coronavirus testing has meant that the true scope of the problem is unknown. One doctor involved in the coronavirus response at a New York City-area hospital, who asked for confidentiality because the doctor did not have permission to speak to the media, said the facility has seen its coronavirus cases jump from just a handful of confirmed patients a week ago to more than a dozen as of Sunday, as more testing has come online. But the true scope of the outbreak still can't be measured, the doctor added, because patients who aren’t sick enough to be hospitalized aren’t getting tested, and the facility has been turning away dozens of less critically ill people who present with coronavirus symptoms, creating a “big gap” between official numbers and the disease’s likely spread. Crystal Lucas, a former state legislature candidate in Florida, told POLITICO that her 61-year-old mother-in-law went to the emergency room of Palms West Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla., on Friday with respiratory problems. Four hours later, she was admitted. “The nurse told us she hadn’t been tested because they didn’t have any test kits,” Lucas said. “She had an infectious disease doctor on her team when she was still in a regular hospital room. She was obviously suspected to have an infectious disease.” Palms West’s communications office did not respond to requests for comment. The patient, Vickie Schafer, is now in critical condition, Lucas said. She finally got a coronavirus test on Sunday evening and is awaiting the results. “Everything points to COVID and they treated it as if it wasn’t even on their radar,” said Lucas. “If we have this going on and this woman presents all the symptoms, why would we not act as if she is already positive?” If Schafer tests positive, it could indicate the virus has spread in Loxahatchee, the area of Palm Beach County where she lives. As of Monday evening, there were eight cases in the county, according to the state Department of Health’s website. In addition to worrying about her mother-in-law, Lucas said she worries about the doctors and nurses Schafer might have been exposed to the coronavirus between Friday and Sunday. And she worries about the patients those people might have come into contact with. Some hospital officials have said they would have developed their own coronavirus tests weeks ago but were told to stand down by officials at CDC and the Food and Drug Administration. “We were told two things,” said Alan Wells, medical director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s clinical laboratories. “One, that they were developing the testing and that CDC and states would be able to handle this. Two, that they were exercising authority to regulate which testing was approved.” Combined with other factors, including limited supplies, Wells’ team decided to shelve their potential coronavirus testing plan six weeks ago, but resumed work as the situation worsened and finally unveiled the tests on Saturday. Public health leaders, doctors and even Wall Street investors, are growing worried about the lack of transparency around the inadequate response. “Testing is getting there but with the virus doubling right now at minimum every seven days, each day of testing lost is a day that more people get sick,” Financial services firm Raymond James warned investors on Sunday night.

"TALLAHASSEE — Door knocking? Nope. Surrogate stops? Canceled. The bubbly? Corked. Even the candidates will be AWOL. Florida, a state famed for its weirdness, is preparing for one of its weirdest election days on Tuesday, when Democrats and Republicans will brave a pandemic to cast primary ballots for their presidential nominees. With two popular candidates on the ballot, Democrats were hoping to deliver a show of force against President Donald Trump with pumped-up turnout and lots of noise. Instead, they’ve had their mojo stolen by the coronavirus. Florida is a presidential election year crown jewel, a delegate-rich state that does double duty as the nation’s largest battleground. It’s expensive and difficult to flex institutional and infrastructure muscle in the state, which serves as a barometer of any campaign’s viability. Still, neither Joe Biden nor Bernie Sanders have campaigned here this year, and neither will be glad-handing Tuesday. Democratic get-out-the-vote operations are all but halted, and for the first time in memory there will be no Election Day parties. As the country hunkers down to avoid the coronavirus, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, on Monday made a push to postpone his state’s Tuesday primary, a plea a judge rejected late Monday. Illinois and Arizona, which also vote Tuesday, are at full speed. And in Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said he’s not going to panic. “We’re definitely voting,” he said Saturday at a coronavirus briefing. “They voted during the Civil War. We’re going to vote.” Besides, he said, most ballots probably have been cast in early voting already. And neither party’s primary, he noted, are going to be cliffhangers. Florida has a reputation for botched elections — from hanging chads in 2000 to a confusing recount in 2018 that led to the ouster of two South Florida election supervisors. This time around, polling places could present the biggest challenge. In an effort to protect elderly populations most at risk from the coronavirus, DeSantis has shut down voting sites at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Democrats are riled up. “We agree with the governor’s decision. We think it’s good policy to protect at-risk populations,” said Juan Peñalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party. “But there is no list of impacted voting locations. It’s information we want to help communicate to voters, but we were told by the governor’s office there is no list, and won’t be before Election Day.” So Peñalosa’s staff and volunteers are making their own list. They’ve reached out to all of the state’s 67 county election offices to find out where polling sites will be closed. “We are compiling a list and have already started communicating to impacted voters,” Peñalosa said. Then there’s the problem of staffing. Poll workers afraid of being exposed to the virus are dropping out. That’s on top of the election coinciding with spring break — many workers have begged off duty this year due to family obligations. Pasco County elections supervisor Brian Corley said he started “hemorrhaging” poll workers after a county resident tested positive for the coronavirus. “I can’t blame them,” Corley said. “A lot of them are senior citizens.” Corley said he’s lost 175 workers so far, and has turned to the local sheriff, schools and county government to find people to fill their spots. School resource officers from the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office will be among those reporting for duty on Tuesday, along with teachers and other county employees. “We can’t get to them fast enough,” Corley said. Still, election supervisors remain optimistic the day will go smoothly, in part because turnout won’t be that high. “We knew going in this was going to be challenging,” said Orange County Supervisor of Elections Bill Cowles. And Corley said he’s doing the unthinkable — encouraging voters to not show up, especially if they’re sick or at risk. “If anyone is unsure, don’t go to the polls, as much as it pains me to say that,” Corley said. “Elections are wonderful, but this is a political party nominating contest.” Campaign operations also are improvising as the coronavirus creep sets in. Rather than emphasizing last-minute campaign and policy talking points, or feverishly ramping up their face-to-face ground game, campaigns are employing public-service-type announcements. Entire operations have gone virtual. Digital events have replaced rallies, in-person fundraising has been canceled, and election night parties just won’t happen. Because neither race is close — Biden has lapped Sanders in state polls and Trump has no serious challengers — any impact on the actual results will be minimal as Florida copes with its slice of a global pandemic. “Post South Carolina, when Biden surged in southern states, Florida experienced the same shift,” said Dan Newman, a Florida Democratic consultant who is unaligned in the presidential primary. “Basically, the race coalesced into Sanders and non-Sanders, and as a trusted national name, Biden was the beneficiary.” More than a million Florida Democrats already have voted by mail or at early voting locations, surpassing pre-primary day turnout in 2016, when 889,207 Democratic voters cast ballots. That year, Hillary Clinton was still fighting off Sanders, her primary rival. And even if Democratic turnout is low, it won’t give Republicans a valid reason to gloat, Newman said. “I don’t think turnout in a presidential primary with neither campaign particularly active, and in a state that’s functionally already decided, and in the middle of a global pandemic is predictive,” he said, “of much.”","Florida is weird.

"The early signals from the coronavirus crisis point to a scale of damage unseen in the modern U.S. economy: the potential for millions of jobs lost in a single month, a historic and sudden plunge in economic activity across the nation and a pace of sharp market swings not seen since the Great Depression. As the coronavirus outbreak ravages a paralyzed nation, Wall Street suffered another brutal bloodbath on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average diving around 13 percent in its worst percentage loss since 1987’s “Black Monday” crash. A reading on business conditions in the New York area plunged a record 34.4 points to -21.5 in March, suggesting a recession is underway that could be sharp and deep as revenue quickly bleeds out of major industries from airlines to hotels, restaurants, bars and sports leagues. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, the broadest gauge of U.S. companies, fell 12 percent. It has shed $6 trillion in value since peaking in February, slamming retirement accounts for millions of Americans in ways that could have psychological ripples for many months to come. The last time the S&P had three days of similar wild swings was 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression. The S&P is now only around 300 points away from wiping out all its gains since Donald Trump won the White House in November 2016. President Trump himself, one of the grandest boasters of the strength and resilience of markets and the American economy, appeared to capitulate on Monday with a more somber tone reflecting the immense magnitude of the challenge facing the nation. “We have an invisible enemy,” he said, acknowledging that the virus could push the U.S. into recession. “This is a bad one. This is a very bad one.” Trump urged Americans not to gather in groups over 10 and to avoid bars, restaurants, food courts and other public spaces. The VIX, a gauge of fear and panic on Wall Street, hit 82.69 on Monday — bringing it to territory unseen since the worst of the financial crisis in 2008. Oil prices tanked 10 percent — after a severe plunge last week — as traders bet the virus will ignite a global recession that sharply reduces demand for fuel. The massive sell-offs have led to suggestions by market professionals that regulators may have to take dramatic steps seen during the Great Depression and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That could include shuttering Wall Street — perhaps for days — until more is known about the direction of the coronavirus spread in the United States and until Washington comes up with a massive, bipartisan policy response to shore up flagging industries and direct money straight into the pockets of American citizens losing work as they remain shuttered in their homes at the direction of the government officials. For now, Securities and Exchange Commissioner Jay Clayton pledged to keep markets open, despite the waves of panicked selling. “Markets should continue to function through times like this,” he told CNBC. Still, many traders expect that if the market plunges several more thousand points, and trips more circuit breakers that temporarily halt trading, the administration could be forced to simply shut Wall Street down. “With new measures being put in place by the hour, the federal government at some point will have to consider a modern version of the bank holiday imposed by the Roosevelt administration back in 1933,” RSM Chief Economist Joseph Brusuelas wrote in a client note. “That four-day holiday was put into place to restore confidence in the banking and financial system. Perhaps the governing authority should consider a 10-business day holiday until Congress can act.” Wall Street analysts are already assessing the damage done to the economy thus far: stark and likely to get far worse, very quickly. “Movie box-office revenues are down more than 60 percent in data through March 15 and more than 70 percent relative to the average of recent years,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a research note. “Broadway box office revenues were already down about 20 percent relative to trend in data through March 8, and are presumably set to be down essentially 100 percent after theaters closed last Thursday, a result we also expect to see for professional and college sports revenues.” Restaurant bookings were collapsing in many cities and may now plunge to zero. Streets are increasingly empty as citizens follow government warnings to slow the spread of the virus. The hope on the part of White House officials is not to avoid a sharp economic slowdown — they all know it is coming — but that the short-term pain from extreme measures will lead to a flattening in the curve of the virus spread. Then economic activity can be made up when the crisis ebbs. But that will require agreement on a massive package of aid for both individuals and corporations to stave off mass bankruptcies and waves of layoffs. The White House hopes for a V-shaped economic cycle this time: a recession in which growth plunges then sharply recovers as consumers emerge from their bunkers with jobs to go to and money to spend. Kevin Hassett, the former White House Council of Economic Advisers chairman who remains in contact with Trump and the White House, said in an interview that jobs reports for March and April could show horrific numbers that will force massive congressional action if it has not already occurred by then. He predicted losses of perhaps over 1 million jobs in coming reports and a spike in the jobless rate. “We really could see the worst jobs reports we’ve ever seen in our history.” Hassett said he did calculations over the weekend with conservative economist Larry Lindsey showing that the economy could contract by 5 percent in the second quarter, though a swift containment of the virus could lead to a bounce-back in the third quarter. (Goldman Sachs economists also predicted a drop of around 5 percent in economic growth in the second quarter.) And he noted that infighting between the House and Senate and uncertainty about the next stimulus package from the White House could make matters far worse. The White House is trying to settle on a package that would include a payroll tax suspension and emergency lending facilities, including from the Federal Reserve, and other measures for impacted businesses that would stop short of direct cash “bailouts,” a politically toxic word since the bank rescues of 2008 and 2009. William Lee, chief economist at the Milken Institute, suggested the United States is headed into what could be the first recession whose length and depth will be determined largely by how effectively Washington responds, both on the fiscal and public health fronts. “This will be first recession induced by public health policies, and the nature of those public health policies and their effectiveness accelerating the recovery from the virus. And that will determine the course of the depth of the recession.” Lee said he was certain the second quarter would show a contraction, but that multiple policies, most of which are currently under consideration, could prime the economy to bounce back. Those policies would include direct aid to corporations slammed by the virus, through loan forbearance and acceptance of late payments. He also suggested credit rating firms would have to take into account the impact of the virus when making ratings changes, including potentially crippling downgrades. On the consumer side, Lee said supplemental sick pay leave and extended benefits for laid-off workers would be critical along with payments to cover day care. “Our avenues for pushing this stuff out through negative income taxes for households can be easily done. The key thing as that as soon as people feel safe to go out, that they have money in their pockets and they go and spend it.” Lee said he did not believe in giving free money away to corporations, but that decisions would have to be made about which companies are simply mismanaged and which are suffering directly from the virus. “We have to be generous about getting money out. It’s really important to preserve the transport infrastructure. We can’t have airlines filing for bankruptcy.” Joel Prakken, chief U.S. economist and IHS Markit, said in a note to clients that the spread of Covid-19 to the U.S. ""is causing a sharp contraction in spending on activities that involve travel and congregating in public.” His firm now expects a recession to start in the second quarter, delivering a peak-to-trough decline in GDP of 2.3 percent, with the jobless rate rising to 6 percent by mid-2021. Goldman Sachs analysts increased their expectations for stimulus action out of Washington. Their base case is to see stimulus worth 1 to 2 percent of GDP in both 2020 and 2021, or roughly $400 billion to $800 billion worth. White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Monday the administration was pursuing at least $800 billion in relief for an economy hit by the crisis. Steve Moore, a conservative economist and outside adviser to the president, said he sent a plan to Kudlow for items to include in the next stimulus proposal expected to come out of the White House and Treasury by the end of the week. Moore authored the proposal along with publishing magnate Steve Forbes and supply-side economics guru Art Laffer, a close Kudlow ally. “They haven’t settled on any one thing at this point. But it’s on a fast-track. They want it by the end of the week,” Moore said. “We proposed a four-step plan and the best idea is to suspend the payroll tax for the rest of the year. That’s something that would help everyone. It’s clean and it doesn’t pick winners and losers.” Moore said his group suggested financing the payroll tax holiday by issuing 50- and 100-year Treasury bonds at 1 percent interest. They also suggested avoiding any direct cash bailouts to hard-hit industries like airlines or hotels. “Every business is materially affected by this. Who is going to make these decision about who gets aid and who doesn’t?” Moore said. The final piece of the plan would be for the Federal Reserve to open lending facilities for low-interest loans to any business that has collateral to avoid cash crunches that could force companies into fire sales of existing assets to raise cash to replace revenue lost to the crisis. “Trump listens to us. He seeks out our advice,” Moore said. “We are urging him not to do things that are bad policy that he would not do otherwise.” “When the virus is contained, the economy will bounce back. But how long that will take and much damage is done to supply chains and the number of bankruptcies — we just don’t know. Every day this lasts compounds the economic damage.”",How ugly could it get?

"The nation's biggest banks, which were at the epicenter of the 2008 financial crisis, are facing a new set of daunting challenges with markets in turmoil over the coronavirus pandemic. While the lenders will probably be in no need of a multibillion-dollar bailout as they were back then, they’re dealing with stress from all sides as they’re pressured to help shield consumers, businesses and other financial firms from a wave of economic pain that has already begun to hit. Business debt is at record-high levels. Many consumers will struggle to repay bank loans if they face even one missed paycheck. And though lawmakers and regulators reined in some of the riskiest behavior at banks after the crisis, a lot of those same activities are still happening in other less-regulated companies that are financially connected to the large lenders. That means the banks will be tested on how well they’ve prepared for a global shock to the economy that no one saw coming. “The banks are not the problem right now,” said Karen Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics. But “they can only be fortresses for so long.” For their part, the megabanks are trying to project strength. In a March 11 meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said the financial system is “in sound shape, and we are here to help.” Bankers argue that they rely much less on debt to fund their operations and have much more cash on hand than they did during the crisis to help them keep lending during a downturn. Citi, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and five other major banks said over the weekend that they'd stop buying back their own shares through June as they pledge to help struggling consumers and businesses. The largest banks have also successfully weathered the Federal Reserve’s so-called stress tests, which require them to show every year how they would manage risks under a hypothetical severe recession. The exercise was launched in 2009 in the depth of the crisis to help restore confidence in the banking system. But financial markets are already showing signs of strain, with stocks in recent weeks wiping out most of their huge gains since Trump's election and trading in U.S. government bond markets becoming irregular, a situation that prompted the Fed to inject piles of cash into funding markets. Troubles are also growing in the market for a type of short-term business debt known as commercial paper. One of the biggest risks that regulators like the Fed have been watching is the rise in loans to companies that are already highly indebted, as well as the volume of corporate bonds that are so risky that mutual funds may not be allowed to hold them. If a lot of companies start to default on their debt, it could blow back not only directly on banks, but also other lenders and investors that do business with them. “You’re going to have massive defaults as the economy turns down, and a massive amount of dumping of the worst debt as certain investment vehicles like mutual funds are getting out of it,” said Dennis Kelleher, who heads the financial regulation advocacy group Better Markets. “You put those two things together, and there is an enormous threat coming to all financial institutions, but particularly the biggest banks.” According to financial analytics firm Trepp, banks have diversified the sectors that they’re invested in, but have particular exposure to companies in real estate; about 10 percent of outstanding corporate loans at a surveyed group of large and medium-size banks were in that sector. Corporate debt could also grow. Companies like Boeing are reportedly drawing on existing lines of credit, while United Airlines is one of the coronavirus-hit businesses that has taken out a new secured loan to help weather decreased revenue. Lee Shaiman, executive director of the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, said bundles of loans to highly indebted companies, known as collateralized loan obligations, aren’t at much risk from the industries that are being hardest hit, like energy and travel. “You don’t want to be Pollyanna-ish,” he said. “We’re in for a rough couple of weeks at least, but it’s very clear why we’re here, as opposed to the financial crisis where there were a lot of reasons and a lot of excesses.” Those CLOs are more transparent and more conservatively structured than the mortgage-backed securities that helped lead to the 2008 blowup, he said. Meanwhile, a lot of payments won’t even be due for years. Still, financial firms are connected to each other in ways that aren’t always clear, which will lead to an intense focus on how large indebted companies are faring. “This is a tinder box that the current regulators have told us is not of concern” for the broader financial system, said Sarah Bloom Raskin, former deputy Treasury secretary and onetime Fed board member. “We will see the extent to which their confidence is warranted.” Raskin also said banks need to be preparing to defer payments from small businesses and people who might be late on mortgage or credit card payments, something their regulators last week encouraged them to do. Some banks have already announced rate reductions on loans for vulnerable borrowers. “These are contributors to how long and deep this downturn is going to be,” she said.",Big banks brace for coronavirus-related onslaught,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/big-banks-coronavirus-onslaught-132997,politico
"The Justice Department is abandoning plans for a looming criminal trial focused on claims of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. With jury selection set to begin in just over two weeks, prosecutors asked a federal judge to permanently dismiss the charges special counsel Robert Mueller brought two years ago against two Russian firms linked to a St. Petersburg businessman known as Putin's chef, Yevgeny Prigozhin. The move scuttles a trial that could have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump: a high-profile showcase of U.S. intelligence agencies' evidence that Russian trolls sought to stir up support for him in the 2016 presidential election while fighting against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee who oversaw the case, formally dismissed the charge against the two Russian firms Monday night. Prosecutors cited several reasons for the shift and were clearly defensive that Russia would portray the decision as proof that U.S. evidence of the alleged Russian tampering is weak. ""There is a substantial federal interest in defending American democratic institutions, exposing those who endeavor to criminally interfere with them, and holding them accountable, which is why this prosecution was properly commenced in the first place,"" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers and U.S. Attorney for Washington Timothy Shea wrote. ""In light of the defendant’s conduct, however, its ephemeral presence and immunity to just punishment, the risk of exposure of law enforcement’s tools and techniques, and the post-indictment change in the proof available at trial, the balance of equities has shifted. It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution,"" Demers and Shea added. They said the indictment would remain in place against Prigozhin and 12 other Russian nationals, as well as the company alleged to have coordinated the online rabble-rousing, the Internet Research Agency. Trump appeared to celebrate the dropping of the charges and the scuttling of the trial as more evidence of the flaws of Mueller's operation. Late Monday night, the president retweeted another user's comment about the developments: ""How embarrassing for Team Mueller."" A defense lawyer for the Russian company that may have surprised prosecutors by seeking a trial in the case, Eric Dubelier, said the prosecution suffered from ""fundamental problems"" from its outset. ""The purpose of this indictment was to make a political statement regarding the outcome of the 2016 election that was grossly overstated,"" said Dubelier, a partner with law firm Reed Smith.  ""In preparing for trial we had every intention to prevail given the problems with the government’s allegations. The government’s evidence was completely devoid of any information that could establish that the defendants knew what they were doing was in violation of highly complex U.S. laws and regulations. This was a make-believe charge to fit the facts solely for political purposes,"" he added. One reason prosecutors cited for their retreat was a recent “classification determination bearing on the evidence the government properly gathered during the investigation [which] limits the unclassified proof now available to the government at trial.” The public filing offered scant details, but suggested that someone in the U.S. intelligence apparatus had decided that disclosing some of the evidence against Concord would expose U.S. intelligence capabilities. Prosecutors asked to submit a separate, secret, classified filing to the court that explained those concerns in more detail. While prosecutors were not specific in their public filing, one disclosed at a recent court hearing that the Justice Department planned to introduce a mystery witness who they said would implicate Prigozhin in election interference outside Russia. It is unclear whether that person is an intelligence asset, defector or someone else.  Intelligence officials also may have concluded that revealing certain evidence against Concord could put at risk Russians who helped the U.S. conclude that the 2016 activities were directed by the Kremlin. One such Russian with Kremlin ties was housed by the CIA in the Washington suburbs until his identity became public last year.  The Justice Department also filed a criminal case last month that suggested the Russian government was seeking to closely monitor Russians cooperating with U.S. intelligence agencies.  From the outset, supporters of the Russian trolls' prosecution — and some critics of the effort — dubbed it a ""name and shame"" effort aimed more at seizing the public relations value of an indictment and less at the typical goal of bringing criminals to justice. No trial ever seemed likely unless one of the defendants stumbled into a place where they could be arrested. However, soon after the indictment was returned in February 2018, Prigozhin sought to call the American prosecutors' bluff without ever exposing himself to the risk of prison. One of his firms, Concord Management & Consulting, hired U.S. lawyers to fight the case. So, the U.S. found itself facing a trial without ever having a human defendant in the dock. That prospect has been relatively clear for nearly two years, but it took prosecutors until Monday — amid the national panic over coronavirus — to concede that going to the trouble of a trial against a company that has no known presence or funds in the U.S., simply wasn't worth it. ""The government has concluded that further proceedings as to Concord, a Russian company with no presence in the United States and no exposure to meaningful punishment in the event of a conviction, promotes neither the interests of justice nor the nation’s security,"" prosecutors wrote. One expert on classified information said Monday that the belated acknowledgment by the prosecution was jarring. ""It's a bit surprising that prosecutors would make this claim so late in the proceeding. It's something they ought to have realized (and may have) months ago or longer,"" said Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists. ""Prosecutors will want to do a postmortem to understand how they got themselves in this position, and how they can avoid similar missteps in the future."" Prosecutors said recent developments in the case contributed to their decision, including difficulties getting Concord to cooperate with court orders to turn over certain information. They faulted the company for submitting a declaration claiming full compliance that was attested to by Prigozhin, someone they described as ""incredible.""  Prigozhin is widely known as Putin's chef because he started out as a high-end restaurateur, developed close ties to the Russian president and built the food-focused business into an empire doing contracting around the world for the Russian military. Concord Management and a related catering company were charged in the criminal case with conspiracy against the U.S. for seeking to frustrate the operation of U.S. election, foreign-agent, and visa laws. Friedrich did not offer any comment on the government's about-face, but did agree to accept and seal the classified explanation prosecutors offered.",Justice Department drops plans for trial over Russian interference in 2016 U.S. election,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/russia-election-justice-department-132875,politico
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants the Army Corps of Engineers to build overflow hospitals. Bernie Sanders wants to call up the National Guard. Joe Biden says ""call out the military — now."" But the military isn't a cure-all, and there are significant legal and practical limits to what the armed forces can do during the coronavirus crisis. “The Department of Defense is ready, willing and able to support civilian authorities to the greatest extent possible at the direction of the president,” Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman told reporters Monday. “We just want to make sure that the conversation that we have is informed by the facts of what is possible and what is not and what those tradeoffs are.” Here is a rundown of the different ways the military could be used in the crisis, along with jobs that should be left to others. Current and former officials have proposed tasking the Pentagon with growing the capacity of the health care system to treat the sickest patients, specifically by deploying field hospitals and constructing care facilities. On Sunday, Biden said the armed forces ""have the capacity to provide this surge help that hospitals need and that is needed across the nation. They have done it. They did it in the Ebola crisis.” But Defense Department officials stressed that while the military does have some experience deploying what they call “tent hospitals,” these facilities are limited in size and capability. Most are small community hospitals tailored for the military’s disproportionately young, healthy community and their families, said Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs, the Joint Staff surgeon. The field hospitals, while they range in size from 25 beds to “much larger,” are designed to support trauma patients and combat casualties, he told reporters Monday. “What we are trying to be very careful about is not over promising,” Friedrichs said. “There are not thousand-bed medical centers all over the U.S.; they are for the most part small community hospitals.” Retired Vice Adm. Matthew Nathan, the former surgeon general of the Navy, said there are some things the military could do to ease the medical burden, but agreed it could only do so much. ""What we are really good at is ramping up trauma capability in a hurry,"" he said in an interview. ""If we just need beds, we are good at that, too."" But he pointed out that even in the worst circumstances such as widespread battle injuries, the military commonly deals with patients who are otherwise healthy and don't suffer from underlying conditions that make them more susceptible to infectious disease such as the coronavirus. ""As far as setting up ICUs to take care of the roughly 6 to 7 percent of patients who will need intensive care and ventilators long term, we don't prepare for that,"" Nathan said. But he stressed that there are other strategies to ""expand the surge of our hospitals."" Instead of treating infected patients, the military could take care of limited numbers of others ""who just need regular hospital care because they are not severe"" in order to free up beds and staff. The Navy’s two medical ships, the USNS Mercy and the USNS Comfort, can handle large-scale medical emergencies. Both contain 12 fully-equipped operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, digital radiological services, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, an optometry lab, a CAT-scan and other capabilities, according to the Navy. But that only helps in areas near the water. ""If for example a community has a large outbreak and there's a need for emergency room support or trauma support, a hospital ship is perfectly designed to do that,” Friedrichs said. ""It’s hard to get the hospital ship to St. Louis, but along the coasts it is an option to use."" Another problem is that these vessels are not conducive to containing infectious disease outbreaks. “You have litters that are stacked toward the ceiling with individuals, you have open bay rooms — they are intended for trauma not for infectious disease environment,” Hoffman said, adding that “there are some beds for that, but at much smaller numbers.” Teams of Army researchers are helping to develop a vaccine and other countermeasures for the virus at installations around the country, including Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, both in Maryland. The teams have identified a potential vaccine that targets what doctors called the “spoke” or “spike protein” that helps the virus attach and enter human cells, Dr. Kayvon Modjarrad, director of emerging infectious diseases at Walter Reed, told reporters at the Pentagon last week. The Army is testing the vaccine candidate on mice and will next move to testing on larger animals and humans to determine whether it is safe. But the earliest the vaccine would be available to the general population is 12 to 18 months, Modjarrad said. More long term, Nathan also says the military has a number of research centers around the world that specialize in disease surveillance ""before they can get a toehold on our troops,” including in Egypt, Peru and Singapore. Perhaps the most famous military doctor, Walter Reed, made scientific breakthroughs in treating communicable diseases in the tropics. ""Why was Major Walter Reed down there? Soldiers were dying of yellow fever."" The National Guard is playing the largest role when it comes to the military's response. As of Monday, some 650 troops have been called up in 15 states to help operate drive-through virus testing facilities, staff emergency operations centers, clean public spaces and transport health care personnel. The biggest contingent to be activated so far is in New York, where as of Monday 516 part-time soldiers and airmen have been called up. In Colorado, 145 National Guardsmen were assisting with drive-up Covid-19 testing centers and helping to plan future screening missions, according to the National Guard Bureau in Washington. Smaller continents, such as eight troops in West Virginia specializing in biological defense, have been activated to train civilian first responders on how to mitigate the exposure to the virus of paramedics and fire and rescue personnel. ""Bottom line, our force must remain flexible, innovative and ready to help America mitigate the impacts of this virus,"" Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said in a statement Monday. But so far, Guardsmen have not yet been “federalized,” or called up on a national scale. That could mean siphoning them away from their civilian jobs where they may already be helping their communities to counter the virus, said Friedrichs. Nor have separate military reservists been called up. “If we mobilize the Guard and Reserve medical personnel from their civilian jobs, they are no longer in their civilian jobs and that directly impacts the community where they work — that’s the tradeoff,” he said. The military does have some options to more efficiently deploy Guard and Reserve personnel, said Hoffman, pointing out the commander of U.S. forces in Korea, one of the global epicenters of the virus, has enlisted Guard and Reserve doctors. Yet there are only so many trained medical professionals in the military to go around. The hospital ships, for example, are currently manned by merchant mariners. The medical personnel to staff them would have to come from elsewhere, Hoffman said. The White House has denied rumors that President Donald Trump is considering a national curfew to limit social interaction until the outbreak is under control. If such a decision were made, however, any military role would likely be limited. And it would fall to the National Guard. The active-duty military is barred from conducting domestic law enforcement under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. The only circumstance in which the active-duty could be called upon to provide security would be under the Insurrection Act to suppress a revolt (a Marine and Army division responded to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, for example). As of Monday, the active-duty military has been asked only to make available a trio of military bases to quarantine cruise ship passengers exposed to the coronavirus. And a spokesperson said no military personnel are involved. “We have a lot of different capacities and we don’t speculate on how or if we'd use it,"" said Stacey Knott, a spokesperson for U.S. Northern Command in Colorado, which is tasked with homeland defense and to support civil authorities in responding to natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes. The National Guard Bureau says it is not planning to play any law enforcement role at this time. ""We have the capability to do something like that but we are not burning calories on something that may or may not be happening,"" said Army Master Sgt. Michael Houk, a Guard spokesperson. ""At this point it looks like it is not happening. We are addressing existing needs."" But if a national curfew is necessary to enforce, the best way to do it is to empower individual states to carry it out. That would fall to traditional law enforcement agencies, not troops, said retired Army Lt. Gen. Steven Blum, former chief of the National Guard Bureau and deputy commander of U.S. Northern Command. ""It depends on how the president sets up the curfew,"" Blum said in an interview. ""Does he set it up where the governors are responsible so they can use the state police to enforce? If all the state governors agree to it and support it then it would be pretty easy. ""If I were advising the president,"" he added, ""I would advise them not to federalize the response but to coordinate the response and allow the states to tailor the response within their guidelines.""",Why you can't just 'call out the military' to fix the coronavirus crisis,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/military-coronavirus-defense-132801,politico
"Seven days before Donald Trump took office, his aides faced a major test: the rapid, global spread of a dangerous virus in cities like London and Seoul, one serious enough that some countries were imposing travel bans.  In a sober briefing, Trump’s incoming team learned that the disease was an emerging pandemic — a strain of novel influenza known as H9N2 — and that health systems were crashing in Asia, overwhelmed by the demand. “Health officials warn that this could become the worst influenza pandemic since 1918,” Trump’s aides were told. Soon, they heard cases were popping up in California and Texas. The briefing was intended to hammer home a new, terrifying reality facing the Trump administration, and the incoming president’s responsibility to protect Americans amid a crisis. But unlike the coronavirus pandemic currently ravaging the globe, this 2017 crisis didn’t really happen — it was among a handful of scenarios presented to Trump’s top aides as part of a legally required transition exercise with members of the outgoing administration of Barack Obama.  And in the words of several attendees, the atmosphere was “weird” at best, chilly at worst. POLITICO obtained documents from the meeting and spoke with more than a dozen attendees to help provide the most detailed reconstruction of the closed-door session yet. It was perhaps the most concrete and visible transition exercise that dealt with the possibility of pandemics, and top officials from both sides — whether they wanted to be there or not — were forced to confront a whole-of-government response to a crisis. The Trump team was told it could face specific challenges, such as shortages of ventilators, anti-viral drugs and other medical essentials, and that having a coordinated, unified national response was “paramount” — warnings that seem eerily prescient given the ongoing coronavirus crisis.  But roughly two-thirds of the Trump representatives in that room are no longer serving in the administration. That extraordinary turnover in the months and years that followed is likely one reason his administration has struggled to handle the very real pandemic it faces now, former Obama administration officials said. “The advantage we had under Obama was that during the first four years we had the same White House staff, the same Cabinet,” said former deputy labor secretary Chris Lu, who attended the gathering. “Just having the continuity makes all the difference in the world.” Sean Spicer, Trump’s first White House press secretary, was among those who participated in the meeting. He said he understood the reasons such exercises could be useful, but described the encounter as a massive transfer of information that ultimately felt very theoretical. In real life, things are never as simple as what’s presented in a table-top exercise, he said. “There’s no briefing that can prepare you for a worldwide pandemic,” added Spicer, who left the administration in mid-2017. The outgoing Obama aides and incoming Trump aides gathered for roughly three hours on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 13, 2017, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House. At least 30 representatives of Trump’s team — many of them soon-to-be Cabinet members — were present, each sitting next to their closest Obama administration counterpart. Incoming Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to keep dozing off. Incoming Energy Secretary Rick Perry was getting along famously with Ernest Moniz, the man he was replacing, several fellow participants said.  But it was clear some on the Trump team had barely, if ever, spoken with the people they were replacing. News had broken that same day about national security adviser Michael Flynn’s unusual contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, so his presence in the meeting added to the surrealness. Some members of both groups kept going in and out of the room, but most paid quiet attention to the presentations, which were led by top Obama aides. Obama aides, in op-eds and essays ripping the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus, officially called COVID-19, have pointed to the Jan. 13, 2017, session as a key example of their effort to press the importance of pandemic preparedness to their successors. In a Friday op-ed, Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, blasted Trump for comments such as “you can never really think” that a pandemic like the coronavirus “is going to happen.” She mentioned the 2017 session as one of many instances of the Obama administration’s efforts to help its successor be ready for such a challenge. She also slammed the Trump team for dismantling the National Security Council section that would play a lead role in organizing the U.S. response to a global pandemic. “Rather than heed the warnings, embrace the planning and preserve the structures and budgets that had been bequeathed to him, the president ignored the risk of a pandemic,” Rice wrote. (Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton, who oversaw the dissolution of the NSC’s global health security and biodefense section, has defended it as necessary streamlining, countering that global health “remained a top NSC priority.” Trump, when recently asked about the reshuffling, called the question “nasty” and said, “I don’t know anything about it.”) Lisa Monaco, Obama’s homeland security adviser, explained the thinking behind the January 2017 session in a recent essay for Foreign Affairs. “Although the exercise was required, the specific scenarios we chose were not,” she wrote. “We included a pandemic scenario because I believed then, and I have warned since, that emerging infectious disease was likely to pose one of the gravest risks for the new administration.” None of the sources argued that one meeting three years ago could have dramatically altered events today. But Obama aides say the Trump administration’s fumbling of the coronavirus outbreak is partly rooted in how unprepared — and in some cases unwilling — it was to engage in transition exercises at all in late 2016 and early 2017. David Shulkin, who was an Obama appointee at the time but had been nominated to be Veterans Affairs secretary in the Trump administration, said in an interview that with the exception of this exercise, which he didn’t recall well, he noticed that in his agency, there had been “little coordination” and “very little interest in working with the Obama appointees.”  “They had said we don’t really have a lot of need to talk to the Obama appointees,” he said. That botched handoff sparked weeks of confusion, all the way up to Inauguration Day. “There was a frenzy before the transition where I was asked to consider staying because the [preparedness] mission was so important,” said Nicole Lurie, who served as Obama’s Health and Human Services assistant secretary for preparedness and response, where she worked on crises like the Ebola virus outbreak and attended the pandemic exercise. “Then through the HHS secretary’s office, the next day, I heard they changed their mind.” The Trump campaign, like the rest of America, was shocked to win the November 2016 election. Soon afterward, Trump cast aside his team’s transition prep work that had happened already and started over; some of his aides described tossing carefully collected binders full of possible personnel picks into trash bins. It was days, sometimes weeks, before his nominees and their aides showed up to meet the people they were replacing — if they did so at all — or to engage in transition meetings. Obama aides said they left detailed memos for their successors, but that quite often it appeared those memos were never read. Many on the Obama side were genuinely surprised that so many actually showed up for the Jan. 13, 2017, exercise, and there were expectations that some would skip it. On the Obama side, several agencies were represented by their second-in-command at the meeting for reasons including a belief that Trump’s principals wouldn’t show. The gathering was held to satisfy a requirement in a 2016 law that updated the procedures around presidential transitions to require, among other things, that the outgoing administration “prepare and host interagency emergency preparedness and response exercises.” Obama also mentioned it in a 2016 executive order laying out his transition goals. The 2016 law came about at the urging of the Partnership for Public Service, a good-government organization that helps administrations and candidates with the transition process. The emergency preparedness provisions were inspired by how George W. Bush handled his transition to Obama; that process, regarded as the gold standard for transition planning, included joint exercises on how to react to improvised explosive devices in cities. Bush had insisted on a detailed and highly coordinated transition planning in part because he felt scarred by the rushed transition he’d experienced from the Bill Clinton administration, not to mention having to deal with the Sept. 11 attacks during his first year. “The idea was hatched after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina precisely to prepare for situations like today,” said David Marchick, director of the Partnership for Public Service’s Center for Presidential Transition.  The Obama and Trump teams met in the afternoon, sitting around tables arranged in a rectangle. Participants were given a binder of unclassified materials titled “Presidential Transition Exercise Series,” the contents of which were obtained by POLITICO. The purpose of the exercise, the documents state, was to “familiarize” the incoming team with “domestic incident management policy and practices and continuity of government programs” in case it faced a major crisis. One key goal was to explain to participants the various legal authorities they had to pursue a response, and which agencies had which capabilities and responsibilities. The references provided included detailed explanations of numerous laws and regulations that might affect their work, such as the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  Aside from the H9N2 pandemic exercise, the participants discussed the case study of how the Obama administration handled Hurricane Sandy in 2012. One section covered a potential cyber incident. Another went through how to respond to a domestic terrorism incident, in this case one carried out by a group of U.S. citizens who placed bombs in nearby spots during a major sporting event in a U.S. city. The terror squad not only detonates the bombs, it also engages in a mass shooting and takes a dozen hostages. Using the materials, Monaco led the discussion. Her incoming counterpart, Tom Bossert, acted as a “semi co-chair,” attendees said. Ross, the then 79-year-old incoming Commerce secretary, was spotted with his eyes closed on more than one occasion. Elaine Chao, tapped to run the Department of Transportation, paid close attention. Several attendees noted the tense body language between Rice and Flynn, who lasted only a few weeks as Trump’s national security adviser and was ousted amid questions over his dealings with Russian officials. And then there was the Energy Department duo: Perry, the incoming secretary who previously served as the governor of Texas, and Moniz, the outgoing secretary and famed physicist. The pair seemed to get along fabulously, which stood out to other attendees given the overall distrust between the two teams and the fact that Perry had once proposed getting rid of the Energy Department altogether. It was a “semi-bizarro lovefest” between the two, a fellow participant said. “They were ready to go make a buddy movie.”  Perry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement, Moniz, who now leads the Energy Futures Initiative, said, “It is correct that [Perry] and I offered relevant perspectives from a governor’s and Cabinet secretary’s seat, respectively. As governor of Texas for a long time, Perry had been through many episodes needing crisis management.” For the most part, however, the Trump team was in receive mode.  Partly, that was not a surprise: Many of Trump’s personnel choices had little or no government experience, and the Obama aides were presenting massive troves of information to them about how a raft of agencies had to work together to respond to various crises. Multiple current and former Trump officials reached by POLITICO said they did not recall much about the briefing. But some Obama aides who attended said they were left with the impression that many of the Trump aides showed up to simply check off a box more than to learn. The impression was boosted in part because the transition overall was going so poorly. Several Trump nominees had barely even spoken to their Obama counterparts.  The State Department representative at the meeting, for instance, was Tom Shannon, a veteran career foreign service officer serving as undersecretary of State for political affairs. Shannon attended instead of Secretary of State John Kerry in part because he would be staying on under Trump and was essentially the “transition designee.” But that Jan. 13, 2017, session was the first time he’d seen the incoming secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in person since Trump picked him for the job a month earlier. (Before the inauguration, Kerry and Tillerson spoke once, by phone, for a few minutes, people familiar with the situation said.) “The problem is that they came in very arrogant and convinced that they knew more than the outgoing administration — full swagger,” one former Obama administration official who attended said.  “There were people who were there who said, ‘This is really stupid and why do we need to be here,’” added another senior Obama administration official who attended, alleging that Ross and incoming Education Secretary Betsy DeVos were especially dismissive in conversations on the sidelines of the session. “But some Trump people, like Tom Bossert, were trying to take it seriously.” Asked for comment, Liz Hill, a spokesperson for DeVos, told POLITICO: “This is nothing more than a hit piece with no basis in reality. This department, under the secretary’s leadership, has taken swift action to support students, parents, and education leaders during this pandemic and will continue to do so. This former Obama official’s wild claims don’t comport with reality.” A Commerce Department spokesperson denied that Ross had dozed off. ""Secretary Ross found the meeting quite interesting and informative, taking many notes during the exercise,"" the spokesperson said. ""He continues to rely upon that knowledge and experience as he assists the president in confronting the crisis at hand."" Another participant noted that such exercises are primarily aimed at helping an incoming administration make it through the first several months of its tenure — “the idea being, of course, that during the transition period we’re uniquely vulnerable.”  Presumably, by the third or fourth year in power, the administration would have its own processes and muscle memory, the participant said. Asked whether information about the pandemic exercise reached the president-elect, a former senior Trump administration official who attended the meeting couldn’t say for sure but noted that it wasn’t “the kind of thing that really interested the president very much.”  “He was never interested in things that might happen. He’s totally focused on the stock market, the economy and always bashing his predecessor and giving him no credit,” the person said. “The possibility things were things he didn’t spend much time on or show much interest in. “Even though we would put time on the schedule for things like that, if they happened at all, they would be very, very brief,” the former official continued. “To get the president to be focused on something like this would be quite hard.”  Anything associated with Obama or his administration was also a no-go zone for Trump aides. If you brought them up, “that would be an immediate rejection, like, ‘Why are they even here? Why the fuck did you ask them?’” Ben Lefebvre contributed to this report.","Before Trump’s inauguration, a warning: ‘The worst influenza pandemic since 1918'",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-inauguration-warning-scenario-pandemic-132797,politico
"At Sunday night’s debate, Bernie Sanders scoffed at Joe Biden’s nearly $2 trillion — with a “t” — plan to combat climate change. “What Joe is saying is nowhere near enough,” Sanders said, dismissing Biden as an incrementalist. Republicans could barely contain their glee. To them, Biden’s pronouncements on a range of issues — from energy to immigration to health care — provided a trove of on-camera material to paint him as a radical in moderate’s clothing in the general election. Though Biden drew praise for a strong debate performance, his commitments underscored the line he’s trying to straddle between pragmatism and progressivism as he works to unite the party as the likely Democratic nominee. Republicans think his positioning will be particularly harmful in the Rust Belt states that decided the 2016 election, and where Biden is seen as a particular threat to Trump. “He effectively called for open borders — no deportations — and has already raised his hand for taxpayer-funded health care for illegals,” Scott Jennings, a former political aide in the George W. Bush White House, said of Biden’s leftward drift. “So, at the same time he’s called for a ban on fracking, he’s opening up America to a flood of illegal immigration. I’m sure this will fly in Pennsylvania and the rest of the upper Midwest. This issue — not to mention the tax increases to pay for abortions — will hurt badly in rural areas and in the big Senate races.” A Trump campaign aide told POLITICO on Monday that Biden had “openly declared war” on traditional energy sources, effectively pledging “a death sentence for the oil and natural gas industries.” Biden called for an end to new fracking (his staff later clarified he only meant on federal land). He said he’d endeavor to take millions of cars off the road, convert gas-powered fleets to clean-burning and end drilling on federal lands. He’d haul the world’s 100 biggest polluters before the U.S. in his first 100 days and make them pay an economic price. He’d convene the hemisphere to provide tens of billions for Brazil to stop burning the Amazon.  And that was on the environment alone. From immigration to social issues to health care, Republicans insist Biden is harming himself in battleground states where his appeal to centrist Democrats has long been viewed as an unmitigated asset. In a statement following the debate, Trump’s campaign even tried to yoke Biden to Sanders on health care, arguing that both offer “a complete government takeover” of the system. The warning shots at Biden come as Trump is message-testing ways to drive up excitement among his restive base while struggling with the enormous responsibilities of managing the coronavirus pandemic. Biden aides and allies view charges that he’s making himself vulnerable to Trump as fanciful. A Biden campaign official rejected the thinking outright, saying Trump will have to defend his record of supporting efforts in the courts to strip essential health coverage from millions. The Biden aide pointed to Trump’s caging of immigrant children and demonization of immigrants as antithetical to America’s values and his ignorance of the climate emergency as costing the U.S. when it should be pursuing green jobs. “These guys are going to have a tough time turning Joe Biden into an extremist liberal in this environment. In that context, Sanders served as a great foil for Biden,” said Tim Miller, a former adviser to Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, who voted for Biden in California’s March 3 primary. “Biden spent 30 minutes waving off Sanders’ claims that a trillion-dollar climate change plan is not enough — this is how you make a bold agenda look pretty centrist.” Trump’s campaign has signaled in recent days that it will try numerous approaches to confronting Biden — from questioning his mental acuity to focusing on what they view as his out-of-step liberalism. Dan Pfeiffer, the former Barack Obama adviser, dismissed the Republican strategy as reeking of desperation for a Trump campaign that had been planning to run against Sanders. The Vermont senator had appeared ascendant leading into Super Tuesday. “Trump already has the voters driven primarily by immigration,” Pfeiffer said, “so it’s about base maintenance as opposed to growing his vote share to a number sufficient to win.” “Several strategies,” he added, “is the same as no strategy.” For months, Biden has unveiled far-reaching plans that would make him a more progressive nominee than Hillary Clinton or his 2008 running mate, former President Barack Obama. Yet Biden has continued with his move left on past statements and policies relating to immigration, abortion, criminal justice and entitlement programs like Social Security. Now, poised to wrap up the nomination, he has grasped for even more olive branches as part of a broader effort to unify Democrats. Biden, who leads Trump in several battleground polls, has endorsed former rival Elizabeth Warren’s sweeping bankruptcy plan to strike through portions of a law that they once fought over. Ahead of Sunday’s debate, he gave his blessing to a Sanders-inspired plan to make college tuition free for students whose families earn less than $125,000 annually. The debate offered him yet another chance to appeal to progressives. Biden pledged that under his administration only felons would be deported in his first 100 days, saying he’d focus on uniting families. “It’s about making sure that we can both be a nation of immigrants as well as a nation that is decent, he said. Biden also said undocumented immigrants arrested by local police should not be turned over to federal immigration authorities, after opposing sanctuary cities as a presidential candidate in 2007. He again distanced himself from voting for the Hyde Amendment, which banned federal funding for the majority of abortions. Biden also restated his policy on public lands and waters, including prohibiting permitting of oil and gas drilling. Trump’s campaign has focused intently on Biden’s environmental and immigration remarks. “Fossil fuel industries employ 10 million Americans and he would yank the jobs out from under all of them. His plan would also drive heating and cooling bills through the roof,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump’s reelection campaign. Murtaugh said Biden’s plan to halt deportations would leave enormous numbers of other criminals in the U.S. who continue to pose a threat to public safety. And Biden’s position on locals not cooperating with federal immigration officials would “effectively turn the entire United States into a sanctuary country and tell the world that our borders are open,” he said. In a Monday email, America Rising, the Republican opposition outfit, cited a Wall Street Journal infographic that tallied up Biden’s agenda as costing more than twice as much as Clinton’s, with his proposed taxes totaling three times as much as the Democratic nominee four years ago. The message: Biden and Sanders “will be virtually indistinguishable.” “As we have said over and over, the eventual Democrat candidate will have to adopt the agenda of the extreme left in order to become the nominee in the first place, and Joe Biden proved that last night,” Murtaugh added.","Trump licks his chops as Biden veers left on sanctuary cities, fracking",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/biden-conservatives-trump-132214,politico
"A potential shortage of cotton swabs and other basic supplies needed for coronavirus testing is emerging as a new threat to the Trump administration’s plans to roll out high-volume testing to 2,000 sites across the country by the end of the week. President Donald Trump and other top administration officials have repeatedly said that millions of Americans could be tested in the coming weeks. But behind the scenes, some officials are warning the nation’s commercial labs that kinks in the supply chain for basic lab materials are the latest obstacle to broader testing. During a Sunday night conference call, HHS Assistant Secretary of Health Brett Giroir warned more than 300 representatives of commercial laboratories, hospitals and state health departments that the Trump administration anticipates supply “speed bumps” as testing expands, a person on the call told POLITICO. The materials in question include swabs that medical workers use to collect samples of patients’ phlegm and saliva for testing, and disposable plastic tips for the pipettes that lab technicians use to transfer liquids. Testing labs say they’re also concerned about the availability of personal protective equipment for their staff. Fears about securing these basic supplies are the latest concern for public health officials as they scramble to institute the widespread testing that is desperately needed to track the spread of the coronavirus and limit the growing U.S. outbreak. The pace of U.S. testing has been slowed by shortages of critical materials used to prep patient samples for analysis and problems with an early test developed by the CDC. Now, the contrast between the administration’s public and private messaging on its plan to expand testing is rankling U.S. labs. The Trump administration announced Friday that it is creating a national network of 2,000 high-volume testing sites, with each processing 2,000 to 4,000 samples a day by the end of this week. To help reach that expanded testing goal, the Food and Drug Administration said Sunday that public health labs no longer have to send coronavirus samples to the CDC to be confirmed. That should reduce the wait for test results and the number of tests conducted for each patient, said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Twitter. The FDA also recently approved the use of more types of cotton swabs and of high-volume testing systems manufactured by Roche and Thermo Fisher. About 122 of of the Roche testing machines are installed at U.S. labs, the investment bank SVB Leerink said Monday, while Thermo Fisher said it is shipping its equipment to about 200 labs. And companies such as Qiagen, Quidel, Hologic and Cepheid are developing their own high-volume testing systems. But the commercial labs that are now performing the bulk of the country’s coronavirus tests say they need help from the government to secure sufficient numbers of swabs and other low-tech equipment. “We need the continued commitment from HHS and the administration to work with us to maintain the necessary volume of supplies,” Tom Sparkman, senior vice president of government affairs and policy at the American Clinical Laboratory Association, told POLITICO. State officials have echoed those concerns. “I’m worried now about access to an adequate number of swabs, not just the RNA extraction kits” used to prepare samples for analysis, said California Gov. Gavin Newsom at a press conference on Sunday. Carmela Coyle, president and CEO of the California Hospital Association, expressed anxiety over the United States’ testing failures and the looming shortages of equipment to test patients and protect lab technicians and other health care workers. “In order to take the specimen, it requires full personal protective equipment,” she said. “We are already short.” Victoria Colliver and Angela Hart contributed to this report.",Latest coronavirus testing glitch: Not enough cotton swabs,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/coronavirus-testing-glitch-cotton-swabs-132692,politico
"The Senate on Monday unanimously adopted a short-term extension of key federal surveillance programs that expired on Sunday night — a move that allows the chamber to more rapidly consider legislation addressing the economic impacts of the global coronavirus pandemic.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scrapped an initial procedural vote Monday night on a House-passed bill that would reauthorize now-expired provisions of the 2015 USA Freedom Act and alter the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  Instead, McConnell and his leadership team worked out a deal with civil libertarian hard-liners who oppose that House bill, including Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), on a 77-day extension of the surveillance powers. As part of the agreement, Lee and Paul also secured a package of amendment votes on the House bill, which has the backing of Attorney General William Barr and leaders from both parties in the House.  “We shouldn’t have to wait until the moment when we’re on the eve of the expiration of some important legislation and where we have to wait for the president of the United States to weigh in and lean in,” Lee said. “From time to time, laws require revision and review and reform. That always necessarily requires amendments.”  Senators were under intense pressure to clear the legislative docket to allow for the chamber to quickly take up a bill intended to blunt the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. The House is expected to send a final version to the Senate as early as Monday night.  Lee and Paul, for their part, vehemently oppose the House’s FISA bill, contending that it does not go far enough to reform law enforcement’s surveillance authority. But they said they would be willing to back a temporary extension of the provisions if Senate GOP leaders allow amendment votes on the House bill, which passed in the lower chamber last week with a bipartisan majority.  “They can do it the easy way or the hard way. The easy way is that they allow debate,” Paul told reporters.  Other senators indicated earlier Monday that they would support a temporary extension of the FISA powers out of concern that a prolonged lapse would hinder the U.S. intelligence community’s work.  “If the alternative is staying dark, I’ll take an extension,” Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) told reporters. McConnell did not address the negotiations on Monday afternoon, only saying the House bill was the best path forward.  “It reauthorizes the tools, which our national security requires, while also imposing a number of new reforms, which basic accountability demands,” McConnell said.  “The Senate should not wait to act,” McConnell added. “I sincerely hope that even our colleagues who may wish to vote against the House bill will not make us prolong this brief lapse in authorities and that we will be able to get these tools back online this week.”  Last week, Lee attempted numerous times to secure unanimous consent for a short-term extension, with an agreement to vote on four amendments to the House-passed bill at a later date. But Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) objected to Lee’s requests, saying it was unnecessary to drag out a debate over the FISA provisions.  Lee also spoke with President Donald Trump earlier that day and said the president told him he did not support the House bill. However, House Republicans indicated late last week that Trump does, in fact, support the legislation.  Three key FISA provisions lapsed on Sunday night after the Senate failed to reauthorize them before the deadline. The House bill addressed bipartisan concerns about possible overreach by the surveillance courts and ended an already deactivated National Security Agency program that allowed the organization to obtain, with judicial approval, Americans’ phone records in terror investigations.  The legislation strengthened privacy statutes and placed new restrictions on the FISA courts — inspired in part by Trump’s frequent complaints about his former campaign adviser, Carter Page, who was wiretapped as part of the U.S. government’s initial investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

"The House is unlikely to return from recess next week as scheduled, with Democratic leaders expected to keep the chamber dark until the next coronavirus stimulus package is ready for a vote, according to multiple Democrats.  Speaking on a conference call with the caucus Monday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told Democrats not to plan to return March 23 as scheduled and to stay tuned for more updates on Thursday. The announcement comes as congressional leaders face dueling missions: how to stave off economic disaster, while simultaneously protecting the hundreds of lawmakers — many of whom are older — from catching and spreading the coronavirus.   Several aides cautioned the chamber could resume legislative action as soon as the next day — March 24 — if the House was ready to vote on a third tranche of recovery money. Congressional leaders are in early negotiations over a massive legislative package they hope will heed off a potential economic collapse as industries, including airlines, hotels and restaurants, shutter to help prevent the spread of the virus.  U.S. airlines are seeking nearly $60 billion in grants and loans, according to a memo distributed on Monday, warning that Congress must act urgently to help several carriers avoid a “potential valley of death” going into the summer months. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, told Democrats he expects the impact on the industry to be “way worse than 9/11,” adding that some airlines are in “free fall,” according to sources on the call Monday.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) instructed Democrats to send ideas about what they’d like to see in the legislation to her office as House and Senate negotiators begin working in earnest on the next bill.  The House left town early Saturday morning after clearing a multibillion dollar stimulus package — its second bill aimed at stemming the outbreak — though it’s currently stalled in the Senate as negotiators hammer out a slew of technical tweaks.  Even so, Democrats and Republicans have been quick to focus their attention on the third legislative response to the outbreak — a measure that is expected to be the biggest so far, with members already comparing its size and scope with the bailouts approved amid the 2008 financial collapse.  Congressional leaders, as well as rank-and-file members of both parties, have already begun floating dramatic plans, such as cash handouts similar to the idea of universal basic income, popularized in the 2020 race by presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Several Democrats asked questions on the call about the possibility of a universal basic income policy — which Pelosi herself had initially been skeptical of, when it was floated at a recent Democratic meeting, though support has been gradually ticking up on both sides.  Pelosi told members on Monday that the priority was to keep people healthy and put money in people’s pockets, specifically mentioning refundable tax credits or some other mechanism, according to people familiar with the call. Top Democrats also discussed the possibility of expanding Medicaid, creating additional price-gouging protections and shoring up local transit and Amtrak.   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday pitched a massive $750 billion proposal that includes direct cash payments as well as substantial support for small businesses and hospitals.   House leaders are also working to balance efforts to prop up the economy with anxiety among their own members, who waited around the Capitol for days while Pelosi negotiated a package of coronavirus response measures with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Members privately worried that they were being forced into packed meetings and hallways crowded with reporters and staff, despite increasingly pitched warnings from experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid those precise situations.  The CDC has now recommended that all gatherings of more than 50 people be canceled for the next eight weeks, complicating plans for the 435-member House and its thousands of staffers. Many Capitol Hill offices have already implemented teleworking strategies for aides, and some lawmakers have either self-quarantined or gotten tested for coronavirus after brushes with people who later tested positive. So far, no member of Congress has reported testing positive for the illness.  House leaders revealed Monday that they would be taking steps to prevent too many members from being on the floor even during votes, the rare occasion when most lawmakers congregate at the same time. Leadership offices in both parties have discussed ideas such as keeping votes open longer, to limit physical contact among members ""[P]lans are being developed to coordinate votes in order to limit the number of Members voting on the Floor at any one time,"" Hoyer's office wrote in a schedule update. Pelosi told lawmakers they may vote according to state or some other procedure when they do come back to limit the number of lawmakers being on the floor at the same time.  On Sunday, Pelosi wrote a letter to House members responding to their growing concerns and encouraging new steps to promote “social distancing” — measures to prevent close contact between people in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus. “This may entail more than half of your Washington staff teleworking from home,” Pelosi wrote. “As this public health emergency develops, the House will continue to take strong, strategic and science-based action to keep the American people safe and ensure the continuity of Congressional operations.”",House eyes extended recess as coronavirus spreads,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/house-coronavirus-recess-132370,politico
"The White House aims to deploy at least $800 billion in aid in the coming weeks to prop up the U.S. economy, as retailers, restaurants, sporting events and other businesses shut down and Americans slow their spending while staying home to guard against the coronavirus pandemic. Among the administration’s targets this week: providing relief in the form of tax deferments, loans or even direct payments to airlines, the hospitality industry and small-to-medium businesses crippled by plunging demand. Officials know they need to release the contours of their plan quickly — potentially as soon as Tuesday — as turmoil accelerates in financial markets, said a person familiar with the White House’s plans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow have specifically cited aid for U.S. airlines, as travelers cancel trips or avoid new bookings and public health experts advise older Americans to avoid flying entirely. “We don’t see the airlines failing, but if they get into a cash crunch, we’re going to try to help them,” Kudlow told reporters Monday at the White House. He said the airlines had been in touch seeking aid, “lots of them,” and that “we’re in touch about their balance sheets and their cash flow.” Hotel CEOs are planning to visit the White House on Tuesday to meet with Vice President Mike Pence, as the hospitality industry also struggles from a serious downturn. The Treasury Department and National Economic Council met several times over the weekend to develop a list of options for the administration’s next phase of fiscal stimulus and held several conversations with President Donald Trump, said one senior administration official. So far, officials have discussed allowing industries such as airlines to defer tax payments or temporarily keep some of the taxes they collect from consumers. Airlines are seeking even greater assistance — nearly $60 billion worth — as they cancel flights and park plans due to collapsing demand for travel. The hotel industry has suggested options to help with their cash crunch including loans from the Small Business Administration, deferring tax liabilities, a temporary payroll tax cut or a tax credit to retain employees. Other suggestions have included offering loan guarantees, loan forbearance or the cancellation of debts through executive action or regulatory changes, said a Republican in close contact with the administration. Within the past week, as business plunged across the nation, the internal discussion among top economic officials has moved toward providing industries with cash and not just tax relief — even if no one in the White House wants to call it a bailout.  Kudlow said he preferred to call it more of a “short-term liquidity issue.” The goal is to help industries deal with the cash-flow crises they’ll likely face in the coming weeks, even if the administration sees no evidence of systemic risk. “They haven’t settled on any one thing at this point,” said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and outside adviser to the president. “We proposed a four-step plan and the best idea is to suspend the payroll tax for the rest of the year. That’s something that would help everyone. It’s clean, and it doesn’t pick winners and losers.” Industries across the board are starting to latch onto the idea of suspending the payroll tax for employers for the rest of the year. The largest business lobbying group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, included the idea in a letter it sent to Congress on Monday, and Trump has said he’d like the payroll tax either cut or suspended through the end of the year. Leaders from sectors including airlines, hotels and casinos have been warning officials behind closed doors about concerns they’ll have to start laying off thousands of employees if the shutdown throughout America continues — including in politically sensitive states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania. Half of the $800 billion in aid, under the latest White House estimates, would come from aid to workers and small businesses, tax deferrals and other moves already underway including deferring student-loan interest, buying oil and additional provisions of a relief bill already moving through Congress. The other half would come from a payroll-tax holiday through the end of the year — a move that would likely cost much more than $400 billion. The administration is also exploring with the Federal Reserve how it can deploy the central bank’s emergency powers to lend to nonfinancial firms, though the central bank’s authorities were curtailed in the political backlash to the 2008 bailout of insurer American International Group. The White House and economic officials are desperate to stave off a potential recession, since the economy has been one of the hallmark achievements of Trump’s first term and a key message for his reelection. The former head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, said in an interview that the March jobs report out early next month might show losses of more than 1 million. “It really could be the worst jobs report we’ve ever seen in our history.” He said he did calculations over the weekend with conservative economist Larry Lindsey showing that the economy could contract by a severe 5 percent in the second quarter, though a swift containment of the virus could lead to a bounce-back in the third quarter.  “There is a dispute between the House and the Senate and the president about what to do,” Hassett said. “But imagine if it’s Friday when the jobs report comes out and it’s worse than we’ve ever seen. Then you’d see Congress act with urgency. The question is if they act with urgency ahead of the terrible numbers.” Hassett, who remains in contact with the White House, says he is not in favor of direct industry bailouts but is arguing for the payroll tax suspension at least for a quarter of the year. “You can do it quickly on the employer side and we need employers not to fire people,” he said. “And on the employee side, it could have a macro-economic effect. You could even offset the 5 percent economic decline with the payroll tax cut. And we don’t have to have a recession if the virus fades and the third quarter booms.”  In addition to hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders directly, the White House is hearing from informal economic advisers such as Moore with their proposals.  Moore said he sent a plan to Kudlow for items to include in the next stimulus proposal that’s expected to emerge from the White House and Treasury Department in the coming days. Moore authored a proposal along with publishing magnate Steve Forbes and supply-side economics guru Art Laffer, a close Kudlow ally. The group suggested financing the payroll tax cut by issuing 50- and 100-year Treasury bonds at 1 percent interest. They also suggested avoiding any direct cash bailouts to hard-hit industries like airlines or hotels. “Every business is materially affected by this. Who is going to make these decisions about who gets aid and who doesn’t?” Moore said. The final piece of the plan would be for the Fed to open lending facilities for low-interest loans to any business that has collateral to avoid cash crunches that could force companies into fire sales of assets to raise cash to replace revenue lost to the crisis. “We aren’t sure which of these Larry and [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin like, but Trump listens to us,” Moore said. “He seeks out our advice. We are urging him not to do things that are bad policy that he would not do otherwise.” A former senior Treasury official still in contact with senior members of the department said Mnuchin is aware that many Republicans will have problems with direct bailout payments to individual industries, but that he may propose them anyway for airlines, cruise lines and the entertainment industry more broadly. “The problem is the Wall Street [Troubled Asset Relief Program] vote still haunts those halls,” this former official said of the 2008 vote to bail out big banks. “It’s going to be like pulling teeth to get Republicans to vote for that. I think the White House is also open to refundable tax credits. And then you have the challenge of, ‘How do you help people exempt from the payroll tax?’’’ The person added that a plan could not wait until the end of the week. “It has to happen right away. Like, right now. Otherwise businesses are just going to start closing and laying people off right away.” Meridith McGraw contributed to this report.",Trump team prepares rescue package of at least $800 billion,2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-coronavirus-relief-package-132369,politico
"President Donald Trump on Monday acknowledged the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic, releasing strict new guidelines to limit people’s interactions in an increasingly urgent bid to slow the virus in the next two weeks before U.S. hospitals are overwhelmed. “We have an invisible enemy,” the president said at a news conference, where he released guidelines that called for people to avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people, steer clear of eating and drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts, and work or attend school from home whenever possible. “This is a bad one. This is a very bad one.” The guidelines — including a strict recommendation that anyone with even minor symptoms stay home — are not mandatory. But they were issued with a sense of alarm and a frankness that Trump has not previously displayed. The president acknowledged that the crisis — which has already killed thousands around the world and set off a plunge of world markets — could last until July or August and even plunge the nation into a recession. No country, including the United States, has it under control, he said, though he also suggested America could limit its death toll “if we do a really good job” responding now. “Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus,” Trump said. “If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation, and we will defeat the virus, and we’re going to have a big celebration altogether. With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly.” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that while some people may perceive the guidelines as inconvenient or going too far, they reflect a deteriorating assessment of the containment efforts and should be taken seriously. “When you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak, you are always behind where you think you are if you think that today reflects where you really are. That’s not word speak. It means if you think you’re here,” Fauci said, gesturing to illustrate his point, “you’re really here because you’re only getting the results. Therefore, it will always seem that the best way to address it would be to be doing something that looks like it might be an overreaction. It isn’t an overreaction.” The White House gave the country a 15-day window to flatten the soaring curve of infection, but some disease modelers see a trajectory that could create a crisis, similar to Italy, that would start to overwhelm the U.S. health care system in about 10 days. Fauci called the 15 days “a trial” period for the guidelines to be reconsidered. “It isn’t that these guidelines are now gonna be in effect until July,” he clarified. “What the president was saying is the trajectory of the outbreak may go until then.” The new guidelines come on the heels of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance Sunday night that recommended the cancellation and postponement of gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks. It also comes after the Office of Personnel Management declared federal offices in the Washington, D.C., area open but with maximum flexibility for telework. The president’s remarks reflect the increased urgency of the moment. As recently as Sunday, Trump was telling Americans to “relax” and that the pandemic would pass. And on Monday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow predicted that the outbreak would only impact the economy in the short term — “weeks and months,” he said, not years.  But hours later, Trump said the situation was “bad,” and administration officials pointed to new predictive modeling showing a need for more stringent social distancing measures. The case for aggressive social distancing is clear: A coronavirus vaccine is at least a year away, and the acceleration of the outbreak within the U.S. has put the it on track with some of the world’s hardest-hit nations.  “If everybody does what we’ve asked for in the next 15 days, we will see a dramatic difference,” said Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator. More than a month-and-a-half into the response effort and after failed bids to prevent and then contain the disease’s spread, the Trump administration is now scrambling to put its full weight behind a messaging campaign aimed at convincing people to do something simple yet unnatural: stay home. Still, public health experts said the administration has much work to do to sell Americans on such an abrupt change in habits and rebuild its credibility after weeks of mixed messages.  Trump was joined at the briefing by his key health advisers, including Fauci, Birx and Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration’s response.  A growing number of governors earlier Monday followed the lead of fellow executives, announcing closures of bars, restaurants and other venues in states across the country. The new guidance similarly calls for any bars, restaurants, food courts, gyms and other venues to be closed in areas where there’s evidence of community transmission. Trump held separate video teleconferences with G-7 leaders and governors on Monday morning to discuss the response to the coronavirus. “Went very well,” he tweeted after speaking to governors. During the call, however, Trump urged governors to try to get respirators, ventilators and other equipment themselves. Hospital systems have raised alarms over a lack of beds and medical supplies to handle the crush of anticipated patients, and already some hospitals are beginning to postpone certain procedures in an effort to free up space and medical personnel. “We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves,” the president told them, according to a source in the room. “Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.” The New York Times first reported the president’s remarks to governors. Trump told reporters that governors would be able to get what they need sooner if they don’t rely on the federal government. Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, said while “the words did not quite come out right,” the president encouraged states to use whatever supply chains they have access to while the federal government attempts to maintain more respirators and ventilators. Administration officials also stressed the important role millennials can play in combating the spread of the virus. Birx called that generation “the core group that will stop the virus.” She said millennials are the most likely group to be the least symptomatic but also the group most likely to be out and about and in social gatherings. That means they could unknowingly spread the virus to older people or those with underlying issues, who are more vulnerable, if they ignore guidance and recommendations, but they’re also adept at communicating via text and across social media platforms. “Public health people like myself don’t always come out with compelling and exciting messages that a 25- to 35-year-old may find interesting and something that they’ll take to heart,” Birx said. “But millennials can speak to one another about how important it is in this moment to protect all of the people.” Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CNN on Monday morning that the U.S. was “at a critical inflection point,” noting that America now has the same number of cases that Italy had two weeks ago. Italy is now on lockdown as it deals with more than 27,000 cases of the coronavirus, trailing only China, where the outbreak began. And public health experts have warned that without further dramatic steps, the U.S. could look like Italy by month’s end, with hospitals swamped by sick patients and hundreds of thousands of infected people freely circulating. “We have a choice to make: Do we want to really lean into social distancing and mitigation strategies and flatten the curve or do we just want to keep going on with business as usual and end up being Italy?” Adams said. As of Monday afternoon, more than 4,100 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., though experts expect that number to rise as more testing becomes available. More than 70 people have died.

"Polls will not open for Ohio's primary election Tuesday after a late-night decision from Gov. Mike DeWine, effectively upheld by the state Supreme Court, to delay in-person voting until June in an effort to protect voters and poll workers from the coronavirus outbreak. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. The election was in limbo for several hours Monday night after a state judge in Columbus denied a last-minute attempt by the state to postpone the primary election. But DeWine responded with an unprecedented order closing physical polling places as the legal battle moved up to the Ohio Supreme Court. Early Tuesday morning, four judges on that court issued a unanimous, unsigned ruling declining to stop the state from shuttering polls. Three other judges on the court recused — two because they're currently running for reelection and the other because he is DeWine's son. The ruling effectively overturns the Monday ruling from Franklin County Judge Richard Frye that the primary had to continue as scheduled. Frye said it was too late to move back the primary and that doing so would confuse and suppress voters. Frye also took issue with the state’s claim that moving the election to June would alleviate voters’ health concerns, saying there's no medical evidence the pandemic will have disappeared by then. Now, officials and voting rights experts say it's not clear whether and how voters will be able to participate in the still-scheduled primary with polling places shuttered, though DeWine, a Republican, has pledged to ""to extend voting options."" ""Every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,"" he said Monday. But the state has not yet laid out the path to letting people vote.  ""What I find most confusing is whether the governor is purporting to call off the election or not,"" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California-Irvine. ""Saying one is closing polling places is not the same as postponing the election."" Ohio is one of four states with primaries scheduled on Tuesday, along with Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Officials in the other three states said that their Tuesday primaries would proceed as planned. Meanwhile, Kentucky's top elections official announced that his state's primaries would move from May to June as well. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced that he and Gov. Andy Beshear had agreed to delay the state's May primary until June 23. ""There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy us time,"" Adams said in his announcement. Kentucky is the third state to formally delay its primary, following Louisiana and Georgia. Earlier in the day, Ohio officials claimed they were ready to move forward with the election as well should the courts not grant the extension.  ""If that was necessitated, I have no doubt that the patriotic Ohio election officials would get that job done,"" LaRose said. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said both state party chairs were consulted and supportive of the push to postpone the primary, though he acknowledged the last-minute nature of the announcement risks confusing voters. ""In deference to their expertise on this critical health crisis, I support that decision regarding in-person voting tomorrow,"" Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a statement following DeWine's initial press conference. ""Extending an election is an unprecedented step, so we as a party are weighing alternatives on how to best do so — including the possibility to conduct the primary election entirely by vote-by-mail, as is done in several other states, with a deadline much earlier than June 2."" The move represented a significant escalation in state action to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Already, Ohio election officials had relocated or closed nearly 150 polling places that were originally supposed to be in nursing homes and assisted living facilities and recruited backup poll workers to replace those who were not comfortable serving due to their age or health status. Over the weekend, before trying to move election day, Ohio officials ordered county boards of elections to set up curbside voting options and extend the deadline to request an absentee ballot for anyone impacted by the virus.  As recently as Friday, election officials from all four states voting Friday, including LaRose, said that the March 17 elections would go on as scheduled. After DeWine held his press conference, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said that he ""feel[s] good about the decision to let the election go on tomorrow."" ""Look, we have to have our elections continue, in my opinion,"" Pritzker said. ""This is the right thing to do. Our democracy needs to go on. We have to elect leaders."" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also said Monday that she wanted ""to encourage everybody to go out and vote today and if you choose to vote tomorrow, it's going to be safe."" In Florida, Secretary of State Laurel Lee said Monday evening at a press conference that the state will still hold its primary on Tuesday. Lee said nearly 2 million people have already voted. And in Arizona, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said the election will also move forward on Tuesday. ""What it all comes down to is that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,"" Hobbs said at a press conference.  Election officials in the state have worked to minimize risk in polling places across the state, striking a delicate balance between making voting accessible and protecting public health. ""This is a dynamic situation. It’s changing day by day, hour by hour,"" Adrian Fontes, the Maricopa County recorder, told POLITICO in an interview on Monday. ""While the state has closed all rec centers and libraries, we made sure they will still stay open as polling places. We have heightened cleanliness and sanitation protocols, and we're paying close attention to mandates from federal, state and local authorities. ...

"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is stepping up its response to the coronavirus by shutting its border to nearly all non-residents, except for U.S. citizens. Speaking to reporters Monday outside his residence, Trudeau said people who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents will be denied entry into Canada. He noted there are exceptions for airline crews, diplomats, immediate family members of Canadians and, for now, U.S. citizens. ""As the virus continues its spread we've decided to take increasingly aggressive steps to keep you and your family safe,"" said Trudeau, who has been in self-isolation and working from home since last Thursday when his wife tested positive for the coronavirus. ""These measures will help save lives."" Trudeau said U.S. citizens are exempt from the ban because Canada's southern neighbor is in a category of its own. Canada will also strengthen travel restrictions in other areas. Trudeau said that, starting Thursday, international flights will only be permitted to land in four cities' airports: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary. He said flights to Canada from the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean and Saint Pierre and Miquelon will be exempt from this rule. Airlines, he added, will be mandated to test all travelers and to prevent anyone showing symptoms of the virus from boarding a plane. The prime minister said Canadians returning home from abroad will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Earlier Monday, the Canada Border Services Agency added new questions for travelers arriving in Canada from all international destinations. The change, aimed at dealing with coronavirus fears, came amid confusion and criticism of the government’s airport screening process. Ontario Premier Doug Ford called on the federal government earlier Monday to tighten things up at the border. Ford also said he would support a federal government decision to shutter Canada's borders to visitors, including those from the United States, in response to the coronavirus. But Ford added that he would not want to see any closure to cross-border trade and commerce.","Trudeau: Canada to deny entry to all nonresidents except U.S. citizens, for now",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/canada-shuts-border-coronavirus-132332,politico

"The White House and Senate Republicans are considering melding together a House-passed coronavirus aid bill with President Donald Trump's request for $850 billion in stimulus spending, creating one massive aid package that the Senate could pass this week.  The thinking, as described by Senate Republican leadership aides and several Trump administration aides, is that one large-scale package would be easier to push through the Senate immediately. The downside is the House would have to also approve the package, and the House is in recess with no current plan to return. But since Senate Republicans were aiming to amend the House bill anyway, they don't see much practical or political risk.  This will, undoubtedly, create a massive legislative rush this week in the midst of a national health crisis that has brought the nation to a standstill. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is slated to attend the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday afternoon, where he is expected to discuss this plan.  The White House Tuesday morning began signaling it was aiming for $850 billion in stimulus spending, split between a payroll tax cut, support for the airline industry and $250 billion in loans for small business.

"Social distancing hit the set of President Donald Trump’s favorite morning cable news show Tuesday, with the three hosts of “Fox & Friends” scattered across their New York studio in an effort to demonstrate best practices amid the coronavirus pandemic.  “To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart — same studio, plenty of distance,” co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers at the top of the broadcast.   The right-leaning talk show, which airs weekdays from 6-9 a.m. ET and has achieved outsized influence under Trump’s administration, is the latest TV news program to employ the preventative measure as the outbreak tears across the United States. Although the CDC recommends that Americans maintain a distance of six feet to help thwart the coronavirus’ rapid spread, co-host Steve Doocy said that he and his colleagues usually sit only about 18 inches apart on the signature “curvy couch” of the “Fox & Friends” set. Tuesday morning, however, Doocy was alone on the mezzanine-level sofa, while Kimeade anchored “the big plastic desk” one floor below and co-host Ainsley Earhardt was stationed at a lectern nearby in the studio’s “fish bowl area.” “We’re doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is stay away from each other because you don’t want to get infected and you don’t want to spread infection,” Doocy said. “We have a responsibility to slow down this virus and to think of other people during this time,” Earhardt added. “And so if you can keep your distance and prevent someone from getting close to you that might be sick, you can save your family, you can save the elderly and help our country as a nation.” The new seating configuration reflects the seriousness with which President Donald Trump and his staunchest allies, both in media and politics, are now taking the nature of the coronavirus threat after previously being dismissive of its risk to Americans. On-air talent and guests at Fox News have drawn special scrutiny for downplaying the disease in recent weeks. Just last Friday, Earhardt remarked that it was “actually the safest time to fly” despite advisories against nonessential travel, and conservative religious leader Jerry Falwell Jr. appeared on the program to accuse people of “overreacting” to the coronavirus. “It makes you wonder if there’s a political reason for that,” Falwell said. “You know, impeachment didn’t work, and the Mueller report didn’t work, and Article 25 didn’t work. And so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.”",The president’s favorite morning show starts social distancing,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/fox-and-friends-social-distancing-133619,politico

"Few Americans trust President Donald Trump when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey, and fewer than half of respondents believe the federal government is taking sufficient steps to combat the public health crisis.  An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Tuesday shows that only 37 percent of those polled have either “a good amount” or “a great deal” of trust in the the information they hear from the president about the coronavirus, while 60 percent say they do “not very much” or “not at all” trust Trump’s words on the subject.  Among those surveyed, the president’s trust ratings regarding the coronavirus rank lower than other prominent sources of information, including the news media, state and local governments, and public health experts. More Americans than do not disapprove of the way he is handling the pandemic, 49 percent to 44 percent, and his overall job approval rating rests at 43 percent. The poll’s results come after the White House spent weeks downplaying the coronavirus threat to the United States, even as public health officials within the administration sounded alarms over its risk to the country and warned of its rapid rates of transmission. Only recently has Trump adopted a more somber tone when discussing the crisis, acknowledging Tuesday that “this is a very bad one” and cautioning Americans that “we have an invisible enemy.”  The more dire rhetoric from the president was accompanied by a new series of increasingly stern guidelines from the administration, which recommended avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people; working or attending school from home whenever possible; and abstaining from eating or drinking at bars, restaurants and food courts. It remains to be seen whether the latest measures will bolster public confidence in the administration’s ability to fight the coronavirus. Just 46 percent of Americans believe the federal government is doing enough to prevent the disease’s spread, down from 61 percent in February. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll was conducted March 13-14, surveying 835 adults. Its margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",Poll: Most Americans don’t trust Trump on coronavirus information,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/poll-americans-lack-trust-in-trump-on-coronavirus-information-133576,politico

"Bernie Sanders has run up the score among young voters in state after state, but his efforts have hit a wall in South Florida.  In a place where young Cuban-Americans joined their elders in the streets with pots and pans to celebrate Fidel Castro’s death, the Vermont senator’s Democratic socialism and past refusals to wholeheartedly condemn Castro and other Latin American authoritarian leaders are proving costly. “I’m more progressive than Biden, but I also don’t want to stand next to the dummy in the Che Guevara T-shirt at a rally, and that’s true here regardless of age,” said Carmen Pelaez, a founding member of Project Pastelito, a grassroots initiative in Miami that leads get-out-the-vote efforts for progressive candidates.  For Sanders, who posted big margins among young and Latino voters in places like California, Nevada and Texas, the resistance he’s encountering among young Latinos is a harbinger of a rough election night in the state that serves as the biggest prize among Tuesday’s primaries.  It’s not that Joe Biden is wildly popular among younger Latinos, just that he’s a more palatable alternative for many of them. “Are we excited about Biden’s candidacy? I don’t think so. But it’s just what Bernie represents to those here in South Florida that could be catastrophic, especially in a general election matchup,” said Toni Rodriguez, national political director for College Democrats.  “Here in South Florida, Bernie Sanders’ message is disconnected. And that’s telling people, ‘No, we need to vote for Biden because Bernie won’t resonate here in Florida,” Rodriguez, a student at Barry University in Miami Shores, Fla., added.  Cuban-Americans — known for their high voter turnout rates — have for decades been the largest group of Latinos in South Florida, with more than half of the state’s 2 million Cubans living in the region. But it’s only been in the past 20 years that Cuban-Americans have started playing a big role in Democratic politics as voters under 50 — many born in the U.S. — have broken with the Republican Party and embraced more liberal views than their parents and grandparents.  That generational change was reflected in the last presidential election: In 2004, George W. Bush won 78 percent of Florida’s Cuban-American vote, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of exit polls. By 2016, Donald Trump only managed to capture just over half of that vote. The red-to-blue evolution has its limits, however.  Pelaez points out that other Latino groups in South Florida, like Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, also favor Biden in the primary because of their family and friends’ history with socialist and authoritarian regimes — a sign of their different background and experience than Latinos in the Southwest, where Sanders had more widespread support.  “We come from countries where we’ve seen the slogan ‘Socialismo o muerte’ on the walls. We either survived socialism or have grandparents that did and have grown up with those stories,” Pelaez said. “Other Latinos don’t have that frame of reference.” That difference was reflected in a Florida poll last week that showed Sanders trailing Biden, 48 percent to 37 percent, among Hispanic voters.  Only 18 percent of Florida Hispanics — from Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Central and South America — said they would vote for a self-described socialist, while 70 percent said they would not, according to the survey conducted for Telemundo Station Group by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy.  More than 50 percent of Florida Hispanic voters under 50 years old said they would not vote for a socialist candidate, compared with 31 percent who said they would.  To some Florida Latinos, those numbers are proof that Biden would be a stronger rival to Trump in November — and would provide more top-of-the-ticket protection for Latino down-ballot candidates. “A lot of people in Florida know in order to win you have to have a more moderate standpoint. That’s been known,” said Mayra Macías, executive director of Latino Victory Project, an organization that endorsed Biden and is dedicated to electing Latinos up and down the ballot. Macías explained that in a state like Florida, voters are thinking beyond the presidential matchup, given the history of close races for national, state and local offices. She pointed to the reelection campaigns for Democratic Reps. Debbie Mucarsel Powell and Donna Shalala, both of whom flipped their South Florida districts in 2018 from Cuban Republicans and are up against two well-known Cuban Republican opponents again. Trump took to Twitter to endorse Mucarsel Powell‘s GOP opponent, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, just hours after he launched his campaign in January. “It’s all these candidates that would get affected … and hurt by a campaign’s inability to distinguish their brand of Democratic socialism from the socialism that many folks in Florida fled from or have a negative perception of,” Macías said.  Democrats have chronically struggled to get more Latino candidates on the ballot — the only Cuban-Americans in the Florida congressional delegation are Republican: Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Díaz Balart.  It’s critical for Biden to court Latinos “who came of political consciousness post the Obama years,” Macías said. “It’s going to be extremely important for the campaign to articulate a vision for them.”",Meet the young voters who refuse to vote for Bernie,2020-03-17,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-florida-youth-132928,politico

"Polls will not open for Ohio's primary election Tuesday after a late-night decision from Gov. Mike DeWine's administration, effectively upheld by the state Supreme Court, to delay in-person voting until June in an effort to protect voters and poll workers from the coronavirus outbreak. ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" DeWine said in a statement. The election was in limbo for several hours Monday night after a judge in Columbus denied a last-minute attempt backed by the state to postpone the primary election. But DeWine responded with an order from the state's top health official, Amy Acton, closing physical polling places as the legal battle moved up to the Ohio Supreme Court. Early Tuesday morning, four judges on that court issued a unanimous, unsigned ruling declining to stop the state from shuttering polls. Three other judges on the court recused — two because they're currently running for reelection and the other because he is DeWine's son. The ruling effectively overturns the Monday ruling from Franklin County Judge Richard Frye that the primary had to continue as scheduled. Frye said it was too late to move back the primary and that doing so would confuse and suppress voters. Frye also took issue with the state’s claim that moving the election to June would alleviate voters’ health concerns, saying there's no medical evidence the pandemic will have disappeared by then. DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose insisted voters will still be able to vote. ""Every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,"" DeWine said Monday. But DeWine's unprecedented order — closing physical polling places because an attempt to postpone the election failed — perplexed experts in election law. ""What I find most confusing is whether the governor is purporting to call off the election or not,"" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California-Irvine said late Monday. ""Saying one is closing polling places is not the same as postponing the election."" A directive from LaRose to county elections officials late Monday night, following the polls closure, said the primary was postponed until June 2 and said counties are ""prohibited from tabulating and reporting any results"" until then. ""There hasn't been an order to the Ohio secretary of state's office or to the governor's office that's been violated,"" LaRose told CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday, arguing that state health officials acted within their jurisdiction. ""I serve as the chief elections officer for Ohio, and what I wanted to do was create certainty for Ohioans."" Ohio was one of four states with primaries scheduled on Tuesday, along with Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Officials in the other three states said that their Tuesday primaries would proceed as planned. Meanwhile, Kentucky's top elections official announced on Monday that his state's primaries would move from May to June as well. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced that he and Gov. Andy Beshear had agreed to delay the state's May primary until June 23. ""There could be more changes, but this was a first step to buy us time,"" Adams said in his announcement. Kentucky is the third state to formally delay its primary, following Louisiana and Georgia. Earlier in the day, Ohio officials claimed they were ready to move forward with the election as well should the courts not grant the extension.  ""If that was necessitated, I have no doubt that the patriotic Ohio election officials would get that job done,"" LaRose said. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said both state party chairs were consulted and supportive of the push to postpone the primary, though he acknowledged the last-minute nature of the announcement risks confusing voters. ""In deference to their expertise on this critical health crisis, I support that decision regarding in-person voting tomorrow,"" Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a statement following DeWine's initial press conference. ""Extending an election is an unprecedented step, so we as a party are weighing alternatives on how to best do so — including the possibility to conduct the primary election entirely by vote-by-mail, as is done in several other states, with a deadline much earlier than June 2."" The move represented a significant escalation in state action to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Already, Ohio election officials had relocated or closed nearly 150 polling places that were originally supposed to be in nursing homes and assisted living facilities and recruited backup poll workers to replace those who were not comfortable serving due to their age or health status. Over the weekend, before trying to move election day, Ohio officials ordered county boards of elections to set up curbside voting options and extend the deadline to request an absentee ballot for anyone impacted by the virus.  As recently as Friday, election officials from all four states voting Friday, including LaRose, said that the March 17 elections would go on as scheduled. After DeWine held his Monday press conference, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said that he ""feel[s] good about the decision to let the election go on tomorrow."" ""Look, we have to have our elections continue, in my opinion,"" Pritzker said. ""This is the right thing to do. Our democracy needs to go on. We have to elect leaders."" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also said Monday that she wanted ""to encourage everybody to go out and vote today and if you choose to vote tomorrow, it's going to be safe."" In Florida, Secretary of State Laurel Lee said Monday evening at a press conference that the state will still hold its primary on Tuesday. Lee said nearly 2 million people have already voted. And in Arizona, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said the election will also move forward. ""What it all comes down to is that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,"" Hobbs said at a press conference.  Election officials in the state have worked to minimize risk in polling places across the state, striking a delicate balance between making voting accessible and protecting public health. ""This is a dynamic situation. It’s changing day by day, hour by hour,"" Adrian Fontes, the Maricopa County recorder, told POLITICO in an interview on Monday. ""While the state has closed all rec centers and libraries, we made sure they will still stay open as polling places. We have heightened cleanliness and sanitation protocols, and we're paying close attention to mandates from federal, state and local authorities. ... Election administrators have to be ready for anything. Except Godzilla.”  Natasha Korecki and Maggie Severns contributed to this report.","Ohio governor shutters polling places for Tuesday's primary, citing public health",2020-03-16,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/ohio-governor-recommends-postponing-tuesdays-primary-132340,politico

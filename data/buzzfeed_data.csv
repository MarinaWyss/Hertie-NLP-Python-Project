"     FLINT, Mich. — It was a rare move for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign.As the candidate prepared to fly to a town hall in Flint, Michigan — a state whose diverse working-class electorate could decide his future in the Democratic primary — an aide gathered reporters to make an announcement: Sanders would “directly address the African-American community and make the case for why black voters should support him over Joe Biden.""Everyone took note, tapping furiously on their iPhones.It's not often that Sanders deviates from his core message about social and economic injustice, delivered daily to thousands of people across the country at rallies that clock in, as if by science, at 47 minutes. He hardly ever directs a speech to a specific demographic. And he almost never asks his campaign team to preview a major address to reporters in order to ensure coverage.But a couple hours later, when Sanders stepped to the podium in Flint, he did not give his prepared remarks on race — instead delivering his familiar stump speech, making only brief mention of “a same-old, same-old status quo politics” that, he said, has “failed African-American communities.”After the event, as the campaign’s press bus idled outside the venue, Sanders communications director Mike Casca told reporters that the candidate scrapped his prepared remarks after discussing the event backstage with panelists, including community leaders in Flint and one of his top supporters, Dr. Cornel West.The crowd in Flint, a majority black city affected by a horrifying lead-water crisis, was mostly white on Saturday.“It was a change they thought was important,” Casca said, describing the decision as both a deliberate one by Sanders and an “one of those on-the-fly backstage moments.”“They wanted to lift up the panelists’ stories.""According to Casca, Sanders worked on the speech on plane rides between campaign events in Michigan and Illinois, two states that will vote in the Democratic primary on Tuesday after a disappointing finish for Sanders against Biden last week in Southern states where black voters made up the majority in Democratic primaries.“They talked over the idea and decided it was probably better to let the people of color who were on the panel discuss instead of him giving a traditional speech,” said Casca.“He does not have those experiences,” he added. “He is a white Jewish man.”Casca said the drafts of the original speech aimed to contrast Sanders and Biden’s record on racial justice — but he declined multiple times to say on which policy areas or votes.Asked whether the candidate will eventually deliver the speech, Casca said, “TBD.”Sanders's town halls, designed as a platform for individual stories of the working class, became an unexpectedly emotional centerpiece of his second presidential campaign through the summer and fall. Although he has largely held traditional rallies since voting began in February, he has said he believes voters' stories can be a more effective tool than any speech.The campaign billed Saturday's event as a town hall on ""racial and economic justice.""All week, at campaign stops across Arizona, Michigan, and Illinois, Sanders has laced into Biden's decades-long record on trade, economic issues, foreign policy, abortion, and LGBT rights. But he stopped short of doing the same with racial justice issues on Saturday night.Sanders, a 78-year-old independent from the mostly white state of Vermont, has struggled to attract, especially, middle-aged and older black voters to his coalition of young people, Latino voters, and white working-class voters.""He didn't want to speak on behalf of people of color when there were people of color on the panel,"" said Casca.Aside from a 30-minute speech at the start of the event, the six panelists spoke more than the candidate himself. Only at one point on Saturday night did Sanders attempt to create an explicit contrast with Biden, teeing up a lengthy question for West, the famed scholar and progressive activist.""Dr. West, there was a headline in today's Detroit News,"" he said, picking up a copy of the newspaper. ""And the headline said, 'Biden sees advantage with Michigan back voters.' OK?"" Sanders, still addressing West, began to list off a litany of statistics about black Americans: a larger wealth gap, a higher poverty rate, a higher rate for the uninsured and under-insured, lower life expectancies, lower pay rates. Do you think, he asked West, given “the reality of the condition of the African-American community right now that supporting a status quo, same old, same old type of politician is going to address these issues?”Sanders effectively asked West to make the case on his behalf.The professor stood with the mic, praising Sanders as an exemplar of “integrity, honesty, and decency"" who is ""never up for sale"" — before describing Biden as a ""neoliberal centrist.”“The neoliberalist who all of a sudden now is coming back to life — and the catalyst was my own black people. Oh, I'm so disappointed. Oh, I'm so upset,” West told the crowd in Flint.“Skin pigmentation doesn't determine your moral and spiritual formation. You gotta decide who you are.”Four years ago, Hillary Clinton effectively ended Sanders's first presidential campaign in the South, where black voters generally make up a majority of Democratic primary electorates and heavily favored her candidacy. Sanders, at times, struggled talking about race during the campaign, showing early frustration when he was interrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters and had occasionally uncomfortable interactions with activists.“His framework is income inequality and economic justice. He sees that as the all-inclusive tent,” Curtiss Reed Jr., the executive director of the Vermont Partnership for Fairness and Diversity, said in a 2018 interview.In the intervening years, Sanders has more often brought racial justice more to the fore of his campaign; he speaks often of wanting to build a multi-racial coalition. His theory of the 2020 campaign involved a massive turnout operation, in which working-class voters of all races would find common cause in issues like ending medical and educational debt, and along the way, convert non-voters into voters.The Sanders campaign heavily organized on the campuses of historical black colleges and universities in states like South and North Carolina, hoping to capitalize on his support among younger black voters.But over the last two weeks, in exit polling and in the returns, Sanders has still struggled to make substantial gains with black voters, particularly those in the South and those who are over age 30.What message did they hope Saturday night delivered to black voters?""That Sen. Sanders stands with them,"" Casca said, ""and his agenda would bring the most powerful change to their lives.""","Bernie Sanders Scrapped A Planned Speech On Race

"     NEW DELHI — A tweet by Tulsi Gabbard, the only woman remaining in the US presidential race, about experiencing “Hinduphobia” in the US has added fuel to escalating communal tensions in India.“Unfortunately, Hinduphobia is very real,” Gabbard wrote, “I've experienced it directly in each of my campaigns for Congress & in this presidential race.""      Gabbard quote-tweeted a US-based psychiatrist from Kashmir, who shared a screenshot of an anonymous Facebook post with the comment: “Blatantly biased news & anti-Hindu propaganda has real-world consequences for innocent people.”The anonymous Facebook post described an alleged encounter between two women and their Uber driver, who blamed Indian Hindus for “killing Muslims in New Delhi,” when he learned the women were Hindu. The driver then allegedly asked the women to get out of his car. BuzzFeed News has reached out to Gabbard and the woman she retweeted to find out more about the Facebook post, which could not be independently verified or located online.Gabbard’s tweet has since been shared on right-wing news websites in India and discussed on news channels.      It comes at an especially tense time in India, which has witnessed a week of horrifying communal violence in its capital, New Delhi.The violence began as a series of skirmishes between Hindus and Muslims on Feb. 23, a day after a member of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India’s Hindu nationalist ruling party, threatened to displace a group of Muslim women protesters by force. The women were protesting a discriminatory new citizenship law passed by the BJP.On Feb. 24, as Modi welcomed Donald and Melania Trump for a 36-hour visit, entire neighborhoods of northeast New Delhi were burnt down, and at least four mosques desecrated.The number of people killed as a result of the rioting is still rising — a hospital in New Delhi estimated the death toll was over 50. As of last week, bodies are still being recovered from of a drain in the neighborhood where the worst of the violence occurred.      Yet by Monday, these skirmishes had escalated into an attack on northeast New Delhi’s Muslim residents. A growing body of evidence — including video footage of police rioting alongside Hindu men — suggests members of New Delhi’s police chose to side with the Hindu community.Indian Twitter has been deeply divided over whether the violence was in fact anti-Muslim, or a spontaneous outburst that affected “both sides.”Hindu and Muslim lives have been lost in the violence. But the the footage of the police suggests the Hindu mobs acted with an impunity stemming from the belief that they had the support of the state. In recent weeks, BJP leaders appeared to prepare the ground for precisely such a confrontation, making several speeches across New Delhi asking citizens to “shoot the traitors.”      Stories like the one Gabbard retweeted, where Hindu or Muslim working-class people enact a kind of “revenge” on their employers or customers, abound on Indian Twitter.On Feb. 7, an Uber driver took a poet who had protested the citizenship bill to a police station instead of his actual destination, where he was interrogated for two hours. The driver was suspended but then reinstated by Uber — before that he was given an “Alert Citizen Prize” prize by the BJP. This week, another alleged report about a “Muslim maid” mixing spit and urine into her employers’ food went viral on right-wing Twitter, but it was later discovered that the video was nine years old and the woman in the footage was not Muslim.These stories are frequently accompanied by calls for economic boycotts of Muslim businesses.      Gabbard was raised in Hawaii by a Catholic father and a Hindu mother. She has said she was immersed in the Hindu holy book, the Bhagavad Gita, and reportedly kept her childhood copy of it with her when she was deployed as a medical administrator to Iraq. Later, she gifted the same copy to Modi himself.While Gabbard has some progressive domestic politics, these views are at odds with her support for authoritarians, including Modi, Egyptian President Fatth El-Sisi, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. She also has a long history of courting the right wing in India, profiled extensively in the Indian magazine Caravan.Ram Madhav, then a BJP spokesperson but previously a longtime executive of a paramilitary Hindu supremacist group that is widely regarded as the parent organization of the BJP itself, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, delivered gifts to Gabbard from Modi on her wedding day in April 2015.

"     The image began to circulate again on Thursday, this time with a very different sentiment behind it: five Democratic women photographed at the height of last summer, back when it seemed like one of them might have a chance at making history. They were all high-fiving, all laughing. The caption: “Madam President?”As the last major woman candidate, Elizabeth Warren, dropped out of the presidential race, Democrats are mourning what could have been — and wondering what happened.“Every time I get introduced as the most powerful woman, I almost cry, because I wish that were not true,” said Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, in the wake of Warren’s exit. “I so wish that we had a woman president of the United States, and we came so close to doing that. I do think there’s a certain element of misogyny.”It had started with a ""blue wave"" midterm election in 2018, where being a woman was seen, for the first time, as a distinct advantage, and where candidates of color won even in white-majority districts. Then, in 2019, a slate of historically diverse presidential candidates came together, including six women.After everything, the last two candidates left in the race with a shot at the nomination are two white men in their late seventies: Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.Kirsten Gillibrand left the race early after a campaign that tried to center women voters simply never took off. Kamala Harris left after a formidable start and rapid rise ended with a just-as-rapid fall. Amy Klobuchar, who spent much of the race fighting for any shred of voters’ attention, dropped out to endorse Biden mere weeks after she finally, unexpectedly, surged.Warren’s exit Thursday, after a disappointing string of losses in early-voting states, was perhaps the starkest reminder of the realities facing women candidates vying for the country’s highest office.She stuck to a popular message, raised huge sums of money, and built a formidable grassroots organization across the country.Like the other candidates who dropped out of the race, she had hardly run a perfect campaign. But it was also unquestionable that, after what seemed like an unstoppable rise in the polls last summer, Warren's candidacy had become mired down in voter fears about electability — and, inextricably, her gender.Polling from a progressive firm showed, for example, that a large swath of Democratic voters, about one-third, held sexist beliefs — and that almost none of them backed Warren. Other figures showed Warren’s support among male voters declining sharply as the campaign went on.      As she addressed reporters Thursday in front of her home in Cambridge, Warren was unflinching about the role that sexism had played in her campaign.“Gender in this race, you know, that is the trap question for everyone,” Warren said. “If you say, ‘Yeah, there was sexism in this race,’ everyone says, ‘Whiner!’ And if you say ‘No, there was no sexism,’ about a bazillion women think, What planet do you live on?“I promise you this: I’ll have a lot more to say on that subject later on.”The drive to beat Donald Trump was all-consuming in the 2020 primary. From the beginning, it also led many voters to simply count women candidates out.Across early states, voters said they found them too angry or too unlikable or too inexperienced. Their dislike of the women candidates’ policies or ideologies mixed frequently with their feelings about their gender.“She’s a firecracker, but she doesn’t have all that experience that Biden does,” Mary, a voter in tiny Blue Grass, Iowa, said of Warren in January. Then, almost as an aside, she added: “And I don’t think she can win, because she’s a woman, dang it, and they don’t like women presidents, I guess.”Mostly, voters said, they saw women candidates as too risky — especially in the wake of the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton lost to Trump.Peggy Hendrix, a Memphis resident who voted early for Michael Bloomberg in Tennessee, was unflinching last week about her belief that Klobuchar and Warren should drop out.“I think the two women in the race should jump out — because America would never elect a woman president. They didn't elect Hillary, who has been senator, first lady, been in government all her life,” Hendrix said.“I know these other women don't have a chance. I think they should get out.”Gillibrand, Harris, Warren, and Klobuchar all ran vastly different campaigns, and all had issues that were entirely separate from their gender. At one point or another, though, all of them were forced to make the same choice: to address the issue of sexism head-on.Male candidates never faced the same questions, or the same necessity, pointed out Lily Adams, who served as Harris’s communications director.“They all had to take it on directly, this issue of electability — no ‘wink, wink, nod, nod,’” Adams said of the women candidates. “You had to define what it is, call out the problem, and explain how you can solve it. We realized, ‘We’re going to have to call out this elephant in the room in a far more explicit way.’”For Harris — who was contending doubly with racism, as the first serious black woman candidate since Shirley Chisholm — that effort began in earnest in a speech in May 2019 at an NAACP convention in Detroit. There, she explicitly challenged media-driven notions of “electability” that favored white men.She wove efforts like the Detroit speech into the fabric of her campaign, frequently referring to hypothetical leaders with ""she""/""her"" pronouns — hoping to challenge voters’ ideas, she said, of what a president looked like.Harris told BuzzFeed News in October that such efforts were necessary “especially in light of the whole discussion about ‘electability,’ which drives me bananas.”She added, “It’s important for people to understand that they have to really check how they're thinking about these things. But we have to help along the way.”      Klobuchar — who found herself losing voters to Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of a small city — addressed the issue directly on the debate stage after she was asked about her comments that a woman with so little experience would not be taken seriously.“What I said is true. Women are held to a higher standard,” she said. “Otherwise, we could play a game called ‘Name Your Favorite Woman President,’ which we can’t do because it has all been men, including all vice presidents. And I think any working woman out there, any woman that’s at home, knows exactly what I mean.”For Warren, that moment came in January, when CNN first reported that Sanders had told her in a private meeting he did not believe a woman could win against Trump.She put out a statement confirming her side of the story, which Sanders denied, and spoke of it briefly in the next debate — before pivoting to an explicit defense of women’s electability, a topic she had so far mostly avoided.It had, her campaign believed, become untenable to not address the issue of gender in the race. But her campaign was also careful to tell key supporters not to accuse Sanders of sexism, largely because they knew the fear was something that was widely held among Democratic voters.“I would be careful with the ‘sexism’ angle when it comes to the Bernie/Warren exchange individually — that’s not what this is about and I think it’ll be really bad news for us if that becomes what this is about,” a Warren aide wrote to a group of supporters in a private Twitter group as the story about Sanders’ comments reached its height.“Claiming you’re worried a woman can’t win/flagging that she’ll receive sexist attacks is something many, many people feel.”Ultimately, the story appeared to do little to damage Sanders, who continued to rise in the polls, and went on to a near win in Iowa and victories New Hampshire and Nevada.Though she avoided speaking explicitly about sexism in the race for much of her campaign, Warren often built her speeches around prominent women in history, and her policies centered issues like universal child care.In her famous “selfie lines,” which could stretch for hours, Warren made a point of allowing families with children to go first and providing coloring paper for children to use as she spoke. It was an environment where, unlike other candidates’ rallies, many families felt comfortable bringing their children — and each time Warren encountered a young girl in line, she knelt and made them a pinkie promise: “I’m running for president because that’s what girls do.”As she addressed reporters in front of her house Thursday, after she had left the race, Warren’s voice broke as she spoke of those interactions.“One of the hardest parts of this is all those pinkie promises,” she said. “And all those little girls who are gonna have to wait four more years. That’s gonna be hard.”Rosie Gray contributed reporting to this story.","What Happened To The Women Of 2020? Fears Of “Electability.”

"     WASHINGTON — Congress will send President Donald Trump an $8.3 billion emergency spending package to help combat the coronavirus, as the virus continues to spread in the United States.The Senate voted 96–1 to fund the package. The bulk of funding is designated to agencies responsible for prevention and care. The amount is more than three times the original $2.5 billion that Trump requested from Congress last week, but he is expected to sign the bill. Republican Sen. Rand Paul was lone vote against the spending package.More than $7 billion will be dispersed among government health agencies, including $2.2 billion allocated to the CDC to contain the outbreak and $3 billion toward research and development of vaccines and other treatments. More than $1 billion will fund State Department operations abroad and humanitarian assistance.The bill comes as the international death toll related to the infection reaches 3,286 people, 11 of which were in the US. More than 95,000 people worldwide have been infected with the coronavirus, according to a Johns Hopkins University website mapping the spread of the infection. Earlier this week, the stock market plummeted to its lowest since 2008. The FDA is closely monitoring potential shortages in critical medical products.To mitigate the issue, Congress’s bill provides nearly $1 billion to state and local agencies for medical supplies, including masks and protective equipment. Small businesses suffering financial losses as a result of the outbreak will have access to $1 billion in loan subsidies.On Wednesday, the House approved the package 415–2; Republican Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona and Ken Buck of Colorado voted against the measure.Prior to the vote, House Democrats and Republicans attended separate closed-door briefings with Vice President Mike Pence and Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Trump put Pence in charge of the coronavirus response, much to the chagrin of health experts who cited the vice president’s lack of medical experience.Members leaving the briefing said Pence and Fauci gave the same public health recommendations that health experts have circulated since the outbreak; Pence and Fauci also announced new guidance for nursing homes to minimize the spread of the virus, according to those who attended the briefing.“On travel, Dr. Fauci said there wasn’t an official directive but 'just use common sense,'” Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York told BuzzFeed News upon exiting the briefing. “The people that are elderly, that have preexisting conditions — with respiratory or heart — they should not be domestically traveling,” she added.Maloney, chair of the House Oversight Committee, said she invited Fauci to appear before the committee next Wednesday for a public briefing.Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts said Pence told Democrats “that the risk for the average American that’s in good health was still small,” also adding that their concerns were more centered around the “frail elderly.”The average age of a US senator is 62.9 years old; several of them are over the age of 80. Still, many senators said they weren’t worried about contracting the infection. Some of their House counterparts seemed rattled when they joined hundreds of their colleagues on the floor to vote Wednesday. Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee wore a blue rubber glove on his right hand during a vote series, and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida sat in the House chambers wearing a gas mask.So far, Congress is moving forward with normal in-person voting and is expected to return to the Capitol next week. When reporters asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi if the Capitol would remain open, she responded, “At this time, yes, without question,” as she walked into a briefing on the coronavirus.","Congress Quickly Passed An $8.3 Billion Spending Package To Fight And Treat The Coronavirus

"     Three weeks after ending his presidential bid, Andrew Yang is starting a new group to cement his ideas about 21st-century work and technology firmly into the political “mainstream,” with an ambitious goal of advancing “a wave of new thinking in American politics,” his advisers said.Yang started the organization, a political nonprofit called Humanity Forward, on Thursday.The group will both support Democratic candidates who embody Yang’s vision, in the style of a more typical political group — such as Bernie Sanders’ Our Revolution or Pete Buttigieg’s Hitting Home — while also embracing more unconventional aims and methods.Yang, according to plans laid out by his advisers earlier this week, will support “projects and pilots that demonstrate the power and practicality of our ideas in real life” through grants across spaces in tech and media. He will also host his own long-form podcast and a “Future of Work” conference in Washington, DC, to discuss his vision for a “human-centered economy.”The 45-year-old entrepreneur got in the race early, in November 2017, and rose from a political nobody to a candidate who outlasted governors and senators. “It’s amazing to imagine a campaign that started with my Google contact list and now has over 400,000 donors and millions of Americans who support us,” Yang said in an interview on the night he ended his presidential campaign in New Hampshire.During his two-plus years in the race, Yang popularized a message about individuals redefining their worth as more than economic metrics, building his campaign around a singular policy idea: a monthly payment to every American, known as universal basic income, or UBI.Part of Humanity Forward’s work, advisers said, will be centered on making UBI a reality, partly through the “grants,” which he and his team are calling “‘Forward Thinking’ seed funding.” These could include pilot programs for universal basic income — something he tried in miniature during his presidential campaign.Humanity Forward is also pledging to give $500,000 in universal basic income to residents in one town in New York state.“It's still me. It's still what we do. It's still about proving that we're the best to solve our problems,” Yang said in an interview last week. “In some ways, it’s easier to do independent from the political cycle.”Yang believes his campaign advanced a conversation about poverty and technology, and perhaps changed the way candidates can talk to voters in the 2020s. His plainspoken style on the campaign trail, professed affinity for many of the other candidates, and easy jokes made him popular among Democratic voters, from his many online supporters to his own rivals on the debate stage.“When I speak at an event and some of my fellow candidates speak at an event, I feel like we’re sometimes speaking different languages. And the language that I speak is just English,” he said, laughing. “With some numbers thrown in, too.”Yang’s success has also led to some speculation that he might run for office in New York, where he and his family live in Manhattan. Asked this week about a run for mayor in 2021, Yang said he is “looking at it.”His new group, which would allow him to build on his political platform until another campaign, will be structured as a 501(c)(4) organization, meaning it can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money and is not obligated to disclose its donors.Zach Graumann, Yang's former campaign manager, said they plan to disclose major donors voluntarily but had not landed on the details.""In true AY style,” he said, “we’ll be really honest about everything.”","Andrew Yang Is Launching A Political Group To Cement His Ideas Into The ""Mainstream""

"     Elizabeth Warren is ending her presidential campaign, a dramatic if expected turn after a disappointing stretch of primaries for someone who was once seen as a leading contender for the Democratic nomination.She announced her decision on a call with staff on Thursday.""I know that when we set out, this was not the call you ever wanted to hear,"" she said. ""It is not the call I ever wanted to make. But I refuse to let disappointment blind me, or you, to what we’ve accomplished. We didn’t reach our goal, but what we have done together, what you have done, has made a lasting difference. It’s not the scale of the difference we wanted to make, but it matters — and the changes will have ripples for years to come.""""We ran from the heart,"" she said. ""We ran on our values. We ran on treating everyone with respect and dignity.""Warren soon after addressed reporters outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with her husband Bruce Mann by her side.""I will not be running for president in 2020, but I guarantee I will stay in the fight for the hard-working folks across this country who've gotten the short end of the stick over and over,"" she said.It is not yet clear whether Warren plans to endorse either of the remaining top candidates, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Her endorsement would be undoubtedly influential, but she is in a difficult position, with a raft of supporters who are likely to split between the two candidates.Among close Warren allies, there has been disagreement in recent days about whether she should endorse Sanders, with whom she is closely aligned ideologically, or try to extract policy commitments or a possible cabinet position from Biden, who for now looks most likely to capture the nomination.Biden and Warren spoke on Wednesday night, a Biden campaign official said.Sanders' deputy campaign manager Ari Rabin-Havt said on MSNBC soon after Warren's decision broke that Sanders would ""welcome"" an endorsement from her, but ""I think we have to leave that to the Warren campaign.""Asked what she would tell her supporters about who to back now, Warren said, ""Let's take a deep breath and spend a little time on that. We don't have to decide right this minute."" She added that she would not be making an endorsement on Thursday.Warren had said often that she cared more about enacting her agenda than becoming president herself. And she and her once-ascendant campaign shaped the 2020 primary in that sense, introducing a slate of policies into the Democratic mainstream intended to reshape the American economy and curb the influence of money in government. She made a wealth tax — 2% on fortunes over $50 million, a policy that even Sanders had shied away from in 2016 — into a progressive rallying cry, with people at her rallies who dressed as two pennies.With the funds from the wealth tax, Warren said she would put in place a series of plans focused on education, another departure from many presidential campaigns — enacting universal childcare to forgiving huge swaths of Americans’ student debt, another idea that had barely been considered among Democrats even two years before.Her campaign itself broke new ground. She made a rejection of high-dollar fundraisers a central tenet of her campaign. Instead of calling important donors, Warren made it a point to call up people who had donated small sums instead, and she spent hours after her events taking photos with every single attendee who wanted one — a “selfie line” tradition that is likely to endure in American politics.And she inspired deep loyalty from her staff and fans, who took to covering everything in the campaign's signature color, ""liberty green.""""You know liberty green everything was key here,"" Warren said on the call with staff Thursday. ""My personal favorites included the liberty green boas, liberty green sneakers, liberty green makeup, liberty green hair, and liberty green glitter liberally applied. But it was so much more.”Despite weak showings in early states, Warren had vowed at the start of March to stay in and fight for the nomination through the Democratic convention this summer, hoping to rekindle a campaign whose momentum had once looked unstoppable. She went as far as to reverse course and choose not to disavow financial help from a super PAC. But she continued to struggle to pick up delegates into Super Tuesday as Biden stormed to a comeback and consolidated the moderate wing of the party.Even Warren's blockbuster debate performance a few weeks ago that brought in tens millions of dollars — and almost singlehandedly crushed the candidacy of Michael Bloomberg — wasn’t enough to revitalize the senator's campaign. She continued to struggle to win over people of color, particularly black voters, as well as moderate and working-class white voters.Warren's departure from the race makes it almost certain that a woman will not be at the top of the ticket — which some Democrats had hoped for after Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss. Tulsi Gabbard is the lone remaining woman running for president, and her campaign has not gained any traction.Asked outside her home what she thought it would be like for women and girls now left deciding between Sanders and Biden, Warren said ""one of the hardest parts of this is all pinky promises, and all those little girls who are gonna have to wait four more years. That's going to be hard.""Arguably, Warren shaped the presidential primary four years ago, as well, with her decision not to run. Though two separate draft movements called on Warren to run for president in 2015 (and dozens of reporters asked her if she would), she declined to do so.Instead, Warren pressured Clinton on policy and personnel, while Sanders ran and captured the hearts of many young progressives. He succeeded beyond everyone's — including his — wildest expectations in 2016, and his ""political revolution"" shifted the discourse about what is possible in US politics. His ascendancy, rather than Warren's, has set the contours of the rising left in American politics.Warren and Sanders, however, go back much further than that. In the 2000s, when Sanders was still a near-pariah in Washington, the pair shared common goals and sometimes appeared together. They share a lot of the same issues and a general attentiveness to structural changes to taxation and regulation in the United States.In 2020, they both ran. Their dual candidacies put at the center of the primary this question: Should the United States move to a single-payer system, if so, how quickly? As the race went on, Warren found herself enmeshed in the horserace bind, appealing to both the kinds of voters who went for Sanders and the ones who went for Pete Buttigieg — but not quite succeeding as a unity candidate, either.After an ascendant summer, it was Warren’s stance on health care that created the first cracks in her campaign, as she struggled to answer questions about whether Medicare for All would increase middle-class taxes. She eventually put forward a plan that would first have the Senate vote on a more moderate public option before pushing for full-fledged single-payer health care.""So if you leave with only one thing you leave with, it must be this,"" Warren told staff on the Thursday call.

"     Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — a rising prospect in national politics who has given Democrats hope in a big Midwest state that Donald Trump flipped in 2016 — is backing Joe Biden for president.Whitmer announced her support Thursday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Biden is expected to campaign Monday in Detroit; it would not be a surprise to see Whitmer by his side there.""I think that the blueprint from 2018 about showing up, focusing on the dinner table issues, and getting things done is exactly what Joe Biden represents,"" said Whitmer, referencing the 2018 Democratic wave that helped sweep her into office, ""and that's why he's got my enthusiastic support and my vote on Tuesday.""Whitmer tweeted after her announcement that she would also be joining the campaign as a cochair. She joins Delaware Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in that role.The endorsement could be a boost for the former vice president in his battle with Sen. Bernie Sanders, who beat Hillary Clinton in Michigan’s primary four years ago. (Sanders endorsed Abdul El-Sayed, a Whitmer rival two years ago.)Michigan’s primary next week will test the coalition Biden has built in the last few days by running up the score with black voters in the South while also winning in the Midwest (Minnesota), Northeast (Massachusetts), and Texas. Whitmer had been under increasing pressure to pick sides, the Detroit Free Press reported Wednesday. A Detroit News/WDIV-TV poll this week found Biden leading Sanders in the state by about 7%.""You all know that politics can change fast,"" Whitmer said on MSNBC. ""A few days can be a lifetime. What we've seen in terms of the ability to coalesce and build a coalition that really has diverse representation — that is reflective of who we are as a party and what we need as a nation — has really started to show that Joe Biden is our strongest candidate going into the fall. I believe that. And I am excited about his candidacy.""Biden campaigned for Whitmer during her 2018 race, which she won convincingly.      Whitmer, 48, has been the subject of vice presidential speculation given her youth, gender, and success in a battleground state. When Detroit hosted the second Democratic presidential debate last summer, she had a featured role as host. And she acknowledged then that candidates were sounding her out and courting her for an endorsement.“I think everyone knows that the path to the White House goes through Michigan and a handful of other states,” Whitmer told BuzzFeed News in an interview at the time.“I really do want to see these candidates show up,” Whitmer added. “I want to see the work that they do — how they react under pressure and what, really, they’re going to be able to do on behalf of the people of Michigan.”On Wednesday she signaled she'll be a visible part of Biden's team.""I am eager to take part in a lot of the national conversation around his campaign because I think we all know Michigan's incredibly important,"" she said on Morning Joe. ""All roads to the White House lead through my state.""Biden has been sweeping up endorsements since his success on Super Tuesday, pulling in support both from backers of former candidates who are now endorsing him and from politicians who have stayed out of the race until now.Michigan’s last Democratic governor, Jennifer Granholm, endorsed Biden on Wednesday.

"     WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday morning in the first major case on abortion rights since President Donald Trump appointed two justices to the court, a case that could threaten the national right to the procedure.As hundreds of protesters gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court, making speeches and yelling pro– and anti–abortion rights slogans at each other, the justices questioned attorneys in the case and focused their questions on precedent and whether laws like the one they are considering should be determined on a state-by-state basis or nationwide.The case at issue examines whether doctors performing abortions in Louisana should be required to have hospital admitting privileges, a requirement that would likely leave only one doctor able to legally perform the procedure in the state. The case also looks more broadly at whether doctors have the ability to file the lawsuit on behalf of their patients.The Louisiana law is nearly identical to one in Texas that the Supreme Court overturned in 2016, a decision that was a major win for abortion rights and helped increase access to the procedure in several states. The main issue at hand Wednesday was whether that precedent applies here, or whether making a different decision in Louisiana would overturn the court’s prior decisions.“This case is about respect for the court’s precedent,” Julie Rikelman, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights who was arguing against the Louisiana law, said at the very start of the hearing Wednesday. “Nothing has changed that would justify this legal about-face.”During the arguments, the court appeared divided. Chief Justice John Roberts — who is expected to be the decisive swing vote — asked the attorneys on both sides of the case repeatedly about whether the court should undertake a state-by-state review, depending on different facts in each state, when examining a law’s restrictions.Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was hearing a major abortion case for the first time in his tenure on the Supreme Court on Wednesday, asked similar questions. Neither justice indicated whether they had made up their minds, but their questioning suggested that the idea of overturning precedent and how broadly it applies will be the determining factor in the court’s decision.The four liberal justices spent much of their time highlighting the precedent the Supreme Court has already set on the issue and questioning attorneys about whether the Louisiana law was actually intended to make abortion safer, or if it was simply passed to make it less accessible. Kavanaugh’s fellow Trump appointee, Neil Gorsuch, and conservative Justice Clarence Thomas both stayed silent throughout the oral arguments.The Supreme Court will likely not issue its opinion in the case, called June Medical Services v. Russo, until late spring.The Louisiana law passed in 2014, and abortion clinics in the state sued over it. Two years later, in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, the Supreme Court struck down the similar law in Texas, which had already gone into effect and caused half of the state’s clinics to close. In the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, the 2016 vote was 5–3 with Roberts dissenting.Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has since retired, agreed with the court’s four more liberal justices in that case: Though the state has a legitimate interest in protecting the health of pregnant people, there was no evidence that admitting privileges actually did anything to help them. Further, there was clear evidence that it made abortion much less accessible.The 2016 decision reaffirmed the idea that it is unconstitutional to place an “undue burden” on access to abortion, a benchmark used by the Supreme Court in every case examining abortion regulations since it was established in the landmark 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld the national right to the procedure.In that case, the court also denied a review of admitting privilege laws in Wisconsin and Mississippi, allowing the laws to be struck down by lower courts. Like those laws, Louisiana’s was modeled on the Texas law overturned in Whole Woman’s Health. A district court found the Louisiana law unconstitutional, stating that, if implemented, it would close two of just three abortion clinics in Louisiana, leaving one doctor who could perform abortions.Then in 2018, in a very unexpected move, the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reversed this decision, letting the law stand. The plaintiffs in the case rushed it to the Supreme Court to request an emergency stay to prevent the law from going into effect in Louisiana. The stay was granted, and the court agreed to take up the case. Roberts, despite having opposed striking down the Texas law, sided with the liberal justices to grant the stay.In its narrowest interpretation, the Supreme Court is looking at whether the 5th Circuit was right in letting the Louisiana law stand. In a broader sense, the court is looking at whether Whole Woman’s Health was correctly decided and whether it applies to the entire country.After the Supreme Court took up the petition, Louisiana’s legal team requested a new question be added to the case: whether June Medical Services and its doctors have the ability to challenge the law on behalf of their patients. This point, called the “third-party standing” question, is a legally complex one that could apply to cases outside of the issue of abortion. Justice Thomas brought it up the issue in his dissent to Whole Woman’s Health and anti-abortion advocates have been pushing it for years.Typically, third parties are not legally allowed to file lawsuits on behalf of other people, but exceptions are made in cases where the plaintiffs have a “close relationship” with the damaged parties, as past Supreme Court cases have put it. The Center for Reproductive Rights argues that this clearly applies to this case because a) the drawn-out process of filing a lawsuit may prevent someone who is pregnant from legally getting the procedure done, and b) there is an extensive precedent of abortion doctors being able to sue on behalf of their patients. This is how the majority of cases challenging laws restricting abortion are filed.Louisiana argued that this “close relationship” standard should not apply to abortion doctors because those doctors usually do not see a single patient more than a couple of times, and because there is a conflict of interest for doctors who are being regulated by the law. The law is intended to protect patients from unqualified doctors, Louisiana’s solicitor general, Elizabeth Murrill, argued in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, letting the doctors sue on the behalf of the people the law is protecting is contrary to that goal.Justice Stephen Breyer, who wrote the opinion striking down Texas’s admitting privileges law in Whole Woman’s Health, asked the attorneys questions Wednesday that served to emphasize the importance of precedent in this case.“How many abortion cases have allowed” third parties to sue on behalf of affected patients in the Supreme Court, Breyer asked Rikelman. “I counted eight,” he said. She agreed.So we would have to overrule eight prior cases? He asked. Rikelman responded that yes, she believes they would.Later he asked Jeffery Wall, an attorney with the US Department of Justice who was arguing on behalf of Louisiana, whether he was suggesting that the Supreme Court should overturn precedent that goes back to the 1800s. Wall, sputtering slightly, denied this.“You just want to go back 40 years then,” Breyer retorted, likely referring to Roe v. Wade.The Louisiana law, called the Louisiana Unsafe Abortion Protection Act, required doctors to have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles of the facility. This means the doctor must be a member of the hospital’s staff and have a granted ability to admit and diagnose patients.Liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg spent most of their questions focused on the true intent of the law — whether Louisiana’s defense that it was to make sure patients seeking abortions were safe in the case of emergency, were true.Ginsburg, especially, focused her questions on the necessity of the law.She asked Murrill, “Do you dispute that first-trimester abortion” is one of the safest medical procedures there is, “even safer than childbirth?” Murill did not give a direct answer.Ginsburg asserted that, in the vast majority of cases in which someone requires hospitalization after an abortion, it is during a medication abortion that they undergo at home. She asked Murill and Wall: If this were the case, wouldn’t it make more sense for them to go to a hospital near their home, rather than one within 30 miles of the abortion clinic as the Louisiana law requires?Wall conceded that the majority of complications happen once the patient is at home, but sometimes they happen at the clinic.Of the conservative justices on the court, Justice Samuel Alito challenged Rikelman the most, asking her about whether there was a conflict of interest for doctors to file this suit. Rikelman denied this. Alito also asked how hard the doctors actually tried to get admitting privileges.Kavanaugh and Roberts seemed to have similar concerns about the case. Kavanaugh asked Rikelman repeatedly whether she thought all admitting privilege laws were unconstitutional, even in states where doctors could easily access admitting privileges. She answered that essentially, yes.Roberts asked a similar question, whether the law should be considered on a state-by-state basis depending on how much it limits access and other facts, or whether it is a nationwide decision, as Whole Woman’s Health was widely interpreted to be. The attorneys arguing on behalf of Louisiana responded that they thought it was a state-by-state consideration; in the case of Louisiana, the law's benefits outweighed its cost.On the steps of the Supreme Court after the hearing, attorneys for the Center for Reproductive Rights both told BuzzFeed News they were hopeful — Rikelman used the term “cautiously optimistic,” and her fellow attorney T.J. Tu, who did not argue in the hearing, said he was “elated.”“I’m feeling great,” Tu said, adding that he was encouraged by the questions from Roberts and Kavanaugh. “We have always argued the case that there should be a broad majority on the court to recognize that there is no difference between this case and the case the Supreme Court decided only four years ago, and it seems like that’s true.”","The Supreme Court Just Heard Its First Major Abortion Case With Trump's Appointees On The Bench

"     Many years ago, in New Hampshire, Amy Klobuchar pulled 19.8% of the vote. Nobody will ever know exactly why that happened, but it seemed like Klobuchar having a good debate less than 24 hours before voting started played a significant role.Having a good debate had never seemed to matter much for Klobuchar before this; if anything, the loop where Klobuchar Had a Good Debate then polls didn't move had become a joke. This good debate just seemed to fall at exactly the right moment, with attendant media coverage.But that kind of sudden shifting reality — press one button over here, see the boom before your eyes over there — is the one we've been living the last 10 days in politics.Joe Biden won South Carolina, which was expected, but in an unexpectedly decisive fashion on the strength of Southern black voters and more moderate Southern white voters. Multiple candidates dropped out and multiple candidates endorsed. A rational choice undergirded that decision — no candidate, including Pete Buttigieg and Klobuchar, can win a Democratic nomination with white voters alone. And Biden won with that exact coalition above in states across the Southeast on Super Tuesday.But within those 72 surreal hours, suddenly, Biden also won exactly — literally — the kinds of voters in Minnesota and Massachusetts and Maine that he failed to win in Iowa and New Hampshire just weeks before.“I saw all these people dropping out and they were all endorsing Biden, and I thought, Biden is the one who can be elected,” one would-be Elizabeth Warren voter in Los Angeles told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday night. “So I did not mail in my ballot. I went to vote today, tore up my ballot, and voted for Biden.”Biden did not campaign in Tennessee, Arkansas, Minnesota, Massachusetts, or Oklahoma. He did not advertise in most of the Super Tuesday states, or if he did, it was at a minor league level. Some more establishment Democrats in those states have told reporters in recent weeks that Biden and his campaign haven't done much to secure their endorsements. Except in one (recent) regard, outlined here by George C. Patton, “Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser,” Biden is not, as a candidate, meaningfully different than he was three weeks ago.Now, he leads Sanders in a two-person race, locked into place by Nevada and South Carolina, compounded by California and the South.Two expected outcomes took us back to where we were, a year ago, seemingly based on what’s happened in the immediate vicinity of people’s minds. The entire thing has the vibe of reaching out with your right hand somewhere offscreen, and tapping your own left shoulder.But that's been the tenor of the year so far. In Iowa, the weekend before the caucuses, as you may recall, Ann Selzer did not release her well-regarded poll due to complaints about irregularities with at least one call. Political media slipped into a full-blown crisis that was weird given that the rumored results didn’t actually look that much different from Selzer's previous polls, which always were (correctly) cool on Biden's performance in a state where many questioned his organization and the populace gets, exclusive to Iowa, an up-close look at the candidates.“The magnitude of the reactions to one poll’s fate raises alarm bells about the way we treat & interpret polls,” wrote Daniel Nichanian of the Appeal.But these kinds of moments all seemed linked up — a good debate, the belief in a sterling pollster, and especially the response to most black South Carolinians’ emphatic support of a single candidate — in one way. People were waiting for someone, anyone to make a decision.","The Surreal Year Where Only The Last 72 Hours Seem To Matter In Politics

"     WASHINGTON — Ten Democrats are calling on the State Department to designate foreign white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups as foreign terrorist organizations.In a new resolution, the House members call on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to add four foreign white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups to the State Departments’s list of 69 foreign terrorist organizations. Along with recognizing victims of white supremacy, the resolution condemns white supremacist extremism as a “global” and “significant threat that is spreading across the United States.” As a resolution, the legislation isn’t binding, but rather expresses the sentiment of the House.Democratic Rep. Max Rose is the lead sponsor and the resolution has nine cosponsors, including Reps. Eliot Engel, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Bennie Thompson, chair of the Homeland Security Committee.“It’s important that when we consider fighting terrorism and preserving national security, that we make sure that we confront the threat of today and tomorrow not just the threats of today and yesterday,” Rose told BuzzFeed News Tuesday during a phone interview.The resolution comes after the Homeland Security Committee unanimously approved Rose’s Transnational White Supremacist Extremism Review Act, a bill that directs the Department of Homeland Security “to develop and disseminate a threat assessment regarding threats to the United States associated with foreign violent white supremacist extremist organizations.”The new resolution calls on the State Department to include specific foreign nationalistic groups in the nation’s foreign terrorist organization list, including the Nordic Resistance Movement of Sweden; the National Action group of the United Kingdom; Blood and Honour, a neo-Nazi group whose militant arm, Combat 18, has been banned in Canada and Germany; and Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi group whose alleged ex-leader was arrested in Texas last week.Rose and more than three dozen lawmakers sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a letter last October inquiring as to why certain white nationalist groups are not considered terrorist groups. The State Department responded by saying that while they’re dedicated to the “appropriate use of its designations authorities,” they do not discuss internal deliberations as it relates to foreign terrorist organizations.While the Patriot Act defines the term domestic terrorism, it is not a federal crime nor does the FBI publish a list of groups they consider to be domestic terrorists. However, the government does have the power to add to its list of foreign terrorist groups and domestic white nationalist groups, financially or otherwise, affiliated with US-designated foreign terrorist groups could face steeper penalties if convicted of a crime.“These domestic neo-Nazi organizations that we’ve been talking about all this time for so long now are not domestic — they are global,” Rose told BuzzFeed News.Last week, during a hearing with the House Homeland Security subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism, FBI officials told members of Congress there’s an ongoing effort to determine global connections between domestic and foreign white terrorist and neo-Nazi groups, including tracking those who train and fund such organizations, but would not elaborate on any ongoing investigations.“They have strong connections with foreign terrorist organizations and we have got to start to identify those foreign terrorist organizations in the same manner that we would identify ISIS and al-Qaida and [go] after their domestic adherents,” Rose told BuzzFeed News.","Democrats Call On The State Department To List White Supremacist Groups As Foreign Terrorist Organizations

"     Michael Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race on Wednesday morning after falling short on Super Tuesday, endorsing Joe Biden.The announcement marked the end of an unconventional campaign that relied on huge amounts of advertising to make Bloomberg a viable candidate. Though Bloomberg's strategy succeeded in making him a serious contender in the Super Tuesday states he competed in, the Democratic establishment's last-minute consolidation around Biden after the former vice president's win in South Carolina and Bloomberg's poor performance in presidential debates combined to doom his campaign.“I’m a believer in using data to inform decisions,"" he said in a statement. ""After yesterday’s results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible — and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists.""“I’ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it,"" he said. ""After yesterday’s vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden.""According to a senior Bloomberg aide, Bloomberg made the decision to drop out on Wednesday morning after a meeting with his senior staff.The aide said that up until Friday, the campaign had believed they were in a three-person race. But the campaign's internal data had shown a dramatic shift toward Biden over the weekend as he won in South Carolina that ended up being reflected in the Super Tuesday results; the shift happened so fast they ""couldn't even model it.""The aide said that the campaign had started to struggle in the week before the Nevada caucuses late last month, as Bloomberg began to take a ""ferocious amount of incoming"" in the form of opposition research and attacks on his record. This, compounded with Bloomberg's poor debate performances, put the campaign in a downswing it didn't have time to recover from before Super Tuesday. A plan for turning Bloomberg's campaign into an organization to help Biden is still being worked out, the aide said.Bloomberg called Biden Wednesday morning and they had a ""good"" conversation, another aide to the former mayor said.Bloomberg had faced increasing pressure to get out of the race after Biden won South Carolina by a commanding margin, emerging as the favorite moderate candidate to take on frontrunner Bernie Sanders.The former mayor spoke on Wednesday afternoon in a ballroom at the Sheraton in Midtown Manhattan, where he held a large “Women for Mike” themed campaign event in January and where he hosted election night rallies in past years during his mayoral campaigns.He thanked supporters and staff, who packed the ballroom shoulder-to-shoulder. He told them “there is no doubt in my mind we would have beat Donald Trump in November.”“But today I am clear-eyed about our overriding objective, which is victory in November,” Bloomberg said. “Staying in would make it more difficult” for Trump to be defeated in November, he said.Referencing his motto “in God we trust, everyone else bring data” (a line that elicited appreciative laughs from the audience), Bloomberg said the results had shown “a viable path to the nomination no longer existed. And I will not be our party’s nominee, but I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my life and I hope you won’t walk away either.”“I’m glad to say I endorse Joe Biden, and I hope you will join me,” he said.Bloomberg built his public reputation as a data-driven wonk who shows little emotion, making it all the more striking that he choked up near the end of his remarks, his voice thick with restrained tears.“Today, I’m sorry we didn’t win, but it’s still the best day of my life and tomorrow’s gonna be even better,” Bloomberg said. He referenced memorizing “The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere” as a child in Massachusetts; “Today I believe that our great nation still sees that light in the Old North Church Tower. The light of freedom, the light of liberty, the light of equality, and the light of opportunity.""After Bloomberg wrapped up, some staffers took pictures with their teams in the ballroom while others filtered out, sporting campaign buttons and t-shirts. Some posed for photos and horsed around outside the ballroom with a cardboard cutout of Bloomberg brought to the event by some staffers from Long Island.His decision to actually end the campaign comes after voting across 15 states and territories on Super Tuesday.Though Bloomberg was not on the ballot in any of the four early states, he had been able to raise his poll numbers significantly in the Super Tuesday states in which he was competing by mounting an aggressive advertising campaign across the country. Bloomberg spent an unprecedented amount during his brief campaign, which only launched in November, months after most other candidates had entered the race. The billionaire former mayor of New York used over $500 million of his own fortune on his campaign, refusing to take donations and hiring an enormous staff.For a time after the Iowa caucuses, which left the party in a state of confusion with no clear winner at first, Bloomberg’s candidacy gained strength as nervous moderate Democrats looked for an alternative to the then-slumping Biden. Bloomberg pitched himself as a competent manager who wasn’t intimidated by Donald Trump and would spend whatever it took to defeat him.But Bloomberg’s decision to participate in primary debates after a DNC rule change allowed him to take part proved fateful; his performance in the debate in Nevada on Feb. 19 was so weak that one poll showed that his favorability numbers had dropped by 20% the next day. Though Bloomberg did better in the second debate he took part in, in South Carolina, the debates showed that even his large, slick advertising campaign couldn’t hide his weaknesses as a candidate.Bloomberg’s record as mayor and as a business executive came under intense scrutiny as he became a more serious candidate; most notably, his record on stop-and-frisk and the history of allegations of sexism at his company became issues in the campaign. Bloomberg’s rivals effectively used these issues against him, particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who memorably challenged Bloomberg on the debate stage on nondisclosure agreements signed by women who had made accusations at his company.Since the beginning of his run, Bloomberg had promised to continue to use his campaign infrastructure and money to support whoever the Democratic nominee is. However, Bloomberg qualified this somewhat over the last week of his campaign as Sanders’ campaign said it didn’t want his money; he told the Houston Chronicle that he wouldn’t support Sanders if the senator's team didn’t want the support.","Michael Bloomberg's Presidential Campaign Is Over

"     WASHINGTON — Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar fended off a primary challenge from Jessica Cisneros, a 26-year-old immigration attorney, in Texas’s 28th district, in a defeat for the progressive movement.The Super Tuesday primary was tight; Decision Desk HQ ultimately called the race with Cuellar leading Cisneros, 52% to 48%.Cisneros officially conceded Wednesday morning, saying in a statement, “This is just the beginning. The first thing we had to defeat was the culture of fear — and our movement was victorious in proving we're within striking distance of bringing fundamental change to South Texas.”Cisneros was backed by Justice Democrats, the progressive group that helped propel Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to victory two years ago. She was the first candidate the group recruited and endorsed this cycle.Cuellar is one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in the House and had held the seat since 2005. He also maintains an A rating from the National Rifle Association, and Cisneros and her allies coined him “Trump’s favorite Democrat” after Cuellar voted with the president nearly 70% of the time during Trump’s first two years in office.Cisneros worked as an intern in Cuellar’s office in 2014 before deciding to launch a campaign to unseat him last summer.Cisneros spoke Tuesday night before the race was officially called, telling supporters, “I think one thing is clear, that our movement was victorious tonight... That’s because this fight has always been about an opportunity to prove how one of us, a brown girl from our community, with her whole community behind her, could take on an entire machine.”Ahead of a planned interview with Cuellar last week, Colin Strother, a spokesperson for the campaign, said Cuellar would not answer any questions framed as responses to attacks Cisneros made on him during the primary.“We’re not allowing a 26-year-old young lady who’s never done anything question the character of a dedicated public servant,” Strother said. (The campaign then canceled the interview half an hour before it was supposed to happen.)      In addition to Justice Democrats, Cisneros had the support of Ocasio-Cortez and presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.“Primary challengers rarely win, so it’s always a long shot,” Justice Democrats spokesperson Waleed Shahid told BuzzFeed News last week. “That’s why AOC and [Rep.] Ayanna [Pressley] winning was a big deal. But I think we’ve run a really great campaign and I think [Cisneros] can win. The world completely changed after AOC’s victory.”In the weeks leading up to Election Day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi traveled to the district to fundraise for Cuellar, and a PAC founded and funded by the libertarian super-donor Charles Koch spent $34,000 in support of Cuellar in the last days of the race.Cuellar’s victory represents a disappointing loss for the progressive movement. While the district is a fairly safe Democratic seat, it’s more conservative than Ocasio-Cortez’s New York seat. Cisneros supports Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and progressive immigration reform.“[Primary challengers are] outspent, and by all the traditional metrics we're not quote-unquote supposed to win,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters Monday evening. “So if she's able to pull this off tomorrow, I think it will be profoundly energizing.”Cisneros would have the youngest woman ever to serve in the House, Ocasio-Cortez noted. “I, for one, could not think of a better way to be the shortest-lived youngest woman in Congress, and I would absolutely be thrilled to hand that off to her tomorrow,” she said.Ocasio-Cortez also said this week she doesn’t think Cisneros’s loss is bad news for other primary challengers across the country.“Each one of these races come down to such individual characteristics. It's about the incumbent, it's about the challenger, and it's about the actual community,” she said. “Jessica Cisneros is very different from Marie Newman [in Illinois], is very different from a Georgette Gomez [in California], for example, but that they all fight for the same values, but all of these are kind of down to the individual communities that they're advocating for and how they do it.”Cisneros told BuzzFeed News last week that winning wasn’t her only metric of victory and that she’s proud to have led a team mostly made up of women and people under 30.“For us, yes, obviously the victory is going to be winning on March 3, but I think the larger victory is training ourselves here in South Texas to organize,” she said. “For me, the victory is going to be that we've invested in the infrastructure, and to build a movement down here in South Texas, and that it's not just going to rally around candidates but around issues.""","One Of The Last Anti-Abortion Democrats In Congress Defeated A Progressive Challenger Backed By Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

They talked to BuzzFeed News about how they arrived at their choice, telling part of the story of the Democratic primary's sudden turn.Carla Taravella, 52, had decided she was voting for Pete Buttigieg, until he dropped out and endorsed Biden on Monday.“It was very close between the two, I was back and forth,” she said. Buttigieg’s endorsement helped, but Biden was always her number two choice, because she likes his demeanor and his experience in politics.Debbie Mars, 63, said she’s been behind Biden since he announced, because of his “kindness and civility.”Mars, who is black, said Biden was the candidate who came across as the most genuinely invested in black communities, a view that helped Biden to a blowout win in South Carolina this past weekend.“As a very proud African American, many of us are very offended at being the flavor of the week. Many of the candidates are bubbling up, ‘We need the black vote; we need the black vote.’ And it makes us feel very much token. This is a very organic thing with Joe,” she said.She looked at Biden’s track record as “a solid policymaker, decision-maker,” she said, adding that she’s not worried about the fact that he’s 77 years old and criticisms over his occasional verbal mishaps because “politics is a machine anyway — he’s going to have plenty of people around him to keep him on the straight and narrow.”      After embracing Biden as their candidate, the women turned to an animated discussion about whom, if he’s the nominee, Biden should pick as his running mate to give him the best chance of beating President Donald Trump and governing successfully.“If you really want to bring everybody together and get Trump out, what if you had a Biden — Bernie ticket?” said Taravella.“That’s never going to happen! That’s 140 years of wisdom between them, that’s too much. That’s too much!” said Mars, as everyone in the group burst out laughing.“I would like Kamala. I would love her,” said Badon, referring to Sen. Kamala Harris, who ran for president until late last year.Mars said she was turned off by Harris’s aggressive approach during some of the primary debates. She was more interested in Beto O’Rourke, another former candidate who endorsed Biden this week, as a potential VP.“Honestly, as an African American woman, my first love would have been to support an African American woman. But the way she came across so hostile during the debates, it was a turn off for me. She pulled a Hillary,” she said. “When Hillary first went against Barack back in the day, Hillary was so condescending, and just a pit bull. It turned me off and I immediately went to Barack’s camp.”For Badon, that trait of Harris’s was the whole reason she was drawn to her in the first place — “I love that about her,” she said. “But unfortunately, like with Hillary, America does not like strong women. So you’ve got to look on the ticket, who would be the most electable.”But the women agreed that they would love to see Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia governor candidate, on the ticket.Taravella added that she would like to see Michelle Obama take on the VP role.“Michelle would run for president, okay,” said Mars.“Trump would just keel over, right,” said Taravella.And as for Buttigieg, the man Taravella had hoped would be the nominee — if he’s not vice president, “I would like to see him as DNC chair after everything that happened in Iowa.”“I don’t think the country is ready for him, it’s unfortunate. We’ve got a lot of people that are closeted in the Senate, trust, but I don’t think the good old boys are going to let that happen,” Mars said.With Sanders and Biden emerging out of Super Tuesday still seemingly locked in a tight contest, they all said they would ultimately, if begrudgingly, support Sanders if he ends up being the nominee against Trump. They’re just concerned that Sanders supporters, if the situation is reversed, wouldn’t support Biden.“Something I really do believe, I don’t even want to put in the atmosphere that Joe doesn’t get it, but if he does not, the Democrats have to come together, the game’s over,” said Mars.But, Taravella said, to agreement from the group, it would be a less energetic kind of support.“If Bernie wins, I’m not jumping in with any money, I’m not volunteering. I’ll vote for him, but I don't think he’s going to be a two-term president,” she said.","Why Did Joe Biden Do So Well On Super Tuesday? These Voters Explain.

"     LOS ANGELES — Before the polls closed in California on Super Tuesday, and possibly days before the full results from the two largest states would be known, Joe Biden took the stage in front of an enthusiastic crowd to say he might have defeated Sen. Bernie Sanders.“They told us when we got to Super Tuesday, it’d be over. Well, it may be over for the other guy!” he said to roars of approval in Los Angeles.“We are very much alive,” he shouted.Biden soon settled into an abridged version of the updated stump speech he’s been giving since his resounding win in South Carolina. In contrast to the long evenings he'd spent over the past 10 months sticking around to shake every hand and grasp every shoulder in relatively small crowds at his events, he stuck around to talk to many people Tuesday night but left dozens still clamoring to meet him as he wrapped up.Not long after Biden left the stage, California’s polls closed and the Associated Press immediately called the state — the biggest Super Tuesday prize — for Sanders. Biden, though, had the kind of night that was unthinkable for him three weeks ago, when he bailed out of New Hampshire hours before results would place him a distant fifth and raise doubts his campaign would last the day.North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Oklahoma all fell into the Biden column Tuesday. So did Minnesota, where he received a late assist from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who suspended her campaign Monday and quickly endorsed his. And in Massachusetts, he beat both Sanders and the state’s senior senator, Elizabeth Warren, in a total surprise.Early Wednesday morning, Biden officially won Texas, the second-largest state on the map on Tuesday, and a state that Sanders badly hoped to win himself.Biden’s confidence, already on the upswing since South Carolina, was reinforced. After months when he could do no right, for the next 72 hours it seemed like Biden could do no wrong. In the days between primaries, he had scored endorsements from Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, another recent dropout, and from another former rival, former Texas representative Beto O’Rourke.Aides to the former vice president could hardly contain themselves on Twitter. It was a somewhat ironic home run trot — over the first 10 months of his campaign, they often trashed the social media platform and wound up on the receiving end of its users’ endless criticism and attacks. The real conversation wasn’t happening there — the real voters weren’t there, this logic went, and so the campaign would not be fooled into fighting its battles or getting too distracted there.But there Biden’s team was Tuesday night, tapping out #Joementum as fast as their fingers could. And, just before 9:30 p.m. ET, the candidate's Twitter account dropped an eight-second meme saturated in swagger.“I ain’t dead,” the 77-year-old Biden, says — in footage from his interview for a New York Times endorsement he didn’t receive. “And I’m not gonna die.”      An animated pair of aviators then drops over Biden’s eyes as the guitar riff and primal screeches of the Who’s “Won’t Get Fooled Again” plays and the image fades to black and white.Before South Carolina, Super Tuesday stood as a prime opportunity for Sanders to skate out to a large delegate lead. Biden’s distant fourth-, fifth-, and second-place finishes in the first three contests had given rise to Michael Bloomberg’s self-funded candidacy and speculation that the race would soon be the democratic socialist Sanders versus the billionaire Bloomberg.Suddenly, though, it’s Sanders who’s facing questions about whether he can grow a coalition capable of winning the Democratic nomination. And Bloomberg barely made a dent on Tuesday despite spending more than $500 million on his late-entry campaign.A fuller account of how close Biden and Sanders are in the race for convention delegates was not clear late into Tuesday. The as-yet-unknown delegate splits out of California and Texas will offer a better picture of where things stand. But Biden’s team started talking like winners early in the day — another change of direction from staffers who have spent the previous two months leading up to voting days and debates playing down expectations.And though the Twitter chest-thumping is not new to the Biden camp, it’s been more pronounced — and more self-congratulatory — since South Carolina. Biden staffers have taken aim at reporters who chronicled the campaign’s early struggles.“‘will Joe even make it to Super Tuesday’ - pundits,” one posted Tuesday night on Twitter.Greg Schultz, Biden’s campaign manager, expressed validation after a rough stretch that saw Anita Dunn, a top Biden adviser, elevated to a higher position of authority after the candidate’s weak showing in the Iowa caucuses.“Nice to get some recognition that @JoeBiden campaign has had an actual delegate STRATEGY for ten months,” Schultz tweeted Tuesday as results came in. “That is one of the reasons why we will be outspent by factors of 10 today on tv and still do really well tonight.”Schultz returned to Twitter a bit later to retweet the new meme.“Make a plan + stick to it + build a team + remain focused = #Joementum,” he wrote.","Joe Biden And His Campaign Had An Absolute Blast On Super Tuesday

"     WASHINGTON — Former attorney general Jeff Sessions moved one step closer to reclaiming his old Senate seat Tuesday night despite a lack of support from his former boss, President Donald Trump.Sessions came in second in the Republican primary for the Alabama Senate seat, but he earned a spot in a runoff election on March 31. Decision Desk HQ called the race with former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville narrowly beating Sessions in Tuesday's election, 33-32%. The two Republicans will face each other in the runoff to determine who will challenge Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in the general election.The outcome of the November general will be key to Democrats’ attempts to regaining the majority in the Senate, making this a key race to watch. Jones’ loss would make it difficult for Democrats to overcome Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s stronghold over the Republican-led Senate.Tuesday’s Republican primary was crowded. In addition to Tuberville, Sessions faced Rep. Bradley Byrne, Roy Moore — the former judge accused of child molestation — and three other candidates. According to Alabama law, primary candidates who win with less than 50% of the vote automatically enter a runoff election against the runner-up before advancing to the general election.Sessions held the Alabama Senate seat for two decades before Trump tapped him to serve as US attorney general. Trump forced him to resign in 2018, a year after he recused himself from the Russia investigation that led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel. Since then, the president has lashed out against Sessions, saying he regrets choosing him as the nation’s top attorney.Tuberville coached football at Auburn University from 1999 to 2008. He has been dubbed a carpetbagger by opponents for switching residencies from Florida to Alabama in 2018 to run for governor before running for Senate in 2020.Trump holds a 60% approval rating in the deep red state but didn’t endorse in the race, leading the other Republicans to criticize Sessions’ fraught relationship with the president while cozying up to Trump themselves.The winner of the runoff will face Jones, a Democrat who won the historically Republican seat in a November 2017 special election. But first, Republican voters in Alabama will have to contend with what’s sure to come in the following three weeks — a bevy of campaign stunts from both candidates aligning themselves with the president and trying hard to point out where their opponents have broken with Trump.In the days leading up to the election, the top Republican candidates bombarded Alabama television with attack ads. Byrne — who’s expected to place third and will not qualify for the runoff — targeted the incumbent in a statewide “Fire Doug Jones” tour. The first-term Democratic senator faces a tough reelection race after upsetting Moore nearly three years ago.Some Republican lawmakers had picked a side in the primary. Rep. Liz Cheney, a member of House Republican leadership and daughter of the former vice president, tweeting her endorsement of Byrne last week. Sen. Kevin Cramer, who served in the House of Representatives before moving over to the Senate in 2019, donated $10,000 to Byrne after he encouraged him to run, long before Sessions entered the race.“I really think the world of him,” Cramer told BuzzFeed News of Byrne. “I think he’s great and a good member.” He added that he hadn't expected Sessions’ last-minute entry into the race.Outgoing Rep. Martha Roby of Alabama was less inclined to weigh in.When asked if she was pushing for either candidate in the primary last week, Roby told BuzzFeed News simply, “I’m not.”","Jeff Sessions Is One Step Closer To Winning His Old Senate Seat Back

"     WEST PALM BEACH, Florida — Michael Bloomberg’s return on investment turned out to be very small.A late entry to the presidential race, Bloomberg skipped the first four early states and constructed his entire strategy around winning big on Super Tuesday, spending over $500 million to put himself into contention during those contests. But it didn’t pay off; his rival Joe Biden surged, and Bloomberg’s status in the race looks uncertain after Tuesday.Despite the disappointing results and increasing pressure on him to drop out, the billionaire former mayor did not tell the audience here on Tuesday night that he would leave the race. He spent the day campaigning in Florida, which votes on March 17. Bloomberg was introduced by supporter Judy Sheindlin, the eponymous host of Judge Judy, and he spoke to a large ballroom audience in a convention center.“If I’m the nominee, let me make you this promise: We will beat Donald Trump here in Florida and in swing states around the country,” Bloomberg said. “Tonight, the polls are still open in a number of Super Tuesday states. And as the results come in, here’s what is clear: No matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one thought was possible. In just three months, we’ve gone from 1% in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination for president.”Though Bloomberg’s campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, told reporters earlier in the day that the candidate would “absolutely not” drop out on Tuesday, he also said the campaign would reassess based on the results. “I think you make an assessment in any campaign like this after every time there's a vote,” Sheekey said.Sheekey left the door open to the idea that Super Tuesday could show that Bloomberg would not win the nomination. “We will find out how well he does tonight,” Sheekey said. “We will find out whether Mike Bloomberg is on his way to becoming the candidate, or we will find out that Mike Bloomberg is going to be the most important person to whomever that candidate will be.”And after Bloomberg’s event, Sheekey put out a statement that didn’t say he was dropping out but also did not definitively say he would fight on. In the statement, Sheekey said, “We’ve built a nationwide coalition focused on building a better future for America, and that starts with defeating Donald Trump in November.” He pointed out that “only” one-third of delegates are awarded on Super Tuesday. But Sheekey also emphasized: ""Our number one priority remains defeating Donald Trump in November.""Earlier this week, Bloomberg’s campaign announced events in Michigan and Florida following Super Tuesday. The campaign returned to New York on Tuesday night and has no public events scheduled for Wednesday.Bloomberg strong-armed his way into the Democratic primary with an unprecedentedly massive ad spending campaign that raised his profile nationally. For a while, this boosted his poll numbers enough that he looked like a serious threat to capture the anti–Bernie Sanders vote.But several factors converged to make everything go wrong for Bloomberg on Tuesday. His shaky performances on the debate stage shattered the carefully constructed image conveyed in his advertising, and Biden’s win in South Carolina gave the former vice president a surge at exactly the right time for Super Tuesday. Biden’s victory injected energy into his formerly moribund campaign and convinced fellow moderates Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg to drop out of the race and endorse him, consolidating against Sanders.This cued wavering voters — many of whom are more focused on beating Trump than supporting any particular candidate — to go with Biden instead of Bloomberg. And it quickly became clear how tentative the former New York City mayor's support had been when news outlets called first Virginia and then North Carolina for Biden within seconds of polls closing, indicating that the former vice president had won by large margins. Biden also won other states into which Bloomberg poured huge amounts of resources, like Oklahoma and Tennessee.Bloomberg did win American Samoa. As of Wednesday morning he is a distant third in the delegate-rich states of Texas and California, but at least with a chance of getting delegates out of each.He spent Tuesday insisting he would stay in the race, becoming irritated with reporters who pressed him about whether he would do like other moderate candidates and drop out to endorse Biden in order to stop Sanders. The former mayor admitted that his only path to the nomination was through a contested convention.And on Tuesday night, voters at his West Palm Beach event said they hoped he would fight on.“I just hope he takes it all the way to the convention,” said Jean Belizaire, 52. “Biden’s a great guy, but he’s missing something. I don’t think he’s the strongest candidate.”“Hopefully he’ll do better in the other states,” said Susanna Scavazzon, 47.“I’ll still vote for him,” said Amy Bissinger, 39. “Delegate-wise, we still have wiggle room. We’re still waiting on California and Texas.”“He is in the top three, thank god,” said Deborah Kinniry, 64. “I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that he said he was running so late. I’m hoping somehow he can change that around.”","Michael Bloomberg Did Not Have A Super Tuesday

"     The average age of a United States senator is 62.9 years old, with five senators over the age of 80, and despite being at heightened risk of coronavirus because of their jobs and demographic profile, senators insist they will not need to shut down Congress in the event of a pandemic.The Senate is sometimes jokingly described as the world’s greatest retirement home. But the advanced age of so many federal politicians is also a major vulnerability. Most people who contract coronavirus will have mild symptoms or none at all, but the people at most acute risk are those age 65 and older. Almost half of the Senate — 48 out of 100 senators — are 65 or older.Every week, senators and members of the House travel between their homes all across the country, where they interact with constituents, and Washington, DC, where they all congregate in the same rooms.Despite this, senators insist they do not see Congress being shut down due to the coronavirus outbreak. Several told BuzzFeed News they are not planning to do their jobs any differently. “We’re going to continue to live our lives and do our jobs. We’re just going to probably wash our hands twice as much,” said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said he plans to continue holding town halls and community meetings, even if he has to wear a face mask. But he agrees that it is likely only a matter of time before coronavirus hits Congress.“I fully anticipate that folks here will end up with it. We just do too much travel,” said Tester. But he rejects the idea of shutting down Congress, saying the legislative branch becoming “paralyzed” could do more damage than good. “I think if you start doing that kind of stuff then what, are we going to shut down the elections? I think it would set a poor precedent.”A study of 70,000 Chinese patients with coronavirus put the mortality rate at around 2%. But that rate rose to 8% for people in their seventies and up to 15% for people age 80 and over.As of yet there are no formal plans for how Congress will respond to the risk of coronavirus, but congressional leaders are meeting Wednesday to discuss it. Thousands of visitors walk through the halls of Congress every day. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said his staff is reviewing policies on how to protect the health of politicians and visitors, but that he won’t comment on hypothetical scenarios.Senators were unanimously confident in Congress’s ability to weather a potential outbreak.“Speaking for the octogenarians that are here, most of us are pretty fit,” said Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts, who is 83.Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, a doctor, said that most members of Congress lead an active lifestyle, which would put them at lower risk of suffering life-threatening effects of the virus. He said the key thing to look at is underlying health, not age. “Given that most folks who work here live fairly active lifestyles, I think we should not overstate the need for concern,” he said.When a reporter responded that at least two senators had recently undergone cancer treatment, Cassidy said individuals may get specific precautions from their doctors.","Senators Insist They Will Be Fine During A Coronavirus Outbreak And Won’t Need To Shut Down Congress

"     ABOARD THE ACELA — It was the morning of Super Tuesday, and I was sitting in the first-class car of the Amtrak Acela Express (got a free upgrade) to Washington DC when I accidentally got cream cheese all over my laptop.When I tried to get up to grab a napkin to circumvent catastrophe, a man in a crisp, sky-blue button-down was blocking my way to the bathroom, standing in the aisle, holding a seat for support, talking to a fan.It was, of course, Andrew Yang.After some encouragement from my editors, I decided to talk to the former Democratic presidential candidate, who just a few weeks out of the race is now a regular on CNN. Turns out he was game, and happy to gossip about the race and his own future.“You know, we’re looking at it,” he said when I asked if he’s thinking about running for mayor of New York City.“Joe’s team reached out to me yesterday,” he said when I asked if he’s facing pressure to back Joe Biden. “At this point, I consider Joe a friend.”Yang was on his way to DC to spend much of the night on a panel of pundits for CNN’s Super Tuesday show and seemed generally amped for what was coming in the next few hours.“I’m really excited to see how the voting unfolds in the Super Tuesday states today,” Yang told me, speaking quietly so as not to disturb the other train passengers (or so they wouldn’t eavesdrop).“Today the biggest question is how much of the support that was going to Pete [Buttigieg] and Amy [Klobuchar] and Tom [Steyer] heads to Joe or Bernie [Sanders] or Elizabeth Warren or [Michael] Bloomberg,” he said. “And then the big question is what decision Bloomberg makes depending on how today goes.”Buttigieg dropped out of the race Sunday and Klobuchar threw in the towel Monday. Both quickly endorsed Biden in an attempt to unite moderate Democrats against Sanders, appearing alongside the former vice president at separate events Monday, urging their supporters to turn to Biden.Yang told me that since dropping out of the race, he has been in touch with many of his former competitors for the Democratic nomination, especially in recent days. He reached out to Buttigieg and Klobuchar via text, but only Buttigieg responded.“I just told Pete that he should be really proud of the race he ran,” Yang said, adding that Buttigieg was likely about to go before cameras with Biden as they were texting. “It’s hard when you end, you know, it’s a lot of mixed emotions, so I wanted to try and raise the positive set of responses. It’s very disappointing for a lot of people when you decide to suspend.”Buttigieg sent him “a nice note back,” he said.“And I actually just got off the phone with Tom, we were comparing notes on post-campaign life,” Yang told me, referring to hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, who only dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination this past weekend. “We ended up talking about the race a fair amount. … The field is shrinking very quickly and I think that’s a good thing for the process and the party.”When I asked if anyone was pushing him to endorse Biden, Yang told me yes: Biden. Biden’s team called him on Monday, he said, but he hasn’t yet “had a chance to talk to Joe."" But this isn’t unusual, Yang explained; his staff and Biden’s talk all the time. However, this doesn’t mean he’s ready to endorse Biden for president.“I don’t have any plans to endorse as of this moment, but something could change at any moment, my phone could ring at any moment,” Yang said.And his phone did ring, frequently. He spent most of the train ride he wasn’t talking to me pacing back and forth on his phone next to the train bathrooms, out of earshot.“I’ve been clear from the get-go that if someone were to champion a universal basic income in their campaign, it would go a long way” toward getting his endorsement, he said. Yang named Warren and Bloomberg as the two candidates who have taken his suggestion most seriously, saying that Warren read his book and publicly stated that basic income was an “option to consider,” while Bloomberg’s team has been “looking at it very actively,” Yang said.Speaking of Bloomberg, I posited, there have been reports that the former mayor of New York and current billionaire tried to get Yang’s support by floating the vice presidency as an option. In response, Yang smiled, laughed, and gave me a look, but said he could not comment specifically on whether Bloomberg had asked him.“I’ve gotten outreach from people who have suggested that [joining a ticket as vice president] is a consideration,” Yang said. “It’s flattering to be considered as someone’s running mate and everyone also knows I wanna do what I can to make Donald Trump a one-term president.”(Shortly after we spoke, Yang tweeted “I have a feeling it might be a tough day for the Bloomberg campaign.”)However, Yang’s team has also been looking into running for the office Bloomberg used to occupy.“You know, we’re looking at it,” Yang said of running for mayor in New York City’s elections next year, crossing his legs to reveal socks with comedian Ronny Chieng’s face on them.“One of the things I’m most curious about is who are the other candidates in the race, and what the race would look like,” he said. “Because I tend to want to do something where I feel like I’m gonna have a big impact and add a lot of value, so if there’s someone who’s already running who would have a positive agenda that’s very aligned with mine — I’m not someone who is just driven by maximum political advantage. I wanna see how much value I can add.”Just then CNN’s Van Jones walked over, telling me he would have to “bug” Yang in a few moments, to prepare for the Super Tuesday show that evening.“We’ll see!” he said, before we thanked each other and I went back to my seat to finish my bagel. As he got off the train, he donned a navy blue hoodie, putting the hood up to cover his face.

"     Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg still refuses to give up countless emails from more than a dozen of his top city staffers during his term as mayor of New York City that were hosted on private Bloomberg.net servers — despite years of requests by the current mayoral administration — according to nearly three years of records obtained by BuzzFeed News and interviews with current New York City officials.“Bloomberg LP still needs to turn over the emails,” Freddi Goldstein, press secretary for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, recently told BuzzFeed News about the billionaire’s company. “There is a responsibility to the public to turn over these records.”While it’s been known Bloomberg used private servers during his 12-year term as mayor, a practice allowed under city rules, dozens of pages of records obtained by BuzzFeed News under the state disclosure law and interviews shed light on how the city spent recent years attempting to get Bloomberg’s staff’s emails and its exasperation at getting stonewalled.The discourse from spring 2016 to fall 2018 shows the city’s Law Department began pressing Bloomberg LP to disclose emails from Bloomberg and his staff in April 2016. The requests began one month after the New York Daily News reported none of Bloomberg’s email had been made public.The issue had been percolating since the year Bloomberg left office. In 2013, Gawker reported that Bloomberg and former first deputy mayor Patti Harris “use @bloomberg.net email addresses to prevent their conversation from becoming public documents.”Bloomberg did eventually hand over thousands of his emails, but only emails in which he was personally the sender or recipient.The City, which covers New York City Hall, reported in December that Bloomberg had sent 1,590 emails from his private server during his time as mayor; those were given to the Department of Records and Information Services in 2017.However, the records obtained by BuzzFeed show at least 15 members of the former mayor’s staff, including deputy mayors and top policy advisers, were also “significant users of Bloomberg.net while they were in the Mayor’s Office,” according to a May 2016 email from the NYC Law Department to Bloomberg LP’s Tom Golden.Officials in the de Blasio administration told BuzzFeed News in February that none of the emails from those 15 individuals were ever disclosed, except in cases where Bloomberg himself was the sender or recipient.The New York City Charter says that documents of “historical, research, cultural or other important value shall be transferred to the municipal archives for permanent custody.”Stu Loeser, a spokesperson for the Bloomberg 2020 presidential campaign, did not answer questions from BuzzFeed News about why the records on Bloomberg.net from those 15 staffers were not disclosed to the city. In an email, he noted that the staffers also had accounts hosted by NYC.gov, operated by the city, which were handed over for the city’s archives.“Bloomberg LP provided to the City hundreds of thousands of bloomberg.net emails between the Mayor and his staffers regarding City business,” Loeser said. “The fact that some staffer used their terminals to message each other on non-City matters is no different than colleagues sending gmails to each other, which happens in every workplace.”BuzzFeed News asked Loeser if he was suggesting the 15 staffers only used the Bloomberg.net accounts for nonwork communications with each other — which would be remarkable, since other records reveal that they used those private accounts for government business with the mayor. Loeser did not answer the question.BuzzFeed News also reached out to Bloomberg LP and its law firm that handled the email matter, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, but did not hear back.The records obtained by BuzzFeed News indicate Bloomberg LP slow-walked discussions about the records, including canceling a meeting at the last moment and missing a phone call entirely. City officials said they kept up phone calls to Bloomberg into 2019, but were ignored and finally gave up.“If you keep calling, after a certain period of time and no one is returning your calls or responding to your emails, you know, there's other business to tend to, and it was clearly becoming fruitless effort,” an official in the New York City mayor's office told BuzzFeed News.“I don’t think they really cared,” the official continued. “Their nonresponsiveness kind of tells you everything you need to know.”In one email, sent at 10:30 a.m. on a Thursday in September 2016, Bloomberg LP lawyer Tom Golden told the city’s Law Department, “I suggest we cancel this afternoon's call; no new information on my end.”Golden had also missed one of the calls with the Law Department entirely that June. “Sorry got tied up,” Golden wrote the same day as missing the scheduled call, “tried to send a meeting cancellation but probably did it incorrectly.”In response, an official in the Law Department said, “It looks like you weren't able to make the call....Maybe we could touch base next week and return to our biweekly schedule.”Bloomberg’s campaign did not answer a question from BuzzFeed News about why Bloomberg’s staff had not allowed city officials to review the emails from those 15 staffers to decide whether they merited preservation.The 15 Bloomberg administration staffers identified as “significant users” of the Bloomberg.net server, according to the city’s records, are as follows: Michael Best, deputy counsel to the mayor; Anthony Crowell, director of operations and counselor to the mayor; Daniel Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development; John Feinblatt, chief adviser to the mayor for policy; Shea Fink, scheduler; Patricia Harris, first deputy mayor; Vincent La Padula, senior adviser; Robert Lieber, deputy mayor for economic development; Kim Molstre, deputy mayoral aide; Kevin Sheekey, deputy mayor for government affairs; Edward Skyler, communications director and deputy mayor for operations; Nanette Smith, mayoral aide; Robert Steel, deputy mayor for economic development; Dennis Walcott, deputy mayor for education; and Howard Wolfson, deputy mayor.Those officials could have been discussing any number of current events, de Blasio’s office official said.“They're the people making the city run,” the official said. “I can tell you that staffers at that level are discussing everything from a snowstorm to major policy announcements.”","Michael Bloomberg’s Top Mayoral Staff Used A Private Email Server And He Still Won’t Release Their Emails

"     At least two US senators intend to probe Clearview AI, the secretive facial recognition startup that’s compiled a database of billions of photos scraped from Facebook, Instagram, and other websites, about the sale of its technology to countries with documented human rights abuses.On Tuesday, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts sent a letter to the company questioning the sharing of its facial recognition software with countries including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, following reporting from BuzzFeed News. Last week BuzzFeed News reported that Clearview documents indicate that more than 2,200 private and public organizations around the world, including the FBI, Macy’s, and law enforcement agencies in 27 different counties, have tried its technology, which matches a photo of someone’s face to existing pictures of them on the web.Markey, who also sent a letter to Clearview in January following stories in the New York Times and BuzzFeed News, called responses to that initial inquiry “unacceptable.” He sent a second letter on Tuesday, noting that the company is unique from other facial recognition firms because “it scrapes billions of photos from social media sites rather than using relatively limited sets of photos from existing government databases.”      “Recent reports about Clearview potentially selling its technology to authoritarian regimes raise a number of concerns because you would risk enabling foreign governments to conduct mass surveillance and suppress their citizens,” he wrote.Markey’s letter comes on a day when a representative for Clearview is also expected to meet with Sen. Ron Wyden’s office to discuss the use of its technology and its rapid expansion. A spokesperson for Wyden’s office said that Clearview CEO Hoan Ton-That had been expected to attend but pulled out the night before. This is the third time the executive has asked to reschedule.A Clearview spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about Markey’s letters or the company’s meeting with Wyden’s office.Since unveiling some of the details around its facial recognition software earlier this year, Clearview AI has drawn scrutiny for its claims about the accuracy of its technology and the entities with which it works. While Ton-That has maintained in media interviews that his company is focused on working with law enforcement agencies in the US and Canada, BuzzFeed News’ reporting last week showed the company is looking to expand in sectors including retail, real estate, and banking, and markets from Brazil to the Middle East.Of particular interest to Markey and Wyden is Clearview’s work in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. According to company documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News, the startup had provided free trials to various government-related agencies there. Those same documents showed that UAE’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company, had run searches using the facial recognition tech, as had the Ministry of Interior’s Child Protection Center in Abu Dhabi.In Saudi Arabia, Clearview documents show the company gave access to the Thakaa Center, also known as the AI Center of Advanced Studies, a Riyadh-based research center whose clients include Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Investment. News outlets have documented numerous human rights violations in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, where, for example, there are laws that discriminate against LGBTQ individuals.In a Jan. 31 letter written in reply to an early inquiry from Markey, Clearview lawyer Tor Ekeland made no mention of the company’s private industry or international clients, describing its software as a “critical law enforcement tool.” In the letter, Ekeland noted that Clearview had not been aware of any abuses of the tool and noted that “all the harm is speculative.”“Clearview is committed to keeping it that way, and working with you to ensure that the use of biometrics in law enforcement strikes the proper balance between protecting our communities and our constitutional rights,” he wrote.On Tuesday, Markey called that four-paragraph letter from Clearview “unacceptable” and sent another inquiry. In it, he asked if the company could guarantee that its technology would not enable human rights abuses and inquired about what steps, if any, had been taken to ensure that Clearview was in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).He also asked a question about the company’s plans to work on live facial recognition with surveillance cameras and augmented reality glasses. “If so, will Clearview commit to halting all such integration given the grave privacy and civil liberty risks this would pose to the public?” he asked.In a statement, Wyden said Clearview's offering of its product to ""a Saudi regime that is responsible for horrifying human rights abuses"" was ""deeply troubling.""""This company has repeatedly misrepresented its product to the public, shown a troubling disregard for basic security practices and now appears willing to offer its technology to autocratic regimes as well,"" he said. ""Congress needs to consider whether U.S. companies should be able to export this kind of powerful surveillance technology to nations where it will likely be used to punish dissent and enable repression.”      ","Senators Are Probing Clearview AI On The Use Of Facial Recognition By Gulf States And International Markets

"     MIAMI — Michael Bloomberg acknowledged Tuesday that his only path to the nomination is through a contested convention but insisted that he was staying in the race.During a testy exchange with the press corps following him while he campaigns in Florida, Bloomberg said he was “in it to win it” and rejected the idea that his presence in the race was helping Bernie Sanders’ candidacy.Reporters pointed out to Bloomberg that other moderate candidates, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, have dropped out and endorsed Joe Biden to consolidate the anti-Sanders vote, and asked if he would do the same.“Joe’s taking votes away from me,” a visibly irritated Bloomberg said. “Have you asked Joe whether he’s going to drop out?”“I have no intention of dropping out,” Bloomberg said.Bloomberg was appearing at a campaign field office in Miami where he was introduced by former mayor Manny Diaz. Though Florida doesn’t vote until March 17, Bloomberg is spending the day here campaigning while the Super Tuesday states hold primaries. Bloomberg has built his strategy around Super Tuesday, in which 14 states and one US territory are voting, after skipping the first four states on the calendar. Though Bloomberg has polled fairly well in many of the states voting Tuesday, he’s faced increased pressure to drop out of the race as the Democratic establishment has united around Biden, who won South Carolina last weekend.“I don’t know why that’s the case,” Bloomberg said when a reporter asked him about criticism that his presence in the race is helping Sanders secure the nomination. “Miss, are you gonna ask a question or give a lecture?” Bloomberg said before relenting and responding to the questions. “I think that I know how to beat Donald Trump. I think I know how to run this country, I’ve been practicing that for a lot of years.”Asked what states he expects to win Tuesday, Bloomberg said, ""I don't know whether you're gonna win any. You don't have to win states, you have to win delegates.""When a reporter asked him if he wants the primary to go into a contested convention, he said, ""I don't think that I can win any other ways.""""A contested convention is a democratic process. There are rules in the Democratic Party about how you go about this, and I did see Bernie Sanders said all of a sudden he didn't want to follow the rules."" Bloomberg said. ""I find it offensive that Bernie Sanders, who, the last time he ran, was in favor of that kind of a convention and now he's opposed to it.""","Michael Bloomberg Said He Can’t Win Without A Contested Convention

"     MINNEAPOLIS — The young woman answered Jared Mollenkof’s question with what sounded like a question.“Bernie Sanders?”Standing in her wool socks on the stoop of her home in Northeast Minneapolis, she looked anything but certain about the question of whom she planned to vote for on Tuesday.“I do really like Elizabeth Warren too,” she offered, looking at the faded stickers on Mollenkof’s winter jacket: Warren for President, Warren Has a Plan for That. “She’s right behind.”Mollenkof explained why he was voting for Warren, a spiel he’s given hundreds of times by now at doors across Minnesota, which will go to the polls in the Democratic primary on Super Tuesday. With her arms crossed tightly, the woman told Mollenkof she agreed with everything he said: She loved Warren, thought she was amazing. But.“I just do worry about her beating Trump,” she said. Her voice went up in a question again. “Sort of…with regards to her as a woman? That’s why I’m leaning towards Sanders.”The woman listened, nodding eagerly, as Mollenkof, who is black, explained that he worried too — all the time. He wanted to beat Trump more than anything else. He assured her the data, the history, didn’t back up the fear that a woman couldn’t beat Trump. He told her why he thought Warren could.“I guess…I guess I should just figure out whether I’m for Bernie or Warren,” the woman said. “I do think that maybe my fears are irrational too.”But as Mollenkof trudged through the crusted-over snow to the next house, and the next, he said he didn’t have much hope that the woman would change her mind. More than likely, he thought, she would end up voting for Bernie Sanders.By his count, Mollenkof had knocked on 1,250 doors for Warren, across not just Minnesota but Tennessee, his home state, and on freezing cold weekends in Iowa, too. He had heard that same worry, that Warren couldn’t win because she was a woman, a lot. And he had tried to talk people out of it a lot.And the more he’d heard it, the more Mollenkof saw Warren slide in the polls.With three days to go until Super Tuesday, he was upbeat. He was hopeful. And he was also getting, well, a little angry.“I think we could unite after a contested convention,” he said. “And I kind of want to leave some blood and teeth on the way.”“Blood and teeth” — a phrase borrowed from Warren a decade ago, in her fight to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Her first choice, she had said, was to create a strong, independent agency. “My second choice is no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.”Warren hasn’t won a single delegate since Iowa. But she raised $30 million in February. And in the wake of an abysmal finish in South Carolina on Saturday, her campaign began to talk openly about a contested convention — their plan to take the fight all the way to Milwaukee, where the convention will be held, in July.She has stayed in the race even as two other candidates, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, dropped out in the days before Super Tuesday, endorsing Joe Biden in an attempt to consolidate the moderate wing of the Democratic Party.Warren has given no indication she will do the same. On the campaign trail lately, she has been fighting, openly, with the fierce energy that began her career in politics.To understand why, you can look at Jared Mollenkof.“Every office I’ve ever worked in has told me they want to have more black employees, but it’s just a supply, not a demand, issue,” Mollenkof said. “I am just so fucking sick of people saying, like, ‘I really want a woman to be president, but just not this woman at this moment.’“And I want the party to have a reckoning with that fact.”      Minnesota was ground zero of Warren’s steady rise last summer: In August in St. Paul, in the midst of a drumbeat of excitement over her plans and unyielding anti-corruption message, she drew the largest crowd of her campaign at that point in the race — some 12,000 people out on the grass in the late summer sun. She stayed for more than two hours to take selfies.That all feels far away now, with the ground packed hard with snow.There aren’t clear, obvious answers about what happened between then and now, with Warren’s shot at winning a majority of delegates almost entirely gone.Pundits have blamed Warren’s fall on her wavering stance on Medicare for All late last summer, her unwillingness to change her messaging into the winter, her lack of momentum, her rejection of traditional methods like super PACs.But Warren also built her campaign on the back of a massive army of paid organizers and volunteer canvassers and phone-bankers. She didn’t spend her money on pollsters to tell her how to fine-tune her message or television ads to blanket the airwaves in early states. Her campaign thought it was better off persuading voters in one-on-one conversations.That army was thought to be one of Warren’s strengths going into Iowa. As she has struggled in those early states, many observers have wondered if it wasn’t also a weakness — an overreliance on grassroots organizing that seems, in the end, not to have mattered as much as they’d hoped.But Mollenkof and other organizers he works with in that grassroots army have seen enough, talked to enough people, that they have come up with their own idea of what happened. In the end, it’s pretty simple, they think: It’s misogyny.Neil Chudgar was one of the first volunteers for Warren’s campaign, long before she had paid staffers in Minnesota. He spoke wistfully of last summer, when Warren was at her height: “It really looked like we were going to win the state.”There was the huge, energetic crowd in St. Paul. And, especially, the Minnesota State Fair — Chudgar remembered that in the famous “bean ballot,” where fairgoers place dried beans into clear tubes to cast their primary vote, Warren was the only candidate in state history to need a whole extra tube to hold her beans. She won 38% of the vote, doubling even Klobuchar.What does he feel now, with Warren far behind in state polls?“I love Elizabeth Warren,” Chudgar said simply. “And I’ve learned more about misogyny in the past few months than I ever realized.”There was one day, specifically, when Mollenkof started to think about how he wanted to leave behind “blood and teeth”: the debate in Iowa, when Warren was asked about news stories that Sanders had told her he thought a woman could not beat Trump.“I think it's really shitty that the fight with Bernie turned out better for him than for her after it seems pretty clear that he said that shit,"" Mollenkof said. “And the fact that people don't think she's smart enough to know that accusing a man of sexism would result in her losing votes is offensive. She was aware of how that was going to play out, and she did it anyway because that was the truth — and she lost votes in New Hampshire.”Mollenkof, who works as a public defender, fell in love with Warren early in the race, and followed her through her ups and downs — a “roller coaster,” he called it.He had originally expected to spend Monday and Tuesday focused on the trial of a client; he had worked some 140 hours over the past two weeks preparing for it. But at the last minute, the state dropped its case.      That meant more time to canvass for Warren. After doorknocking from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, he would be out the next day, and the next.To celebrate, Mollenkof painted his nails with a thick coat of liberty green, the color of Warren’s campaign, smudging the paint around his cuticles. He hadn’t wanted to have his nails painted in case of a trial: You never know what a juror might think.He is still fiercely, tirelessly, behind Warren. But, he admitted, canvassing for Warren was “a lot easier” back that summer — not because of his own feelings about the candidate, but because people were eager to talk about her. They liked to be part of the winning team.“I was ready to gamble a lot of money on her being president,” Mollenkof said.Lately, instead of gambling, he has simply been donating a lot of money to Warren — more than he’s ever given to another candidate, despite his love for Barack Obama and his work on behalf of Hillary Clinton in 2016.Like Warren’s team, he’s convinced she’s the only candidate who can unite the Democratic Party’s ideological wings. There’s another thing driving him too.""It feels like you’re watching a game play out that's rigged against one team,” Mollenkof said.“The basketball hoops have been set at different heights, and you're watching, and the refs aren't doing anything about it. And you just get angrier and angrier.”      After the devastation of Clinton’s loss in 2016, Mollenkof did his research as he tried to decide who to back in the 2020 primary. He bought books by Sanders and Buttigieg. He wanted to be excited about Buttigieg, he said: Mollenkof is gay, and there was something meaningful about that. And he did like Sanders’ politics; he’d voted for him in the 2016 primary.But Warren was the one Mollenkof fell in love with. He loved the way she talked about poverty and race and class. He loved the way she listened. She was the candidate, he thought, who could truly run the federal government competently.Mollenkof has only met Warren briefly — a few unremarkable conversations in selfie lines. But like so many of her volunteers, he feels like he knows her personally. He tells voters not just about her plans, but how she created them. He tells them about how nice she is to her staff. Watching her this election, he said, felt like cheering your kid as they run a big race, one you know they might not win. You’re just that invested.Mollenkof’s love for Warren, he said, came in large part from talking to people of color who respected her: DACA recipients, black women criminal justice advocates in the South. “Those women do not pity a fool, and that sealed it,” he said.Mollenkof has watched, though, as Warren has struggled with black and Latino voters. The support he thought she might get at first never materialized. That night in South Carolina, she would finish with around 5% of the black vote.He isn’t entirely sure what happened.“It— I have wondered if there is some level on which that, like, people just reached the conclusion that a Harvard professor that grew up in the places that she did would be incapable of really relating to African American communities,” Mollenkof said. He thought her claim of Native American ancestry might have had something to do with it too.“It makes me nervous to try to put my finger on why — why the coalition hasn’t been more diverse. Especially when it seems like some of the endorsements would have been so helpful, and I…I don’t know.”Of the hundreds of doors Mollenkof has knocked for Warren, the one that sticks out to him most was one of the first people he met in Minnesota, in the mostly black neighborhood of north Minneapolis. An older black man invited him into his home, he said, and proudly showed off a display on his wall: a full-size stop sign that he’d written “TRUMP” on the bottom of, decorating it with Christmas lights. The man was retired and lived alone; it wasn’t clear whom the sign was really for, besides himself.To Mollenkof, the man is a reminder.“I don’t know how the Democratic Party does the best job of honoring the experience of the people that have been most harmed by the Trump administration,” he said. “But it is important that when we get him out of office that we don’t just try to turn the page and try to cross the aisle, but we actually hold people accountable for the crimes this administration has committed.”Mollenkof believes there are only two candidates who “have the stomach” to do that: Warren and Sanders.Did he think the man from north Minneapolis would vote for Warren?“I don’t know,” Mollenkof said. “I don’t know who he’ll vote for.”      “Hey hey,” Mollenkof said over and over again when voters opened the door. “I’m a volunteer with the Elizabeth Warren campaign.”He always makes a point to say he’s a volunteer; white voters, of which there are very, very many in Minneapolis, always assume black volunteers must be staffers, Mollenkof said. “They think you must be paid to do this,” he explained. People are ruder when they think you’re getting paid.All day Saturday, from voter to voter, up one block of modest single-family homes and down another, the sense of anxiety was strong. There were a lot of undecided voters, a lot of people who admitted they didn’t care about issues as much as they wanted to beat Trump. Despite a highly engaged, almost entirely Democratic electorate in Minneapolis, Mollenkof passed few yard signs: one Amy, one Bernie, one that said “Any Functioning Adult.”“She’s taken a knock,” one Warren voter told Mollenkof, sadly, squinting out into the sun from her porch. “I don’t really know what to do about it.”“I think a lot of people have gotten worried about pundits and polling,” Mollenkof told another woman. “But if people get out and vote their heart, then we’ll end up in the right place.”Mollenkof gets the anxiety, he said. He feels it too. But he doesn’t listen to it.""I've been an eternal optimist on every campaign I've ever worked on,” Mollenkof said. “I've doorknocked on Election Day thinking we’re going to win on every campaign I've ever worked on.“It'll be so much less fun if I don't fully engage and drink the Kool-Aid in that regard, and so I do.”A lot of the campaigns he has worked on have lost. There was Hillary, of course. But one loss that really sticks out to Mollenkof was from the 2018 midterm elections, when he was living in Tennessee. He campaigned hard for Phil Bredesen, the former governor, who was running for Senate.Mollenkof really thought Bredesen could win, he said. But he can pinpoint the day he believes Bredesen lost the race: when he said he would have voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.It was a bid to win some of the state’s moderate and conservative voters. But that was the day when so many of the young, progressive women who had been working tirelessly on Bredesen’s behalf simply stopped showing up to phone-bank and canvass. Bredesen said it on a Tuesday; by that weekend, Mollenkof said, 60% of their volunteers had canceled on them.He couldn’t blame them. He was “pissed,” too. And even though he still showed up to canvass, he did less than he would have. He felt he couldn’t push family and friends to volunteer, either, because they asked a question he didn’t really have an answer to: “If he was going to have voted for Kavanaugh, why do I care if he’s in the Senate?”This is the theory that drives Mollenkof, and a case he makes over and over again as he campaigns for Warren. The candidate who will beat Trump, he said, is the one who can inspire the widest swath of people to turn out to the polls, not the one who will just flip voters away from Trump.We don’t need to change Republicans’ minds, he told a young couple on Saturday who had invited him out of the cold and into their home to talk about electability, despite the fact that they had friends visiting from out of town.“It’s the people who don’t even show up to vote,” Mollenkof told them. “The 144,000 people in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania who didn’t turn out in 2016.”Mollenkof grew up in a religious, anti-abortion home, the son of evangelical missionaries in Africa. His father, who is white, is extremely conservative but deeply opposed to Trump; he dislikes the president so much, Mollenkof said, that he changed his stance on issues like climate change to be as far from Trump’s as possible. But he didn’t like Hillary Clinton, either. Mollenkof thinks he probably didn’t vote in 2016.Does Mollenkof ever think about picking a Democratic nominee whom his father would vote for too?“No,” he said simply. “Because I wouldn’t want to vote for that person.” ●","He Knocked 1,250 Doors For Elizabeth Warren.

"     For a brief moment last Tuesday after the Democratic presidential debate, past the hallways that snaked from the spin room to the exit near the back of the Gaillard Center in South Carolina, two of the candidates ended up stuck together in a small room, unable to leave.There was a problem with the door — security needed to unlock it — and so they stood together waiting. Had chance put them there with anybody else, it might’ve been a moment of awkward silence. Amy Klobuchar and Bernie Sanders dislike plenty of people, but not each other.The fact of their friendship, based on a little-discussed, yearslong mutual respect, is all at once entirely unexpected and intuitively obvious. As candidates, they shared a stubborn force of will and a fierce distaste for their enemies — both of them salty, but in vastly different ways. As senators, they work together all the time, but in matters of ideology and political sensibility, they agree on very little. He, for example, will hate this article — see: ""political gossip,"" personality-driven media, etc. She already loves it.“Hey, Bernie,” she told him in Charleston last Tuesday, flashing a little smile as they waited to leave the Gaillard Center, their respective SUVs idling outside in the dark. “BuzzFeed is writing a story about us.”Klobuchar’s decision to drop out on the eve of Super Tuesday was a move aimed squarely at stopping Sanders’s rise — consolidating the moderate wing of the Democratic party. Sanders, meanwhile, spent Monday night in Klobuchar’s state, holding a rally with thousands in St. Paul. Klobuchar’s endorsement of Joe Biden on Monday, Sanders’ campaign suggested hours before his Minnesota event, changes nothing about their strategy.But he is losing something rarer in this year’s presidential field: a friend.The Democratic primary drew a cumulative 28 candidates who, isolated from everyone but one another, forged unique relationships under the pressure of a unique experience. Amid the bizarre mix of personalities and political biographies on the presidential stage this year, Sanders and Klobuchar had this year’s most unlikely repartee — a puzzle of compatibility that even their own staffers can’t totally decode but cast as illuminating on both sides.“She’s always willing to reach out to anyone,” a senior Klobuchar adviser said of the Minnesota senator’s efforts to pursue common ground across partisan lines, a fact of which they are quite proud. “But there’s a little personality match there that oddly works.”“He likes people who are real and so does she,” a senior Sanders adviser said of the Vermont senator’s radar for political phoniness, a fact of which they are also quite proud. “Neither give a shit about putting on pretense.”      On Monday night in St. Paul, hours after she left the race, Sanders spoke about his fondness for Klobuchar. “We came into the Senate together in 2006, and she is one of the hardest workers that I know. I like Amy.”The personality match, aides to both senators said in recent interviews, is undergirded in mutual respect in spite of their sizable disagreements. Sanders frequently talks about Klobuchar’s work ethic. (“She is always working,” he’ll say.) The moderate and progressive have partnered on multiple bills in the Senate, including one recent effort to import cheaper prescription drugs from Canada. (The amendment failed, with 13 Democrats also voting against it.)In 2017, when CNN asked Sanders to participate in a televised debate on health care policy against Sen. Ted Cruz and another Republican, it was Sanders’s idea to invite Klobuchar to appear as his co-debater at the event. The two presented a tag team–like effect, mostly banding together over a topic that would sharply divide them in the Democratic primary a year later.      The personal relationship between Sanders and Klobuchar dates back more than a decade, when on a trip to Vermont, she and her husband, John Bessler, stopped to have dinner with Sanders and his wife, Jane, at a restaurant there.More recently, in 2018, Sanders and Klobuchar ran into each other on a flight from Washington to Minneapolis. She was flying home. He was with three staffers, en route to campaign for candidates across the Midwest. When they got on the plane, Klobuchar moved to sit in the middle seat next to Sanders. When he had a problem with his ride to the hotel, she insisted on taking him herself. And when she walked him from the gate to baggage claim, introducing him to every Minnesotan she recognized along the way, she began by saying, “This is my friend Bernie.”Outside, an aide was waiting in a sedan. There wasn’t enough room in the car, but without hesitation, Klobuchar put Sanders in the front seat and crammed into the backseat with his three staffers.The two senators are both respected and influential among their Senate colleagues, but Klobuchar and Sanders also have a reputation for rubbing other Democrats the wrong way. Both can be tough on the people who work for them, though Klobuchar has been accused of harsher treatment, like throwing objects that strike staffers.Former aides said Klobuchar could become obsessive about getting credit, particularly for bills that she sponsored, sometimes holding up other offices to ensure she got credit. In Senate tradition, the lead lawmaker on a bill has their name listed first; Klobuchar’s communications staffers are known for frequently emailing reporters who incorrectly list the order of names to correct the record, noting that their boss, not a different senator, is the lead on the bill.In the New Hampshire debate that propelled Klobuchar to a surprising third-place finish in the state, Klobuchar was asked about Hillary Clinton’s biting assertion about Bernie in a January interview: “Nobody likes him. Nobody wants to work with him. He got nothing done.”      “I like Bernie just fine,” Klobuchar said onstage, referencing their work on the 2017 pharmaceutical amendment.“We actually had a vote late at night one time, the Klobuchar–Sanders amendment to—”Sanders interrupted, leaning over to look at Klobuchar at the podium next to him.He broke into a grin.“I thought it was Sanders–Klobuchar? No?” he said.“Nope, nope, nope, it was not. It was not,” Klobuchar said.The field of departed candidates now vastly outnumbers the five remaining trying to make it to the White House. But all of them learned for themselves that running for president is a strange and lonely business. People can watch up close — staffers and advisers, friends and partners, reporters and volunteers — but only those who have done it know the singular experience.Months before he ended his campaign, after a day of long drives and small crowds across Iowa, Rep. Eric Swalwell returned to his hotel in Des Moines around midnight, ordered a plate of deviled eggs for dinner from the lobby bar, and talked with reporters about how much he missed his 6-month-old kid at home in California. Elizabeth Warren told NBC News the experience “can be thrilling but also very lonely.” And Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur who dropped out of the race last month, recalled the slog of early party dinners in Iowa and New Hampshire.“Frankly it was a lot of the other second-tier candidates — and those events were kind of lonesome,” he said in an interview. “You show up and people are very polite, but a lot of them are just being courteous. Some of them don’t even know who you are. Then you go out there and you do your thing and you hope they like it. There’s a lot of putting yourself out there, so you naturally empathize with the other people who are putting themselves out there in that setting too.”“There is a real bonding experience and kinship that comes with this process,” Yang said.At party dinners, debates, and parades over the last 14 months, against the super-serious backdrop of a race to unseat Donald Trump, genuine relationships flourished between certain candidates with small gestures.Yang remembered agreeing to switch time slots at a town hall–style event with Klobuchar. “From there I think Amy and I had a better connection,” he said.      Pete Buttigieg tried setting up a series of “get-to-know-you” calls with candidates he didn’t know well, such as Kamala Harris, according to three of his former staffers.Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who dropped out of the race last weekend, made it a habit to methodically say “goodnight” to the candidates at the end of every debate, including once when he famously interrupted Sanders and Warren in the middle of a heated confrontation in Des Moines.“The stakes are amazingly serious. It can’t be any more serious. So could we please have some joy as we go about life in the meantime and treat each other well?” Steyer said, laughing in an interview before he left the race.“Are you kidding me? What a cast!” he said.Klobuchar and Sanders, two of the most serious and stubborn candidates to run in the last year, didn’t exactly find “joy” in one another. But they did find common admiration for their work.At the debate in New Hampshire, Klobuchar went on to talk about her own “receipts” — her bipartisan bills, her victories in Republican districts in Minnesota, and her large number of newspaper endorsements, another particular obsession of Klobuchar’s.She listed all three of the New Hampshire papers that had endorsed her.“I must confess, I don’t get too many newspapers’ editorial support,” Sanders said when she was finished. “Must confess that.”“What do you mean — you got the Conway endorsement,” Klobuchar interrupted, turning to Sanders — a reference to the Conway Daily Sun, another local newspaper in New Hampshire.“I did. We’re very proud of that.”Klobuchar gestured to him, satisfied, and turned back to the audience. “There we go.”      ","Remembering This Election’s Strangest Friendship: Bernie Sanders And Amy Klobuchar

"     DALLAS — In the hours leading up to Super Tuesday, Joe Biden was having some of the best moments his campaign has had in months.After handily winning South Carolina over the weekend, a wave of endorsements came from legislators across the country, including three former rivals for the presidency, two of whom dropped out of the race just in the previous 48 hours.“Just a few days ago the press and the pundits declared this campaign dead, but South Carolina had something to say about it,” Biden said at a rally in Dallas on Monday night. “And tomorrow, Texas and Minnesota and the rest of the Super Tuesday states, they’re going to have a lot to say about it.”“In all we now have 1,500 endorsements, including 36 congressmen. Mayors, elected officials, are joining the campaign, in just the last two days,” he added later.In Iowa, and then in New Hampshire, and then in Nevada and South Carolina, Biden repeated the mantra each time that this was the state that was the real beginning of the campaign. And in each of those states, his team worked to downplay expectations as his performance in the first three of those contests stood in contrast to his frontrunner status at the launch of his campaign.Biden’s animated performance Monday, however, alongside Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, and — at a previous event — Pete Buttigieg, spoke to an emboldened campaign coming off a decisive victory in South Carolina — thanks to the overwhelming support of older black voters.“I cannot think of a better way to end my campaign than joining his,” Sen. Klobuchar said Monday night, campaigning for Biden for the first time since dropping out of the race that morning.The crowd was a combination of decided Biden voters, those leaning his way, and former Buttigieg and Klobuchar supporters who turned their support to him in the past few days.“Especially with Amy and Beto it was right on the money, it was perfect. It seems like the campaign has been energized,” said Sherelyn Roberts, 71, at Biden’s packed rally in Dallas on Monday evening, where a marching band set the scene for a campaign event with a distinctly more lively crowd than the former vice president’s events have tended to draw in recent months.With 14 states voting and a third of the total number of delegates at play on Tuesday, Biden and Bernie Sanders have been polling close to each other in several states recently, with Sanders ahead in some — including in the delegate-rich states of California and Texas.On Monday, Biden laid out some of the same pointed attacks on Sanders, who was an Independent for most of his time in Congress, that he has brought up in recent weeks without mentioning his name: “People don’t want the promise of revolution, they want results, they want the revival of decency, honor, and character,” he said.“If Democrats want a nominee who’s a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, an Obama–Biden Democrat, then join us. We can either win big or lose big, that’s a choice,” he added.Biden praised Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and O’Rourke, casting them as the future of the Democratic Party — Klobuchar “had the grit and determination to do anything she set her mind to”, and O’Rourke was “a man who electrified this state and nation,” “a man with unlimited future.”He reserved the highest compliment he could think of for Buttigieg — “[Buttigieg] reminds me of my son, Beau,” Biden said at an earlier campaign stop after Buttigieg endorsed him.Buttigieg told reporters, ""When I ran for president we made it clear that the whole idea was about rallying the country together to defeat Donald Trump and to win the era for the values that we share, and that was always a goal that was much bigger than me becoming president and it is in the name of that very same goal that I am delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president.""Klobuchar, taking the stage at the rally to chants of “Amy!” from the crowd Monday night, appealed to Texans to “vote for dignity, vote for our heart, for our country.”And O’Rourke, whose 2018 Senate run came within inches of unseating Sen. Ted Cruz but didn’t quite get there, was there as a sharp reminder to Texans of how close they’ve come in recent years to flipping their state at various levels.O’Rourke called Biden “the antithesis of Donald Trump,” and said he decided to endorse Biden after seeing him at a CNN town hall in Charleston, South Carolina, last week, responding with empathy to Rev. Anthony Thompson, who lost his wife in the Mother Emanuel AME church shooting in 2015.“He wanted to heal that man, he wanted to heal Charleston, South Carolina. But as someone who lives in El Paso, Texas … I felt Joe Biden healing us,” O’Rourke said.For Texas Democrats, gains in recent years on both the state and federal levels have been exciting and frustrating at the same time — to come close but not quite defeat Cruz, to be nine seats away from a majority in the state House. Among Texas Democrats, there’s been a tension on how to keep that momentum moving, to either take the path of centrist candidates to win over unsettled independents and moderate Republicans, or to present bold progressive candidates to activate young and Latino voters who could represent rising political forces, as their numbers have grown in recent years.“Por ultimo, in 2018, all of us, a lot of the people who are here on this stage, ran the greatest grassroots campaign Texas had ever seen, we won more votes than any Democrat had in Texas history,” O’Rourke said, closing out his speech, “Ladies and gentlemen, el proximo presidente de los estados unidos.”Several of O’Rourke’s former staffers, some of whom played an instrumental role in that Senate run, are working for the Sanders campaign in Texas or have moved on to work on down-ballot races for markedly more progressive candidates than Biden.Biden’s campaign is making the case to Texas that only a moderate candidate like himself is capable of delivering progress for their state.“He can bring together that coalition of our fired-up Democratic base, as well as independents and moderate Republicans,” Klobuchar told the crowd in Dallas.Several voters in the crowd said they support Sanders’ proposals in principle but said they can’t see how he’d pass them, and worry that a more progressive candidate could damage the prospects of other Democrats down the ticket, especially in Texas where Republicans still control both houses in the Capitol and officials litigiously went after Obama’s policies for years.Immediately following Klobuchar and former Democratic leader Sen. Harry Reid’s endorsement of Biden on Monday, Sanders told a rally that “the establishment” was getting “very, very nervous.”Some voters at the Biden event on Monday said they found that suggestion condescending.“I’m offended by somebody saying, ‘establishment’. I just want somebody who’s best for this country, and I know that’s not Donald Trump,” said Charlene Powell, 55, who voted early for Biden.“I don’t have a card to the establishment. I’m not a card-carrying establishment member. What does that mean, ‘establishment,’ Bernie?” said her husband, Jay Powell, 62, who also voted for Biden. “We’re capable of thinking for ourselves.”A handful of voters who spoke to BuzzFeed News at the Biden event Monday echoed what moderates and independents said in Iowa two months ago — that even if they don’t agree with Sanders on most things or would worry about his effect on down-ticket candidates, they would still vote for him in November if he wins the primary.One Biden supporter at Monday’s rally, a former lifelong Republican who said she switched parties because of Trump and supported Buttigieg until he dropped out, said she’s excited to vote for Biden, but she, too, would vote for Bernie Sanders if it came down to it.Judy Hockenborough, 60, was at the rally in Dallas wearing a T-shirt plastered with Buttigieg’s logo and a sign on her back that said “former Republican.”“First I went for Beto, then I went for Pete, they’re both for Biden, so I think Biden can do it,” she said.“I would still vote for [Sanders],” if he wins the nomination, she said, “I’m going to vote blue no matter what, because I can’t stand Trump. I feel like he’s ruined my party. I will vote for Bernie. I won’t be happy about it. I think Biden would do a much better job.”","An Emboldened Joe Biden Made His Case To Super Tuesday Voters With A Raft Of Endorsements Behind Him

"     In 2016, Super Tuesday was the beginning of the end for Bernie Sanders, as returns came in from primarily Southern states.This Super Tuesday will likely be very different.For one thing, this Super Tuesday is a lot bigger: One-third of the total delegates will be allocated in contests today. The two largest states (California and Texas) in the country vote today, along with the 10th (North Carolina) and 12th (Virginia). Two of those states, California and North Carolina, are new additions to Super Tuesday.For another thing, Sanders is expected to win California — possibly by a big margin — and stay competitive in or even win Texas.Today’s also the first time Michael Bloomberg will appear on ballots. He’s spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising over the last few months for this day. He will likely be competing in many states with Joe Biden, fresh off his decisive win in South Carolina, for the votes of more moderate Democrats. This will also be the first set of contests without Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, though they will remain on the ballot and have already received votes in states with early voting.Sanders is pretty likely to come in first or second in almost every state, if not every state, which could be significant — especially if he splits those results with four different candidates.Here are a few things to understand about Super Tuesday, as you watch returns come in:You will hear a lot of talk about delegates in the coming weeks. To win the Democratic nomination automatically, a candidate needs to win a majority of the delegates awarded by the states. That’s unlikely to happen (though still possible). So the margins between the candidates, and all the little delegates they pick up along the way, will be important.States generally award delegates in two ways: based on the total statewide results and by congressional district. In both state and district, the party awards delegates to candidates who earn at least 15% of the vote.Some states vote by mail, most notably California, which means the specific delegate results in the state may take days or even weeks to determine.Why?If a few candidates are at 16% and 14% statewide, it could take a while for California to determine how the delegates will be awarded. If Sanders wins California and no one else clears 15% statewide, he would probably come close to winning 400 delegates. If Sanders wins California and two other candidates clear 15%, he would still win a lot of delegates, but the proportions would be reduced.This same exercise — determining who clears 15% — will play out across the congressional districts in California (and all the other Super Tuesday states). Those results may not be the same as the statewide ones. For example: The results will probably be different a) statewide in California, b) in a congressional district that’s in Los Angeles, c) in a Silicon Valley–area congressional district, and d) in a congressional district that covers a farming area in California. It’s complicated and can take time.The general point is: Look for the winners in these states voting today, but remember that when it comes to delegate totals, the results might look a little different from what you’re expecting.States that close at 7 p.m. ETVermont (16 delegates)Bernie Sanders will win this state and probably take all the delegates.Virginia (99 delegates)This is a state where Biden, Bloomberg, and Sanders will all be looking to do well — but especially the first two. Virginia’s largest population is in the Washington, DC, suburbs of Northern Virginia. This area is now reliably Democratic, but is also where more center-left and moderate Republicans have done well in local contests. Black voters and military voters also play an important role in Virginia elections, primarily in the Richmond and Norfolk areas.States that close at 7:30 p.m. ETNorth Carolina (110 delegates)This is the fourth-biggest state on the map Tuesday and with some of the most split polling: It’s hard to know who will win, and it will be interesting to watch! Biden is hoping to do well in North Carolina on the strength of his South Carolina win; black voters and more moderate, conservative Democrats play a key role in elections here. Sanders, however, has campaigned hard in the state, especially on college campuses. Bloomberg has also invested heavily in the state.States that close at 8 p.m. ETAlabama (52 delegates)This is one of the Southern states that Joe Biden hopes to win, based on the strength of his performance in South Carolina, where older black voters and older white moderates powered him to a big win. Bloomberg is also looking to do well here.Tennessee (64 delegates)Likewise, Biden is hoping to do well in Tennessee, another Southern state where more moderate white voters and black voters are likely to account for a big part of the electorate. Bloomberg is also looking to do well here.Texas (228 delegates)Democrats dream of using Donald Trump’s unpopularity to activate the nonvoters in the state and turn Texas blue on the strength of its large population of young, Latino, and black voters. In 2018, Beto O’Rourke came close to making part of that happen in a race against Ted Cruz. Where Texas Democrats did win, however, is in the affluent suburbs of Houston and Dallas.The polling in Texas is a little all over the place. Some polls put Bernie Sanders up by a fair amount in the state, on the strength of his popularity with Latino voters, and younger voters of all races. He’s spent a fair amount of time in the state. Bloomberg has spent big here. Biden is hoping to be above the 15% mark. And lastly, this is one of the states where Elizabeth Warren is staking her longshot strategy to stay in the race. She’s spent a fair amount of time, and a lot of early organizing energy, in the state where she lived and worked. Her campaign’s thinking is that if she can place in Texas and California, she can amass a small, but important delegate total.Oklahoma (37 delegates)There hasn’t been a ton of polling here, and both the moderates and the progressives have a case to make. Warren, a native Oklahoman, is also hoping to secure some delegates.Massachusetts (91 delegates)Sanders and Warren are both trying to win outright in Massachusetts, the state she represents in the Senate, and a New England neighbor to Vermont. Despite all the “ooh drama” takes about Sanders campaigning here in recent days, this is the fifth-largest state on the Super Tuesday map, and Sanders would like to pick up as many delegates as possible in a traditionally liberal state.Maine (24 delegates)Sanders is hoping to win this New England state as well, though it has a flinty moderate streak (Maine is sometimes a general election battleground state), and it’s one where Pete Buttigieg had previously looked to do well, so someone like Warren or Biden may benefit.States that close at 8:30 p.m. ETArkansas (31 delegates)Biden and Bloomberg will both be looking to win. This is a Southern state, but one where Sanders may do a little better than he’s done in other Southern states. He still pulled in 30% of the vote in 2016, despite the long legacy of the Clintons in Arkansas.States that close at 9 p.m. ETColorado (67 delegates)Sanders is expected to win Colorado by a potentially substantial amount. Though the state has only recently become blue in general elections, Coloradans recently elected Jared Polis, one of the most progressive governors in the country. Sanders will also likely benefit from his strength with young white voters, young Latino voters, and liberal bros. Warren is hoping to clear the 15% threshold here.Minnesota (75 delegates)This one changed on Monday, when Amy Klobuchar, who has never lost a statewide race in Minnesota, ended her campaign to endorse Biden. Sanders also polls strongly in the state and held a rally there on Monday night. It’s a big state — the sixth largest on Super Tuesday — so the results matter.States that close at 10 p.m. ETUtah (29 delegates)One wild card in Utah: This is a state where Buttigieg polled well, and where Bloomberg has too. With Buttigieg out of the race and Bloomberg potentially a little damaged in recent weeks, will Biden benefit? Will Sanders? Sanders is hoping to win by a fair amount here.States that close at 11 p.m. ETCalifornia (415 delegates)Some polling has Bernie Sanders winning California by 15 or 20 points. If that actually happens, it will have an enormous effect on the race. He’s campaigned extensively on combating climate change and changing US immigration policy — two core issues important in California. His organizing strength in Nevada with Latino voters, a yearlong campaign to make their concerns a priority and activate that voter group, make his campaign the one to beat in California. Unlike 2016, his campaign has also spent a lot more time attuned to the delegate race, focusing on parts of the state that deliver delegates but don’t always get visited as much. If he wins big, this will be a big part of the reason. If he doesn’t win as big as he’d hoped, though, that could promise big issues in March for the Sanders campaign as the field starts to consolidate.Warren and Bloomberg are also hoping to clear 15% here statewide, and though Biden is unlikely to do so, that would be huge for his campaign. One thing to watch: Voting in California started on Feb. 3 (the day of the Iowa caucus). A decent share of the vote has already been cast — probably some of it for Buttigieg and Steyer, who are no longer in the race.Also voting on TuesdayAmerican Samoa (6 delegates)These are caucuses and there’s been no polling, so who knows! Let’s find out.","What To Watch For On Super Tuesday

"     As centrist Democrats consolidate around Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, progressive organizations that have divided in support between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren said they do not have a plan to quickly band behind one of the two to form a coalition against the moderate threat.Justice Democrats, founded by alumni of Sanders' 2016 campaign, suggested Monday that Warren ease up on attacks on Sanders and commit to supporting him with her delegates should he continue to run well ahead of her campaign. But groups that have backed Warren for months or years — like the Working Families Party and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee — are showing no sign of relenting in their support or beginning to coalesce around Sanders’ frontrunning campaign to match the support Biden’s now receiving.“The point I want to make is that most voters aren’t extremely ideological and there are voters that support Sanders who would never support Warren and there are Warren supporters who would never support Sanders,” Adam Green, the cofounder of PCCC, which supports Warren’s campaign, told BuzzFeed News about the different bases of support who might not support each other in the primary. He added that he believes Warren supporters would support Sen. Sanders if he were to become the party's nominee. “Warren remains the second choice for tons of voters and staying in this race is helpful to progressives across this country because there are tons of Amy and Pete supporters who would have defaulted to Biden if she weren’t there.”Progressives who are supporting Warren’s campaign argued that Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar have given Warren a real shot at picking up enough delegates to help her campaign survive Super Tuesday by ending their own campaigns to back Biden. If Warren can continue on toward the Democratic convention with delegates, they argue, it would help the progressive movement no matter which candidate wins in the end. They’ve suggested that either candidate could make a deal with the other prior to the convention in a bid to keep their delegates together. They also pointed to her commitment to staying in the race as beneficial to Sanders on the debate stage.“One can close their eyes and imagine a debate stage on March 15 with both Bernie and Warren tag-teaming Biden,” Green told BuzzFeed News. “His campaign would be declared dead in minutes on Wikipedia.”He added that the best outcome from Super Tuesday would be that Sanders and Warren would be the last two Democrats running for the party’s nomination. “We’d have two members of the progressive wing running against each other, and I really don’t see a better situation for progressive voters than that one.” This, however, looks unlikely in the short term, with Biden going into Super Tuesday far ahead of Warren in the delegate count, and in a better position in many of the 14 states with contests.“The last couple days of this race have underscored exactly how fluid it still is, and there are a lot of delegates that are still up for grabs,” said Joe Dinkin, the Working Families Party’s national campaign director. “One of Warren's talents is that she has brought new people into the progressive movement, and they aren't all necessarily Bernie supporters. Having two progressive candidates accumulate progressive delegates could prove very valuable.""Those comments come after both Buttigieg and Klobuchar announced that they were dropping out of the presidential race in the days after the South Carolina primary, where Biden blew out the field and emerged as seemingly the strongest chance at stopping Sanders’ campaign from at least reaching a majority of delegates after winning New Hampshire, Nevada, and narrowly placing in second in Iowa.On Monday night, Buttigieg and Klobuchar both announced that they were endorsing Biden in the hours before Super Tuesday. Beto O’Rourke, who also ran for president this cycle, also endorsed Biden at his Monday night rally in Dallas.Other progressives, like Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, have said that Warren is standing in the way of Sanders and could push the party toward a contested convention.“Senator Warren has been an ally of the progressive movement throughout her entire career. But I hope she stops attacking Senator Sanders and publicly commits to give her delegates to him if he has more votes to ensure a progressive wins the nomination,” Rojas said in a statement. I'd say the same to Bernie. Pursuing the nomination through a contested convention without accumulating the most delegates would be harmful for our movement, our party, and the policies she's spent her life fighting for.""Spokespersons for Warren’s campaign did not respond for comment.On Monday morning, Democracy for America, one of the last major progressive organizations to endorse a candidate, voted to endorse Sanders over Warren with 79% of the voters in its endorsement poll choosing his candidacy and 13% choosing Warren. The group said in its announcement that it planned to continue to honor the progressive unity pledge it helped design in January and that it planned on “focusing its fire” on candidates supported by the corporate wing of the party.The groups who spoke with BuzzFeed News said that they didn’t currently see a need for a coordinated strategy against Biden’s campaign in the lead-up to Super Tuesday and that they’d planned on working independently of each other.“We’ve been making this argument against corporate Democrats for years and we’ve all worked together on that in the past,” Green told BuzzFeed News. “I think we’ve all been pushing a similar critique of his campaign independently of each other which is that Joe Biden is wrong on almost everything from cutting social security to being out of touch on gender and race issues when we need the most diverse coalition that we can get in the general election.”      ","Progressive Groups Aren’t Ready To Rally To Bernie Sanders To Oppose Joe Biden’s Centrist Army

"     SALT LAKE CITY — The news about Amy Klobuchar and Harry Reid broke in Utah just before Bernie Sanders took the stage. “Let me tell you something,” he yelled into the mic, backdropped by a sweep of mountains and snow. “The establishment is getting very, very nervous.”Past a crowd of more than 5,800 at an outdoor rally in Utah, in the open area set up for members of the press, his deputy campaign manager, Ari Rabin-Havt, arrived to insist that the building number of endorsements for Joe Biden’s presidential bid had changed nothing for the 78-year-old Vermont senator ahead of Super Tuesday contests here and in 14 other states and territories.Did Bernie know about Klobuchar and Reid’s support for Biden, a reporter asked.“Yes,” said Rabin-Havt.Was he freaked out?“No,” said Rabin-Havt.“He also knows about the Nation endorsing us and Democracy for America,” he said, two progressive institutions that recently announced their support for Sanders. “We believe regardless of all this, we are still the strongest campaign coming into Super Tuesday.”In a matter of hours, Biden’s presidential campaign has rapidly consolidated support from establishment and moderate Democrats, with two candidates dropping out to endorse his campaign and longtime party leaders jumping off the sidelines to back him before Super Tuesday.After wins in New Hampshire and Nevada last month, Sanders looked to be on a path to gaining at least a plurality of delegates with a strong performance in states like California and Texas this week. But Biden’s blowout victory in South Carolina last weekend — coupled with growing establishment fears about what a Sanders ticket would mean for the party’s chances both against Donald Trump and in House and Senate races this fall — has altered the race.Sanders typically celebrates any evidence of ""establishment backlash"" — framing it, in speeches and interviews, as proof his movement is working — but the news of moderates moving so quickly to halt his path could be a genuine concern for his chances this spring.Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who surged to best Biden in New Hampshire, ended her own presidential campaign Monday to back the former vice president. Former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, a longtime party titan in Nevada, endorsed Biden on Monday, saying he is the candidate “best able to defeat Donald Trump and enact the policies we all care about.” A slew of former Pete Buttigieg endorsers joined, as did former Obama-era officials like Susan Rice.Buttigieg, who suddenly bowed out of the race Sunday night, endorsed Biden just ahead of a campaign event in Dallas.""When I ran for president, we made it clear that the whole idea was about rallying the country together to defeat Donald Trump and to win the era for the values that we share, Buttigieg said with Biden at his side at a Dallas restaurant. ""And that was always a goal that was much bigger than me becoming president. And it is in the name of that very same goal that I'm delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president.""Beto O'Rourke, who ran for president until late last year, is also reportedly expected to endorse Biden on Monday.The remarkable turn of events has shrunk the presidential race to five candidates after more than a year of a sprawling and at times unruly Democratic field.Thousands of voters have already cast their ballots early in states that vote Tuesday, like Texas and California, where Sanders is poised to net delegates on Tuesday. But in a two-man race against Biden, he would face tougher odds in states later this spring where voters view him less favorably, such as Florida and Georgia.Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, who previously worked for Reid, responded to the wave of news after Klobuchar’s decision with disappointment.      Buttigieg’s exit from the race Sunday night triggered the stampede to Biden. Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia — the first member of Congress to endorse Buttigieg’s campaign — quickly shifted his support to Biden. Steve Adler, the mayor of Austin and another early Buttigieg backer, also moved to Biden. Both Virginia and Texas are Super Tuesday states.On Twitter, Biden’s aides essentially spiked the football. Staffers cheekily began tweeting their own endorsements of their boss and celebrating actual endorsements in real time while bragging about the speed at which they were coming.“DISCLAIMER: Not a comprehensive list,” a Biden spokesperson posted at the beginning of a thread that went on for 12 tweets.      On Monday afternoon, Sanders largely ignored the news.“The fact is after watching this campaign unfold, after watching 10 debates, there is no way you can rationally believe that Joe Biden is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump,” said Rabin-Havt, the Sanders adviser, at the rally in Salt Lake City.“Look, in fact, we did not expect to get the support of Democracy for America today,” he said of the progressive group, which made its surprise endorsement on Monday over Elizabeth Warren.“That is actually a big deal.”Compared to private and public discussion around the Biden campaign, when it became clear over the last two weeks that Sanders could rack up a delegate lead on Super Tuesday that would make it increasingly difficulty for a single candidate in a crowded field to catch up, there has been scant talk among progressives about an effort to consolidate support among voters on the left.      On Sunday morning, two days before Super Tuesday, Warren's campaign manager Roger Lau vowed to compete in the rest of the March caucuses and primaries, where hundreds of delegates will be awarded in 13 states and territories this month after Super Tuesday.“In the road to the nomination, the Wisconsin primary is halftime, and the convention in Milwaukee is the final play,” Lau wrote.Warren has yet to win a state and still faces significant hurdles with voters of color. In the memo, Lau predicted that while she may not win a Super Tuesday contest outright, she would collect delegates from ""nearly every state."" On Monday, after Klobuchar dropped out, Warren received the endorsement of EMILY’s List, a leading Washington group that supports pro–abortion rights women.Before his rally here on Monday, in a press conference at a DoubleTree in downtown Salt Lake City, Sanders dismissed questions about Warren's campaign and her future in the Democratic primary.“I can't speak for Sen. Warren,” he said. “She will do what she wants.”And reports of moderates moving in private to push Buttigieg out of the race to try to blunt Sanders’ chances?The Vermont senator threw up his hands in mock amazement.“I am shocked by that!”      ","Moderates Are Consolidating Behind Joe Biden.

"     The Justice Department and FBI have turned over to BuzzFeed News and CNN the latest cache of highly secretive interview summaries from former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and President Donald Trump’s attempts to obstruct the inquiry.The documents include interview summaries from Trump adviser Jared Kushner, former campaign chair Paul Manafort, former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates, and former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon.Excerpts from some of the interview summaries, known as FBI 302s, are sprinkled throughout Mueller’s report, but many details were omitted. For example, interview summaries released to BuzzFeed News last month revealed that former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe told investigators he had met with other officials several times after FBI director James Comey was fired to discuss ""whether there was predication to open an obstruction investigation on Trump” and other Russia-related investigations.The summaries also showed that senior advisers Stephen Miller and Kushner, along with former communications director Hope Hicks, sometimes drafted tweets for Trump, that Bannon didn’t think the “Putin stuff” was a big deal, and that former national security adviser Michael Flynn sought guidance from Obama administration officials Susan Rice and Ben Rhodes “about how to do things.”Since last November, the government has released about 1,700 pages of interview summaries representing more than 100 interviews. The majority of the documents released thus far have been heavily redacted. BuzzFeed News began a legal challenge last month to one particular category of exemption from the Freedom of Information Act.The Mueller report was the most hotly anticipated prosecutorial document in a generation, laying out the evidence of Russia's interference in the 2016 election and Trump’s attempts to obstruct the investigation. But at 448 pages, it reflected only a tiny fraction of the primary-source documents that Mueller’s team had amassed over the course of its investigation.Last May, BuzzFeed News, and later CNN, filed Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the FBI and Justice Department to gain access to the thousands of pages of interview summaries of all the witnesses who spoke to FBI agents and investigators.Here are the highlights from this installment:Jared Kushner explained back-channel meetings with then–Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak      The documents include a heavily redacted interview summary from April 11, 2018, with Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, which was released following a lengthy review by intelligence agencies.Kushner told investigators during the eight-hour interview that former HBO chair Richard Plepler invited him to a Time Warner luncheon with Henry Kissinger and Dimitri Simes, who ran a pro-Kremlin think tank in Washington, DC. Kushner told agents he pursued Simes at a time when “the campaign was having a hard time getting people to support them.”Simes had reportedly tried to peddle to Kushner compromising information on Bill and Hillary Clinton’s ties to Russia. But Kushner told investigators he “never got from Simes information that could be ‘operationalized.’”During his interview with investigators, Kushner also discussed his meeting then–Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak who said to Kushner, ""we like what your candidate is saying. It's refreshing.""Kushner said “they discussed Syria and having the Russian generals brief” national security adviser Michael Flynn. According to the interview summary, Flynn said there was not a secure line of communication, so Kushner asked whether they could communicate using the Russian Embassy. Kislyak quickly said, “no that won't work.”“Kushner told Kislyak that he wanted to make sure he was speaking with people ‘who can make decisions,’” the 33-page interview summary said.Kislyak also met with Avi Berkowitz, an attorney and political adviser to Trump and Kushner. Kislyak told Berkowitz that Kushner “should meet with someone else who was a better channel through which to communicate to Putin.”Kushner also discussed his meeting with Sergey Gorkov, the head of the Russian state-owned bank Vnesheconombank (VEB). Kushner told investigators he did not prepare for the meeting and that no one from the transition team had “googled Gorkov.”“The meeting with Gorkov presenting Kushner with two very thoughtful gifts; a bag of dirt/soil from the town in Belarus where Kushner’s family is from and a painting,” the interview summary says.Kushner told investigators he did not recall anything about VEB “being sanctioned, or any discussions of US sanctions.”A former foreign policy adviser ripped into Trump’s “shady” campaign and the president himself      J.D. Gordon, a Trump campaign adviser during the 2016 election, unloaded on Trump and the campaign, telling Mueller’s team he was “glad the interviewing Agents were speaking with him as he believed there were a lot of shenanigans happening at the highest levels.”Gordon, a Navy veteran and former Pentagon spokesperson, spoke in unusually vivid detail about dysfunction within the campaign’s foreign policy team and the controversial changes to the Republican platform surrounding Ukraine during the 2016 convention. Several noteworthy details from his interviews with the special counsel’s office were excluded from Mueller’s final report.“Gordon described the Trump campaign as being disorganized and chaotic at times and stated it was important for the Agents to understand that concept when conducting this investigation,” according to an August 2017 interview summary.Among Gordon’s complaints were that Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks had lied about contacts between the campaign and Russians.“Gordon said he hoped the Russian investigation was very thorough,” the summary says. “Gordon thinks Trump must be guilty of something. He is constantly ripping people off. Trump lies all the time and surrounds himself with people who don't tell the truth. Gordon explained Hicks had lied about contact with Russians. Gordon thinks she probably lied to protect Trump whether she knew anything or not.”He also complained that he didn’t get paid for his work on the campaign as promised, prompting him to quit on Aug. 10, 2016.“Gordon was offered a position with the Presidential Transition Team but said he wouldn't show up until he got a check and he never received payment,” the summary says. “The campaign was shady and dishonest.”Gordon said then-senator Jeff Sessions, who ran the campaign’s foreign policy team and later became Trump’s attorney general, was a “good friend” who had offered him the campaign job. But things didn’t go well, according to Gordon.“Gordon described the foreign policy team as being run like a 6th grade student council with no real authority or power,” the summary states. Gordon also said that “the last person to speak to Trump has the most influence on his decisions,” and that Jared Kushner “had a lot of say with Trump.”In one apparent example of campaign dysfunction, Gordon said that Walid Phares, another foreign policy adviser, “had come up with a list of ambassadors to meet with and when Kushner found out, Kushner said only he would be meeting with ambassadors.” Kushner “came up with an idea, which Gordon jokingly referred to as ‘win a call with Kushner,’ where campaign members were asked to write bios on various ambassadors and Kushner would have a phone call with whoever wrote the best ambassador bios about those particular ambassadors.” Phares quit two weeks into the gig after Rick Dearborn, another campaign official, told the advisers “they couldn't meet with ambassadors.”Gordon and someone whose name is redacted “got stuck writing the bios,” and Kushner eventually met with ambassadors for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, according to the summary.“At one point, [REDACTED] sent Dearborn a note about Kushner's outreaches after finding out [REDACTED] tried to setup a meeting with the Saudi prince,” the summary says. “Gordon had [REDACTED] talk to Dearborn about going through the embassies to setup meetings because back channels are always about money.”Gordon said it was Sam Clovis, another campaign adviser, who came up with the list of who would serve on the foreign policy team. The list included Phares, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, and Keith Kellogg, among others.“Eventually Clovis was pushed out of his role,” Gordon’s summary states. Page and Papadopoulos “were bad news for the campaign.” Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI as part of Mueller’s probe.In May 2016, Gordon and Phares were planning to fire Papadopoulos “after a story broke about his statements to the British press,” but Clovis wanted to give him another chance, the summary says. “They were worried that if they fired Papadopoulos he would go to the press and tell them that the foreign policy advisor team was a scam.”Gordon spoke to investigators about two key events that Mueller scrutinized in his final report. His interview summary paints a more vivid picture of one of those events, an encounter with Sergey Kislyak at a reception following an event for ambassadors in Cleveland at the same time as the 2016 Republican National Convention.Mueller’s report said that “Gordon ran into Kislyak as the two prepared plates of food, and they decided to sit at the same table to eat.” There, they were joined by Page and the ambassadors from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. “As they ate, Gordon and Kislyak talked for what Gordon estimated to have been three to five minutes, during which Gordon again mentioned that he meant what he said in his speech about improving U.S.-Russia relations.”Gordon’s interview summary notes that the reception was “a networking event” that offered free food and drink, and that Gordon and Kislyak encountered one another at “the chicken satay tray.” Gordon also said that he “knew the Kazakh ambassador prior to this event.” Page, according to Gordon, “briefly spoke with Kislyak and the Azerbaijan ambassador.” Gordon said he and Kislyak not only spoke about US–Russia relations; they also “talked about Russia's attempt to warn the U.S. about the Boston bomber.”Gordon also shed light on how the Republican platform came to present less forceful language around Ukraine and Russia than what was originally proposed.On March 31, 2016, the foreign policy team held a two-hour meeting in Washington, DC, Gordon said. It was then that Papadopoulos proposed a Trump–Putin meeting.“Gordon described Papadopoulos as acting on his own and wheeling and dealing,” the interview summary states. “Papadopoulos said he was working with the ambassador in the United Kingdom and Putin was interested in meeting with Trump, working through the ambassador to make it happen. Sessions said it was a bad idea and shut it down. Apparently Papadopoulos kept doing it, repeatedly going around Gordon.”During both his August 2017 interview and a 2019 interview with Mueller’s office, Gordon recalled comments Trump made about Ukraine and Russia. “In that meeting, Trump said the Europeans should do more about the situation in Ukraine,” reads the summary of an interview with Gordon on Feb. 14, 2019. “Trump had also said he wanted better relations with Russia and he didn't want World War III over Ukraine.”Mueller’s report detailed how months later at the RNC, delegate Diana Denman proposed an amendment to the platform that expressed support for Ukraine in the midst of Russia’s ""ongoing military aggression"" — support that included ""providing lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine's armed forces.”“Gordon stated that he flagged this amendment because of Trump's stated position on Ukraine, which Gordon personally heard the candidate say at the March 31 foreign policy meeting — namely, that the Europeans should take primary responsibility for any assistance to Ukraine, that there should be improved U.S.-Russia relations, and that he did not want to start World War III over that region,” the Mueller report says. The amendment was eventually edited from “lethal assistance” to “appropriate assistance.”In his 2017 interview summary, Gordon said Denman was “hell-bent on arming Ukraine” and that he had heard that she “had been to Ukraine and was involved in elections monitoring there. Denman was a [Ted] Cruz delegate and a protagonist.”Gordon said Denman “was upset” by his desire to “withdraw the whole amendment.” He also said that Trump and Manafort “exacerbated the issue by lying about the platform in the news on July 31.”“Manafort denied the campaign's involvement in changing the platform in an interview with Chuck Todd,” the summary states. “Gordon explained that the campaign was involved in legitimately changing the amendment through debate. Trump doesn't pay attention and ended up saying the same thing in an interview with George Stephanopoulos. Trump said he had heard the campaign was involved in the change but he had nothing to do with the platform change.”Near the end of his interview that day, Gordon heaped more criticism on Trump — but stopped short of accusing him of collusion. Though the beginning of the sentence is redacted, the summary says “Trump was involved in inappropriate activity” and that “Gordon made this statement based on 3500 lawsuits Trump is involved in, business deals with Russia, not paying his policy office. The investigators could likely find something illegal Trump was involved in but Gordon is not aware of any election meddling that Trump was involved in.”A delegate interview contradicted Mueller's finding      In May and June 2017, prosecutors and FBI agents interviewed two delegates to the Republican National Convention to understand what happened with the party’s platform on Ukraine.One delegate proposed language pledging “lethal defensive weapons” to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, but the platform was softened to promise “appropriate assistance.”In his report, the special counsel wrote that his investigation didn’t establish that the efforts by Gordon — a Trump official watching the process — “to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia.”Diana Denman wanted the party to take a strong stand and arm Ukraine. She said Gordon told her he needed to clear that amendment with “New York.” Denman asked Gordon three times with whom he was speaking in New York. Gordon reportedly told her it was Donald Trump.“Denman noted she only shared Trump’s name as the guy in New York with the interviewing agents and refused to tell it to reporters,” the summary said.Denman’s amendment was set to the side — the only one tabled during the meeting. Another delegate, Rachel Hoff, said the campaign hadn’t weighed in elsewhere about the platform and described Gordon’s move as a “rare intervention.”The committee ultimately watered down Denman’s proposal.Gordon told the FBI that Trump often said he wanted to avoid “World War III” with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. He denied changing the platform and said Denman was “hell bent” on arming Ukraine.Gordon denied telling Denman that he was ever on the phone with Trump and said he called Rick Dearborn, another campaign adviser. He “might have said to Denman that he had talked to Trump about these issues in the past” and accused Denman of leaking the changes to the press.The FBI summary notes, however, that Gordon acknowledged Trump and Manafort “exacerbated” the matter by making misstatements on TV about the campaign’s involvement in the platform changes.A Trump campaign aide said Flynn set up a transition period call between Trump and the Afghan president      Matthew Miller, another Trump campaign aide, says he knew Michael Flynn — Trump’s eventual national security adviser who was fired less than a month into the job — from time spent as a civilian Defense Department employee in Afghanistan.Flynn used his connections there to set up a phone call between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Trump during the transition period, a summary of an October 2017 interview with Miller says. Flynn set up the call “in December 2016 utilizing an ambassador contact Flynn had in Afghanistan.”Miller also provided details about the changes to the Republican platform in 2016 regarding Ukraine. “The campaign was there to target amendments that may be troublesome,” Miller’s interview summary reads.“It was as non-nefarious as it comes since the NATO mentality was if you attack one you attack all and it shouldn't just fall on the U.S. to defend Ukraine,” Miller said of the changes. The interview summary states, “Miller didn't think it made sense for the platform to lock the president in to making such a significant commitment to defend Ukraine. Gordon talked to Denman about lightening the amendment and eventually the lightened version passed the vote.”Miller also described Denman as “grandmotherly,” the summary says. When he and Gordon spoke with her about changing her amendment, she was “hesitant about the changes but didn't object.”Roger Stone met with a Russian national who wanted to sell him dirt on Hillary Clinton      The documents included an interview summary with a mysterious figure: Henry Oknyansky, also known as Henry Greenberg, a Russian national who in 2016 wanted to sell Roger Stone dirt on Hillary Clinton for $2 million.Stone’s meeting with Greenberg was publicized in a Washington Post story in June 2018. A month later, investigators from Mueller’s team met with Greenberg at the special counsel’s office in Washington, DC.Greenberg told investigators he met with Stone and Republican strategist Michael Caputo in May 2016. Greenberg was joined at the meeting with his Ukrainian associate, Alexei Rasin, “who offered Stone damaging information on Hillary Clinton.”“Rasin formerly worked for Clinton and was allegedly in possession of financial statements which demonstrated her involvement in money laundering activities with Rasin’s companies. Stone inquired about the amount of financial misappropriations related to Clinton and asked if it was in the amount of millions. Rasin relayed that it was rather somewhere in the amount of hundreds of thousands. Stone ultimately refuted the offer and stated that he did not believe Donald Trump would pay for opposition research information. The meeting then concluded shortly thereafter,” the interview summary states.Greenberg said Rasin has tried to find other buyers for the information he had but was unsuccessful. Greenberg told investigators his motivation was purely financial as he would have received a portion of the proceeds from the sale.The Washington Post story quoted Stone as saying that Greenberg was a longtime FBI informant. The interview summary says Greenberg used to communicate with FBI special agents whose names are redacted and that he “still maintains contact with many individuals who may be of interest to the FBI.”Former FBI director James Comey found government documents while packing for a move      Former FBI director James Comey called the bureau two months after Trump fired him to let officials know that “while packing for an upcoming move, he found a folder with government documents,” according to the interview summary of James Rybicki, Comey’s former chief of staff.Rybicki told Mueller’s team in early August 2017 that a couple weeks prior, Comey had “called the front office telephone number and left a telephone message for Rybicki,” who returned Comey’s call the same day.“Comey agreed to provide the documents the next day when individuals from FBI Finance & Facilities Division (FFD) were returning Comey's personal property,” the interview summary says.The next day, employees from the FFD “retrieved one blue ‘standard’ folder from Comey at his residence,” the summary says. “The folder contained a one page email, a one page chart with handwritten notes on the back and civil litigation paperwork for Comey.” The interview summary doesn’t go into any more detail about the nature of the documents.Rybicki got the records on the same day, then “requested guidance from FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe later that evening on how to handle the documents,” the summary says. McCabe asked that “Comey's civil litigation paperwork go to the FBI's Office of General Counsel (OGC) and the remaining items be provided to FBI's Records Management Division. Rybicki sent the civil litigation paperwork to [REDACTED] the Acting Deputy General Counsel at OGC.”The interview summary says Rybicki also spoke with then–FBI associate deputy director David Bowdich “regarding the remaining documents.” Someone whose name is redacted “retrieved the documents from Rybicki” a couple days later.Previously released interview summaries detailed how Rybicki and Comey kept track of the memos the former FBI director wrote about his interactions with Trump.Rob Goldstone talked about a gift to Trump from a Russian real estate mogul      An interview summary for Rob Goldstone, the music publicist who worked for pop singer Emin Agalarov and helped set up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, appeared to provide more detail about gifts that Emin’s father, Russian real estate giant Aras Agalarov, gave Trump. The Mueller report simply states that Agalarov and Trump “exchanged gifts and letters in 2016,” citing Goldstone’s February interview and others. The newly released summary, however, includes a line that says “a gift for Trump from Emin Agalarov and Aras Agalarov” — father and son. It’s unclear when the Agalarovs gave this gift, as everything around the line is redacted. However, a report by House Democrats in early 2018 found that “At key campaign milestones, the Agalarovs sent notes wishing good luck, conveying congratulations, and offering gifts to Donald Trump” and that the “communications generally occurred through Rob Goldstone.”The summary also provides a more specific date for when Goldstone says he stopped working with Emin Agalarov. The Mueller report says it was in late 2016, while Goldstone’s interview summary says October 2016 — a month before Trump was elected.An adviser said he told Papadopoulos to “shut up” and not engage with Russia      Sam Clovis, the Trump adviser who briefly served in the Agriculture Department, told FBI agents he ordered George Papadopoulos to “shut up” and to not engage with Russia during the 2016 campaign.Clovis described three attempts by campaign surrogates or supporters to set up meetings with Russia, but said he warned his colleagues to steer clear. During his October 2017 interview, Clovis called himself a “Sovietologist” and said he recommended a policy that any paid members of the campaign be required to report any contact with a foreign official.“Russia can be very sneaky and will try to distract you on one side while sneaking by you on the other side,” Clovis told the agents.He explained that he felt like he was “herding cats” while organizing the scattershot foreign policy team and others on the Trump campaign. The summary by FBI agents recorded Clovis saying Gen. Michael Flynn did not have “much depth or thought.” He said Papadopoulos couldn’t be trusted to not talk to the press. He called Stephen Miller a “chameleon.” He said Ivanka Trump was the president’s “blind spot, his princess.”Clovis told the agents that he worked briefly with Ivanka on policies about the Family and Medical Leave Act but he had to remind her that “they were running as Republicans” — and helped her develop more conservative policies.Describing himself as one of the few people who emerged from the campaign without any “scars,” Clovis said he was troubled when the Republican Party changed its platform on Ukraine at the convention and that he fretted over Trump’s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.“The ‘bromance’ Trump had with Putin bothered Clovis but the press and the public fed on it,” FBI agents wrote. “Clovis felt he had to clean up after with a shovel because Trump played up his bromance with Putin for the public.”Manafort maintained close contact with the Trump White House      Roughly 200 pages of the summaries are dedicated to “proffers” by Rick Gates, interviews with FBI agents after his plea deal to tell them everything he knew on more than a dozen subjects.Among the items:Gates described a meeting at the Grand Havana Room in Manhattan with Paul Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik, who is suspected of being a Russian spy. There, Manafort was showing off about his success on the Trump campaign and told Kilimnik about a strategy to win blue-collar workers in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — the very states about which Manafort would later turn over internal polling data.At that same meeting, Gates said Manafort turned down an offer to work on behalf of ousted Ukrainian politician Viktor Yanukovych.Manafort’s proximity to the Trump White House continued through at least February 2018. Gates told the agents that Manafort spoke regularly to intermediaries — such as Kushner and Rudy Giuliani — to get associates appointed to administration jobs.Gates told the agents about his involvement in “insider trading and/or securities fraud offenses” connected to an identity theft company. This section is heavily redacted.Flynn was the campaign official who came up with the “lock her up” slogan, Gates said.Giuliani was on tap to be attorney general — but, Gates said, he “overplayed his hand” and felt he was due a much more influential role in the administration.After the election, Gates said he was approached by an unidentified person who was close to the prime minister of Malaysia, who was accused of looting $700 million from a state development fund called 1MDB. Gates said the person asked him to help “resolve the 1MDB issue between the Malaysian government and the US government.”Gates recalled that Trump told this person the “issue would be resolved” but “Trump did not expound on what he meant.” The person suggested meetings with H.R. McMaster, then the national security adviser, and then–secretary of state Rex Tillerson, but Gates said those meetings wouldn’t be possible. Gates drafted talking points about 1MDB but eventually dropped the issue by February 2018.A Manafort associate had ""no doubt"" he'd met with Russian intelligence      In January 2018, former BBC journalist Jonathan Hawker voluntarily met with agents and prosecutors about his consultancy work with Gates and Manafort; Hawker said he split with the duo “because of his experience in Ukraine and not being paid in full.”In heavily redacted portions of the FBI interview summary, Hawker was asked about work done by the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom with Manafort in Ukraine. The firm ultimately settled a lobbying case with the Justice Department. Hawker described Gates and Skadden lawyer Alex van der Zwaan as having “the active nightlife” while in Ukraine.Hawker told FBI agents about his final meeting with Kilimnik, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late 2015. Kilimnik told Hawker about a “PR opportunity in Russia” and invited the American to meet with someone from the Russian foreign ministry.The FBI summary doesn’t include the name of the person that Hawker met with, but he did tell agents that “he had no doubt the person he met with was a Russian operative.” Hawker said he submitted a proposal for the job but asked for such an “outrageously high price” that there was no way he would get it.Trump, Mueller, and the big chess match      The documents released Monday include an interview with a prominent figure in the chess world, which sheds more light on the special counsel’s interest in a major match attended by powerful Russians just days after Trump was elected.Mueller’s report says that senior Russian government officials — such as press secretary Dmitry Peskov and Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund — traveled to New York for the match between Norwegian and Russian players in November 2016. Dmitriev tried to use the event to meet people close to Trump but was apparently largely unsuccessful, according to the special counsel’s findings. Otherwise, the event is scarcely mentioned in the Mueller report; in written responses to Mueller’s team, Trump said he didn’t attend the event — though the Trump Organization had been asked months before to host it.“Although one World Chess Federation official recalled hearing from an attendee that President-Elect Trump had stopped by the tournament, the investigation did not establish that Trump or any Campaign or Transition Team official attended the event,” the Mueller report states.That official was Beatriz Marinello, who was then the vice president of the World Chess Federation. Mueller’s team spoke with her in May 2018, and the interview is cited only in this one instance in the final report.But the complete interview summary, released Monday, fleshes out what the FBI heard about Trump’s purported attendance at the match and a Russian businessperson’s role in organizing the event. Marinello said “various celebrities and prominent businessmen from New York attended,” including actor Woody Harrelson, and that “the event was full of Russians.” She said she “remembered seeing the Russian Press Officer at the event,” but couldn’t remember the person’s name.“Another individual at the event claimed that Putin was in Florida on that day,” the summary says. “Marinello believed that statement to be false however, as she did not see any news coverage of Putin being in Florida.”Marinello said Ilya Merenzon, the CEO of a company called Agon, organized the event. She said she thought he “may have formerly worked for” Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of the World Chess Federation who was placed under US sanctions in 2015.“During the first week of the 2016 WCC, Merenzon showed Marinello a photograph on his cell phone and told her it was a photo of Donald Trump attending the event,” Marinello’s interview summary reads. “Marinello did not get a good look at the photograph because Merenzon held it from a distance. Marinello could tell the photograph depicted three men but could not identify any of them. Marinello did not see Trump at the event but stated that it was possible he had attended in the VIP area and that she may not have seen him.”Marinello recounted to investigators how more than a year later, she went to Moscow and on the way back ran into Merenzon on her flight. “Marinello recalled asking Merenzon, ‘Do you still have the photo?’ to which Merenzon quickly responded, 'No,'” the summary says of the March 2018 encounter. “Marinello clarified that she did not specifically ask Merenzon if he had the photograph of Trump but she was positive he understood her inquiry to be related to it based on his response.”Marinello said Merenzon had “brought many Russians to the United States for the 2016 WCC,” according to the summary. Marinello guessed that he had brought 10 to 20 “mostly females,” whom she described as “young and casual.”“Merenzon was insistent that the Russians be brought to the United States early, prior to the event,” the summary states. “Merenzon assisted with obtaining office space for them in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. They utilized that space for approximately two months. They rented two small offices located just off of Broadway.”Marinello said the Russians “seemed guarded” when they spoke with her and “only engaged with her when they needed something.”“They often had conference calls with Moscow and were very disorganized,” the summary says. “They had no prior connections to New York and for most of them, it was their first time visiting the United States. Marinello provided that, in normal circumstances, the organizers of the event provided the infrastructure [NFI] needed for the event. In this case, the Russians brought their own infrastructure.” A “case agent note” says Marinello could have been referring “to either computers and/or telecommunications equipment” when she spoke about infrastructure.Throughout the interview, Marinello said she would look for additional information to give the FBI agents, indicating that they were interested in learning more. For instance, near the end, she agreed to search “various documents” to try to find the names of the Russians who worked at the 2016 event for the FBI agents. She also said she would give them copies of the invitations that the Russians received and would search “her cell phone for any additional information which could provide further insight about Russian activities at the 2016 WCC.”“Hannity tailored his shows to the agenda Manafort suggested.”      Sean Hannity continues to be a major presence in the interview summaries. BuzzFeed News previously reported that Hannity had been mentioned more than a dozen times since the Justice Department and FBI began releasing the interviews last November. He often provided guidance and advice to witnesses in the Mueller probe without disclosing it to his audience.The latest entry for Hannity includes this detail from Gates’s FBI interview summary in February 2018. Hannity was a Trump supporter who publicly applauded Manafort's hiring by the Trump campaign. Hannity said, ""Finally, we have an adult in the room"" when Manafort was hired. During the campaign, he tailored his shows to the agenda Manafort suggested. Hannity called himself a ""pundit,"" not ""a journalist.""","Mueller Memos Part 6: What Witnesses Told Investigators About Trump And Russia
        ","            Last updated on March 2, 2020, at 11:49 p.m. ET                Posted on March 2, 2020, at 4:55 p.m. ET      ",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/mueller-report-secret-memos-part-6,buzzfeed
"     A few weeks ago, after the very loose Las Vegas debate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar sat down with CNN’s Erin Burnett, who asked various questions and then teed up a clip of Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg arguing over what it meant that she had forgotten the Mexican president's name.When CNN returned to the live shot, Burnett and Klobuchar sat side by side in folding chairs, squinting grimly at what appeared to be a monitor located somewhere offscreen.“You went on to say,” Burnett said, glancing down at her notebook, “'Not everyone can be as perfect as you are' to Mayor Pete. But what were you thinking in that moment?”Of course, we all know what Amy Klobuchar was thinking in that moment. For nearly 24 hours, as soon as Buttigieg dropped out, Twitter was alight with Klobuchar’s name and GIFs following a narrative of satisfaction and mirth (even if she, of course, tweeted her great respect and regard for the former mayor).      On Monday afternoon, Klobuchar herself dropped out of the race and announced she’d be flying to Texas and endorsing Joe Biden in person and onstage, just hours before Minnesota’s not insignificant Tuesday primary.All of this came just after Buttigieg quit but before he too could endorse Biden — a narrow gap that allowed Klobuchar just one last triumph over the perfect Pete Buttigieg.Or, at the very least, that’s how a lot of people received the news: an online/group text festival of joy in spite. Her distaste for the younger, less traditionally credentialed, male Buttigieg — and the churning rage she plainly felt toward parts of the nominating process — has been one of the rare moments of collective consciousness this election cycle. It was as though, like at the same time, our eyes finally adjusted to a dark room.And maybe because it's so personal, and so entirely detached from the outcome of the election, that it also became a great source of joy online. When Biden's campaign manager mocked the Buttigieg campaign’s third-place performance in Nevada on Twitter, wrote Jon Lovett of Klobuchar, “Let's see if she gives it the old RT.”This aspect of Klobuchar registers differently with people: delight, ironic delight, a leery kind of recognition, a righteous kind of recognition, an outright distaste for the passive aggression on display. Most debates, however, involved at least a few moments of the rage that suggests Klobuchar in her suit and New Balance sneakers pulling out a book of matches while “Smells Like Teen Spirit” cues up.      This was the candidate caught in frame regarding glacially Sen. Bernie Sanders, Biden, and Tom Steyer. This was the candidate who enters a gym in Iowa mid-caucus and goes first to the people in Pete's corner. This is the candidate who remembers a criticism about Washington experience in the November debate and rebuts that line in the December debate.“As usual,” she said last weekend after the Nevada caucus results, “I think we have exceeded expectations. A lot of people didn’t think I’d be standing at this point.”Many of Klobuchar's prepared remarks worked in that two-step formulation: a) a quip in which she has implicitly persevered over a slight, followed by b) a practical answer or plan on policy — often crowd-pleasing, if not as ideological as progressives would like. In this, there's a portrait of Klobuchar: smart, formidable, dissatisfied. There's a National song with this kind of tone, a breakup song. “Besides, I barely ever see you anymore / And when I do it feels like you're only halfway there,” the song goes. “Young mothers love me / Even ghosts of girlfriends call from Cleveland / They will meet me anytime and anywhere.”People have sliced this in different ways: as part of a feminist frustration with male mediocrity or, incorporating what former staffers described as Klobuchar's abusive behavior as a boss, into an argument about the poisonous #GirlBoss.Because there is a darker edge at work here. This was also the candidate who, after failing to name the Mexican president in an interview, cut that interview short, leaving so quickly that her microphone was still attached. She returned an hour later — after telling a different interviewer the Mexican president's name (as she told Burnett, “I have since, many times, said the president's name in numerous other interviews and made it very clear that I know his name”) — to find the Telemundo interviewer and say: “So you see that I know more than you think.”That this element of Klobuchar can be alarming and a source of satisfied comedy is the result of something simple. Klobuchar is deeply competent and, clearly, deeply flawed; the distance between those two things in public life is an authentic individual.","Amy Klobuchar May Be Out Of The Race, But Her Wrath Will Endure

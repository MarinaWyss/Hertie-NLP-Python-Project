"     FLINT, Mich. — It was a rare move for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign.As the candidate prepared to fly to a town hall in Flint, Michigan — a state whose diverse working-class electorate could decide his future in the Democratic primary — an aide gathered reporters to make an announcement: Sanders would “directly address the African-American community and make the case for why black voters should support him over Joe Biden.""Everyone took note, tapping furiously on their iPhones.It's not often that Sanders deviates from his core message about social and economic injustice, delivered daily to thousands of people across the country at rallies that clock in, as if by science, at 47 minutes. He hardly ever directs a speech to a specific demographic. And he almost never asks his campaign team to preview a major address to reporters in order to ensure coverage.But a couple hours later, when Sanders stepped to the podium in Flint, he did not give his prepared remarks on race — instead delivering his familiar stump speech, making only brief mention of “a same-old, same-old status quo politics” that, he said, has “failed African-American communities.”After the event, as the campaign’s press bus idled outside the venue, Sanders communications director Mike Casca told reporters that the candidate scrapped his prepared remarks after discussing the event backstage with panelists, including community leaders in Flint and one of his top supporters, Dr. Cornel West.The crowd in Flint, a majority black city affected by a horrifying lead-water crisis, was mostly white on Saturday.“It was a change they thought was important,” Casca said, describing the decision as both a deliberate one by Sanders and an “one of those on-the-fly backstage moments.”“They wanted to lift up the panelists’ stories.""According to Casca, Sanders worked on the speech on plane rides between campaign events in Michigan and Illinois, two states that will vote in the Democratic primary on Tuesday after a disappointing finish for Sanders against Biden last week in Southern states where black voters made up the majority in Democratic primaries.“They talked over the idea and decided it was probably better to let the people of color who were on the panel discuss instead of him giving a traditional speech,” said Casca.“He does not have those experiences,” he added. “He is a white Jewish man.”Casca said the drafts of the original speech aimed to contrast Sanders and Biden’s record on racial justice — but he declined multiple times to say on which policy areas or votes.Asked whether the candidate will eventually deliver the speech, Casca said, “TBD.”Sanders's town halls, designed as a platform for individual stories of the working class, became an unexpectedly emotional centerpiece of his second presidential campaign through the summer and fall. Although he has largely held traditional rallies since voting began in February, he has said he believes voters' stories can be a more effective tool than any speech.The campaign billed Saturday's event as a town hall on ""racial and economic justice.""All week, at campaign stops across Arizona, Michigan, and Illinois, Sanders has laced into Biden's decades-long record on trade, economic issues, foreign policy, abortion, and LGBT rights. But he stopped short of doing the same with racial justice issues on Saturday night.Sanders, a 78-year-old independent from the mostly white state of Vermont, has struggled to attract, especially, middle-aged and older black voters to his coalition of young people, Latino voters, and white working-class voters.""He didn't want to speak on behalf of people of color when there were people of color on the panel,"" said Casca.Aside from a 30-minute speech at the start of the event, the six panelists spoke more than the candidate himself. Only at one point on Saturday night did Sanders attempt to create an explicit contrast with Biden, teeing up a lengthy question for West, the famed scholar and progressive activist.""Dr. West, there was a headline in today's Detroit News,"" he said, picking up a copy of the newspaper. ""And the headline said, 'Biden sees advantage with Michigan back voters.' OK?"" Sanders, still addressing West, began to list off a litany of statistics about black Americans: a larger wealth gap, a higher poverty rate, a higher rate for the uninsured and under-insured, lower life expectancies, lower pay rates. Do you think, he asked West, given “the reality of the condition of the African-American community right now that supporting a status quo, same old, same old type of politician is going to address these issues?”Sanders effectively asked West to make the case on his behalf.The professor stood with the mic, praising Sanders as an exemplar of “integrity, honesty, and decency"" who is ""never up for sale"" — before describing Biden as a ""neoliberal centrist.”“The neoliberalist who all of a sudden now is coming back to life — and the catalyst was my own black people. Oh, I'm so disappointed. Oh, I'm so upset,” West told the crowd in Flint.“Skin pigmentation doesn't determine your moral and spiritual formation. You gotta decide who you are.”Four years ago, Hillary Clinton effectively ended Sanders's first presidential campaign in the South, where black voters generally make up a majority of Democratic primary electorates and heavily favored her candidacy. Sanders, at times, struggled talking about race during the campaign, showing early frustration when he was interrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters and had occasionally uncomfortable interactions with activists.“His framework is income inequality and economic justice. He sees that as the all-inclusive tent,” Curtiss Reed Jr., the executive director of the Vermont Partnership for Fairness and Diversity, said in a 2018 interview.In the intervening years, Sanders has more often brought racial justice more to the fore of his campaign; he speaks often of wanting to build a multi-racial coalition. His theory of the 2020 campaign involved a massive turnout operation, in which working-class voters of all races would find common cause in issues like ending medical and educational debt, and along the way, convert non-voters into voters.The Sanders campaign heavily organized on the campuses of historical black colleges and universities in states like South and North Carolina, hoping to capitalize on his support among younger black voters.But over the last two weeks, in exit polling and in the returns, Sanders has still struggled to make substantial gains with black voters, particularly those in the South and those who are over age 30.What message did they hope Saturday night delivered to black voters?""That Sen. Sanders stands with them,"" Casca said, ""and his agenda would bring the most powerful change to their lives.""","Bernie Sanders Scrapped A Planned Speech On Race

"     NEW DELHI — A tweet by Tulsi Gabbard, the only woman remaining in the US presidential race, about experiencing “Hinduphobia” in the US has added fuel to escalating communal tensions in India.“Unfortunately, Hinduphobia is very real,” Gabbard wrote, “I've experienced it directly in each of my campaigns for Congress & in this presidential race.""      Gabbard quote-tweeted a US-based psychiatrist from Kashmir, who shared a screenshot of an anonymous Facebook post with the comment: “Blatantly biased news & anti-Hindu propaganda has real-world consequences for innocent people.”The anonymous Facebook post described an alleged encounter between two women and their Uber driver, who blamed Indian Hindus for “killing Muslims in New Delhi,” when he learned the women were Hindu. The driver then allegedly asked the women to get out of his car. BuzzFeed News has reached out to Gabbard and the woman she retweeted to find out more about the Facebook post, which could not be independently verified or located online.Gabbard’s tweet has since been shared on right-wing news websites in India and discussed on news channels.      It comes at an especially tense time in India, which has witnessed a week of horrifying communal violence in its capital, New Delhi.The violence began as a series of skirmishes between Hindus and Muslims on Feb. 23, a day after a member of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India’s Hindu nationalist ruling party, threatened to displace a group of Muslim women protesters by force. The women were protesting a discriminatory new citizenship law passed by the BJP.On Feb. 24, as Modi welcomed Donald and Melania Trump for a 36-hour visit, entire neighborhoods of northeast New Delhi were burnt down, and at least four mosques desecrated.The number of people killed as a result of the rioting is still rising — a hospital in New Delhi estimated the death toll was over 50. As of last week, bodies are still being recovered from of a drain in the neighborhood where the worst of the violence occurred.      Yet by Monday, these skirmishes had escalated into an attack on northeast New Delhi’s Muslim residents. A growing body of evidence — including video footage of police rioting alongside Hindu men — suggests members of New Delhi’s police chose to side with the Hindu community.Indian Twitter has been deeply divided over whether the violence was in fact anti-Muslim, or a spontaneous outburst that affected “both sides.”Hindu and Muslim lives have been lost in the violence. But the the footage of the police suggests the Hindu mobs acted with an impunity stemming from the belief that they had the support of the state. In recent weeks, BJP leaders appeared to prepare the ground for precisely such a confrontation, making several speeches across New Delhi asking citizens to “shoot the traitors.”      Stories like the one Gabbard retweeted, where Hindu or Muslim working-class people enact a kind of “revenge” on their employers or customers, abound on Indian Twitter.On Feb. 7, an Uber driver took a poet who had protested the citizenship bill to a police station instead of his actual destination, where he was interrogated for two hours. The driver was suspended but then reinstated by Uber — before that he was given an “Alert Citizen Prize” prize by the BJP. This week, another alleged report about a “Muslim maid” mixing spit and urine into her employers’ food went viral on right-wing Twitter, but it was later discovered that the video was nine years old and the woman in the footage was not Muslim.These stories are frequently accompanied by calls for economic boycotts of Muslim businesses.      Gabbard was raised in Hawaii by a Catholic father and a Hindu mother. She has said she was immersed in the Hindu holy book, the Bhagavad Gita, and reportedly kept her childhood copy of it with her when she was deployed as a medical administrator to Iraq. Later, she gifted the same copy to Modi himself.While Gabbard has some progressive domestic politics, these views are at odds with her support for authoritarians, including Modi, Egyptian President Fatth El-Sisi, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. She also has a long history of courting the right wing in India, profiled extensively in the Indian magazine Caravan.Ram Madhav, then a BJP spokesperson but previously a longtime executive of a paramilitary Hindu supremacist group that is widely regarded as the parent organization of the BJP itself, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, delivered gifts to Gabbard from Modi on her wedding day in April 2015.

"     The image began to circulate again on Thursday, this time with a very different sentiment behind it: five Democratic women photographed at the height of last summer, back when it seemed like one of them might have a chance at making history. They were all high-fiving, all laughing. The caption: “Madam President?”As the last major woman candidate, Elizabeth Warren, dropped out of the presidential race, Democrats are mourning what could have been — and wondering what happened.“Every time I get introduced as the most powerful woman, I almost cry, because I wish that were not true,” said Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, in the wake of Warren’s exit. “I so wish that we had a woman president of the United States, and we came so close to doing that. I do think there’s a certain element of misogyny.”It had started with a ""blue wave"" midterm election in 2018, where being a woman was seen, for the first time, as a distinct advantage, and where candidates of color won even in white-majority districts. Then, in 2019, a slate of historically diverse presidential candidates came together, including six women.After everything, the last two candidates left in the race with a shot at the nomination are two white men in their late seventies: Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.Kirsten Gillibrand left the race early after a campaign that tried to center women voters simply never took off. Kamala Harris left after a formidable start and rapid rise ended with a just-as-rapid fall. Amy Klobuchar, who spent much of the race fighting for any shred of voters’ attention, dropped out to endorse Biden mere weeks after she finally, unexpectedly, surged.Warren’s exit Thursday, after a disappointing string of losses in early-voting states, was perhaps the starkest reminder of the realities facing women candidates vying for the country’s highest office.She stuck to a popular message, raised huge sums of money, and built a formidable grassroots organization across the country.Like the other candidates who dropped out of the race, she had hardly run a perfect campaign. But it was also unquestionable that, after what seemed like an unstoppable rise in the polls last summer, Warren's candidacy had become mired down in voter fears about electability — and, inextricably, her gender.Polling from a progressive firm showed, for example, that a large swath of Democratic voters, about one-third, held sexist beliefs — and that almost none of them backed Warren. Other figures showed Warren’s support among male voters declining sharply as the campaign went on.      As she addressed reporters Thursday in front of her home in Cambridge, Warren was unflinching about the role that sexism had played in her campaign.“Gender in this race, you know, that is the trap question for everyone,” Warren said. “If you say, ‘Yeah, there was sexism in this race,’ everyone says, ‘Whiner!’ And if you say ‘No, there was no sexism,’ about a bazillion women think, What planet do you live on?“I promise you this: I’ll have a lot more to say on that subject later on.”The drive to beat Donald Trump was all-consuming in the 2020 primary. From the beginning, it also led many voters to simply count women candidates out.Across early states, voters said they found them too angry or too unlikable or too inexperienced. Their dislike of the women candidates’ policies or ideologies mixed frequently with their feelings about their gender.“She’s a firecracker, but she doesn’t have all that experience that Biden does,” Mary, a voter in tiny Blue Grass, Iowa, said of Warren in January. Then, almost as an aside, she added: “And I don’t think she can win, because she’s a woman, dang it, and they don’t like women presidents, I guess.”Mostly, voters said, they saw women candidates as too risky — especially in the wake of the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton lost to Trump.Peggy Hendrix, a Memphis resident who voted early for Michael Bloomberg in Tennessee, was unflinching last week about her belief that Klobuchar and Warren should drop out.“I think the two women in the race should jump out — because America would never elect a woman president. They didn't elect Hillary, who has been senator, first lady, been in government all her life,” Hendrix said.“I know these other women don't have a chance. I think they should get out.”Gillibrand, Harris, Warren, and Klobuchar all ran vastly different campaigns, and all had issues that were entirely separate from their gender. At one point or another, though, all of them were forced to make the same choice: to address the issue of sexism head-on.Male candidates never faced the same questions, or the same necessity, pointed out Lily Adams, who served as Harris’s communications director.“They all had to take it on directly, this issue of electability — no ‘wink, wink, nod, nod,’” Adams said of the women candidates. “You had to define what it is, call out the problem, and explain how you can solve it. We realized, ‘We’re going to have to call out this elephant in the room in a far more explicit way.’”For Harris — who was contending doubly with racism, as the first serious black woman candidate since Shirley Chisholm — that effort began in earnest in a speech in May 2019 at an NAACP convention in Detroit. There, she explicitly challenged media-driven notions of “electability” that favored white men.She wove efforts like the Detroit speech into the fabric of her campaign, frequently referring to hypothetical leaders with ""she""/""her"" pronouns — hoping to challenge voters’ ideas, she said, of what a president looked like.Harris told BuzzFeed News in October that such efforts were necessary “especially in light of the whole discussion about ‘electability,’ which drives me bananas.”She added, “It’s important for people to understand that they have to really check how they're thinking about these things. But we have to help along the way.”      Klobuchar — who found herself losing voters to Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of a small city — addressed the issue directly on the debate stage after she was asked about her comments that a woman with so little experience would not be taken seriously.“What I said is true. Women are held to a higher standard,” she said. “Otherwise, we could play a game called ‘Name Your Favorite Woman President,’ which we can’t do because it has all been men, including all vice presidents. And I think any working woman out there, any woman that’s at home, knows exactly what I mean.”For Warren, that moment came in January, when CNN first reported that Sanders had told her in a private meeting he did not believe a woman could win against Trump.She put out a statement confirming her side of the story, which Sanders denied, and spoke of it briefly in the next debate — before pivoting to an explicit defense of women’s electability, a topic she had so far mostly avoided.It had, her campaign believed, become untenable to not address the issue of gender in the race. But her campaign was also careful to tell key supporters not to accuse Sanders of sexism, largely because they knew the fear was something that was widely held among Democratic voters.“I would be careful with the ‘sexism’ angle when it comes to the Bernie/Warren exchange individually — that’s not what this is about and I think it’ll be really bad news for us if that becomes what this is about,” a Warren aide wrote to a group of supporters in a private Twitter group as the story about Sanders’ comments reached its height.“Claiming you’re worried a woman can’t win/flagging that she’ll receive sexist attacks is something many, many people feel.”Ultimately, the story appeared to do little to damage Sanders, who continued to rise in the polls, and went on to a near win in Iowa and victories New Hampshire and Nevada.Though she avoided speaking explicitly about sexism in the race for much of her campaign, Warren often built her speeches around prominent women in history, and her policies centered issues like universal child care.In her famous “selfie lines,” which could stretch for hours, Warren made a point of allowing families with children to go first and providing coloring paper for children to use as she spoke. It was an environment where, unlike other candidates’ rallies, many families felt comfortable bringing their children — and each time Warren encountered a young girl in line, she knelt and made them a pinkie promise: “I’m running for president because that’s what girls do.”As she addressed reporters in front of her house Thursday, after she had left the race, Warren’s voice broke as she spoke of those interactions.“One of the hardest parts of this is all those pinkie promises,” she said. “And all those little girls who are gonna have to wait four more years. That’s gonna be hard.”Rosie Gray contributed reporting to this story.","What Happened To The Women Of 2020? Fears Of “Electability.”

"     WASHINGTON — Congress will send President Donald Trump an $8.3 billion emergency spending package to help combat the coronavirus, as the virus continues to spread in the United States.The Senate voted 96–1 to fund the package. The bulk of funding is designated to agencies responsible for prevention and care. The amount is more than three times the original $2.5 billion that Trump requested from Congress last week, but he is expected to sign the bill. Republican Sen. Rand Paul was lone vote against the spending package.More than $7 billion will be dispersed among government health agencies, including $2.2 billion allocated to the CDC to contain the outbreak and $3 billion toward research and development of vaccines and other treatments. More than $1 billion will fund State Department operations abroad and humanitarian assistance.The bill comes as the international death toll related to the infection reaches 3,286 people, 11 of which were in the US. More than 95,000 people worldwide have been infected with the coronavirus, according to a Johns Hopkins University website mapping the spread of the infection. Earlier this week, the stock market plummeted to its lowest since 2008. The FDA is closely monitoring potential shortages in critical medical products.To mitigate the issue, Congress’s bill provides nearly $1 billion to state and local agencies for medical supplies, including masks and protective equipment. Small businesses suffering financial losses as a result of the outbreak will have access to $1 billion in loan subsidies.On Wednesday, the House approved the package 415–2; Republican Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona and Ken Buck of Colorado voted against the measure.Prior to the vote, House Democrats and Republicans attended separate closed-door briefings with Vice President Mike Pence and Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Trump put Pence in charge of the coronavirus response, much to the chagrin of health experts who cited the vice president’s lack of medical experience.Members leaving the briefing said Pence and Fauci gave the same public health recommendations that health experts have circulated since the outbreak; Pence and Fauci also announced new guidance for nursing homes to minimize the spread of the virus, according to those who attended the briefing.“On travel, Dr. Fauci said there wasn’t an official directive but 'just use common sense,'” Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York told BuzzFeed News upon exiting the briefing. “The people that are elderly, that have preexisting conditions — with respiratory or heart — they should not be domestically traveling,” she added.Maloney, chair of the House Oversight Committee, said she invited Fauci to appear before the committee next Wednesday for a public briefing.Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts said Pence told Democrats “that the risk for the average American that’s in good health was still small,” also adding that their concerns were more centered around the “frail elderly.”The average age of a US senator is 62.9 years old; several of them are over the age of 80. Still, many senators said they weren’t worried about contracting the infection. Some of their House counterparts seemed rattled when they joined hundreds of their colleagues on the floor to vote Wednesday. Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee wore a blue rubber glove on his right hand during a vote series, and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida sat in the House chambers wearing a gas mask.So far, Congress is moving forward with normal in-person voting and is expected to return to the Capitol next week. When reporters asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi if the Capitol would remain open, she responded, “At this time, yes, without question,” as she walked into a briefing on the coronavirus.","Congress Quickly Passed An $8.3 Billion Spending Package To Fight And Treat The Coronavirus

"     Three weeks after ending his presidential bid, Andrew Yang is starting a new group to cement his ideas about 21st-century work and technology firmly into the political “mainstream,” with an ambitious goal of advancing “a wave of new thinking in American politics,” his advisers said.Yang started the organization, a political nonprofit called Humanity Forward, on Thursday.The group will both support Democratic candidates who embody Yang’s vision, in the style of a more typical political group — such as Bernie Sanders’ Our Revolution or Pete Buttigieg’s Hitting Home — while also embracing more unconventional aims and methods.Yang, according to plans laid out by his advisers earlier this week, will support “projects and pilots that demonstrate the power and practicality of our ideas in real life” through grants across spaces in tech and media. He will also host his own long-form podcast and a “Future of Work” conference in Washington, DC, to discuss his vision for a “human-centered economy.”The 45-year-old entrepreneur got in the race early, in November 2017, and rose from a political nobody to a candidate who outlasted governors and senators. “It’s amazing to imagine a campaign that started with my Google contact list and now has over 400,000 donors and millions of Americans who support us,” Yang said in an interview on the night he ended his presidential campaign in New Hampshire.During his two-plus years in the race, Yang popularized a message about individuals redefining their worth as more than economic metrics, building his campaign around a singular policy idea: a monthly payment to every American, known as universal basic income, or UBI.Part of Humanity Forward’s work, advisers said, will be centered on making UBI a reality, partly through the “grants,” which he and his team are calling “‘Forward Thinking’ seed funding.” These could include pilot programs for universal basic income — something he tried in miniature during his presidential campaign.Humanity Forward is also pledging to give $500,000 in universal basic income to residents in one town in New York state.“It's still me. It's still what we do. It's still about proving that we're the best to solve our problems,” Yang said in an interview last week. “In some ways, it’s easier to do independent from the political cycle.”Yang believes his campaign advanced a conversation about poverty and technology, and perhaps changed the way candidates can talk to voters in the 2020s. His plainspoken style on the campaign trail, professed affinity for many of the other candidates, and easy jokes made him popular among Democratic voters, from his many online supporters to his own rivals on the debate stage.“When I speak at an event and some of my fellow candidates speak at an event, I feel like we’re sometimes speaking different languages. And the language that I speak is just English,” he said, laughing. “With some numbers thrown in, too.”Yang’s success has also led to some speculation that he might run for office in New York, where he and his family live in Manhattan. Asked this week about a run for mayor in 2021, Yang said he is “looking at it.”His new group, which would allow him to build on his political platform until another campaign, will be structured as a 501(c)(4) organization, meaning it can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money and is not obligated to disclose its donors.Zach Graumann, Yang's former campaign manager, said they plan to disclose major donors voluntarily but had not landed on the details.""In true AY style,” he said, “we’ll be really honest about everything.”","Andrew Yang Is Launching A Political Group To Cement His Ideas Into The ""Mainstream""

"     Elizabeth Warren is ending her presidential campaign, a dramatic if expected turn after a disappointing stretch of primaries for someone who was once seen as a leading contender for the Democratic nomination.She announced her decision on a call with staff on Thursday.""I know that when we set out, this was not the call you ever wanted to hear,"" she said. ""It is not the call I ever wanted to make. But I refuse to let disappointment blind me, or you, to what we’ve accomplished. We didn’t reach our goal, but what we have done together, what you have done, has made a lasting difference. It’s not the scale of the difference we wanted to make, but it matters — and the changes will have ripples for years to come.""""We ran from the heart,"" she said. ""We ran on our values. We ran on treating everyone with respect and dignity.""Warren soon after addressed reporters outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with her husband Bruce Mann by her side.""I will not be running for president in 2020, but I guarantee I will stay in the fight for the hard-working folks across this country who've gotten the short end of the stick over and over,"" she said.It is not yet clear whether Warren plans to endorse either of the remaining top candidates, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Her endorsement would be undoubtedly influential, but she is in a difficult position, with a raft of supporters who are likely to split between the two candidates.Among close Warren allies, there has been disagreement in recent days about whether she should endorse Sanders, with whom she is closely aligned ideologically, or try to extract policy commitments or a possible cabinet position from Biden, who for now looks most likely to capture the nomination.Biden and Warren spoke on Wednesday night, a Biden campaign official said.Sanders' deputy campaign manager Ari Rabin-Havt said on MSNBC soon after Warren's decision broke that Sanders would ""welcome"" an endorsement from her, but ""I think we have to leave that to the Warren campaign.""Asked what she would tell her supporters about who to back now, Warren said, ""Let's take a deep breath and spend a little time on that. We don't have to decide right this minute."" She added that she would not be making an endorsement on Thursday.Warren had said often that she cared more about enacting her agenda than becoming president herself. And she and her once-ascendant campaign shaped the 2020 primary in that sense, introducing a slate of policies into the Democratic mainstream intended to reshape the American economy and curb the influence of money in government. She made a wealth tax — 2% on fortunes over $50 million, a policy that even Sanders had shied away from in 2016 — into a progressive rallying cry, with people at her rallies who dressed as two pennies.With the funds from the wealth tax, Warren said she would put in place a series of plans focused on education, another departure from many presidential campaigns — enacting universal childcare to forgiving huge swaths of Americans’ student debt, another idea that had barely been considered among Democrats even two years before.Her campaign itself broke new ground. She made a rejection of high-dollar fundraisers a central tenet of her campaign. Instead of calling important donors, Warren made it a point to call up people who had donated small sums instead, and she spent hours after her events taking photos with every single attendee who wanted one — a “selfie line” tradition that is likely to endure in American politics.And she inspired deep loyalty from her staff and fans, who took to covering everything in the campaign's signature color, ""liberty green.""""You know liberty green everything was key here,"" Warren said on the call with staff Thursday. ""My personal favorites included the liberty green boas, liberty green sneakers, liberty green makeup, liberty green hair, and liberty green glitter liberally applied. But it was so much more.”Despite weak showings in early states, Warren had vowed at the start of March to stay in and fight for the nomination through the Democratic convention this summer, hoping to rekindle a campaign whose momentum had once looked unstoppable. She went as far as to reverse course and choose not to disavow financial help from a super PAC. But she continued to struggle to pick up delegates into Super Tuesday as Biden stormed to a comeback and consolidated the moderate wing of the party.Even Warren's blockbuster debate performance a few weeks ago that brought in tens millions of dollars — and almost singlehandedly crushed the candidacy of Michael Bloomberg — wasn’t enough to revitalize the senator's campaign. She continued to struggle to win over people of color, particularly black voters, as well as moderate and working-class white voters.Warren's departure from the race makes it almost certain that a woman will not be at the top of the ticket — which some Democrats had hoped for after Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss. Tulsi Gabbard is the lone remaining woman running for president, and her campaign has not gained any traction.Asked outside her home what she thought it would be like for women and girls now left deciding between Sanders and Biden, Warren said ""one of the hardest parts of this is all pinky promises, and all those little girls who are gonna have to wait four more years. That's going to be hard.""Arguably, Warren shaped the presidential primary four years ago, as well, with her decision not to run. Though two separate draft movements called on Warren to run for president in 2015 (and dozens of reporters asked her if she would), she declined to do so.Instead, Warren pressured Clinton on policy and personnel, while Sanders ran and captured the hearts of many young progressives. He succeeded beyond everyone's — including his — wildest expectations in 2016, and his ""political revolution"" shifted the discourse about what is possible in US politics. His ascendancy, rather than Warren's, has set the contours of the rising left in American politics.Warren and Sanders, however, go back much further than that. In the 2000s, when Sanders was still a near-pariah in Washington, the pair shared common goals and sometimes appeared together. They share a lot of the same issues and a general attentiveness to structural changes to taxation and regulation in the United States.In 2020, they both ran. Their dual candidacies put at the center of the primary this question: Should the United States move to a single-payer system, if so, how quickly? As the race went on, Warren found herself enmeshed in the horserace bind, appealing to both the kinds of voters who went for Sanders and the ones who went for Pete Buttigieg — but not quite succeeding as a unity candidate, either.After an ascendant summer, it was Warren’s stance on health care that created the first cracks in her campaign, as she struggled to answer questions about whether Medicare for All would increase middle-class taxes. She eventually put forward a plan that would first have the Senate vote on a more moderate public option before pushing for full-fledged single-payer health care.""So if you leave with only one thing you leave with, it must be this,"" Warren told staff on the Thursday call.

"     Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — a rising prospect in national politics who has given Democrats hope in a big Midwest state that Donald Trump flipped in 2016 — is backing Joe Biden for president.Whitmer announced her support Thursday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Biden is expected to campaign Monday in Detroit; it would not be a surprise to see Whitmer by his side there.""I think that the blueprint from 2018 about showing up, focusing on the dinner table issues, and getting things done is exactly what Joe Biden represents,"" said Whitmer, referencing the 2018 Democratic wave that helped sweep her into office, ""and that's why he's got my enthusiastic support and my vote on Tuesday.""Whitmer tweeted after her announcement that she would also be joining the campaign as a cochair. She joins Delaware Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in that role.The endorsement could be a boost for the former vice president in his battle with Sen. Bernie Sanders, who beat Hillary Clinton in Michigan’s primary four years ago. (Sanders endorsed Abdul El-Sayed, a Whitmer rival two years ago.)Michigan’s primary next week will test the coalition Biden has built in the last few days by running up the score with black voters in the South while also winning in the Midwest (Minnesota), Northeast (Massachusetts), and Texas. Whitmer had been under increasing pressure to pick sides, the Detroit Free Press reported Wednesday. A Detroit News/WDIV-TV poll this week found Biden leading Sanders in the state by about 7%.""You all know that politics can change fast,"" Whitmer said on MSNBC. ""A few days can be a lifetime. What we've seen in terms of the ability to coalesce and build a coalition that really has diverse representation — that is reflective of who we are as a party and what we need as a nation — has really started to show that Joe Biden is our strongest candidate going into the fall. I believe that. And I am excited about his candidacy.""Biden campaigned for Whitmer during her 2018 race, which she won convincingly.      Whitmer, 48, has been the subject of vice presidential speculation given her youth, gender, and success in a battleground state. When Detroit hosted the second Democratic presidential debate last summer, she had a featured role as host. And she acknowledged then that candidates were sounding her out and courting her for an endorsement.“I think everyone knows that the path to the White House goes through Michigan and a handful of other states,” Whitmer told BuzzFeed News in an interview at the time.“I really do want to see these candidates show up,” Whitmer added. “I want to see the work that they do — how they react under pressure and what, really, they’re going to be able to do on behalf of the people of Michigan.”On Wednesday she signaled she'll be a visible part of Biden's team.""I am eager to take part in a lot of the national conversation around his campaign because I think we all know Michigan's incredibly important,"" she said on Morning Joe. ""All roads to the White House lead through my state.""Biden has been sweeping up endorsements since his success on Super Tuesday, pulling in support both from backers of former candidates who are now endorsing him and from politicians who have stayed out of the race until now.Michigan’s last Democratic governor, Jennifer Granholm, endorsed Biden on Wednesday.

"     WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday morning in the first major case on abortion rights since President Donald Trump appointed two justices to the court, a case that could threaten the national right to the procedure.As hundreds of protesters gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court, making speeches and yelling pro– and anti–abortion rights slogans at each other, the justices questioned attorneys in the case and focused their questions on precedent and whether laws like the one they are considering should be determined on a state-by-state basis or nationwide.The case at issue examines whether doctors performing abortions in Louisana should be required to have hospital admitting privileges, a requirement that would likely leave only one doctor able to legally perform the procedure in the state. The case also looks more broadly at whether doctors have the ability to file the lawsuit on behalf of their patients.The Louisiana law is nearly identical to one in Texas that the Supreme Court overturned in 2016, a decision that was a major win for abortion rights and helped increase access to the procedure in several states. The main issue at hand Wednesday was whether that precedent applies here, or whether making a different decision in Louisiana would overturn the court’s prior decisions.“This case is about respect for the court’s precedent,” Julie Rikelman, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights who was arguing against the Louisiana law, said at the very start of the hearing Wednesday. “Nothing has changed that would justify this legal about-face.”During the arguments, the court appeared divided. Chief Justice John Roberts — who is expected to be the decisive swing vote — asked the attorneys on both sides of the case repeatedly about whether the court should undertake a state-by-state review, depending on different facts in each state, when examining a law’s restrictions.Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was hearing a major abortion case for the first time in his tenure on the Supreme Court on Wednesday, asked similar questions. Neither justice indicated whether they had made up their minds, but their questioning suggested that the idea of overturning precedent and how broadly it applies will be the determining factor in the court’s decision.The four liberal justices spent much of their time highlighting the precedent the Supreme Court has already set on the issue and questioning attorneys about whether the Louisiana law was actually intended to make abortion safer, or if it was simply passed to make it less accessible. Kavanaugh’s fellow Trump appointee, Neil Gorsuch, and conservative Justice Clarence Thomas both stayed silent throughout the oral arguments.The Supreme Court will likely not issue its opinion in the case, called June Medical Services v. Russo, until late spring.The Louisiana law passed in 2014, and abortion clinics in the state sued over it. Two years later, in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, the Supreme Court struck down the similar law in Texas, which had already gone into effect and caused half of the state’s clinics to close. In the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, the 2016 vote was 5–3 with Roberts dissenting.Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has since retired, agreed with the court’s four more liberal justices in that case: Though the state has a legitimate interest in protecting the health of pregnant people, there was no evidence that admitting privileges actually did anything to help them. Further, there was clear evidence that it made abortion much less accessible.The 2016 decision reaffirmed the idea that it is unconstitutional to place an “undue burden” on access to abortion, a benchmark used by the Supreme Court in every case examining abortion regulations since it was established in the landmark 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld the national right to the procedure.In that case, the court also denied a review of admitting privilege laws in Wisconsin and Mississippi, allowing the laws to be struck down by lower courts. Like those laws, Louisiana’s was modeled on the Texas law overturned in Whole Woman’s Health. A district court found the Louisiana law unconstitutional, stating that, if implemented, it would close two of just three abortion clinics in Louisiana, leaving one doctor who could perform abortions.Then in 2018, in a very unexpected move, the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reversed this decision, letting the law stand. The plaintiffs in the case rushed it to the Supreme Court to request an emergency stay to prevent the law from going into effect in Louisiana. The stay was granted, and the court agreed to take up the case. Roberts, despite having opposed striking down the Texas law, sided with the liberal justices to grant the stay.In its narrowest interpretation, the Supreme Court is looking at whether the 5th Circuit was right in letting the Louisiana law stand. In a broader sense, the court is looking at whether Whole Woman’s Health was correctly decided and whether it applies to the entire country.After the Supreme Court took up the petition, Louisiana’s legal team requested a new question be added to the case: whether June Medical Services and its doctors have the ability to challenge the law on behalf of their patients. This point, called the “third-party standing” question, is a legally complex one that could apply to cases outside of the issue of abortion. Justice Thomas brought it up the issue in his dissent to Whole Woman’s Health and anti-abortion advocates have been pushing it for years.Typically, third parties are not legally allowed to file lawsuits on behalf of other people, but exceptions are made in cases where the plaintiffs have a “close relationship” with the damaged parties, as past Supreme Court cases have put it. The Center for Reproductive Rights argues that this clearly applies to this case because a) the drawn-out process of filing a lawsuit may prevent someone who is pregnant from legally getting the procedure done, and b) there is an extensive precedent of abortion doctors being able to sue on behalf of their patients. This is how the majority of cases challenging laws restricting abortion are filed.Louisiana argued that this “close relationship” standard should not apply to abortion doctors because those doctors usually do not see a single patient more than a couple of times, and because there is a conflict of interest for doctors who are being regulated by the law. The law is intended to protect patients from unqualified doctors, Louisiana’s solicitor general, Elizabeth Murrill, argued in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, letting the doctors sue on the behalf of the people the law is protecting is contrary to that goal.Justice Stephen Breyer, who wrote the opinion striking down Texas’s admitting privileges law in Whole Woman’s Health, asked the attorneys questions Wednesday that served to emphasize the importance of precedent in this case.“How many abortion cases have allowed” third parties to sue on behalf of affected patients in the Supreme Court, Breyer asked Rikelman. “I counted eight,” he said. She agreed.So we would have to overrule eight prior cases? He asked. Rikelman responded that yes, she believes they would.Later he asked Jeffery Wall, an attorney with the US Department of Justice who was arguing on behalf of Louisiana, whether he was suggesting that the Supreme Court should overturn precedent that goes back to the 1800s. Wall, sputtering slightly, denied this.“You just want to go back 40 years then,” Breyer retorted, likely referring to Roe v. Wade.The Louisiana law, called the Louisiana Unsafe Abortion Protection Act, required doctors to have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles of the facility. This means the doctor must be a member of the hospital’s staff and have a granted ability to admit and diagnose patients.Liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg spent most of their questions focused on the true intent of the law — whether Louisiana’s defense that it was to make sure patients seeking abortions were safe in the case of emergency, were true.Ginsburg, especially, focused her questions on the necessity of the law.She asked Murrill, “Do you dispute that first-trimester abortion” is one of the safest medical procedures there is, “even safer than childbirth?” Murill did not give a direct answer.Ginsburg asserted that, in the vast majority of cases in which someone requires hospitalization after an abortion, it is during a medication abortion that they undergo at home. She asked Murill and Wall: If this were the case, wouldn’t it make more sense for them to go to a hospital near their home, rather than one within 30 miles of the abortion clinic as the Louisiana law requires?Wall conceded that the majority of complications happen once the patient is at home, but sometimes they happen at the clinic.Of the conservative justices on the court, Justice Samuel Alito challenged Rikelman the most, asking her about whether there was a conflict of interest for doctors to file this suit. Rikelman denied this. Alito also asked how hard the doctors actually tried to get admitting privileges.Kavanaugh and Roberts seemed to have similar concerns about the case. Kavanaugh asked Rikelman repeatedly whether she thought all admitting privilege laws were unconstitutional, even in states where doctors could easily access admitting privileges. She answered that essentially, yes.Roberts asked a similar question, whether the law should be considered on a state-by-state basis depending on how much it limits access and other facts, or whether it is a nationwide decision, as Whole Woman’s Health was widely interpreted to be. The attorneys arguing on behalf of Louisiana responded that they thought it was a state-by-state consideration; in the case of Louisiana, the law's benefits outweighed its cost.On the steps of the Supreme Court after the hearing, attorneys for the Center for Reproductive Rights both told BuzzFeed News they were hopeful — Rikelman used the term “cautiously optimistic,” and her fellow attorney T.J. Tu, who did not argue in the hearing, said he was “elated.”“I’m feeling great,” Tu said, adding that he was encouraged by the questions from Roberts and Kavanaugh. “We have always argued the case that there should be a broad majority on the court to recognize that there is no difference between this case and the case the Supreme Court decided only four years ago, and it seems like that’s true.”","The Supreme Court Just Heard Its First Major Abortion Case With Trump's Appointees On The Bench

"     Many years ago, in New Hampshire, Amy Klobuchar pulled 19.8% of the vote. Nobody will ever know exactly why that happened, but it seemed like Klobuchar having a good debate less than 24 hours before voting started played a significant role.Having a good debate had never seemed to matter much for Klobuchar before this; if anything, the loop where Klobuchar Had a Good Debate then polls didn't move had become a joke. This good debate just seemed to fall at exactly the right moment, with attendant media coverage.But that kind of sudden shifting reality — press one button over here, see the boom before your eyes over there — is the one we've been living the last 10 days in politics.Joe Biden won South Carolina, which was expected, but in an unexpectedly decisive fashion on the strength of Southern black voters and more moderate Southern white voters. Multiple candidates dropped out and multiple candidates endorsed. A rational choice undergirded that decision — no candidate, including Pete Buttigieg and Klobuchar, can win a Democratic nomination with white voters alone. And Biden won with that exact coalition above in states across the Southeast on Super Tuesday.But within those 72 surreal hours, suddenly, Biden also won exactly — literally — the kinds of voters in Minnesota and Massachusetts and Maine that he failed to win in Iowa and New Hampshire just weeks before.“I saw all these people dropping out and they were all endorsing Biden, and I thought, Biden is the one who can be elected,” one would-be Elizabeth Warren voter in Los Angeles told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday night. “So I did not mail in my ballot. I went to vote today, tore up my ballot, and voted for Biden.”Biden did not campaign in Tennessee, Arkansas, Minnesota, Massachusetts, or Oklahoma. He did not advertise in most of the Super Tuesday states, or if he did, it was at a minor league level. Some more establishment Democrats in those states have told reporters in recent weeks that Biden and his campaign haven't done much to secure their endorsements. Except in one (recent) regard, outlined here by George C. Patton, “Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser,” Biden is not, as a candidate, meaningfully different than he was three weeks ago.Now, he leads Sanders in a two-person race, locked into place by Nevada and South Carolina, compounded by California and the South.Two expected outcomes took us back to where we were, a year ago, seemingly based on what’s happened in the immediate vicinity of people’s minds. The entire thing has the vibe of reaching out with your right hand somewhere offscreen, and tapping your own left shoulder.But that's been the tenor of the year so far. In Iowa, the weekend before the caucuses, as you may recall, Ann Selzer did not release her well-regarded poll due to complaints about irregularities with at least one call. Political media slipped into a full-blown crisis that was weird given that the rumored results didn’t actually look that much different from Selzer's previous polls, which always were (correctly) cool on Biden's performance in a state where many questioned his organization and the populace gets, exclusive to Iowa, an up-close look at the candidates.“The magnitude of the reactions to one poll’s fate raises alarm bells about the way we treat & interpret polls,” wrote Daniel Nichanian of the Appeal.But these kinds of moments all seemed linked up — a good debate, the belief in a sterling pollster, and especially the response to most black South Carolinians’ emphatic support of a single candidate — in one way. People were waiting for someone, anyone to make a decision.","The Surreal Year Where Only The Last 72 Hours Seem To Matter In Politics

"     WASHINGTON — Ten Democrats are calling on the State Department to designate foreign white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups as foreign terrorist organizations.In a new resolution, the House members call on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to add four foreign white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups to the State Departments’s list of 69 foreign terrorist organizations. Along with recognizing victims of white supremacy, the resolution condemns white supremacist extremism as a “global” and “significant threat that is spreading across the United States.” As a resolution, the legislation isn’t binding, but rather expresses the sentiment of the House.Democratic Rep. Max Rose is the lead sponsor and the resolution has nine cosponsors, including Reps. Eliot Engel, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Bennie Thompson, chair of the Homeland Security Committee.“It’s important that when we consider fighting terrorism and preserving national security, that we make sure that we confront the threat of today and tomorrow not just the threats of today and yesterday,” Rose told BuzzFeed News Tuesday during a phone interview.The resolution comes after the Homeland Security Committee unanimously approved Rose’s Transnational White Supremacist Extremism Review Act, a bill that directs the Department of Homeland Security “to develop and disseminate a threat assessment regarding threats to the United States associated with foreign violent white supremacist extremist organizations.”The new resolution calls on the State Department to include specific foreign nationalistic groups in the nation’s foreign terrorist organization list, including the Nordic Resistance Movement of Sweden; the National Action group of the United Kingdom; Blood and Honour, a neo-Nazi group whose militant arm, Combat 18, has been banned in Canada and Germany; and Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi group whose alleged ex-leader was arrested in Texas last week.Rose and more than three dozen lawmakers sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a letter last October inquiring as to why certain white nationalist groups are not considered terrorist groups. The State Department responded by saying that while they’re dedicated to the “appropriate use of its designations authorities,” they do not discuss internal deliberations as it relates to foreign terrorist organizations.While the Patriot Act defines the term domestic terrorism, it is not a federal crime nor does the FBI publish a list of groups they consider to be domestic terrorists. However, the government does have the power to add to its list of foreign terrorist groups and domestic white nationalist groups, financially or otherwise, affiliated with US-designated foreign terrorist groups could face steeper penalties if convicted of a crime.“These domestic neo-Nazi organizations that we’ve been talking about all this time for so long now are not domestic — they are global,” Rose told BuzzFeed News.Last week, during a hearing with the House Homeland Security subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism, FBI officials told members of Congress there’s an ongoing effort to determine global connections between domestic and foreign white terrorist and neo-Nazi groups, including tracking those who train and fund such organizations, but would not elaborate on any ongoing investigations.“They have strong connections with foreign terrorist organizations and we have got to start to identify those foreign terrorist organizations in the same manner that we would identify ISIS and al-Qaida and [go] after their domestic adherents,” Rose told BuzzFeed News.","Democrats Call On The State Department To List White Supremacist Groups As Foreign Terrorist Organizations

"     Michael Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race on Wednesday morning after falling short on Super Tuesday, endorsing Joe Biden.The announcement marked the end of an unconventional campaign that relied on huge amounts of advertising to make Bloomberg a viable candidate. Though Bloomberg's strategy succeeded in making him a serious contender in the Super Tuesday states he competed in, the Democratic establishment's last-minute consolidation around Biden after the former vice president's win in South Carolina and Bloomberg's poor performance in presidential debates combined to doom his campaign.“I’m a believer in using data to inform decisions,"" he said in a statement. ""After yesterday’s results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible — and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists.""“I’ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it,"" he said. ""After yesterday’s vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden.""According to a senior Bloomberg aide, Bloomberg made the decision to drop out on Wednesday morning after a meeting with his senior staff.The aide said that up until Friday, the campaign had believed they were in a three-person race. But the campaign's internal data had shown a dramatic shift toward Biden over the weekend as he won in South Carolina that ended up being reflected in the Super Tuesday results; the shift happened so fast they ""couldn't even model it.""The aide said that the campaign had started to struggle in the week before the Nevada caucuses late last month, as Bloomberg began to take a ""ferocious amount of incoming"" in the form of opposition research and attacks on his record. This, compounded with Bloomberg's poor debate performances, put the campaign in a downswing it didn't have time to recover from before Super Tuesday. A plan for turning Bloomberg's campaign into an organization to help Biden is still being worked out, the aide said.Bloomberg called Biden Wednesday morning and they had a ""good"" conversation, another aide to the former mayor said.Bloomberg had faced increasing pressure to get out of the race after Biden won South Carolina by a commanding margin, emerging as the favorite moderate candidate to take on frontrunner Bernie Sanders.The former mayor spoke on Wednesday afternoon in a ballroom at the Sheraton in Midtown Manhattan, where he held a large “Women for Mike” themed campaign event in January and where he hosted election night rallies in past years during his mayoral campaigns.He thanked supporters and staff, who packed the ballroom shoulder-to-shoulder. He told them “there is no doubt in my mind we would have beat Donald Trump in November.”“But today I am clear-eyed about our overriding objective, which is victory in November,” Bloomberg said. “Staying in would make it more difficult” for Trump to be defeated in November, he said.Referencing his motto “in God we trust, everyone else bring data” (a line that elicited appreciative laughs from the audience), Bloomberg said the results had shown “a viable path to the nomination no longer existed. And I will not be our party’s nominee, but I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my life and I hope you won’t walk away either.”“I’m glad to say I endorse Joe Biden, and I hope you will join me,” he said.Bloomberg built his public reputation as a data-driven wonk who shows little emotion, making it all the more striking that he choked up near the end of his remarks, his voice thick with restrained tears.“Today, I’m sorry we didn’t win, but it’s still the best day of my life and tomorrow’s gonna be even better,” Bloomberg said. He referenced memorizing “The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere” as a child in Massachusetts; “Today I believe that our great nation still sees that light in the Old North Church Tower. The light of freedom, the light of liberty, the light of equality, and the light of opportunity.""After Bloomberg wrapped up, some staffers took pictures with their teams in the ballroom while others filtered out, sporting campaign buttons and t-shirts. Some posed for photos and horsed around outside the ballroom with a cardboard cutout of Bloomberg brought to the event by some staffers from Long Island.His decision to actually end the campaign comes after voting across 15 states and territories on Super Tuesday.Though Bloomberg was not on the ballot in any of the four early states, he had been able to raise his poll numbers significantly in the Super Tuesday states in which he was competing by mounting an aggressive advertising campaign across the country. Bloomberg spent an unprecedented amount during his brief campaign, which only launched in November, months after most other candidates had entered the race. The billionaire former mayor of New York used over $500 million of his own fortune on his campaign, refusing to take donations and hiring an enormous staff.For a time after the Iowa caucuses, which left the party in a state of confusion with no clear winner at first, Bloomberg’s candidacy gained strength as nervous moderate Democrats looked for an alternative to the then-slumping Biden. Bloomberg pitched himself as a competent manager who wasn’t intimidated by Donald Trump and would spend whatever it took to defeat him.But Bloomberg’s decision to participate in primary debates after a DNC rule change allowed him to take part proved fateful; his performance in the debate in Nevada on Feb. 19 was so weak that one poll showed that his favorability numbers had dropped by 20% the next day. Though Bloomberg did better in the second debate he took part in, in South Carolina, the debates showed that even his large, slick advertising campaign couldn’t hide his weaknesses as a candidate.Bloomberg’s record as mayor and as a business executive came under intense scrutiny as he became a more serious candidate; most notably, his record on stop-and-frisk and the history of allegations of sexism at his company became issues in the campaign. Bloomberg’s rivals effectively used these issues against him, particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who memorably challenged Bloomberg on the debate stage on nondisclosure agreements signed by women who had made accusations at his company.Since the beginning of his run, Bloomberg had promised to continue to use his campaign infrastructure and money to support whoever the Democratic nominee is. However, Bloomberg qualified this somewhat over the last week of his campaign as Sanders’ campaign said it didn’t want his money; he told the Houston Chronicle that he wouldn’t support Sanders if the senator's team didn’t want the support.","Michael Bloomberg's Presidential Campaign Is Over

"     WASHINGTON — Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar fended off a primary challenge from Jessica Cisneros, a 26-year-old immigration attorney, in Texas’s 28th district, in a defeat for the progressive movement.The Super Tuesday primary was tight; Decision Desk HQ ultimately called the race with Cuellar leading Cisneros, 52% to 48%.Cisneros officially conceded Wednesday morning, saying in a statement, “This is just the beginning. The first thing we had to defeat was the culture of fear — and our movement was victorious in proving we're within striking distance of bringing fundamental change to South Texas.”Cisneros was backed by Justice Democrats, the progressive group that helped propel Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to victory two years ago. She was the first candidate the group recruited and endorsed this cycle.Cuellar is one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in the House and had held the seat since 2005. He also maintains an A rating from the National Rifle Association, and Cisneros and her allies coined him “Trump’s favorite Democrat” after Cuellar voted with the president nearly 70% of the time during Trump’s first two years in office.Cisneros worked as an intern in Cuellar’s office in 2014 before deciding to launch a campaign to unseat him last summer.Cisneros spoke Tuesday night before the race was officially called, telling supporters, “I think one thing is clear, that our movement was victorious tonight... That’s because this fight has always been about an opportunity to prove how one of us, a brown girl from our community, with her whole community behind her, could take on an entire machine.”Ahead of a planned interview with Cuellar last week, Colin Strother, a spokesperson for the campaign, said Cuellar would not answer any questions framed as responses to attacks Cisneros made on him during the primary.“We’re not allowing a 26-year-old young lady who’s never done anything question the character of a dedicated public servant,” Strother said. (The campaign then canceled the interview half an hour before it was supposed to happen.)      In addition to Justice Democrats, Cisneros had the support of Ocasio-Cortez and presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.“Primary challengers rarely win, so it’s always a long shot,” Justice Democrats spokesperson Waleed Shahid told BuzzFeed News last week. “That’s why AOC and [Rep.] Ayanna [Pressley] winning was a big deal. But I think we’ve run a really great campaign and I think [Cisneros] can win. The world completely changed after AOC’s victory.”In the weeks leading up to Election Day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi traveled to the district to fundraise for Cuellar, and a PAC founded and funded by the libertarian super-donor Charles Koch spent $34,000 in support of Cuellar in the last days of the race.Cuellar’s victory represents a disappointing loss for the progressive movement. While the district is a fairly safe Democratic seat, it’s more conservative than Ocasio-Cortez’s New York seat. Cisneros supports Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and progressive immigration reform.“[Primary challengers are] outspent, and by all the traditional metrics we're not quote-unquote supposed to win,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters Monday evening. “So if she's able to pull this off tomorrow, I think it will be profoundly energizing.”Cisneros would have the youngest woman ever to serve in the House, Ocasio-Cortez noted. “I, for one, could not think of a better way to be the shortest-lived youngest woman in Congress, and I would absolutely be thrilled to hand that off to her tomorrow,” she said.Ocasio-Cortez also said this week she doesn’t think Cisneros’s loss is bad news for other primary challengers across the country.“Each one of these races come down to such individual characteristics. It's about the incumbent, it's about the challenger, and it's about the actual community,” she said. “Jessica Cisneros is very different from Marie Newman [in Illinois], is very different from a Georgette Gomez [in California], for example, but that they all fight for the same values, but all of these are kind of down to the individual communities that they're advocating for and how they do it.”Cisneros told BuzzFeed News last week that winning wasn’t her only metric of victory and that she’s proud to have led a team mostly made up of women and people under 30.“For us, yes, obviously the victory is going to be winning on March 3, but I think the larger victory is training ourselves here in South Texas to organize,” she said. “For me, the victory is going to be that we've invested in the infrastructure, and to build a movement down here in South Texas, and that it's not just going to rally around candidates but around issues.""","One Of The Last Anti-Abortion Democrats In Congress Defeated A Progressive Challenger Backed By Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

They talked to BuzzFeed News about how they arrived at their choice, telling part of the story of the Democratic primary's sudden turn.Carla Taravella, 52, had decided she was voting for Pete Buttigieg, until he dropped out and endorsed Biden on Monday.“It was very close between the two, I was back and forth,” she said. Buttigieg’s endorsement helped, but Biden was always her number two choice, because she likes his demeanor and his experience in politics.Debbie Mars, 63, said she’s been behind Biden since he announced, because of his “kindness and civility.”Mars, who is black, said Biden was the candidate who came across as the most genuinely invested in black communities, a view that helped Biden to a blowout win in South Carolina this past weekend.“As a very proud African American, many of us are very offended at being the flavor of the week. Many of the candidates are bubbling up, ‘We need the black vote; we need the black vote.’ And it makes us feel very much token. This is a very organic thing with Joe,” she said.She looked at Biden’s track record as “a solid policymaker, decision-maker,” she said, adding that she’s not worried about the fact that he’s 77 years old and criticisms over his occasional verbal mishaps because “politics is a machine anyway — he’s going to have plenty of people around him to keep him on the straight and narrow.”      After embracing Biden as their candidate, the women turned to an animated discussion about whom, if he’s the nominee, Biden should pick as his running mate to give him the best chance of beating President Donald Trump and governing successfully.“If you really want to bring everybody together and get Trump out, what if you had a Biden — Bernie ticket?” said Taravella.“That’s never going to happen! That’s 140 years of wisdom between them, that’s too much. That’s too much!” said Mars, as everyone in the group burst out laughing.“I would like Kamala. I would love her,” said Badon, referring to Sen. Kamala Harris, who ran for president until late last year.Mars said she was turned off by Harris’s aggressive approach during some of the primary debates. She was more interested in Beto O’Rourke, another former candidate who endorsed Biden this week, as a potential VP.“Honestly, as an African American woman, my first love would have been to support an African American woman. But the way she came across so hostile during the debates, it was a turn off for me. She pulled a Hillary,” she said. “When Hillary first went against Barack back in the day, Hillary was so condescending, and just a pit bull. It turned me off and I immediately went to Barack’s camp.”For Badon, that trait of Harris’s was the whole reason she was drawn to her in the first place — “I love that about her,” she said. “But unfortunately, like with Hillary, America does not like strong women. So you’ve got to look on the ticket, who would be the most electable.”But the women agreed that they would love to see Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia governor candidate, on the ticket.Taravella added that she would like to see Michelle Obama take on the VP role.“Michelle would run for president, okay,” said Mars.“Trump would just keel over, right,” said Taravella.And as for Buttigieg, the man Taravella had hoped would be the nominee — if he’s not vice president, “I would like to see him as DNC chair after everything that happened in Iowa.”“I don’t think the country is ready for him, it’s unfortunate. We’ve got a lot of people that are closeted in the Senate, trust, but I don’t think the good old boys are going to let that happen,” Mars said.With Sanders and Biden emerging out of Super Tuesday still seemingly locked in a tight contest, they all said they would ultimately, if begrudgingly, support Sanders if he ends up being the nominee against Trump. They’re just concerned that Sanders supporters, if the situation is reversed, wouldn’t support Biden.“Something I really do believe, I don’t even want to put in the atmosphere that Joe doesn’t get it, but if he does not, the Democrats have to come together, the game’s over,” said Mars.But, Taravella said, to agreement from the group, it would be a less energetic kind of support.“If Bernie wins, I’m not jumping in with any money, I’m not volunteering. I’ll vote for him, but I don't think he’s going to be a two-term president,” she said.","Why Did Joe Biden Do So Well On Super Tuesday? These Voters Explain.

"     LOS ANGELES — Before the polls closed in California on Super Tuesday, and possibly days before the full results from the two largest states would be known, Joe Biden took the stage in front of an enthusiastic crowd to say he might have defeated Sen. Bernie Sanders.“They told us when we got to Super Tuesday, it’d be over. Well, it may be over for the other guy!” he said to roars of approval in Los Angeles.“We are very much alive,” he shouted.Biden soon settled into an abridged version of the updated stump speech he’s been giving since his resounding win in South Carolina. In contrast to the long evenings he'd spent over the past 10 months sticking around to shake every hand and grasp every shoulder in relatively small crowds at his events, he stuck around to talk to many people Tuesday night but left dozens still clamoring to meet him as he wrapped up.Not long after Biden left the stage, California’s polls closed and the Associated Press immediately called the state — the biggest Super Tuesday prize — for Sanders. Biden, though, had the kind of night that was unthinkable for him three weeks ago, when he bailed out of New Hampshire hours before results would place him a distant fifth and raise doubts his campaign would last the day.North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Oklahoma all fell into the Biden column Tuesday. So did Minnesota, where he received a late assist from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who suspended her campaign Monday and quickly endorsed his. And in Massachusetts, he beat both Sanders and the state’s senior senator, Elizabeth Warren, in a total surprise.Early Wednesday morning, Biden officially won Texas, the second-largest state on the map on Tuesday, and a state that Sanders badly hoped to win himself.Biden’s confidence, already on the upswing since South Carolina, was reinforced. After months when he could do no right, for the next 72 hours it seemed like Biden could do no wrong. In the days between primaries, he had scored endorsements from Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, another recent dropout, and from another former rival, former Texas representative Beto O’Rourke.Aides to the former vice president could hardly contain themselves on Twitter. It was a somewhat ironic home run trot — over the first 10 months of his campaign, they often trashed the social media platform and wound up on the receiving end of its users’ endless criticism and attacks. The real conversation wasn’t happening there — the real voters weren’t there, this logic went, and so the campaign would not be fooled into fighting its battles or getting too distracted there.But there Biden’s team was Tuesday night, tapping out #Joementum as fast as their fingers could. And, just before 9:30 p.m. ET, the candidate's Twitter account dropped an eight-second meme saturated in swagger.“I ain’t dead,” the 77-year-old Biden, says — in footage from his interview for a New York Times endorsement he didn’t receive. “And I’m not gonna die.”      An animated pair of aviators then drops over Biden’s eyes as the guitar riff and primal screeches of the Who’s “Won’t Get Fooled Again” plays and the image fades to black and white.Before South Carolina, Super Tuesday stood as a prime opportunity for Sanders to skate out to a large delegate lead. Biden’s distant fourth-, fifth-, and second-place finishes in the first three contests had given rise to Michael Bloomberg’s self-funded candidacy and speculation that the race would soon be the democratic socialist Sanders versus the billionaire Bloomberg.Suddenly, though, it’s Sanders who’s facing questions about whether he can grow a coalition capable of winning the Democratic nomination. And Bloomberg barely made a dent on Tuesday despite spending more than $500 million on his late-entry campaign.A fuller account of how close Biden and Sanders are in the race for convention delegates was not clear late into Tuesday. The as-yet-unknown delegate splits out of California and Texas will offer a better picture of where things stand. But Biden’s team started talking like winners early in the day — another change of direction from staffers who have spent the previous two months leading up to voting days and debates playing down expectations.And though the Twitter chest-thumping is not new to the Biden camp, it’s been more pronounced — and more self-congratulatory — since South Carolina. Biden staffers have taken aim at reporters who chronicled the campaign’s early struggles.“‘will Joe even make it to Super Tuesday’ - pundits,” one posted Tuesday night on Twitter.Greg Schultz, Biden’s campaign manager, expressed validation after a rough stretch that saw Anita Dunn, a top Biden adviser, elevated to a higher position of authority after the candidate’s weak showing in the Iowa caucuses.“Nice to get some recognition that @JoeBiden campaign has had an actual delegate STRATEGY for ten months,” Schultz tweeted Tuesday as results came in. “That is one of the reasons why we will be outspent by factors of 10 today on tv and still do really well tonight.”Schultz returned to Twitter a bit later to retweet the new meme.“Make a plan + stick to it + build a team + remain focused = #Joementum,” he wrote.","Joe Biden And His Campaign Had An Absolute Blast On Super Tuesday

"     WASHINGTON — Former attorney general Jeff Sessions moved one step closer to reclaiming his old Senate seat Tuesday night despite a lack of support from his former boss, President Donald Trump.Sessions came in second in the Republican primary for the Alabama Senate seat, but he earned a spot in a runoff election on March 31. Decision Desk HQ called the race with former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville narrowly beating Sessions in Tuesday's election, 33-32%. The two Republicans will face each other in the runoff to determine who will challenge Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in the general election.The outcome of the November general will be key to Democrats’ attempts to regaining the majority in the Senate, making this a key race to watch. Jones’ loss would make it difficult for Democrats to overcome Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s stronghold over the Republican-led Senate.Tuesday’s Republican primary was crowded. In addition to Tuberville, Sessions faced Rep. Bradley Byrne, Roy Moore — the former judge accused of child molestation — and three other candidates. According to Alabama law, primary candidates who win with less than 50% of the vote automatically enter a runoff election against the runner-up before advancing to the general election.Sessions held the Alabama Senate seat for two decades before Trump tapped him to serve as US attorney general. Trump forced him to resign in 2018, a year after he recused himself from the Russia investigation that led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel. Since then, the president has lashed out against Sessions, saying he regrets choosing him as the nation’s top attorney.Tuberville coached football at Auburn University from 1999 to 2008. He has been dubbed a carpetbagger by opponents for switching residencies from Florida to Alabama in 2018 to run for governor before running for Senate in 2020.Trump holds a 60% approval rating in the deep red state but didn’t endorse in the race, leading the other Republicans to criticize Sessions’ fraught relationship with the president while cozying up to Trump themselves.The winner of the runoff will face Jones, a Democrat who won the historically Republican seat in a November 2017 special election. But first, Republican voters in Alabama will have to contend with what’s sure to come in the following three weeks — a bevy of campaign stunts from both candidates aligning themselves with the president and trying hard to point out where their opponents have broken with Trump.In the days leading up to the election, the top Republican candidates bombarded Alabama television with attack ads. Byrne — who’s expected to place third and will not qualify for the runoff — targeted the incumbent in a statewide “Fire Doug Jones” tour. The first-term Democratic senator faces a tough reelection race after upsetting Moore nearly three years ago.Some Republican lawmakers had picked a side in the primary. Rep. Liz Cheney, a member of House Republican leadership and daughter of the former vice president, tweeting her endorsement of Byrne last week. Sen. Kevin Cramer, who served in the House of Representatives before moving over to the Senate in 2019, donated $10,000 to Byrne after he encouraged him to run, long before Sessions entered the race.“I really think the world of him,” Cramer told BuzzFeed News of Byrne. “I think he’s great and a good member.” He added that he hadn't expected Sessions’ last-minute entry into the race.Outgoing Rep. Martha Roby of Alabama was less inclined to weigh in.When asked if she was pushing for either candidate in the primary last week, Roby told BuzzFeed News simply, “I’m not.”","Jeff Sessions Is One Step Closer To Winning His Old Senate Seat Back

"     WEST PALM BEACH, Florida — Michael Bloomberg’s return on investment turned out to be very small.A late entry to the presidential race, Bloomberg skipped the first four early states and constructed his entire strategy around winning big on Super Tuesday, spending over $500 million to put himself into contention during those contests. But it didn’t pay off; his rival Joe Biden surged, and Bloomberg’s status in the race looks uncertain after Tuesday.Despite the disappointing results and increasing pressure on him to drop out, the billionaire former mayor did not tell the audience here on Tuesday night that he would leave the race. He spent the day campaigning in Florida, which votes on March 17. Bloomberg was introduced by supporter Judy Sheindlin, the eponymous host of Judge Judy, and he spoke to a large ballroom audience in a convention center.“If I’m the nominee, let me make you this promise: We will beat Donald Trump here in Florida and in swing states around the country,” Bloomberg said. “Tonight, the polls are still open in a number of Super Tuesday states. And as the results come in, here’s what is clear: No matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one thought was possible. In just three months, we’ve gone from 1% in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination for president.”Though Bloomberg’s campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, told reporters earlier in the day that the candidate would “absolutely not” drop out on Tuesday, he also said the campaign would reassess based on the results. “I think you make an assessment in any campaign like this after every time there's a vote,” Sheekey said.Sheekey left the door open to the idea that Super Tuesday could show that Bloomberg would not win the nomination. “We will find out how well he does tonight,” Sheekey said. “We will find out whether Mike Bloomberg is on his way to becoming the candidate, or we will find out that Mike Bloomberg is going to be the most important person to whomever that candidate will be.”And after Bloomberg’s event, Sheekey put out a statement that didn’t say he was dropping out but also did not definitively say he would fight on. In the statement, Sheekey said, “We’ve built a nationwide coalition focused on building a better future for America, and that starts with defeating Donald Trump in November.” He pointed out that “only” one-third of delegates are awarded on Super Tuesday. But Sheekey also emphasized: ""Our number one priority remains defeating Donald Trump in November.""Earlier this week, Bloomberg’s campaign announced events in Michigan and Florida following Super Tuesday. The campaign returned to New York on Tuesday night and has no public events scheduled for Wednesday.Bloomberg strong-armed his way into the Democratic primary with an unprecedentedly massive ad spending campaign that raised his profile nationally. For a while, this boosted his poll numbers enough that he looked like a serious threat to capture the anti–Bernie Sanders vote.But several factors converged to make everything go wrong for Bloomberg on Tuesday. His shaky performances on the debate stage shattered the carefully constructed image conveyed in his advertising, and Biden’s win in South Carolina gave the former vice president a surge at exactly the right time for Super Tuesday. Biden’s victory injected energy into his formerly moribund campaign and convinced fellow moderates Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg to drop out of the race and endorse him, consolidating against Sanders.This cued wavering voters — many of whom are more focused on beating Trump than supporting any particular candidate — to go with Biden instead of Bloomberg. And it quickly became clear how tentative the former New York City mayor's support had been when news outlets called first Virginia and then North Carolina for Biden within seconds of polls closing, indicating that the former vice president had won by large margins. Biden also won other states into which Bloomberg poured huge amounts of resources, like Oklahoma and Tennessee.Bloomberg did win American Samoa. As of Wednesday morning he is a distant third in the delegate-rich states of Texas and California, but at least with a chance of getting delegates out of each.He spent Tuesday insisting he would stay in the race, becoming irritated with reporters who pressed him about whether he would do like other moderate candidates and drop out to endorse Biden in order to stop Sanders. The former mayor admitted that his only path to the nomination was through a contested convention.And on Tuesday night, voters at his West Palm Beach event said they hoped he would fight on.“I just hope he takes it all the way to the convention,” said Jean Belizaire, 52. “Biden’s a great guy, but he’s missing something. I don’t think he’s the strongest candidate.”“Hopefully he’ll do better in the other states,” said Susanna Scavazzon, 47.“I’ll still vote for him,” said Amy Bissinger, 39. “Delegate-wise, we still have wiggle room. We’re still waiting on California and Texas.”“He is in the top three, thank god,” said Deborah Kinniry, 64. “I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that he said he was running so late. I’m hoping somehow he can change that around.”","Michael Bloomberg Did Not Have A Super Tuesday

"     The average age of a United States senator is 62.9 years old, with five senators over the age of 80, and despite being at heightened risk of coronavirus because of their jobs and demographic profile, senators insist they will not need to shut down Congress in the event of a pandemic.The Senate is sometimes jokingly described as the world’s greatest retirement home. But the advanced age of so many federal politicians is also a major vulnerability. Most people who contract coronavirus will have mild symptoms or none at all, but the people at most acute risk are those age 65 and older. Almost half of the Senate — 48 out of 100 senators — are 65 or older.Every week, senators and members of the House travel between their homes all across the country, where they interact with constituents, and Washington, DC, where they all congregate in the same rooms.Despite this, senators insist they do not see Congress being shut down due to the coronavirus outbreak. Several told BuzzFeed News they are not planning to do their jobs any differently. “We’re going to continue to live our lives and do our jobs. We’re just going to probably wash our hands twice as much,” said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said he plans to continue holding town halls and community meetings, even if he has to wear a face mask. But he agrees that it is likely only a matter of time before coronavirus hits Congress.“I fully anticipate that folks here will end up with it. We just do too much travel,” said Tester. But he rejects the idea of shutting down Congress, saying the legislative branch becoming “paralyzed” could do more damage than good. “I think if you start doing that kind of stuff then what, are we going to shut down the elections? I think it would set a poor precedent.”A study of 70,000 Chinese patients with coronavirus put the mortality rate at around 2%. But that rate rose to 8% for people in their seventies and up to 15% for people age 80 and over.As of yet there are no formal plans for how Congress will respond to the risk of coronavirus, but congressional leaders are meeting Wednesday to discuss it. Thousands of visitors walk through the halls of Congress every day. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said his staff is reviewing policies on how to protect the health of politicians and visitors, but that he won’t comment on hypothetical scenarios.Senators were unanimously confident in Congress’s ability to weather a potential outbreak.“Speaking for the octogenarians that are here, most of us are pretty fit,” said Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts, who is 83.Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, a doctor, said that most members of Congress lead an active lifestyle, which would put them at lower risk of suffering life-threatening effects of the virus. He said the key thing to look at is underlying health, not age. “Given that most folks who work here live fairly active lifestyles, I think we should not overstate the need for concern,” he said.When a reporter responded that at least two senators had recently undergone cancer treatment, Cassidy said individuals may get specific precautions from their doctors.","Senators Insist They Will Be Fine During A Coronavirus Outbreak And Won’t Need To Shut Down Congress

"     ABOARD THE ACELA — It was the morning of Super Tuesday, and I was sitting in the first-class car of the Amtrak Acela Express (got a free upgrade) to Washington DC when I accidentally got cream cheese all over my laptop.When I tried to get up to grab a napkin to circumvent catastrophe, a man in a crisp, sky-blue button-down was blocking my way to the bathroom, standing in the aisle, holding a seat for support, talking to a fan.It was, of course, Andrew Yang.After some encouragement from my editors, I decided to talk to the former Democratic presidential candidate, who just a few weeks out of the race is now a regular on CNN. Turns out he was game, and happy to gossip about the race and his own future.“You know, we’re looking at it,” he said when I asked if he’s thinking about running for mayor of New York City.“Joe’s team reached out to me yesterday,” he said when I asked if he’s facing pressure to back Joe Biden. “At this point, I consider Joe a friend.”Yang was on his way to DC to spend much of the night on a panel of pundits for CNN’s Super Tuesday show and seemed generally amped for what was coming in the next few hours.“I’m really excited to see how the voting unfolds in the Super Tuesday states today,” Yang told me, speaking quietly so as not to disturb the other train passengers (or so they wouldn’t eavesdrop).“Today the biggest question is how much of the support that was going to Pete [Buttigieg] and Amy [Klobuchar] and Tom [Steyer] heads to Joe or Bernie [Sanders] or Elizabeth Warren or [Michael] Bloomberg,” he said. “And then the big question is what decision Bloomberg makes depending on how today goes.”Buttigieg dropped out of the race Sunday and Klobuchar threw in the towel Monday. Both quickly endorsed Biden in an attempt to unite moderate Democrats against Sanders, appearing alongside the former vice president at separate events Monday, urging their supporters to turn to Biden.Yang told me that since dropping out of the race, he has been in touch with many of his former competitors for the Democratic nomination, especially in recent days. He reached out to Buttigieg and Klobuchar via text, but only Buttigieg responded.“I just told Pete that he should be really proud of the race he ran,” Yang said, adding that Buttigieg was likely about to go before cameras with Biden as they were texting. “It’s hard when you end, you know, it’s a lot of mixed emotions, so I wanted to try and raise the positive set of responses. It’s very disappointing for a lot of people when you decide to suspend.”Buttigieg sent him “a nice note back,” he said.“And I actually just got off the phone with Tom, we were comparing notes on post-campaign life,” Yang told me, referring to hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, who only dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination this past weekend. “We ended up talking about the race a fair amount. … The field is shrinking very quickly and I think that’s a good thing for the process and the party.”When I asked if anyone was pushing him to endorse Biden, Yang told me yes: Biden. Biden’s team called him on Monday, he said, but he hasn’t yet “had a chance to talk to Joe."" But this isn’t unusual, Yang explained; his staff and Biden’s talk all the time. However, this doesn’t mean he’s ready to endorse Biden for president.“I don’t have any plans to endorse as of this moment, but something could change at any moment, my phone could ring at any moment,” Yang said.And his phone did ring, frequently. He spent most of the train ride he wasn’t talking to me pacing back and forth on his phone next to the train bathrooms, out of earshot.“I’ve been clear from the get-go that if someone were to champion a universal basic income in their campaign, it would go a long way” toward getting his endorsement, he said. Yang named Warren and Bloomberg as the two candidates who have taken his suggestion most seriously, saying that Warren read his book and publicly stated that basic income was an “option to consider,” while Bloomberg’s team has been “looking at it very actively,” Yang said.Speaking of Bloomberg, I posited, there have been reports that the former mayor of New York and current billionaire tried to get Yang’s support by floating the vice presidency as an option. In response, Yang smiled, laughed, and gave me a look, but said he could not comment specifically on whether Bloomberg had asked him.“I’ve gotten outreach from people who have suggested that [joining a ticket as vice president] is a consideration,” Yang said. “It’s flattering to be considered as someone’s running mate and everyone also knows I wanna do what I can to make Donald Trump a one-term president.”(Shortly after we spoke, Yang tweeted “I have a feeling it might be a tough day for the Bloomberg campaign.”)However, Yang’s team has also been looking into running for the office Bloomberg used to occupy.“You know, we’re looking at it,” Yang said of running for mayor in New York City’s elections next year, crossing his legs to reveal socks with comedian Ronny Chieng’s face on them.“One of the things I’m most curious about is who are the other candidates in the race, and what the race would look like,” he said. “Because I tend to want to do something where I feel like I’m gonna have a big impact and add a lot of value, so if there’s someone who’s already running who would have a positive agenda that’s very aligned with mine — I’m not someone who is just driven by maximum political advantage. I wanna see how much value I can add.”Just then CNN’s Van Jones walked over, telling me he would have to “bug” Yang in a few moments, to prepare for the Super Tuesday show that evening.“We’ll see!” he said, before we thanked each other and I went back to my seat to finish my bagel. As he got off the train, he donned a navy blue hoodie, putting the hood up to cover his face.

"     Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg still refuses to give up countless emails from more than a dozen of his top city staffers during his term as mayor of New York City that were hosted on private Bloomberg.net servers — despite years of requests by the current mayoral administration — according to nearly three years of records obtained by BuzzFeed News and interviews with current New York City officials.“Bloomberg LP still needs to turn over the emails,” Freddi Goldstein, press secretary for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, recently told BuzzFeed News about the billionaire’s company. “There is a responsibility to the public to turn over these records.”While it’s been known Bloomberg used private servers during his 12-year term as mayor, a practice allowed under city rules, dozens of pages of records obtained by BuzzFeed News under the state disclosure law and interviews shed light on how the city spent recent years attempting to get Bloomberg’s staff’s emails and its exasperation at getting stonewalled.The discourse from spring 2016 to fall 2018 shows the city’s Law Department began pressing Bloomberg LP to disclose emails from Bloomberg and his staff in April 2016. The requests began one month after the New York Daily News reported none of Bloomberg’s email had been made public.The issue had been percolating since the year Bloomberg left office. In 2013, Gawker reported that Bloomberg and former first deputy mayor Patti Harris “use @bloomberg.net email addresses to prevent their conversation from becoming public documents.”Bloomberg did eventually hand over thousands of his emails, but only emails in which he was personally the sender or recipient.The City, which covers New York City Hall, reported in December that Bloomberg had sent 1,590 emails from his private server during his time as mayor; those were given to the Department of Records and Information Services in 2017.However, the records obtained by BuzzFeed show at least 15 members of the former mayor’s staff, including deputy mayors and top policy advisers, were also “significant users of Bloomberg.net while they were in the Mayor’s Office,” according to a May 2016 email from the NYC Law Department to Bloomberg LP’s Tom Golden.Officials in the de Blasio administration told BuzzFeed News in February that none of the emails from those 15 individuals were ever disclosed, except in cases where Bloomberg himself was the sender or recipient.The New York City Charter says that documents of “historical, research, cultural or other important value shall be transferred to the municipal archives for permanent custody.”Stu Loeser, a spokesperson for the Bloomberg 2020 presidential campaign, did not answer questions from BuzzFeed News about why the records on Bloomberg.net from those 15 staffers were not disclosed to the city. In an email, he noted that the staffers also had accounts hosted by NYC.gov, operated by the city, which were handed over for the city’s archives.“Bloomberg LP provided to the City hundreds of thousands of bloomberg.net emails between the Mayor and his staffers regarding City business,” Loeser said. “The fact that some staffer used their terminals to message each other on non-City matters is no different than colleagues sending gmails to each other, which happens in every workplace.”BuzzFeed News asked Loeser if he was suggesting the 15 staffers only used the Bloomberg.net accounts for nonwork communications with each other — which would be remarkable, since other records reveal that they used those private accounts for government business with the mayor. Loeser did not answer the question.BuzzFeed News also reached out to Bloomberg LP and its law firm that handled the email matter, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, but did not hear back.The records obtained by BuzzFeed News indicate Bloomberg LP slow-walked discussions about the records, including canceling a meeting at the last moment and missing a phone call entirely. City officials said they kept up phone calls to Bloomberg into 2019, but were ignored and finally gave up.“If you keep calling, after a certain period of time and no one is returning your calls or responding to your emails, you know, there's other business to tend to, and it was clearly becoming fruitless effort,” an official in the New York City mayor's office told BuzzFeed News.“I don’t think they really cared,” the official continued. “Their nonresponsiveness kind of tells you everything you need to know.”In one email, sent at 10:30 a.m. on a Thursday in September 2016, Bloomberg LP lawyer Tom Golden told the city’s Law Department, “I suggest we cancel this afternoon's call; no new information on my end.”Golden had also missed one of the calls with the Law Department entirely that June. “Sorry got tied up,” Golden wrote the same day as missing the scheduled call, “tried to send a meeting cancellation but probably did it incorrectly.”In response, an official in the Law Department said, “It looks like you weren't able to make the call....Maybe we could touch base next week and return to our biweekly schedule.”Bloomberg’s campaign did not answer a question from BuzzFeed News about why Bloomberg’s staff had not allowed city officials to review the emails from those 15 staffers to decide whether they merited preservation.The 15 Bloomberg administration staffers identified as “significant users” of the Bloomberg.net server, according to the city’s records, are as follows: Michael Best, deputy counsel to the mayor; Anthony Crowell, director of operations and counselor to the mayor; Daniel Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development; John Feinblatt, chief adviser to the mayor for policy; Shea Fink, scheduler; Patricia Harris, first deputy mayor; Vincent La Padula, senior adviser; Robert Lieber, deputy mayor for economic development; Kim Molstre, deputy mayoral aide; Kevin Sheekey, deputy mayor for government affairs; Edward Skyler, communications director and deputy mayor for operations; Nanette Smith, mayoral aide; Robert Steel, deputy mayor for economic development; Dennis Walcott, deputy mayor for education; and Howard Wolfson, deputy mayor.Those officials could have been discussing any number of current events, de Blasio’s office official said.“They're the people making the city run,” the official said. “I can tell you that staffers at that level are discussing everything from a snowstorm to major policy announcements.”","Michael Bloomberg’s Top Mayoral Staff Used A Private Email Server And He Still Won’t Release Their Emails

"     At least two US senators intend to probe Clearview AI, the secretive facial recognition startup that’s compiled a database of billions of photos scraped from Facebook, Instagram, and other websites, about the sale of its technology to countries with documented human rights abuses.On Tuesday, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts sent a letter to the company questioning the sharing of its facial recognition software with countries including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, following reporting from BuzzFeed News. Last week BuzzFeed News reported that Clearview documents indicate that more than 2,200 private and public organizations around the world, including the FBI, Macy’s, and law enforcement agencies in 27 different counties, have tried its technology, which matches a photo of someone’s face to existing pictures of them on the web.Markey, who also sent a letter to Clearview in January following stories in the New York Times and BuzzFeed News, called responses to that initial inquiry “unacceptable.” He sent a second letter on Tuesday, noting that the company is unique from other facial recognition firms because “it scrapes billions of photos from social media sites rather than using relatively limited sets of photos from existing government databases.”      “Recent reports about Clearview potentially selling its technology to authoritarian regimes raise a number of concerns because you would risk enabling foreign governments to conduct mass surveillance and suppress their citizens,” he wrote.Markey’s letter comes on a day when a representative for Clearview is also expected to meet with Sen. Ron Wyden’s office to discuss the use of its technology and its rapid expansion. A spokesperson for Wyden’s office said that Clearview CEO Hoan Ton-That had been expected to attend but pulled out the night before. This is the third time the executive has asked to reschedule.A Clearview spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about Markey’s letters or the company’s meeting with Wyden’s office.Since unveiling some of the details around its facial recognition software earlier this year, Clearview AI has drawn scrutiny for its claims about the accuracy of its technology and the entities with which it works. While Ton-That has maintained in media interviews that his company is focused on working with law enforcement agencies in the US and Canada, BuzzFeed News’ reporting last week showed the company is looking to expand in sectors including retail, real estate, and banking, and markets from Brazil to the Middle East.Of particular interest to Markey and Wyden is Clearview’s work in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. According to company documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News, the startup had provided free trials to various government-related agencies there. Those same documents showed that UAE’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company, had run searches using the facial recognition tech, as had the Ministry of Interior’s Child Protection Center in Abu Dhabi.In Saudi Arabia, Clearview documents show the company gave access to the Thakaa Center, also known as the AI Center of Advanced Studies, a Riyadh-based research center whose clients include Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Investment. News outlets have documented numerous human rights violations in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, where, for example, there are laws that discriminate against LGBTQ individuals.In a Jan. 31 letter written in reply to an early inquiry from Markey, Clearview lawyer Tor Ekeland made no mention of the company’s private industry or international clients, describing its software as a “critical law enforcement tool.” In the letter, Ekeland noted that Clearview had not been aware of any abuses of the tool and noted that “all the harm is speculative.”“Clearview is committed to keeping it that way, and working with you to ensure that the use of biometrics in law enforcement strikes the proper balance between protecting our communities and our constitutional rights,” he wrote.On Tuesday, Markey called that four-paragraph letter from Clearview “unacceptable” and sent another inquiry. In it, he asked if the company could guarantee that its technology would not enable human rights abuses and inquired about what steps, if any, had been taken to ensure that Clearview was in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).He also asked a question about the company’s plans to work on live facial recognition with surveillance cameras and augmented reality glasses. “If so, will Clearview commit to halting all such integration given the grave privacy and civil liberty risks this would pose to the public?” he asked.In a statement, Wyden said Clearview's offering of its product to ""a Saudi regime that is responsible for horrifying human rights abuses"" was ""deeply troubling.""""This company has repeatedly misrepresented its product to the public, shown a troubling disregard for basic security practices and now appears willing to offer its technology to autocratic regimes as well,"" he said. ""Congress needs to consider whether U.S. companies should be able to export this kind of powerful surveillance technology to nations where it will likely be used to punish dissent and enable repression.”      ","Senators Are Probing Clearview AI On The Use Of Facial Recognition By Gulf States And International Markets

"     MIAMI — Michael Bloomberg acknowledged Tuesday that his only path to the nomination is through a contested convention but insisted that he was staying in the race.During a testy exchange with the press corps following him while he campaigns in Florida, Bloomberg said he was “in it to win it” and rejected the idea that his presence in the race was helping Bernie Sanders’ candidacy.Reporters pointed out to Bloomberg that other moderate candidates, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, have dropped out and endorsed Joe Biden to consolidate the anti-Sanders vote, and asked if he would do the same.“Joe’s taking votes away from me,” a visibly irritated Bloomberg said. “Have you asked Joe whether he’s going to drop out?”“I have no intention of dropping out,” Bloomberg said.Bloomberg was appearing at a campaign field office in Miami where he was introduced by former mayor Manny Diaz. Though Florida doesn’t vote until March 17, Bloomberg is spending the day here campaigning while the Super Tuesday states hold primaries. Bloomberg has built his strategy around Super Tuesday, in which 14 states and one US territory are voting, after skipping the first four states on the calendar. Though Bloomberg has polled fairly well in many of the states voting Tuesday, he’s faced increased pressure to drop out of the race as the Democratic establishment has united around Biden, who won South Carolina last weekend.“I don’t know why that’s the case,” Bloomberg said when a reporter asked him about criticism that his presence in the race is helping Sanders secure the nomination. “Miss, are you gonna ask a question or give a lecture?” Bloomberg said before relenting and responding to the questions. “I think that I know how to beat Donald Trump. I think I know how to run this country, I’ve been practicing that for a lot of years.”Asked what states he expects to win Tuesday, Bloomberg said, ""I don't know whether you're gonna win any. You don't have to win states, you have to win delegates.""When a reporter asked him if he wants the primary to go into a contested convention, he said, ""I don't think that I can win any other ways.""""A contested convention is a democratic process. There are rules in the Democratic Party about how you go about this, and I did see Bernie Sanders said all of a sudden he didn't want to follow the rules."" Bloomberg said. ""I find it offensive that Bernie Sanders, who, the last time he ran, was in favor of that kind of a convention and now he's opposed to it.""","Michael Bloomberg Said He Can’t Win Without A Contested Convention

"     MINNEAPOLIS — The young woman answered Jared Mollenkof’s question with what sounded like a question.“Bernie Sanders?”Standing in her wool socks on the stoop of her home in Northeast Minneapolis, she looked anything but certain about the question of whom she planned to vote for on Tuesday.“I do really like Elizabeth Warren too,” she offered, looking at the faded stickers on Mollenkof’s winter jacket: Warren for President, Warren Has a Plan for That. “She’s right behind.”Mollenkof explained why he was voting for Warren, a spiel he’s given hundreds of times by now at doors across Minnesota, which will go to the polls in the Democratic primary on Super Tuesday. With her arms crossed tightly, the woman told Mollenkof she agreed with everything he said: She loved Warren, thought she was amazing. But.“I just do worry about her beating Trump,” she said. Her voice went up in a question again. “Sort of…with regards to her as a woman? That’s why I’m leaning towards Sanders.”The woman listened, nodding eagerly, as Mollenkof, who is black, explained that he worried too — all the time. He wanted to beat Trump more than anything else. He assured her the data, the history, didn’t back up the fear that a woman couldn’t beat Trump. He told her why he thought Warren could.“I guess…I guess I should just figure out whether I’m for Bernie or Warren,” the woman said. “I do think that maybe my fears are irrational too.”But as Mollenkof trudged through the crusted-over snow to the next house, and the next, he said he didn’t have much hope that the woman would change her mind. More than likely, he thought, she would end up voting for Bernie Sanders.By his count, Mollenkof had knocked on 1,250 doors for Warren, across not just Minnesota but Tennessee, his home state, and on freezing cold weekends in Iowa, too. He had heard that same worry, that Warren couldn’t win because she was a woman, a lot. And he had tried to talk people out of it a lot.And the more he’d heard it, the more Mollenkof saw Warren slide in the polls.With three days to go until Super Tuesday, he was upbeat. He was hopeful. And he was also getting, well, a little angry.“I think we could unite after a contested convention,” he said. “And I kind of want to leave some blood and teeth on the way.”“Blood and teeth” — a phrase borrowed from Warren a decade ago, in her fight to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Her first choice, she had said, was to create a strong, independent agency. “My second choice is no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.”Warren hasn’t won a single delegate since Iowa. But she raised $30 million in February. And in the wake of an abysmal finish in South Carolina on Saturday, her campaign began to talk openly about a contested convention — their plan to take the fight all the way to Milwaukee, where the convention will be held, in July.She has stayed in the race even as two other candidates, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, dropped out in the days before Super Tuesday, endorsing Joe Biden in an attempt to consolidate the moderate wing of the Democratic Party.Warren has given no indication she will do the same. On the campaign trail lately, she has been fighting, openly, with the fierce energy that began her career in politics.To understand why, you can look at Jared Mollenkof.“Every office I’ve ever worked in has told me they want to have more black employees, but it’s just a supply, not a demand, issue,” Mollenkof said. “I am just so fucking sick of people saying, like, ‘I really want a woman to be president, but just not this woman at this moment.’“And I want the party to have a reckoning with that fact.”      Minnesota was ground zero of Warren’s steady rise last summer: In August in St. Paul, in the midst of a drumbeat of excitement over her plans and unyielding anti-corruption message, she drew the largest crowd of her campaign at that point in the race — some 12,000 people out on the grass in the late summer sun. She stayed for more than two hours to take selfies.That all feels far away now, with the ground packed hard with snow.There aren’t clear, obvious answers about what happened between then and now, with Warren’s shot at winning a majority of delegates almost entirely gone.Pundits have blamed Warren’s fall on her wavering stance on Medicare for All late last summer, her unwillingness to change her messaging into the winter, her lack of momentum, her rejection of traditional methods like super PACs.But Warren also built her campaign on the back of a massive army of paid organizers and volunteer canvassers and phone-bankers. She didn’t spend her money on pollsters to tell her how to fine-tune her message or television ads to blanket the airwaves in early states. Her campaign thought it was better off persuading voters in one-on-one conversations.That army was thought to be one of Warren’s strengths going into Iowa. As she has struggled in those early states, many observers have wondered if it wasn’t also a weakness — an overreliance on grassroots organizing that seems, in the end, not to have mattered as much as they’d hoped.But Mollenkof and other organizers he works with in that grassroots army have seen enough, talked to enough people, that they have come up with their own idea of what happened. In the end, it’s pretty simple, they think: It’s misogyny.Neil Chudgar was one of the first volunteers for Warren’s campaign, long before she had paid staffers in Minnesota. He spoke wistfully of last summer, when Warren was at her height: “It really looked like we were going to win the state.”There was the huge, energetic crowd in St. Paul. And, especially, the Minnesota State Fair — Chudgar remembered that in the famous “bean ballot,” where fairgoers place dried beans into clear tubes to cast their primary vote, Warren was the only candidate in state history to need a whole extra tube to hold her beans. She won 38% of the vote, doubling even Klobuchar.What does he feel now, with Warren far behind in state polls?“I love Elizabeth Warren,” Chudgar said simply. “And I’ve learned more about misogyny in the past few months than I ever realized.”There was one day, specifically, when Mollenkof started to think about how he wanted to leave behind “blood and teeth”: the debate in Iowa, when Warren was asked about news stories that Sanders had told her he thought a woman could not beat Trump.“I think it's really shitty that the fight with Bernie turned out better for him than for her after it seems pretty clear that he said that shit,"" Mollenkof said. “And the fact that people don't think she's smart enough to know that accusing a man of sexism would result in her losing votes is offensive. She was aware of how that was going to play out, and she did it anyway because that was the truth — and she lost votes in New Hampshire.”Mollenkof, who works as a public defender, fell in love with Warren early in the race, and followed her through her ups and downs — a “roller coaster,” he called it.He had originally expected to spend Monday and Tuesday focused on the trial of a client; he had worked some 140 hours over the past two weeks preparing for it. But at the last minute, the state dropped its case.      That meant more time to canvass for Warren. After doorknocking from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, he would be out the next day, and the next.To celebrate, Mollenkof painted his nails with a thick coat of liberty green, the color of Warren’s campaign, smudging the paint around his cuticles. He hadn’t wanted to have his nails painted in case of a trial: You never know what a juror might think.He is still fiercely, tirelessly, behind Warren. But, he admitted, canvassing for Warren was “a lot easier” back that summer — not because of his own feelings about the candidate, but because people were eager to talk about her. They liked to be part of the winning team.“I was ready to gamble a lot of money on her being president,” Mollenkof said.Lately, instead of gambling, he has simply been donating a lot of money to Warren — more than he’s ever given to another candidate, despite his love for Barack Obama and his work on behalf of Hillary Clinton in 2016.Like Warren’s team, he’s convinced she’s the only candidate who can unite the Democratic Party’s ideological wings. There’s another thing driving him too.""It feels like you’re watching a game play out that's rigged against one team,” Mollenkof said.“The basketball hoops have been set at different heights, and you're watching, and the refs aren't doing anything about it. And you just get angrier and angrier.”      After the devastation of Clinton’s loss in 2016, Mollenkof did his research as he tried to decide who to back in the 2020 primary. He bought books by Sanders and Buttigieg. He wanted to be excited about Buttigieg, he said: Mollenkof is gay, and there was something meaningful about that. And he did like Sanders’ politics; he’d voted for him in the 2016 primary.But Warren was the one Mollenkof fell in love with. He loved the way she talked about poverty and race and class. He loved the way she listened. She was the candidate, he thought, who could truly run the federal government competently.Mollenkof has only met Warren briefly — a few unremarkable conversations in selfie lines. But like so many of her volunteers, he feels like he knows her personally. He tells voters not just about her plans, but how she created them. He tells them about how nice she is to her staff. Watching her this election, he said, felt like cheering your kid as they run a big race, one you know they might not win. You’re just that invested.Mollenkof’s love for Warren, he said, came in large part from talking to people of color who respected her: DACA recipients, black women criminal justice advocates in the South. “Those women do not pity a fool, and that sealed it,” he said.Mollenkof has watched, though, as Warren has struggled with black and Latino voters. The support he thought she might get at first never materialized. That night in South Carolina, she would finish with around 5% of the black vote.He isn’t entirely sure what happened.“It— I have wondered if there is some level on which that, like, people just reached the conclusion that a Harvard professor that grew up in the places that she did would be incapable of really relating to African American communities,” Mollenkof said. He thought her claim of Native American ancestry might have had something to do with it too.“It makes me nervous to try to put my finger on why — why the coalition hasn’t been more diverse. Especially when it seems like some of the endorsements would have been so helpful, and I…I don’t know.”Of the hundreds of doors Mollenkof has knocked for Warren, the one that sticks out to him most was one of the first people he met in Minnesota, in the mostly black neighborhood of north Minneapolis. An older black man invited him into his home, he said, and proudly showed off a display on his wall: a full-size stop sign that he’d written “TRUMP” on the bottom of, decorating it with Christmas lights. The man was retired and lived alone; it wasn’t clear whom the sign was really for, besides himself.To Mollenkof, the man is a reminder.“I don’t know how the Democratic Party does the best job of honoring the experience of the people that have been most harmed by the Trump administration,” he said. “But it is important that when we get him out of office that we don’t just try to turn the page and try to cross the aisle, but we actually hold people accountable for the crimes this administration has committed.”Mollenkof believes there are only two candidates who “have the stomach” to do that: Warren and Sanders.Did he think the man from north Minneapolis would vote for Warren?“I don’t know,” Mollenkof said. “I don’t know who he’ll vote for.”      “Hey hey,” Mollenkof said over and over again when voters opened the door. “I’m a volunteer with the Elizabeth Warren campaign.”He always makes a point to say he’s a volunteer; white voters, of which there are very, very many in Minneapolis, always assume black volunteers must be staffers, Mollenkof said. “They think you must be paid to do this,” he explained. People are ruder when they think you’re getting paid.All day Saturday, from voter to voter, up one block of modest single-family homes and down another, the sense of anxiety was strong. There were a lot of undecided voters, a lot of people who admitted they didn’t care about issues as much as they wanted to beat Trump. Despite a highly engaged, almost entirely Democratic electorate in Minneapolis, Mollenkof passed few yard signs: one Amy, one Bernie, one that said “Any Functioning Adult.”“She’s taken a knock,” one Warren voter told Mollenkof, sadly, squinting out into the sun from her porch. “I don’t really know what to do about it.”“I think a lot of people have gotten worried about pundits and polling,” Mollenkof told another woman. “But if people get out and vote their heart, then we’ll end up in the right place.”Mollenkof gets the anxiety, he said. He feels it too. But he doesn’t listen to it.""I've been an eternal optimist on every campaign I've ever worked on,” Mollenkof said. “I've doorknocked on Election Day thinking we’re going to win on every campaign I've ever worked on.“It'll be so much less fun if I don't fully engage and drink the Kool-Aid in that regard, and so I do.”A lot of the campaigns he has worked on have lost. There was Hillary, of course. But one loss that really sticks out to Mollenkof was from the 2018 midterm elections, when he was living in Tennessee. He campaigned hard for Phil Bredesen, the former governor, who was running for Senate.Mollenkof really thought Bredesen could win, he said. But he can pinpoint the day he believes Bredesen lost the race: when he said he would have voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.It was a bid to win some of the state’s moderate and conservative voters. But that was the day when so many of the young, progressive women who had been working tirelessly on Bredesen’s behalf simply stopped showing up to phone-bank and canvass. Bredesen said it on a Tuesday; by that weekend, Mollenkof said, 60% of their volunteers had canceled on them.He couldn’t blame them. He was “pissed,” too. And even though he still showed up to canvass, he did less than he would have. He felt he couldn’t push family and friends to volunteer, either, because they asked a question he didn’t really have an answer to: “If he was going to have voted for Kavanaugh, why do I care if he’s in the Senate?”This is the theory that drives Mollenkof, and a case he makes over and over again as he campaigns for Warren. The candidate who will beat Trump, he said, is the one who can inspire the widest swath of people to turn out to the polls, not the one who will just flip voters away from Trump.We don’t need to change Republicans’ minds, he told a young couple on Saturday who had invited him out of the cold and into their home to talk about electability, despite the fact that they had friends visiting from out of town.“It’s the people who don’t even show up to vote,” Mollenkof told them. “The 144,000 people in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania who didn’t turn out in 2016.”Mollenkof grew up in a religious, anti-abortion home, the son of evangelical missionaries in Africa. His father, who is white, is extremely conservative but deeply opposed to Trump; he dislikes the president so much, Mollenkof said, that he changed his stance on issues like climate change to be as far from Trump’s as possible. But he didn’t like Hillary Clinton, either. Mollenkof thinks he probably didn’t vote in 2016.Does Mollenkof ever think about picking a Democratic nominee whom his father would vote for too?“No,” he said simply. “Because I wouldn’t want to vote for that person.” ●","He Knocked 1,250 Doors For Elizabeth Warren.

"     For a brief moment last Tuesday after the Democratic presidential debate, past the hallways that snaked from the spin room to the exit near the back of the Gaillard Center in South Carolina, two of the candidates ended up stuck together in a small room, unable to leave.There was a problem with the door — security needed to unlock it — and so they stood together waiting. Had chance put them there with anybody else, it might’ve been a moment of awkward silence. Amy Klobuchar and Bernie Sanders dislike plenty of people, but not each other.The fact of their friendship, based on a little-discussed, yearslong mutual respect, is all at once entirely unexpected and intuitively obvious. As candidates, they shared a stubborn force of will and a fierce distaste for their enemies — both of them salty, but in vastly different ways. As senators, they work together all the time, but in matters of ideology and political sensibility, they agree on very little. He, for example, will hate this article — see: ""political gossip,"" personality-driven media, etc. She already loves it.“Hey, Bernie,” she told him in Charleston last Tuesday, flashing a little smile as they waited to leave the Gaillard Center, their respective SUVs idling outside in the dark. “BuzzFeed is writing a story about us.”Klobuchar’s decision to drop out on the eve of Super Tuesday was a move aimed squarely at stopping Sanders’s rise — consolidating the moderate wing of the Democratic party. Sanders, meanwhile, spent Monday night in Klobuchar’s state, holding a rally with thousands in St. Paul. Klobuchar’s endorsement of Joe Biden on Monday, Sanders’ campaign suggested hours before his Minnesota event, changes nothing about their strategy.But he is losing something rarer in this year’s presidential field: a friend.The Democratic primary drew a cumulative 28 candidates who, isolated from everyone but one another, forged unique relationships under the pressure of a unique experience. Amid the bizarre mix of personalities and political biographies on the presidential stage this year, Sanders and Klobuchar had this year’s most unlikely repartee — a puzzle of compatibility that even their own staffers can’t totally decode but cast as illuminating on both sides.“She’s always willing to reach out to anyone,” a senior Klobuchar adviser said of the Minnesota senator’s efforts to pursue common ground across partisan lines, a fact of which they are quite proud. “But there’s a little personality match there that oddly works.”“He likes people who are real and so does she,” a senior Sanders adviser said of the Vermont senator’s radar for political phoniness, a fact of which they are also quite proud. “Neither give a shit about putting on pretense.”      On Monday night in St. Paul, hours after she left the race, Sanders spoke about his fondness for Klobuchar. “We came into the Senate together in 2006, and she is one of the hardest workers that I know. I like Amy.”The personality match, aides to both senators said in recent interviews, is undergirded in mutual respect in spite of their sizable disagreements. Sanders frequently talks about Klobuchar’s work ethic. (“She is always working,” he’ll say.) The moderate and progressive have partnered on multiple bills in the Senate, including one recent effort to import cheaper prescription drugs from Canada. (The amendment failed, with 13 Democrats also voting against it.)In 2017, when CNN asked Sanders to participate in a televised debate on health care policy against Sen. Ted Cruz and another Republican, it was Sanders’s idea to invite Klobuchar to appear as his co-debater at the event. The two presented a tag team–like effect, mostly banding together over a topic that would sharply divide them in the Democratic primary a year later.      The personal relationship between Sanders and Klobuchar dates back more than a decade, when on a trip to Vermont, she and her husband, John Bessler, stopped to have dinner with Sanders and his wife, Jane, at a restaurant there.More recently, in 2018, Sanders and Klobuchar ran into each other on a flight from Washington to Minneapolis. She was flying home. He was with three staffers, en route to campaign for candidates across the Midwest. When they got on the plane, Klobuchar moved to sit in the middle seat next to Sanders. When he had a problem with his ride to the hotel, she insisted on taking him herself. And when she walked him from the gate to baggage claim, introducing him to every Minnesotan she recognized along the way, she began by saying, “This is my friend Bernie.”Outside, an aide was waiting in a sedan. There wasn’t enough room in the car, but without hesitation, Klobuchar put Sanders in the front seat and crammed into the backseat with his three staffers.The two senators are both respected and influential among their Senate colleagues, but Klobuchar and Sanders also have a reputation for rubbing other Democrats the wrong way. Both can be tough on the people who work for them, though Klobuchar has been accused of harsher treatment, like throwing objects that strike staffers.Former aides said Klobuchar could become obsessive about getting credit, particularly for bills that she sponsored, sometimes holding up other offices to ensure she got credit. In Senate tradition, the lead lawmaker on a bill has their name listed first; Klobuchar’s communications staffers are known for frequently emailing reporters who incorrectly list the order of names to correct the record, noting that their boss, not a different senator, is the lead on the bill.In the New Hampshire debate that propelled Klobuchar to a surprising third-place finish in the state, Klobuchar was asked about Hillary Clinton’s biting assertion about Bernie in a January interview: “Nobody likes him. Nobody wants to work with him. He got nothing done.”      “I like Bernie just fine,” Klobuchar said onstage, referencing their work on the 2017 pharmaceutical amendment.“We actually had a vote late at night one time, the Klobuchar–Sanders amendment to—”Sanders interrupted, leaning over to look at Klobuchar at the podium next to him.He broke into a grin.“I thought it was Sanders–Klobuchar? No?” he said.“Nope, nope, nope, it was not. It was not,” Klobuchar said.The field of departed candidates now vastly outnumbers the five remaining trying to make it to the White House. But all of them learned for themselves that running for president is a strange and lonely business. People can watch up close — staffers and advisers, friends and partners, reporters and volunteers — but only those who have done it know the singular experience.Months before he ended his campaign, after a day of long drives and small crowds across Iowa, Rep. Eric Swalwell returned to his hotel in Des Moines around midnight, ordered a plate of deviled eggs for dinner from the lobby bar, and talked with reporters about how much he missed his 6-month-old kid at home in California. Elizabeth Warren told NBC News the experience “can be thrilling but also very lonely.” And Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur who dropped out of the race last month, recalled the slog of early party dinners in Iowa and New Hampshire.“Frankly it was a lot of the other second-tier candidates — and those events were kind of lonesome,” he said in an interview. “You show up and people are very polite, but a lot of them are just being courteous. Some of them don’t even know who you are. Then you go out there and you do your thing and you hope they like it. There’s a lot of putting yourself out there, so you naturally empathize with the other people who are putting themselves out there in that setting too.”“There is a real bonding experience and kinship that comes with this process,” Yang said.At party dinners, debates, and parades over the last 14 months, against the super-serious backdrop of a race to unseat Donald Trump, genuine relationships flourished between certain candidates with small gestures.Yang remembered agreeing to switch time slots at a town hall–style event with Klobuchar. “From there I think Amy and I had a better connection,” he said.      Pete Buttigieg tried setting up a series of “get-to-know-you” calls with candidates he didn’t know well, such as Kamala Harris, according to three of his former staffers.Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who dropped out of the race last weekend, made it a habit to methodically say “goodnight” to the candidates at the end of every debate, including once when he famously interrupted Sanders and Warren in the middle of a heated confrontation in Des Moines.“The stakes are amazingly serious. It can’t be any more serious. So could we please have some joy as we go about life in the meantime and treat each other well?” Steyer said, laughing in an interview before he left the race.“Are you kidding me? What a cast!” he said.Klobuchar and Sanders, two of the most serious and stubborn candidates to run in the last year, didn’t exactly find “joy” in one another. But they did find common admiration for their work.At the debate in New Hampshire, Klobuchar went on to talk about her own “receipts” — her bipartisan bills, her victories in Republican districts in Minnesota, and her large number of newspaper endorsements, another particular obsession of Klobuchar’s.She listed all three of the New Hampshire papers that had endorsed her.“I must confess, I don’t get too many newspapers’ editorial support,” Sanders said when she was finished. “Must confess that.”“What do you mean — you got the Conway endorsement,” Klobuchar interrupted, turning to Sanders — a reference to the Conway Daily Sun, another local newspaper in New Hampshire.“I did. We’re very proud of that.”Klobuchar gestured to him, satisfied, and turned back to the audience. “There we go.”      ","Remembering This Election’s Strangest Friendship: Bernie Sanders And Amy Klobuchar

"     DALLAS — In the hours leading up to Super Tuesday, Joe Biden was having some of the best moments his campaign has had in months.After handily winning South Carolina over the weekend, a wave of endorsements came from legislators across the country, including three former rivals for the presidency, two of whom dropped out of the race just in the previous 48 hours.“Just a few days ago the press and the pundits declared this campaign dead, but South Carolina had something to say about it,” Biden said at a rally in Dallas on Monday night. “And tomorrow, Texas and Minnesota and the rest of the Super Tuesday states, they’re going to have a lot to say about it.”“In all we now have 1,500 endorsements, including 36 congressmen. Mayors, elected officials, are joining the campaign, in just the last two days,” he added later.In Iowa, and then in New Hampshire, and then in Nevada and South Carolina, Biden repeated the mantra each time that this was the state that was the real beginning of the campaign. And in each of those states, his team worked to downplay expectations as his performance in the first three of those contests stood in contrast to his frontrunner status at the launch of his campaign.Biden’s animated performance Monday, however, alongside Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, and — at a previous event — Pete Buttigieg, spoke to an emboldened campaign coming off a decisive victory in South Carolina — thanks to the overwhelming support of older black voters.“I cannot think of a better way to end my campaign than joining his,” Sen. Klobuchar said Monday night, campaigning for Biden for the first time since dropping out of the race that morning.The crowd was a combination of decided Biden voters, those leaning his way, and former Buttigieg and Klobuchar supporters who turned their support to him in the past few days.“Especially with Amy and Beto it was right on the money, it was perfect. It seems like the campaign has been energized,” said Sherelyn Roberts, 71, at Biden’s packed rally in Dallas on Monday evening, where a marching band set the scene for a campaign event with a distinctly more lively crowd than the former vice president’s events have tended to draw in recent months.With 14 states voting and a third of the total number of delegates at play on Tuesday, Biden and Bernie Sanders have been polling close to each other in several states recently, with Sanders ahead in some — including in the delegate-rich states of California and Texas.On Monday, Biden laid out some of the same pointed attacks on Sanders, who was an Independent for most of his time in Congress, that he has brought up in recent weeks without mentioning his name: “People don’t want the promise of revolution, they want results, they want the revival of decency, honor, and character,” he said.“If Democrats want a nominee who’s a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, an Obama–Biden Democrat, then join us. We can either win big or lose big, that’s a choice,” he added.Biden praised Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and O’Rourke, casting them as the future of the Democratic Party — Klobuchar “had the grit and determination to do anything she set her mind to”, and O’Rourke was “a man who electrified this state and nation,” “a man with unlimited future.”He reserved the highest compliment he could think of for Buttigieg — “[Buttigieg] reminds me of my son, Beau,” Biden said at an earlier campaign stop after Buttigieg endorsed him.Buttigieg told reporters, ""When I ran for president we made it clear that the whole idea was about rallying the country together to defeat Donald Trump and to win the era for the values that we share, and that was always a goal that was much bigger than me becoming president and it is in the name of that very same goal that I am delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president.""Klobuchar, taking the stage at the rally to chants of “Amy!” from the crowd Monday night, appealed to Texans to “vote for dignity, vote for our heart, for our country.”And O’Rourke, whose 2018 Senate run came within inches of unseating Sen. Ted Cruz but didn’t quite get there, was there as a sharp reminder to Texans of how close they’ve come in recent years to flipping their state at various levels.O’Rourke called Biden “the antithesis of Donald Trump,” and said he decided to endorse Biden after seeing him at a CNN town hall in Charleston, South Carolina, last week, responding with empathy to Rev. Anthony Thompson, who lost his wife in the Mother Emanuel AME church shooting in 2015.“He wanted to heal that man, he wanted to heal Charleston, South Carolina. But as someone who lives in El Paso, Texas … I felt Joe Biden healing us,” O’Rourke said.For Texas Democrats, gains in recent years on both the state and federal levels have been exciting and frustrating at the same time — to come close but not quite defeat Cruz, to be nine seats away from a majority in the state House. Among Texas Democrats, there’s been a tension on how to keep that momentum moving, to either take the path of centrist candidates to win over unsettled independents and moderate Republicans, or to present bold progressive candidates to activate young and Latino voters who could represent rising political forces, as their numbers have grown in recent years.“Por ultimo, in 2018, all of us, a lot of the people who are here on this stage, ran the greatest grassroots campaign Texas had ever seen, we won more votes than any Democrat had in Texas history,” O’Rourke said, closing out his speech, “Ladies and gentlemen, el proximo presidente de los estados unidos.”Several of O’Rourke’s former staffers, some of whom played an instrumental role in that Senate run, are working for the Sanders campaign in Texas or have moved on to work on down-ballot races for markedly more progressive candidates than Biden.Biden’s campaign is making the case to Texas that only a moderate candidate like himself is capable of delivering progress for their state.“He can bring together that coalition of our fired-up Democratic base, as well as independents and moderate Republicans,” Klobuchar told the crowd in Dallas.Several voters in the crowd said they support Sanders’ proposals in principle but said they can’t see how he’d pass them, and worry that a more progressive candidate could damage the prospects of other Democrats down the ticket, especially in Texas where Republicans still control both houses in the Capitol and officials litigiously went after Obama’s policies for years.Immediately following Klobuchar and former Democratic leader Sen. Harry Reid’s endorsement of Biden on Monday, Sanders told a rally that “the establishment” was getting “very, very nervous.”Some voters at the Biden event on Monday said they found that suggestion condescending.“I’m offended by somebody saying, ‘establishment’. I just want somebody who’s best for this country, and I know that’s not Donald Trump,” said Charlene Powell, 55, who voted early for Biden.“I don’t have a card to the establishment. I’m not a card-carrying establishment member. What does that mean, ‘establishment,’ Bernie?” said her husband, Jay Powell, 62, who also voted for Biden. “We’re capable of thinking for ourselves.”A handful of voters who spoke to BuzzFeed News at the Biden event Monday echoed what moderates and independents said in Iowa two months ago — that even if they don’t agree with Sanders on most things or would worry about his effect on down-ticket candidates, they would still vote for him in November if he wins the primary.One Biden supporter at Monday’s rally, a former lifelong Republican who said she switched parties because of Trump and supported Buttigieg until he dropped out, said she’s excited to vote for Biden, but she, too, would vote for Bernie Sanders if it came down to it.Judy Hockenborough, 60, was at the rally in Dallas wearing a T-shirt plastered with Buttigieg’s logo and a sign on her back that said “former Republican.”“First I went for Beto, then I went for Pete, they’re both for Biden, so I think Biden can do it,” she said.“I would still vote for [Sanders],” if he wins the nomination, she said, “I’m going to vote blue no matter what, because I can’t stand Trump. I feel like he’s ruined my party. I will vote for Bernie. I won’t be happy about it. I think Biden would do a much better job.”","An Emboldened Joe Biden Made His Case To Super Tuesday Voters With A Raft Of Endorsements Behind Him

"     In 2016, Super Tuesday was the beginning of the end for Bernie Sanders, as returns came in from primarily Southern states.This Super Tuesday will likely be very different.For one thing, this Super Tuesday is a lot bigger: One-third of the total delegates will be allocated in contests today. The two largest states (California and Texas) in the country vote today, along with the 10th (North Carolina) and 12th (Virginia). Two of those states, California and North Carolina, are new additions to Super Tuesday.For another thing, Sanders is expected to win California — possibly by a big margin — and stay competitive in or even win Texas.Today’s also the first time Michael Bloomberg will appear on ballots. He’s spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising over the last few months for this day. He will likely be competing in many states with Joe Biden, fresh off his decisive win in South Carolina, for the votes of more moderate Democrats. This will also be the first set of contests without Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, though they will remain on the ballot and have already received votes in states with early voting.Sanders is pretty likely to come in first or second in almost every state, if not every state, which could be significant — especially if he splits those results with four different candidates.Here are a few things to understand about Super Tuesday, as you watch returns come in:You will hear a lot of talk about delegates in the coming weeks. To win the Democratic nomination automatically, a candidate needs to win a majority of the delegates awarded by the states. That’s unlikely to happen (though still possible). So the margins between the candidates, and all the little delegates they pick up along the way, will be important.States generally award delegates in two ways: based on the total statewide results and by congressional district. In both state and district, the party awards delegates to candidates who earn at least 15% of the vote.Some states vote by mail, most notably California, which means the specific delegate results in the state may take days or even weeks to determine.Why?If a few candidates are at 16% and 14% statewide, it could take a while for California to determine how the delegates will be awarded. If Sanders wins California and no one else clears 15% statewide, he would probably come close to winning 400 delegates. If Sanders wins California and two other candidates clear 15%, he would still win a lot of delegates, but the proportions would be reduced.This same exercise — determining who clears 15% — will play out across the congressional districts in California (and all the other Super Tuesday states). Those results may not be the same as the statewide ones. For example: The results will probably be different a) statewide in California, b) in a congressional district that’s in Los Angeles, c) in a Silicon Valley–area congressional district, and d) in a congressional district that covers a farming area in California. It’s complicated and can take time.The general point is: Look for the winners in these states voting today, but remember that when it comes to delegate totals, the results might look a little different from what you’re expecting.States that close at 7 p.m. ETVermont (16 delegates)Bernie Sanders will win this state and probably take all the delegates.Virginia (99 delegates)This is a state where Biden, Bloomberg, and Sanders will all be looking to do well — but especially the first two. Virginia’s largest population is in the Washington, DC, suburbs of Northern Virginia. This area is now reliably Democratic, but is also where more center-left and moderate Republicans have done well in local contests. Black voters and military voters also play an important role in Virginia elections, primarily in the Richmond and Norfolk areas.States that close at 7:30 p.m. ETNorth Carolina (110 delegates)This is the fourth-biggest state on the map Tuesday and with some of the most split polling: It’s hard to know who will win, and it will be interesting to watch! Biden is hoping to do well in North Carolina on the strength of his South Carolina win; black voters and more moderate, conservative Democrats play a key role in elections here. Sanders, however, has campaigned hard in the state, especially on college campuses. Bloomberg has also invested heavily in the state.States that close at 8 p.m. ETAlabama (52 delegates)This is one of the Southern states that Joe Biden hopes to win, based on the strength of his performance in South Carolina, where older black voters and older white moderates powered him to a big win. Bloomberg is also looking to do well here.Tennessee (64 delegates)Likewise, Biden is hoping to do well in Tennessee, another Southern state where more moderate white voters and black voters are likely to account for a big part of the electorate. Bloomberg is also looking to do well here.Texas (228 delegates)Democrats dream of using Donald Trump’s unpopularity to activate the nonvoters in the state and turn Texas blue on the strength of its large population of young, Latino, and black voters. In 2018, Beto O’Rourke came close to making part of that happen in a race against Ted Cruz. Where Texas Democrats did win, however, is in the affluent suburbs of Houston and Dallas.The polling in Texas is a little all over the place. Some polls put Bernie Sanders up by a fair amount in the state, on the strength of his popularity with Latino voters, and younger voters of all races. He’s spent a fair amount of time in the state. Bloomberg has spent big here. Biden is hoping to be above the 15% mark. And lastly, this is one of the states where Elizabeth Warren is staking her longshot strategy to stay in the race. She’s spent a fair amount of time, and a lot of early organizing energy, in the state where she lived and worked. Her campaign’s thinking is that if she can place in Texas and California, she can amass a small, but important delegate total.Oklahoma (37 delegates)There hasn’t been a ton of polling here, and both the moderates and the progressives have a case to make. Warren, a native Oklahoman, is also hoping to secure some delegates.Massachusetts (91 delegates)Sanders and Warren are both trying to win outright in Massachusetts, the state she represents in the Senate, and a New England neighbor to Vermont. Despite all the “ooh drama” takes about Sanders campaigning here in recent days, this is the fifth-largest state on the Super Tuesday map, and Sanders would like to pick up as many delegates as possible in a traditionally liberal state.Maine (24 delegates)Sanders is hoping to win this New England state as well, though it has a flinty moderate streak (Maine is sometimes a general election battleground state), and it’s one where Pete Buttigieg had previously looked to do well, so someone like Warren or Biden may benefit.States that close at 8:30 p.m. ETArkansas (31 delegates)Biden and Bloomberg will both be looking to win. This is a Southern state, but one where Sanders may do a little better than he’s done in other Southern states. He still pulled in 30% of the vote in 2016, despite the long legacy of the Clintons in Arkansas.States that close at 9 p.m. ETColorado (67 delegates)Sanders is expected to win Colorado by a potentially substantial amount. Though the state has only recently become blue in general elections, Coloradans recently elected Jared Polis, one of the most progressive governors in the country. Sanders will also likely benefit from his strength with young white voters, young Latino voters, and liberal bros. Warren is hoping to clear the 15% threshold here.Minnesota (75 delegates)This one changed on Monday, when Amy Klobuchar, who has never lost a statewide race in Minnesota, ended her campaign to endorse Biden. Sanders also polls strongly in the state and held a rally there on Monday night. It’s a big state — the sixth largest on Super Tuesday — so the results matter.States that close at 10 p.m. ETUtah (29 delegates)One wild card in Utah: This is a state where Buttigieg polled well, and where Bloomberg has too. With Buttigieg out of the race and Bloomberg potentially a little damaged in recent weeks, will Biden benefit? Will Sanders? Sanders is hoping to win by a fair amount here.States that close at 11 p.m. ETCalifornia (415 delegates)Some polling has Bernie Sanders winning California by 15 or 20 points. If that actually happens, it will have an enormous effect on the race. He’s campaigned extensively on combating climate change and changing US immigration policy — two core issues important in California. His organizing strength in Nevada with Latino voters, a yearlong campaign to make their concerns a priority and activate that voter group, make his campaign the one to beat in California. Unlike 2016, his campaign has also spent a lot more time attuned to the delegate race, focusing on parts of the state that deliver delegates but don’t always get visited as much. If he wins big, this will be a big part of the reason. If he doesn’t win as big as he’d hoped, though, that could promise big issues in March for the Sanders campaign as the field starts to consolidate.Warren and Bloomberg are also hoping to clear 15% here statewide, and though Biden is unlikely to do so, that would be huge for his campaign. One thing to watch: Voting in California started on Feb. 3 (the day of the Iowa caucus). A decent share of the vote has already been cast — probably some of it for Buttigieg and Steyer, who are no longer in the race.Also voting on TuesdayAmerican Samoa (6 delegates)These are caucuses and there’s been no polling, so who knows! Let’s find out.","What To Watch For On Super Tuesday

"     As centrist Democrats consolidate around Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, progressive organizations that have divided in support between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren said they do not have a plan to quickly band behind one of the two to form a coalition against the moderate threat.Justice Democrats, founded by alumni of Sanders' 2016 campaign, suggested Monday that Warren ease up on attacks on Sanders and commit to supporting him with her delegates should he continue to run well ahead of her campaign. But groups that have backed Warren for months or years — like the Working Families Party and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee — are showing no sign of relenting in their support or beginning to coalesce around Sanders’ frontrunning campaign to match the support Biden’s now receiving.“The point I want to make is that most voters aren’t extremely ideological and there are voters that support Sanders who would never support Warren and there are Warren supporters who would never support Sanders,” Adam Green, the cofounder of PCCC, which supports Warren’s campaign, told BuzzFeed News about the different bases of support who might not support each other in the primary. He added that he believes Warren supporters would support Sen. Sanders if he were to become the party's nominee. “Warren remains the second choice for tons of voters and staying in this race is helpful to progressives across this country because there are tons of Amy and Pete supporters who would have defaulted to Biden if she weren’t there.”Progressives who are supporting Warren’s campaign argued that Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar have given Warren a real shot at picking up enough delegates to help her campaign survive Super Tuesday by ending their own campaigns to back Biden. If Warren can continue on toward the Democratic convention with delegates, they argue, it would help the progressive movement no matter which candidate wins in the end. They’ve suggested that either candidate could make a deal with the other prior to the convention in a bid to keep their delegates together. They also pointed to her commitment to staying in the race as beneficial to Sanders on the debate stage.“One can close their eyes and imagine a debate stage on March 15 with both Bernie and Warren tag-teaming Biden,” Green told BuzzFeed News. “His campaign would be declared dead in minutes on Wikipedia.”He added that the best outcome from Super Tuesday would be that Sanders and Warren would be the last two Democrats running for the party’s nomination. “We’d have two members of the progressive wing running against each other, and I really don’t see a better situation for progressive voters than that one.” This, however, looks unlikely in the short term, with Biden going into Super Tuesday far ahead of Warren in the delegate count, and in a better position in many of the 14 states with contests.“The last couple days of this race have underscored exactly how fluid it still is, and there are a lot of delegates that are still up for grabs,” said Joe Dinkin, the Working Families Party’s national campaign director. “One of Warren's talents is that she has brought new people into the progressive movement, and they aren't all necessarily Bernie supporters. Having two progressive candidates accumulate progressive delegates could prove very valuable.""Those comments come after both Buttigieg and Klobuchar announced that they were dropping out of the presidential race in the days after the South Carolina primary, where Biden blew out the field and emerged as seemingly the strongest chance at stopping Sanders’ campaign from at least reaching a majority of delegates after winning New Hampshire, Nevada, and narrowly placing in second in Iowa.On Monday night, Buttigieg and Klobuchar both announced that they were endorsing Biden in the hours before Super Tuesday. Beto O’Rourke, who also ran for president this cycle, also endorsed Biden at his Monday night rally in Dallas.Other progressives, like Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, have said that Warren is standing in the way of Sanders and could push the party toward a contested convention.“Senator Warren has been an ally of the progressive movement throughout her entire career. But I hope she stops attacking Senator Sanders and publicly commits to give her delegates to him if he has more votes to ensure a progressive wins the nomination,” Rojas said in a statement. I'd say the same to Bernie. Pursuing the nomination through a contested convention without accumulating the most delegates would be harmful for our movement, our party, and the policies she's spent her life fighting for.""Spokespersons for Warren’s campaign did not respond for comment.On Monday morning, Democracy for America, one of the last major progressive organizations to endorse a candidate, voted to endorse Sanders over Warren with 79% of the voters in its endorsement poll choosing his candidacy and 13% choosing Warren. The group said in its announcement that it planned to continue to honor the progressive unity pledge it helped design in January and that it planned on “focusing its fire” on candidates supported by the corporate wing of the party.The groups who spoke with BuzzFeed News said that they didn’t currently see a need for a coordinated strategy against Biden’s campaign in the lead-up to Super Tuesday and that they’d planned on working independently of each other.“We’ve been making this argument against corporate Democrats for years and we’ve all worked together on that in the past,” Green told BuzzFeed News. “I think we’ve all been pushing a similar critique of his campaign independently of each other which is that Joe Biden is wrong on almost everything from cutting social security to being out of touch on gender and race issues when we need the most diverse coalition that we can get in the general election.”      ","Progressive Groups Aren’t Ready To Rally To Bernie Sanders To Oppose Joe Biden’s Centrist Army

"     SALT LAKE CITY — The news about Amy Klobuchar and Harry Reid broke in Utah just before Bernie Sanders took the stage. “Let me tell you something,” he yelled into the mic, backdropped by a sweep of mountains and snow. “The establishment is getting very, very nervous.”Past a crowd of more than 5,800 at an outdoor rally in Utah, in the open area set up for members of the press, his deputy campaign manager, Ari Rabin-Havt, arrived to insist that the building number of endorsements for Joe Biden’s presidential bid had changed nothing for the 78-year-old Vermont senator ahead of Super Tuesday contests here and in 14 other states and territories.Did Bernie know about Klobuchar and Reid’s support for Biden, a reporter asked.“Yes,” said Rabin-Havt.Was he freaked out?“No,” said Rabin-Havt.“He also knows about the Nation endorsing us and Democracy for America,” he said, two progressive institutions that recently announced their support for Sanders. “We believe regardless of all this, we are still the strongest campaign coming into Super Tuesday.”In a matter of hours, Biden’s presidential campaign has rapidly consolidated support from establishment and moderate Democrats, with two candidates dropping out to endorse his campaign and longtime party leaders jumping off the sidelines to back him before Super Tuesday.After wins in New Hampshire and Nevada last month, Sanders looked to be on a path to gaining at least a plurality of delegates with a strong performance in states like California and Texas this week. But Biden’s blowout victory in South Carolina last weekend — coupled with growing establishment fears about what a Sanders ticket would mean for the party’s chances both against Donald Trump and in House and Senate races this fall — has altered the race.Sanders typically celebrates any evidence of ""establishment backlash"" — framing it, in speeches and interviews, as proof his movement is working — but the news of moderates moving so quickly to halt his path could be a genuine concern for his chances this spring.Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who surged to best Biden in New Hampshire, ended her own presidential campaign Monday to back the former vice president. Former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, a longtime party titan in Nevada, endorsed Biden on Monday, saying he is the candidate “best able to defeat Donald Trump and enact the policies we all care about.” A slew of former Pete Buttigieg endorsers joined, as did former Obama-era officials like Susan Rice.Buttigieg, who suddenly bowed out of the race Sunday night, endorsed Biden just ahead of a campaign event in Dallas.""When I ran for president, we made it clear that the whole idea was about rallying the country together to defeat Donald Trump and to win the era for the values that we share, Buttigieg said with Biden at his side at a Dallas restaurant. ""And that was always a goal that was much bigger than me becoming president. And it is in the name of that very same goal that I'm delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president.""Beto O'Rourke, who ran for president until late last year, is also reportedly expected to endorse Biden on Monday.The remarkable turn of events has shrunk the presidential race to five candidates after more than a year of a sprawling and at times unruly Democratic field.Thousands of voters have already cast their ballots early in states that vote Tuesday, like Texas and California, where Sanders is poised to net delegates on Tuesday. But in a two-man race against Biden, he would face tougher odds in states later this spring where voters view him less favorably, such as Florida and Georgia.Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, who previously worked for Reid, responded to the wave of news after Klobuchar’s decision with disappointment.      Buttigieg’s exit from the race Sunday night triggered the stampede to Biden. Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia — the first member of Congress to endorse Buttigieg’s campaign — quickly shifted his support to Biden. Steve Adler, the mayor of Austin and another early Buttigieg backer, also moved to Biden. Both Virginia and Texas are Super Tuesday states.On Twitter, Biden’s aides essentially spiked the football. Staffers cheekily began tweeting their own endorsements of their boss and celebrating actual endorsements in real time while bragging about the speed at which they were coming.“DISCLAIMER: Not a comprehensive list,” a Biden spokesperson posted at the beginning of a thread that went on for 12 tweets.      On Monday afternoon, Sanders largely ignored the news.“The fact is after watching this campaign unfold, after watching 10 debates, there is no way you can rationally believe that Joe Biden is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump,” said Rabin-Havt, the Sanders adviser, at the rally in Salt Lake City.“Look, in fact, we did not expect to get the support of Democracy for America today,” he said of the progressive group, which made its surprise endorsement on Monday over Elizabeth Warren.“That is actually a big deal.”Compared to private and public discussion around the Biden campaign, when it became clear over the last two weeks that Sanders could rack up a delegate lead on Super Tuesday that would make it increasingly difficulty for a single candidate in a crowded field to catch up, there has been scant talk among progressives about an effort to consolidate support among voters on the left.      On Sunday morning, two days before Super Tuesday, Warren's campaign manager Roger Lau vowed to compete in the rest of the March caucuses and primaries, where hundreds of delegates will be awarded in 13 states and territories this month after Super Tuesday.“In the road to the nomination, the Wisconsin primary is halftime, and the convention in Milwaukee is the final play,” Lau wrote.Warren has yet to win a state and still faces significant hurdles with voters of color. In the memo, Lau predicted that while she may not win a Super Tuesday contest outright, she would collect delegates from ""nearly every state."" On Monday, after Klobuchar dropped out, Warren received the endorsement of EMILY’s List, a leading Washington group that supports pro–abortion rights women.Before his rally here on Monday, in a press conference at a DoubleTree in downtown Salt Lake City, Sanders dismissed questions about Warren's campaign and her future in the Democratic primary.“I can't speak for Sen. Warren,” he said. “She will do what she wants.”And reports of moderates moving in private to push Buttigieg out of the race to try to blunt Sanders’ chances?The Vermont senator threw up his hands in mock amazement.“I am shocked by that!”      ","Moderates Are Consolidating Behind Joe Biden.

"     The Justice Department and FBI have turned over to BuzzFeed News and CNN the latest cache of highly secretive interview summaries from former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and President Donald Trump’s attempts to obstruct the inquiry.The documents include interview summaries from Trump adviser Jared Kushner, former campaign chair Paul Manafort, former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates, and former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon.Excerpts from some of the interview summaries, known as FBI 302s, are sprinkled throughout Mueller’s report, but many details were omitted. For example, interview summaries released to BuzzFeed News last month revealed that former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe told investigators he had met with other officials several times after FBI director James Comey was fired to discuss ""whether there was predication to open an obstruction investigation on Trump” and other Russia-related investigations.The summaries also showed that senior advisers Stephen Miller and Kushner, along with former communications director Hope Hicks, sometimes drafted tweets for Trump, that Bannon didn’t think the “Putin stuff” was a big deal, and that former national security adviser Michael Flynn sought guidance from Obama administration officials Susan Rice and Ben Rhodes “about how to do things.”Since last November, the government has released about 1,700 pages of interview summaries representing more than 100 interviews. The majority of the documents released thus far have been heavily redacted. BuzzFeed News began a legal challenge last month to one particular category of exemption from the Freedom of Information Act.The Mueller report was the most hotly anticipated prosecutorial document in a generation, laying out the evidence of Russia's interference in the 2016 election and Trump’s attempts to obstruct the investigation. But at 448 pages, it reflected only a tiny fraction of the primary-source documents that Mueller’s team had amassed over the course of its investigation.Last May, BuzzFeed News, and later CNN, filed Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the FBI and Justice Department to gain access to the thousands of pages of interview summaries of all the witnesses who spoke to FBI agents and investigators.Here are the highlights from this installment:Jared Kushner explained back-channel meetings with then–Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak      The documents include a heavily redacted interview summary from April 11, 2018, with Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, which was released following a lengthy review by intelligence agencies.Kushner told investigators during the eight-hour interview that former HBO chair Richard Plepler invited him to a Time Warner luncheon with Henry Kissinger and Dimitri Simes, who ran a pro-Kremlin think tank in Washington, DC. Kushner told agents he pursued Simes at a time when “the campaign was having a hard time getting people to support them.”Simes had reportedly tried to peddle to Kushner compromising information on Bill and Hillary Clinton’s ties to Russia. But Kushner told investigators he “never got from Simes information that could be ‘operationalized.’”During his interview with investigators, Kushner also discussed his meeting then–Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak who said to Kushner, ""we like what your candidate is saying. It's refreshing.""Kushner said “they discussed Syria and having the Russian generals brief” national security adviser Michael Flynn. According to the interview summary, Flynn said there was not a secure line of communication, so Kushner asked whether they could communicate using the Russian Embassy. Kislyak quickly said, “no that won't work.”“Kushner told Kislyak that he wanted to make sure he was speaking with people ‘who can make decisions,’” the 33-page interview summary said.Kislyak also met with Avi Berkowitz, an attorney and political adviser to Trump and Kushner. Kislyak told Berkowitz that Kushner “should meet with someone else who was a better channel through which to communicate to Putin.”Kushner also discussed his meeting with Sergey Gorkov, the head of the Russian state-owned bank Vnesheconombank (VEB). Kushner told investigators he did not prepare for the meeting and that no one from the transition team had “googled Gorkov.”“The meeting with Gorkov presenting Kushner with two very thoughtful gifts; a bag of dirt/soil from the town in Belarus where Kushner’s family is from and a painting,” the interview summary says.Kushner told investigators he did not recall anything about VEB “being sanctioned, or any discussions of US sanctions.”A former foreign policy adviser ripped into Trump’s “shady” campaign and the president himself      J.D. Gordon, a Trump campaign adviser during the 2016 election, unloaded on Trump and the campaign, telling Mueller’s team he was “glad the interviewing Agents were speaking with him as he believed there were a lot of shenanigans happening at the highest levels.”Gordon, a Navy veteran and former Pentagon spokesperson, spoke in unusually vivid detail about dysfunction within the campaign’s foreign policy team and the controversial changes to the Republican platform surrounding Ukraine during the 2016 convention. Several noteworthy details from his interviews with the special counsel’s office were excluded from Mueller’s final report.“Gordon described the Trump campaign as being disorganized and chaotic at times and stated it was important for the Agents to understand that concept when conducting this investigation,” according to an August 2017 interview summary.Among Gordon’s complaints were that Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks had lied about contacts between the campaign and Russians.“Gordon said he hoped the Russian investigation was very thorough,” the summary says. “Gordon thinks Trump must be guilty of something. He is constantly ripping people off. Trump lies all the time and surrounds himself with people who don't tell the truth. Gordon explained Hicks had lied about contact with Russians. Gordon thinks she probably lied to protect Trump whether she knew anything or not.”He also complained that he didn’t get paid for his work on the campaign as promised, prompting him to quit on Aug. 10, 2016.“Gordon was offered a position with the Presidential Transition Team but said he wouldn't show up until he got a check and he never received payment,” the summary says. “The campaign was shady and dishonest.”Gordon said then-senator Jeff Sessions, who ran the campaign’s foreign policy team and later became Trump’s attorney general, was a “good friend” who had offered him the campaign job. But things didn’t go well, according to Gordon.“Gordon described the foreign policy team as being run like a 6th grade student council with no real authority or power,” the summary states. Gordon also said that “the last person to speak to Trump has the most influence on his decisions,” and that Jared Kushner “had a lot of say with Trump.”In one apparent example of campaign dysfunction, Gordon said that Walid Phares, another foreign policy adviser, “had come up with a list of ambassadors to meet with and when Kushner found out, Kushner said only he would be meeting with ambassadors.” Kushner “came up with an idea, which Gordon jokingly referred to as ‘win a call with Kushner,’ where campaign members were asked to write bios on various ambassadors and Kushner would have a phone call with whoever wrote the best ambassador bios about those particular ambassadors.” Phares quit two weeks into the gig after Rick Dearborn, another campaign official, told the advisers “they couldn't meet with ambassadors.”Gordon and someone whose name is redacted “got stuck writing the bios,” and Kushner eventually met with ambassadors for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, according to the summary.“At one point, [REDACTED] sent Dearborn a note about Kushner's outreaches after finding out [REDACTED] tried to setup a meeting with the Saudi prince,” the summary says. “Gordon had [REDACTED] talk to Dearborn about going through the embassies to setup meetings because back channels are always about money.”Gordon said it was Sam Clovis, another campaign adviser, who came up with the list of who would serve on the foreign policy team. The list included Phares, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, and Keith Kellogg, among others.“Eventually Clovis was pushed out of his role,” Gordon’s summary states. Page and Papadopoulos “were bad news for the campaign.” Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI as part of Mueller’s probe.In May 2016, Gordon and Phares were planning to fire Papadopoulos “after a story broke about his statements to the British press,” but Clovis wanted to give him another chance, the summary says. “They were worried that if they fired Papadopoulos he would go to the press and tell them that the foreign policy advisor team was a scam.”Gordon spoke to investigators about two key events that Mueller scrutinized in his final report. His interview summary paints a more vivid picture of one of those events, an encounter with Sergey Kislyak at a reception following an event for ambassadors in Cleveland at the same time as the 2016 Republican National Convention.Mueller’s report said that “Gordon ran into Kislyak as the two prepared plates of food, and they decided to sit at the same table to eat.” There, they were joined by Page and the ambassadors from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. “As they ate, Gordon and Kislyak talked for what Gordon estimated to have been three to five minutes, during which Gordon again mentioned that he meant what he said in his speech about improving U.S.-Russia relations.”Gordon’s interview summary notes that the reception was “a networking event” that offered free food and drink, and that Gordon and Kislyak encountered one another at “the chicken satay tray.” Gordon also said that he “knew the Kazakh ambassador prior to this event.” Page, according to Gordon, “briefly spoke with Kislyak and the Azerbaijan ambassador.” Gordon said he and Kislyak not only spoke about US–Russia relations; they also “talked about Russia's attempt to warn the U.S. about the Boston bomber.”Gordon also shed light on how the Republican platform came to present less forceful language around Ukraine and Russia than what was originally proposed.On March 31, 2016, the foreign policy team held a two-hour meeting in Washington, DC, Gordon said. It was then that Papadopoulos proposed a Trump–Putin meeting.“Gordon described Papadopoulos as acting on his own and wheeling and dealing,” the interview summary states. “Papadopoulos said he was working with the ambassador in the United Kingdom and Putin was interested in meeting with Trump, working through the ambassador to make it happen. Sessions said it was a bad idea and shut it down. Apparently Papadopoulos kept doing it, repeatedly going around Gordon.”During both his August 2017 interview and a 2019 interview with Mueller’s office, Gordon recalled comments Trump made about Ukraine and Russia. “In that meeting, Trump said the Europeans should do more about the situation in Ukraine,” reads the summary of an interview with Gordon on Feb. 14, 2019. “Trump had also said he wanted better relations with Russia and he didn't want World War III over Ukraine.”Mueller’s report detailed how months later at the RNC, delegate Diana Denman proposed an amendment to the platform that expressed support for Ukraine in the midst of Russia’s ""ongoing military aggression"" — support that included ""providing lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine's armed forces.”“Gordon stated that he flagged this amendment because of Trump's stated position on Ukraine, which Gordon personally heard the candidate say at the March 31 foreign policy meeting — namely, that the Europeans should take primary responsibility for any assistance to Ukraine, that there should be improved U.S.-Russia relations, and that he did not want to start World War III over that region,” the Mueller report says. The amendment was eventually edited from “lethal assistance” to “appropriate assistance.”In his 2017 interview summary, Gordon said Denman was “hell-bent on arming Ukraine” and that he had heard that she “had been to Ukraine and was involved in elections monitoring there. Denman was a [Ted] Cruz delegate and a protagonist.”Gordon said Denman “was upset” by his desire to “withdraw the whole amendment.” He also said that Trump and Manafort “exacerbated the issue by lying about the platform in the news on July 31.”“Manafort denied the campaign's involvement in changing the platform in an interview with Chuck Todd,” the summary states. “Gordon explained that the campaign was involved in legitimately changing the amendment through debate. Trump doesn't pay attention and ended up saying the same thing in an interview with George Stephanopoulos. Trump said he had heard the campaign was involved in the change but he had nothing to do with the platform change.”Near the end of his interview that day, Gordon heaped more criticism on Trump — but stopped short of accusing him of collusion. Though the beginning of the sentence is redacted, the summary says “Trump was involved in inappropriate activity” and that “Gordon made this statement based on 3500 lawsuits Trump is involved in, business deals with Russia, not paying his policy office. The investigators could likely find something illegal Trump was involved in but Gordon is not aware of any election meddling that Trump was involved in.”A delegate interview contradicted Mueller's finding      In May and June 2017, prosecutors and FBI agents interviewed two delegates to the Republican National Convention to understand what happened with the party’s platform on Ukraine.One delegate proposed language pledging “lethal defensive weapons” to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, but the platform was softened to promise “appropriate assistance.”In his report, the special counsel wrote that his investigation didn’t establish that the efforts by Gordon — a Trump official watching the process — “to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia.”Diana Denman wanted the party to take a strong stand and arm Ukraine. She said Gordon told her he needed to clear that amendment with “New York.” Denman asked Gordon three times with whom he was speaking in New York. Gordon reportedly told her it was Donald Trump.“Denman noted she only shared Trump’s name as the guy in New York with the interviewing agents and refused to tell it to reporters,” the summary said.Denman’s amendment was set to the side — the only one tabled during the meeting. Another delegate, Rachel Hoff, said the campaign hadn’t weighed in elsewhere about the platform and described Gordon’s move as a “rare intervention.”The committee ultimately watered down Denman’s proposal.Gordon told the FBI that Trump often said he wanted to avoid “World War III” with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. He denied changing the platform and said Denman was “hell bent” on arming Ukraine.Gordon denied telling Denman that he was ever on the phone with Trump and said he called Rick Dearborn, another campaign adviser. He “might have said to Denman that he had talked to Trump about these issues in the past” and accused Denman of leaking the changes to the press.The FBI summary notes, however, that Gordon acknowledged Trump and Manafort “exacerbated” the matter by making misstatements on TV about the campaign’s involvement in the platform changes.A Trump campaign aide said Flynn set up a transition period call between Trump and the Afghan president      Matthew Miller, another Trump campaign aide, says he knew Michael Flynn — Trump’s eventual national security adviser who was fired less than a month into the job — from time spent as a civilian Defense Department employee in Afghanistan.Flynn used his connections there to set up a phone call between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Trump during the transition period, a summary of an October 2017 interview with Miller says. Flynn set up the call “in December 2016 utilizing an ambassador contact Flynn had in Afghanistan.”Miller also provided details about the changes to the Republican platform in 2016 regarding Ukraine. “The campaign was there to target amendments that may be troublesome,” Miller’s interview summary reads.“It was as non-nefarious as it comes since the NATO mentality was if you attack one you attack all and it shouldn't just fall on the U.S. to defend Ukraine,” Miller said of the changes. The interview summary states, “Miller didn't think it made sense for the platform to lock the president in to making such a significant commitment to defend Ukraine. Gordon talked to Denman about lightening the amendment and eventually the lightened version passed the vote.”Miller also described Denman as “grandmotherly,” the summary says. When he and Gordon spoke with her about changing her amendment, she was “hesitant about the changes but didn't object.”Roger Stone met with a Russian national who wanted to sell him dirt on Hillary Clinton      The documents included an interview summary with a mysterious figure: Henry Oknyansky, also known as Henry Greenberg, a Russian national who in 2016 wanted to sell Roger Stone dirt on Hillary Clinton for $2 million.Stone’s meeting with Greenberg was publicized in a Washington Post story in June 2018. A month later, investigators from Mueller’s team met with Greenberg at the special counsel’s office in Washington, DC.Greenberg told investigators he met with Stone and Republican strategist Michael Caputo in May 2016. Greenberg was joined at the meeting with his Ukrainian associate, Alexei Rasin, “who offered Stone damaging information on Hillary Clinton.”“Rasin formerly worked for Clinton and was allegedly in possession of financial statements which demonstrated her involvement in money laundering activities with Rasin’s companies. Stone inquired about the amount of financial misappropriations related to Clinton and asked if it was in the amount of millions. Rasin relayed that it was rather somewhere in the amount of hundreds of thousands. Stone ultimately refuted the offer and stated that he did not believe Donald Trump would pay for opposition research information. The meeting then concluded shortly thereafter,” the interview summary states.Greenberg said Rasin has tried to find other buyers for the information he had but was unsuccessful. Greenberg told investigators his motivation was purely financial as he would have received a portion of the proceeds from the sale.The Washington Post story quoted Stone as saying that Greenberg was a longtime FBI informant. The interview summary says Greenberg used to communicate with FBI special agents whose names are redacted and that he “still maintains contact with many individuals who may be of interest to the FBI.”Former FBI director James Comey found government documents while packing for a move      Former FBI director James Comey called the bureau two months after Trump fired him to let officials know that “while packing for an upcoming move, he found a folder with government documents,” according to the interview summary of James Rybicki, Comey’s former chief of staff.Rybicki told Mueller’s team in early August 2017 that a couple weeks prior, Comey had “called the front office telephone number and left a telephone message for Rybicki,” who returned Comey’s call the same day.“Comey agreed to provide the documents the next day when individuals from FBI Finance & Facilities Division (FFD) were returning Comey's personal property,” the interview summary says.The next day, employees from the FFD “retrieved one blue ‘standard’ folder from Comey at his residence,” the summary says. “The folder contained a one page email, a one page chart with handwritten notes on the back and civil litigation paperwork for Comey.” The interview summary doesn’t go into any more detail about the nature of the documents.Rybicki got the records on the same day, then “requested guidance from FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe later that evening on how to handle the documents,” the summary says. McCabe asked that “Comey's civil litigation paperwork go to the FBI's Office of General Counsel (OGC) and the remaining items be provided to FBI's Records Management Division. Rybicki sent the civil litigation paperwork to [REDACTED] the Acting Deputy General Counsel at OGC.”The interview summary says Rybicki also spoke with then–FBI associate deputy director David Bowdich “regarding the remaining documents.” Someone whose name is redacted “retrieved the documents from Rybicki” a couple days later.Previously released interview summaries detailed how Rybicki and Comey kept track of the memos the former FBI director wrote about his interactions with Trump.Rob Goldstone talked about a gift to Trump from a Russian real estate mogul      An interview summary for Rob Goldstone, the music publicist who worked for pop singer Emin Agalarov and helped set up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, appeared to provide more detail about gifts that Emin’s father, Russian real estate giant Aras Agalarov, gave Trump. The Mueller report simply states that Agalarov and Trump “exchanged gifts and letters in 2016,” citing Goldstone’s February interview and others. The newly released summary, however, includes a line that says “a gift for Trump from Emin Agalarov and Aras Agalarov” — father and son. It’s unclear when the Agalarovs gave this gift, as everything around the line is redacted. However, a report by House Democrats in early 2018 found that “At key campaign milestones, the Agalarovs sent notes wishing good luck, conveying congratulations, and offering gifts to Donald Trump” and that the “communications generally occurred through Rob Goldstone.”The summary also provides a more specific date for when Goldstone says he stopped working with Emin Agalarov. The Mueller report says it was in late 2016, while Goldstone’s interview summary says October 2016 — a month before Trump was elected.An adviser said he told Papadopoulos to “shut up” and not engage with Russia      Sam Clovis, the Trump adviser who briefly served in the Agriculture Department, told FBI agents he ordered George Papadopoulos to “shut up” and to not engage with Russia during the 2016 campaign.Clovis described three attempts by campaign surrogates or supporters to set up meetings with Russia, but said he warned his colleagues to steer clear. During his October 2017 interview, Clovis called himself a “Sovietologist” and said he recommended a policy that any paid members of the campaign be required to report any contact with a foreign official.“Russia can be very sneaky and will try to distract you on one side while sneaking by you on the other side,” Clovis told the agents.He explained that he felt like he was “herding cats” while organizing the scattershot foreign policy team and others on the Trump campaign. The summary by FBI agents recorded Clovis saying Gen. Michael Flynn did not have “much depth or thought.” He said Papadopoulos couldn’t be trusted to not talk to the press. He called Stephen Miller a “chameleon.” He said Ivanka Trump was the president’s “blind spot, his princess.”Clovis told the agents that he worked briefly with Ivanka on policies about the Family and Medical Leave Act but he had to remind her that “they were running as Republicans” — and helped her develop more conservative policies.Describing himself as one of the few people who emerged from the campaign without any “scars,” Clovis said he was troubled when the Republican Party changed its platform on Ukraine at the convention and that he fretted over Trump’s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.“The ‘bromance’ Trump had with Putin bothered Clovis but the press and the public fed on it,” FBI agents wrote. “Clovis felt he had to clean up after with a shovel because Trump played up his bromance with Putin for the public.”Manafort maintained close contact with the Trump White House      Roughly 200 pages of the summaries are dedicated to “proffers” by Rick Gates, interviews with FBI agents after his plea deal to tell them everything he knew on more than a dozen subjects.Among the items:Gates described a meeting at the Grand Havana Room in Manhattan with Paul Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik, who is suspected of being a Russian spy. There, Manafort was showing off about his success on the Trump campaign and told Kilimnik about a strategy to win blue-collar workers in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — the very states about which Manafort would later turn over internal polling data.At that same meeting, Gates said Manafort turned down an offer to work on behalf of ousted Ukrainian politician Viktor Yanukovych.Manafort’s proximity to the Trump White House continued through at least February 2018. Gates told the agents that Manafort spoke regularly to intermediaries — such as Kushner and Rudy Giuliani — to get associates appointed to administration jobs.Gates told the agents about his involvement in “insider trading and/or securities fraud offenses” connected to an identity theft company. This section is heavily redacted.Flynn was the campaign official who came up with the “lock her up” slogan, Gates said.Giuliani was on tap to be attorney general — but, Gates said, he “overplayed his hand” and felt he was due a much more influential role in the administration.After the election, Gates said he was approached by an unidentified person who was close to the prime minister of Malaysia, who was accused of looting $700 million from a state development fund called 1MDB. Gates said the person asked him to help “resolve the 1MDB issue between the Malaysian government and the US government.”Gates recalled that Trump told this person the “issue would be resolved” but “Trump did not expound on what he meant.” The person suggested meetings with H.R. McMaster, then the national security adviser, and then–secretary of state Rex Tillerson, but Gates said those meetings wouldn’t be possible. Gates drafted talking points about 1MDB but eventually dropped the issue by February 2018.A Manafort associate had ""no doubt"" he'd met with Russian intelligence      In January 2018, former BBC journalist Jonathan Hawker voluntarily met with agents and prosecutors about his consultancy work with Gates and Manafort; Hawker said he split with the duo “because of his experience in Ukraine and not being paid in full.”In heavily redacted portions of the FBI interview summary, Hawker was asked about work done by the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom with Manafort in Ukraine. The firm ultimately settled a lobbying case with the Justice Department. Hawker described Gates and Skadden lawyer Alex van der Zwaan as having “the active nightlife” while in Ukraine.Hawker told FBI agents about his final meeting with Kilimnik, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late 2015. Kilimnik told Hawker about a “PR opportunity in Russia” and invited the American to meet with someone from the Russian foreign ministry.The FBI summary doesn’t include the name of the person that Hawker met with, but he did tell agents that “he had no doubt the person he met with was a Russian operative.” Hawker said he submitted a proposal for the job but asked for such an “outrageously high price” that there was no way he would get it.Trump, Mueller, and the big chess match      The documents released Monday include an interview with a prominent figure in the chess world, which sheds more light on the special counsel’s interest in a major match attended by powerful Russians just days after Trump was elected.Mueller’s report says that senior Russian government officials — such as press secretary Dmitry Peskov and Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund — traveled to New York for the match between Norwegian and Russian players in November 2016. Dmitriev tried to use the event to meet people close to Trump but was apparently largely unsuccessful, according to the special counsel’s findings. Otherwise, the event is scarcely mentioned in the Mueller report; in written responses to Mueller’s team, Trump said he didn’t attend the event — though the Trump Organization had been asked months before to host it.“Although one World Chess Federation official recalled hearing from an attendee that President-Elect Trump had stopped by the tournament, the investigation did not establish that Trump or any Campaign or Transition Team official attended the event,” the Mueller report states.That official was Beatriz Marinello, who was then the vice president of the World Chess Federation. Mueller’s team spoke with her in May 2018, and the interview is cited only in this one instance in the final report.But the complete interview summary, released Monday, fleshes out what the FBI heard about Trump’s purported attendance at the match and a Russian businessperson’s role in organizing the event. Marinello said “various celebrities and prominent businessmen from New York attended,” including actor Woody Harrelson, and that “the event was full of Russians.” She said she “remembered seeing the Russian Press Officer at the event,” but couldn’t remember the person’s name.“Another individual at the event claimed that Putin was in Florida on that day,” the summary says. “Marinello believed that statement to be false however, as she did not see any news coverage of Putin being in Florida.”Marinello said Ilya Merenzon, the CEO of a company called Agon, organized the event. She said she thought he “may have formerly worked for” Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of the World Chess Federation who was placed under US sanctions in 2015.“During the first week of the 2016 WCC, Merenzon showed Marinello a photograph on his cell phone and told her it was a photo of Donald Trump attending the event,” Marinello’s interview summary reads. “Marinello did not get a good look at the photograph because Merenzon held it from a distance. Marinello could tell the photograph depicted three men but could not identify any of them. Marinello did not see Trump at the event but stated that it was possible he had attended in the VIP area and that she may not have seen him.”Marinello recounted to investigators how more than a year later, she went to Moscow and on the way back ran into Merenzon on her flight. “Marinello recalled asking Merenzon, ‘Do you still have the photo?’ to which Merenzon quickly responded, 'No,'” the summary says of the March 2018 encounter. “Marinello clarified that she did not specifically ask Merenzon if he had the photograph of Trump but she was positive he understood her inquiry to be related to it based on his response.”Marinello said Merenzon had “brought many Russians to the United States for the 2016 WCC,” according to the summary. Marinello guessed that he had brought 10 to 20 “mostly females,” whom she described as “young and casual.”“Merenzon was insistent that the Russians be brought to the United States early, prior to the event,” the summary states. “Merenzon assisted with obtaining office space for them in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. They utilized that space for approximately two months. They rented two small offices located just off of Broadway.”Marinello said the Russians “seemed guarded” when they spoke with her and “only engaged with her when they needed something.”“They often had conference calls with Moscow and were very disorganized,” the summary says. “They had no prior connections to New York and for most of them, it was their first time visiting the United States. Marinello provided that, in normal circumstances, the organizers of the event provided the infrastructure [NFI] needed for the event. In this case, the Russians brought their own infrastructure.” A “case agent note” says Marinello could have been referring “to either computers and/or telecommunications equipment” when she spoke about infrastructure.Throughout the interview, Marinello said she would look for additional information to give the FBI agents, indicating that they were interested in learning more. For instance, near the end, she agreed to search “various documents” to try to find the names of the Russians who worked at the 2016 event for the FBI agents. She also said she would give them copies of the invitations that the Russians received and would search “her cell phone for any additional information which could provide further insight about Russian activities at the 2016 WCC.”“Hannity tailored his shows to the agenda Manafort suggested.”      Sean Hannity continues to be a major presence in the interview summaries. BuzzFeed News previously reported that Hannity had been mentioned more than a dozen times since the Justice Department and FBI began releasing the interviews last November. He often provided guidance and advice to witnesses in the Mueller probe without disclosing it to his audience.The latest entry for Hannity includes this detail from Gates’s FBI interview summary in February 2018. Hannity was a Trump supporter who publicly applauded Manafort's hiring by the Trump campaign. Hannity said, ""Finally, we have an adult in the room"" when Manafort was hired. During the campaign, he tailored his shows to the agenda Manafort suggested. Hannity called himself a ""pundit,"" not ""a journalist.""","Mueller Memos Part 6: What Witnesses Told Investigators About Trump And Russia
        ","            Last updated on March 2, 2020, at 11:49 p.m. ET                Posted on March 2, 2020, at 4:55 p.m. ET      ",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/mueller-report-secret-memos-part-6,buzzfeed
"     A few weeks ago, after the very loose Las Vegas debate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar sat down with CNN’s Erin Burnett, who asked various questions and then teed up a clip of Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg arguing over what it meant that she had forgotten the Mexican president's name.When CNN returned to the live shot, Burnett and Klobuchar sat side by side in folding chairs, squinting grimly at what appeared to be a monitor located somewhere offscreen.“You went on to say,” Burnett said, glancing down at her notebook, “'Not everyone can be as perfect as you are' to Mayor Pete. But what were you thinking in that moment?”Of course, we all know what Amy Klobuchar was thinking in that moment. For nearly 24 hours, as soon as Buttigieg dropped out, Twitter was alight with Klobuchar’s name and GIFs following a narrative of satisfaction and mirth (even if she, of course, tweeted her great respect and regard for the former mayor).      On Monday afternoon, Klobuchar herself dropped out of the race and announced she’d be flying to Texas and endorsing Joe Biden in person and onstage, just hours before Minnesota’s not insignificant Tuesday primary.All of this came just after Buttigieg quit but before he too could endorse Biden — a narrow gap that allowed Klobuchar just one last triumph over the perfect Pete Buttigieg.Or, at the very least, that’s how a lot of people received the news: an online/group text festival of joy in spite. Her distaste for the younger, less traditionally credentialed, male Buttigieg — and the churning rage she plainly felt toward parts of the nominating process — has been one of the rare moments of collective consciousness this election cycle. It was as though, like at the same time, our eyes finally adjusted to a dark room.And maybe because it's so personal, and so entirely detached from the outcome of the election, that it also became a great source of joy online. When Biden's campaign manager mocked the Buttigieg campaign’s third-place performance in Nevada on Twitter, wrote Jon Lovett of Klobuchar, “Let's see if she gives it the old RT.”This aspect of Klobuchar registers differently with people: delight, ironic delight, a leery kind of recognition, a righteous kind of recognition, an outright distaste for the passive aggression on display. Most debates, however, involved at least a few moments of the rage that suggests Klobuchar in her suit and New Balance sneakers pulling out a book of matches while “Smells Like Teen Spirit” cues up.      This was the candidate caught in frame regarding glacially Sen. Bernie Sanders, Biden, and Tom Steyer. This was the candidate who enters a gym in Iowa mid-caucus and goes first to the people in Pete's corner. This is the candidate who remembers a criticism about Washington experience in the November debate and rebuts that line in the December debate.“As usual,” she said last weekend after the Nevada caucus results, “I think we have exceeded expectations. A lot of people didn’t think I’d be standing at this point.”Many of Klobuchar's prepared remarks worked in that two-step formulation: a) a quip in which she has implicitly persevered over a slight, followed by b) a practical answer or plan on policy — often crowd-pleasing, if not as ideological as progressives would like. In this, there's a portrait of Klobuchar: smart, formidable, dissatisfied. There's a National song with this kind of tone, a breakup song. “Besides, I barely ever see you anymore / And when I do it feels like you're only halfway there,” the song goes. “Young mothers love me / Even ghosts of girlfriends call from Cleveland / They will meet me anytime and anywhere.”People have sliced this in different ways: as part of a feminist frustration with male mediocrity or, incorporating what former staffers described as Klobuchar's abusive behavior as a boss, into an argument about the poisonous #GirlBoss.Because there is a darker edge at work here. This was also the candidate who, after failing to name the Mexican president in an interview, cut that interview short, leaving so quickly that her microphone was still attached. She returned an hour later — after telling a different interviewer the Mexican president's name (as she told Burnett, “I have since, many times, said the president's name in numerous other interviews and made it very clear that I know his name”) — to find the Telemundo interviewer and say: “So you see that I know more than you think.”That this element of Klobuchar can be alarming and a source of satisfied comedy is the result of something simple. Klobuchar is deeply competent and, clearly, deeply flawed; the distance between those two things in public life is an authentic individual.","Amy Klobuchar May Be Out Of The Race, But Her Wrath Will Endure

"     FLINT, Mich. — It was a rare move for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign.As the candidate prepared to fly to a town hall in Flint, Michigan — a state whose diverse working-class electorate could decide his future in the Democratic primary — an aide gathered reporters to make an announcement: Sanders would “directly address the African-American community and make the case for why black voters should support him over Joe Biden.""Everyone took note, tapping furiously on their phones.It's not often that Sanders deviates from his core message about social and economic injustice, delivered daily to thousands of people across the country at rallies that clock in, as if by science, at 47 minutes. He hardly ever directs a speech to a specific demographic. And he almost never asks his campaign team to preview a major address to reporters in order to ensure coverage.But a couple hours later, when Sanders stepped to the podium in Flint, he did not give his prepared remarks on race — instead delivering his familiar stump speech, making only brief mention of “a same-old, same-old status quo politics” that, he said, has “failed African-American communities.”After the event, as the campaign’s press bus idled outside the venue, Sanders communications director Mike Casca told reporters that the candidate scrapped his prepared remarks after discussing the event backstage with panelists, including community leaders in Flint and one of his top supporters, Cornel West.The crowd in Flint, a majority black city affected by a horrifying lead-water crisis, was mostly white on Saturday.“It was a change they thought was important,” Casca said, describing the decision as both a deliberate one by Sanders and “one of those on-the-fly backstage moments.”“They wanted to lift up the panelists’ stories.""According to Casca, Sanders worked on the speech on plane rides between campaign events in Michigan and Illinois, two states that will vote in the Democratic primaries in March after a disappointing finish for Sanders against Biden last week in Southern states where black voters made up the majority in Democratic primaries.“They talked over the idea and decided it was probably better to let the people of color who were on the panel discuss instead of him giving a traditional speech,” said Casca.“He does not have those experiences,” he added. “He is a white Jewish man.”Casca said the drafts of the original speech aimed to contrast Sanders and Biden’s record on racial justice — but he declined multiple times to say on which policy areas or votes.Asked whether the candidate will eventually deliver the speech, Casca said, “TBD.”Sanders's town halls, designed as a platform for individual stories of the working class, became an unexpectedly emotional centerpiece of his second presidential campaign through the summer and fall. Although he has largely held traditional rallies since voting began in February, he has said he believes voters' stories can be a more effective tool than any speech.The campaign billed Saturday's event as a town hall on ""racial and economic justice.""All week, at campaign stops across Arizona, Michigan, and Illinois, Sanders has laced into Biden's decades-long record on trade, economic issues, foreign policy, abortion, and LGBT rights. But he stopped short of doing the same with racial justice issues on Saturday night.Sanders, a 78-year-old independent from the mostly white state of Vermont, has struggled to attract, especially, middle-aged and older black voters to his coalition of young people, Latino voters, and white working-class voters.""He didn't want to speak on behalf of people of color when there were people of color on the panel,"" said Casca.Aside from a 30-minute speech at the start of the event, the six panelists spoke more than the candidate himself.

""And the headline said, 'Biden sees advantage with Michigan black voters.' OK?""

"     WASHINGTON — Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz jokingly wore a large gas mask on the House floor when the chamber voted on a coronavirus spending bill last Wednesday.By Monday, his office announced the Florida lawmaker was in self-quarantine after coming into contact with a person who was diagnosed with the coronavirus at CPAC, a conservative political conference, almost two weeks ago.“Congressman Gaetz was informed today that he came into contact with a CPAC attendee 11 days ago who tested positive for COVID-19,” his office tweeted Monday afternoon. “Congressman Gaetz had expected COVID-19 to impact Congress, given the elevated frequency of travel and human contact, and demonstrated his concern last week on the House Floor.”Gaetz doesn’t have any symptoms of the coronavirus, his office said on Twitter, and he has been tested for the virus, but the results haven’t come back yet. He will remain in self-quarantine until later this week, after a two-week period since coming in contact with the person expires. Gaetz also said on Twitter that his DC office will be closed while the member is in quarantine, and that his district office in Pensacola, Florida, will remain open. One person from Gaetz’s district died from COVID-19 over the weekend.Gaetz is one of four members of Congress currently in self-quarantine after interacting with a person diagnosed with the virus at CPAC last month. Republicans Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona announced Sunday night that they were going into quarantine, and Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia announced he was going into quarantine Monday afternoon.The CDC has recommended that, as coronavirus spreads, people avoid shaking hands. Last week, after the CPAC conference, Collins visited the CDC with President Donald Trump and shook hands with the president Friday.      “This afternoon, I was notified by CPAC that they discovered a photo of myself and the patient who has tested positive for coronavirus,” Collins said in a statement Monday. “While I feel completely healthy and I am not experiencing any symptoms, I have decided to self-quarantine at my home for the remainder of the 14-day period out of an abundance of caution.”One other member of Congress, Democratic Rep. Julia Brownley of California, announced Monday that she, too, was self-quarantining after coming in contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19. She is the only member who has announced contact with a person who did not attend CPAC.“Out of an abundance of absolute caution, my DC staff and I are self-monitoring and maintaining social distancing practices,"" Brownley said in a statement.

"     WASHINGTON — Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, who was previously one of Michael Bloomberg’s prominent supporters on Capitol Hill, will now endorse and back Joe Biden.The move is not entirely shocking, given that Bloomberg endorsed Biden as he dropped out of the presidential race. Meeks joins dozens of Congress members backing Biden. Biden has strong support on Capitol Hill — especially among members of the Congressional Black Caucus.""We are grateful for the support of Congressman Meeks as we continue to build a broad and diverse coalition that will defeat Donald Trump this fall,"" said Biden adviser Andrew Bates.Meeks told BuzzFeed News last week that Biden had not reached out to him, as did Rep. Bobby Rush, both CBC members. The campaign, however, told BuzzFeed News the campaign reached out to both members and “asked for their support previously during this election.”A source with knowledge of the situation said that the group of Congressional Black Caucus members who had previously backed Bloomberg would be announcing their support for Biden later Monday.Meeks, while poised to support the more moderate candidate, told BuzzFeed News last week he would stand behind Sanders should he become the nominee. But he also denounced Sanders’ allies, saying he remains concerned about Justice Democrats, a group closely aligned with Sanders’ surrogate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the fact they were launching primary challenges to several members of the CBC.The endorsement speaks to the considerable shift in Biden’s campaign following the South Carolina primary, who up until then trailed Bernie Sanders in early primaries and caucuses. Two presidential candidates exiting the race backed Biden, as did a host of congressional members who were either supporting another candidate or had been silent, including Reps. Val Demings and Bennie Thompson. And Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, two prominent black senators who had both run for president, came out in support of Biden and planned to rally with him in Michigan on Monday night.Rep. Terri Sewell who helped deliver Alabama for Biden told BuzzFeed News “We brought it for Biden,” last week.Those gestures haven’t gone unrecognized.

"     The Working Families Party, a progressive grassroots organization that endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren early in the Democratic primary, is now throwing its support behind Sen. Bernie Sanders after Warren dropped out of the race.“It’s been really unfortunate to see Elizabeth Warren exit the campaign. She’s a progressive lion. We were really proud to stand along with her. But now that she’s out, there’s only one clear choice to continue to push the issues and fight for big structural change and that is Bernie Sanders,” Nelini Stamp, WFP’s director of strategy and partnerships, told BuzzFeed News. “Now that it’s a two-person race, it's a very clear choice. We’ve always said that there were two progressive champions in the race, and we believe that both of them can beat Donald Trump. We’re going to do everything to unite progressives and unite the left to help Bernie be the nominee.”The WFP said that it conducted its initial endorsement process through a ranked-choice voting system of its members, and while Warren won that vote, Sanders finished in a strong second position and many of the voters who’d chosen Warren had listed Sanders as their second choice. The group’s early endorsement of Warren was one of the first flash points and signs of some splintering on the left as some Sanders supporters were upset that the organization hadn’t chosen to initially endorse their candidate and demanded to see the organization’s mathematical process for calculating their endorsement.The group’s Sanders endorsement comes as Warren supporters across the country have been calculating whether to throw their support behind former vice president Joe Biden or Sanders, and as Sanders supporters have pressured Warren to endorse Sanders herself. Other organizations that supported Warren, like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, have encouraged their members in Michigan to strategically vote for Sanders in the primary to push progressive ideas forward but haven’t officially endorsed his campaign.“I, as much as many people, would love and welcome Elizabeth Warren to make an endorsement, but she’s going to do things on her own time,” Stamp told BuzzFeed News. “That is not a decision for us to make for her. At the end of the day, would I love continuing to fight alongside her in this primary? Yes, and we would love that as an organization. But that is her decision to make.”Some Warren supporters have pointed to the harassment they’ve faced online from some Sanders supporters throughout the primary as a point of apprehension for moving to support the candidate. The Working Families Party has said it's aware of those concerns and that it's working to ease its supporters fears and steer them toward supporting Sanders. Earlier in the week, it hosted a call for former Warren supporters to debrief about their experiences with the campaign and it'll be holding another call with elected officials who supported Warren and who are now switching their support Sanders.“It’s hard! I’m not going to pretend like this is going to be easy,” Stamp said about the process of convincing some Warren supporters to move to Sanders. “Most people know in their heart know that the right side, the side that is just, is the side that wants free higher education, the side that wants cancellation of student debt because that’s why they got behind Elizabeth Warren.”","The Working Families Party Is Endorsing Bernie Sanders After Elizabeth Warren’s Exit

"     JACKSON, Mississippi — The past week and a half had seen his campaign turn around, and Joe Biden had no doubt about who to thank for his change in fortunes.“There’s only one reason I’ve come back. The African American community all around the country,” he told the congregation at the New Hope Baptist Church in Jackson on Sunday morning. Biden had attended that morning’s services alongside Rep. Bennie Thompson, who recently endorsed him.“You’re the reason I’m back, no one else,” Biden said again.Black voters in Missouri and Mississippi — stops Biden made over the weekend ahead of Tuesday’s primaries — were keenly aware of their impact on the Biden campaign. Several older black Biden voters who spoke to BuzzFeed News said that while it certainly helps that Biden was Barack Obama's number two, their support for him is also about what they think the country needs to recover from a turbulent couple of years under Trump.They seriously considered their choices, but given the gravity of the situation currently facing black communities under the Trump administration, Biden was the right choice. And it was decidedly not, they said, an uninformed choice, as Sanders surrogate and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested on Thursday.Biden is “safe, and they realize the importance of getting Trump out of there, and they want to go for a sure thing, they want to go for something comfortable, something familiar,” said Darryl Hayes, 61, who was at Biden’s St. Louis rally on Saturday and said he generally likes and agrees with Sanders’ policies but thinks Biden is more likely to win both the primary and the general election.“I think if this election wasn’t so crucial, they might take a chance with Bernie, but the situation with Trump being what it is, they don’t want to take a chance with Bernie,” he said. “[Biden] doesn’t lean as far left as Bernie, but we’re hopeful that he’ll expand Medicare, do something with trade, he cares about the climate, global warming.”“If we don't get the right president in this year, it is going to devastate African American communities and poor people,” said Cleother Griffin, 60, who drove to Biden’s rally in Jackson from Carthage, Mississippi, on Sunday.Some Biden supporters said no one else has made serious inroads with black voters partly because they’re looking for stability over ambitious progressive changes, and someone with the ability to lessen divisions in the country — divisions that feel all too real for people in Mississippi when they flare up, especially off the back of racist political rhetoric.“It’s causing too much chaos amongst us in our communities. It doesn't matter what area or communities you're in, you can see the division still. I live in a neighborhood where there’s white and black, but you know that there’s still tension there just because of color, and so we need a president to understand that,” said Brenda Taylor, 53, in Jackson. “There’s too much division to keep going forward.”The weekend saw another surge of momentum for Biden, as he heads into the next round of primaries on Tuesday: A rally in St Louis on Saturday drew 2,300 people, the largest turnout Biden has seen since his launch rally in Philadelphia last year. An event at an HBCU campus in Jackson drew 1,300, and was noticeably more enthusiastic than any Biden was drawing before South Carolina (albeit noticeably older than crowds at a Sanders swing through HBCUs). Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, two of the most prominent black senators and former rivals of Biden’s, endorsed the former vice president and will appear with him at a rally in Michigan on Monday night.Voters in Jackson said they think Biden is less polarizing and more realistic than other candidates at this point in US history.“Look at the result of having a female candidate for president. Look at the result of having an African American man successfully run the country. I believe there was a blowback,” said Dr. Mary Elizabeth Gilbert Manogin, 35, of Trump being elected despite his racist rhetoric and misogynistic comments.Manogin was at the event with her mother and 15-year-old sister (who can’t yet vote but supports Bernie Sanders). She said she would have loved to vote for Elizabeth Warren, but “unfortunately we are not there. The past few years have shown that to us.""“I think our country is in the stage where it's not a matter of what we want, it’s what we need,” said Lonnie Harris, 65, in Jackson, adding that he thinks Biden has the most experience and insight into how to run the country and maintain relationships with foreign leaders.Sanders, in the lead-up to Super Tuesday, often said that “the establishment is getting nervous” about his candidacy. On Wednesday, Biden told reporters in Los Angeles, “The establishment are all those hard working middle class people, those African Americans, the single women in suburbia.”Black voters in Texas, California, Missouri, and Mississippi said that while there may be some truth in the idea that the party establishment doesn’t support Sanders, writing off their support for Biden as part of that system doesn’t add up to them.Not everyone at Biden’s rallies this weekend was convinced that there was room for their concerns in his plan for the country, and while Biden has racked up endorsements from black elected officials, Sanders has backing from more grassroots activist organizations working across issues like criminal justice reform, climate change, and immigration.At his rally in Kansas City, Missouri, a young black woman who said she was evicted from her home after being diagnosed with cancer and having skyrocketing medical bills protested along with a small group of other activists, shouting that they want a “housing guarantee,” a platform advocated for by fair housing groups which would make safe housing a basic right. Sanders has included the idea in his platform, earning him endorsements from some fair housing groups, but Biden has not.“We need you, we want you, and there's a place for you in our campaign,” Biden said at the St. Louis rally, part of his updated post-South Carolina stump speech.In East St. Louis, “we’ve been overlooked, disrespected, stepped on, and we just want someone to be president who can come and see what they can do to help us with jobs, schools,” said Sam Franklin, who added that the group was able to reach the Sanders campaign, who planned to send a surrogate to East St. Louis the following day. (The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment about whether they had communicated with the group.)“What about us, Joe?” yelled Maria Franklin, Sam Franklin’s wife, and a member of the United Congregations of Metro East, an Illinois and Iowa-based group. “If you can’t pay attention to us and you’re five minutes away what’s going to happen when you’re in DC and you’re five hours, or six hours away?” she said.But with many voters, it didn’t go unnoticed that Biden came to Mississippi this weekend and Sanders did not.“I firmly believe if you want to know anything you have to read it for yourself and you have to take the knowledge you get to educate others,” said Tinisha Woodberry, 38, at Tougaloo College, an HBCU in Jackson that played a central role as a refuge for civil rights activists in the 1950s and '60s. “But for that position, candidates should want to try to reach as many people as you can. One big upset was Bernie Sanders not coming here. The fact that he canceled his visit here, that means something to me.”Despite Sanders’ credentials of civil rights activism including sit-ins, getting arrested at protests, and the 1963 March on Washington, voters at Tougaloo College said they don’t know his connection to the civil rights movement as well as they know Biden, who they said has been a known figure to black communities for decades, and added to that by becoming someone who the first black president trusted enough to recruit as a vice president.“It's a real signal of respect, total respect [for black communities],” that Biden served as Obama’s number two, Cleother Griffin said.While Biden attended church, went to a local soul food spot to pick up lunch, and held a rally at an HBCU in Jackson on Sunday, Sanders canceled a planned trip to Mississippi on Friday to focus instead on Michigan. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, who endorsed Sanders after a caucus of city residents, attended a service at another Jackson church and campaigned on Sanders’ behalf on Sunday.""We look forward to doing as well as we can in Mississippi. It is going to be a tough state for us. But, right now, our focus is here in Michigan, where we think we have the agenda that can win this state,” Sanders said during a CNN interview on Sunday morning.","Black Democrats Know They Saved Joe Biden’s Campaign

"     WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is moving ahead with its plan to enact strict work requirements on people who use food stamps despite the coronavirus pandemic — a move that could result in potentially hundreds of thousands of people losing their eligibility for the program.People could soon be forced to work public-facing jobs when they should stay home or else risk losing access to the assistance they get to buy food.The Department of Agriculture confirmed this week it is sticking to its timeline to tighten work requirements starting April 1. Able-bodied people without children must work 20 hours per week to qualify for SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program formerly known as food stamps.The White House projects 700,000 people would lose SNAP eligibility. Brookings Institute fellow Lauren Bauer filed access to information requests for figures from all 50 states and projected the number of people losing assistance would be much higher, at 1.3 million to 1.5 million.But those projections all came out before the novel coronavirus swept across the United States, causing a wave of self-quarantines and threatening economic downturn.“That number is going to be much, much higher,” she said. “It’s going to cause harm both to the people who are eligible for SNAP, but it’s also going to cause harm for the economy.”One fear is people who particularly work in the service industry or gig economy will see their hours cut as people stay indoors rather than go out to restaurants, bars and sporting events. If those people fall below 80 hours per month, they can be kicked off SNAP. There’s also a public health issue: hourly workers may go into work while they feel ill, a dangerous proposition when officials are recommending most people stay home to help stop the spread of the disease.The Trump administration had considered delaying the April 1 start day for the rule change but ultimately decided to stay on schedule, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue confirmed on Tuesday to a House Appropriations subcommittee.Since the mid-90s, able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 49 without children have been required to work 80 hours per month, or they are capped at three months of SNAP eligibility over three years. But states are currently waiving that requirement in high-unemployment areas. The Trump administration rule change would make it harder for states to get those waivers.Perdue said the administration, however, determined states can mitigate the effects of coronavirus on SNAP enrollment through “good cause” waivers. These exemptions apply when someone has a good cause for missing work, such as falling ill or an office building being shut down due to infection. They can be authorized at the state level and do not need to be approved federally.“Whether you are sick or your job says you can’t come to work, the good cause will eliminate need for work requirements under this rule,” Perdue said in a statement released to BuzzFeed News.Experts have raised concerns that good cause waivers need to be processed on a case-by-case basis. This can cause case managers to become overloaded and people may not even know they are able to make such claims.It also just seems like an odd time to be forcing people to go out and work 80 hours of predominantly public-facing jobs, said Ed Bolen, senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Because “good cause” is a relatively obscure provision, he said, it is not clear whether someone with a sick spouse at home would have cause to stay home from their food service job, even if that’s medically wise.“It just seems short-sighted and counter-productive to condition SNAP benefits on making those kinds of decisions during a public health emergency,” he said.Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee repeatedly pressed Perdue to delay the rule change until coronavirus was no longer a threat, as well as taking other steps to expand the social safety net. “Really it’s a cruel rule, taking food out of the mouths of hungry individuals,” she said. “Why can’t we just postpone or delay this at least until at least this critical moment is over?”But Perdue said any response to coronavirus actions involving food programs would need to be approved by both the White House and Congress as part of a “one government approach” to the problem.House Democrats included a blanket work requirement waiver during the length of the coronavirus outbreak in their signature legislation they introduced to address the crisis. However, that policy package was rebuffed in the Senate, where Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell denounced the bill for creating a “thicket of bureaucracy” that will kill thousands of jobs. What measures ultimately get passed will depend on negotiations between Congress and the White House.","The Trump Administration Will Move Ahead With Their Plan To Kick People Off Of Food Stamps Despite Coronavirus Outbreak

"     WASHINGTON — A day after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic, health experts came to the Capitol on Thursday to brief members of Congress on the disease and testing.But members emerged from the meeting saying they were unhappy with the lack of information health experts provided.“What we still don't have is a real sense [of the situation], and this is what's most important to us. You can talk to us about reagents and processing capacity, but we still don't have is: Can I tell my constituents that if a doctor recommends, that they can get [a test]?” Rep. Jim Himes told BuzzFeed News after the meeting. “We still don't know that, and that's the important question.”A shortage of testing kits has become the latest problem in trying to implement nationwide coronavirus detection, according to reports. But health officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, weren’t able to give “clear” responses on how they would address the issue or how long it would take, members said.Fauci told members in a separate House committee hearing Thursday that the US is “failing” at providing testing for the coronavirus. ""It is failing. Let’s admit it. … The system ... is not really geared to what we need right now,” he told the House Oversight Committee.      There’s a lot we still don’t know about the coronavirus outbreak. Our newsletter Outbreak Today will do its best to put everything we do know in one place — you can sign up here. Do you have questions you want answered? You can always get in touch. And if you're someone who is seeing the impact of this firsthand, we’d also love to hear from you (you can reach out to us via one of our tip line channels).      “The challenge is they didn’t come with much information today,” Rep. Abigail Spanberger told BuzzFeed News after the meeting, which also included officials from the FDA and the Defense Department.Earlier this week, the CDC updated guidance for doctors to better identify patients who should be tested. The revisions would widen the group of symptomatic patients, which unfortunately means nothing without the appropriate testing materials. There have been 1,323 cases of coronavirus in the US, according to the latest data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.Himes said health officials told members that there are “hundreds of thousands” of testing kits, but the problem seems to be processing capabilities, which stems from coordination issues between public and private agencies.“I think most people are going to come out of this very discouraged about where we are, honestly,” Rep. Jason Crow told BuzzFeed News upon exiting the briefing. “We're not remotely where we need to be. I think one of the biggest problems is that the briefers were not able to tell us what the current testing capacity is.”“The fact that the top people leading this response can’t tell me where we are sitting here today means we also don’t know what our plan is to get to where we need to be,” Crow added.Even Republicans expressed their concerns about the delays in testing.“I am satisfied that they’re working towards trying to get new tests out,” Rep. Will Hurd told reporters. “I wish it would be at a— We all wish it was at a quicker pace than it is.”The Republican said health experts conducting the briefing did discuss the number of tests available to the public, but he told BuzzFeed News that while he didn’t “want to misspeak on the data,” the availability is increasing and they are working on a plan.On Wednesday night, President Donald Trump addressed the nation over the crisis and instituted a travel ban from Europe, effective Friday. Himes said the president’s decision to exempt the UK from the ban was “puzzling,” considering it is easily accessible from the rest of Europe.""Heathrow [Airport] is the single biggest travel hub in Europe, right? So just as a layperson, I don't understand that,"" the representative said.","Members Of Congress Are Furious At The Lack Of Information On Coronavirus Testing

"     Joe Biden is looking past the remaining primaries with a shakeup of his campaign leadership and an approach to the coronavirus outbreak framed as a rebuttal to President Donald Trump.During remarks Thursday afternoon in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden pointedly called back to Trump’s address the night before, when from the Oval Office he announced a ban on a significant amount of travel from Europe and described the disease as a “foreign” virus with origins in China.“Downplaying it, being overly dismissive, or spreading misinformation is only going to hurt us and further advantage the spread of the disease,” Biden said. “But neither should we panic or fall back on xenophobia. Labeling COVID-19 a foreign virus does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration.”“Let me be crystal clear,” the former vice president added. “The coronavirus does not have a political affiliation, but will infect Republicans, independents, and Democrats alike. And it will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power, as well as the most vulnerable in our society. And it will not stop banning all travel from Europe or any other part of the world. It may slow it, but as we’ve seen, it will not stop it.”Biden, who on Wednesday formed a public health advisory committee for his campaign, also criticized the Trump administration for cuts to global health investments that he said left the US vulnerable to a pandemic like the coronavirus. And he released a lengthy plan to combat the coronavirus that is heavy on broad themes and ideas, like ""restoring trust, credibility, and common purpose."" But it also includes big and potentially expensive proposals, like preventing Americans from paying out of pocket for preventive care or treatment for the virus, and providing emergency paid leave for people impacted by the virus’s spread.The Democratic frontrunner also called for COVID-19 testing to be made both free and widely available, for mobile testing sites and drive-through medical facilities in each state, and for preparing hospitals for possibly gigantic patient influxes with temporary hospitals and military resources.“Biden believes,” the plan states, “we must spend whatever it takes, without delay, to meet public health needs and deal with the mounting economic consequences.”Trump reelection campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh defended the president in a statement emailed after Biden’s speech. “His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe,” Murtaugh said of Trump, “while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens’ fears.”Thursday’s speech came at a pivotal moment in the campaign. Both Biden and Bernie Sanders have canceled events, citing the public health risks. The next debate, initially set for Sunday in Phoenix, is now closed to spectators and the media and happening in Washington, DC. Just as Biden tightens his grasp on the Democratic nomination and Sanders struggles to reconcile what’s next for his now–long shot candidacy, both are limited to televised moments. (Sanders is expected to address the “health and economic crisis” at a 3 p.m. ET news conference in Burlington, Vermont.)Biden also has canceled upcoming visits to Chicago and Miami ahead of next week’s primaries in Illinois and Florida, and instead plans events such as a “virtual town hall” Friday for Illinois voters. He spoke Thursday about “radical changes” necessary in daily behavior, with more hand-washing and less hand-shaking and more people working remotely. The NBA and NHL have suspended the remainder of their seasons indefinitely. The NCAA’s March Madness tournament is in jeopardy.“We’ll continue to assess and adjust how we conduct our campaign as we move forward and find new ways to share our message with the public while putting the health and safety of the American people first,” Biden said.Just before he began his remarks Thursday, Biden announced a shakeup that puts longtime Democratic strategist Jen O’Malley Dillon in as the new campaign manager and moves Greg Schultz, who had held the position since Biden’s campaign launch last year, into an organizational role that is expected to focus on general election planning.“I am grateful to Greg for his leadership and hard work to help get our campaign where it is today, and I will value his continued input on this campaign,” Biden said in a statement distributed by the campaign. “I am also thrilled that Jen is bringing her considerable talent and insight to this team. She will be a tremendous asset to a campaign that is only growing and getting stronger as we prepare to take the fight to Donald Trump this fall.”Biden often offers his experience in federal government as a reassuring attribute during times of crisis, tragedy, and uncertainty. As impeachment proceedings began against Trump last year, he used a speech in Wilmington to paint the president as a threat to the Constitution. And the overall theme of Biden’s campaign is that Trump — through his character and his handling of racist riots in Charlottesville, Virginia — has forced a battle for the soul of the nation.“No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks,” Biden said Thursday. “But I can promise you this: When I am president, we will be better prepared, respond better, and recover better.”","Joe Biden’s Coronavirus Speech And Campaign Shakeup Show Him Shifting Into General Election Mode

"     Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's press secretary has tested positive for the coronavirus, days after meeting President Donald Trump.Fabio Wajngarten was part of a Brazilian delegation that recently visited the US, and last weekend posted a photo on Instagram of him standing next to Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida.A Brazilian government source told BuzzFeed News that they suspect Wajngarten contracted the virus while in the US.      Bolsonaro meanwhile is being monitored for the coronavirus.      Ivanka Trump posted a photo on Sunday of the Brazilian president having dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.According to Brazil's Folha de S.Paulo newspaper, which first reported the news about Wajngarten, Wajngarten's wife revealed her husband's positive test on the WhatsApp group for parents at the school their children attend.      “The White House is aware of public reports that a member of the Brazilian delegation‘s visit to Mar-a-Lago last weekend tested positive for COVID-19; confirmatory testing is pending. Exposures from the case are being assessed, which will dictate next steps. Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.“As stated before, the White House Medical Unit and the United States Secret Service has been working closely with various agencies to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the First & Second Families, and all White House staff healthy.“To reiterate CDC guidelines, there is currently no indication to test patients without symptoms, and only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine. We are monitoring the situation closely and will update everyone as we get more information.”      Trump earlier responded to a journalist's question in the Oval Office about Wajngarten testing positive for the novel coronavirus, saying, ""I did hear something about that. We had dinner together in Florida, at Mar-a-Lago, with the entire delegation. I don’t know if the press aide was there, if he was there he was there, but we did nothing very unusual. We sat together for a period of time, had a great conversation. [Bolsonaro's] doing a terrific job in Brazil, and we’ll find out what happens — I guess they’re being tested right now.""Trump added, ""Let’s put it this way: I’m not concerned.""Also on Thursday, Florida Sen. Rick Scott said he was self-quarantining after potential contact with Wajngarten at a separate event in Miami on Tuesday.      Just days ago, Bolsonaro downplayed the impact of the coronavirus.“During the past year, obviously, we have had moments of crisis. A lot of that is fantasy.

"     On a flight to Boston in January, James, a young academic, caught the attention of an aisle mate. “Do you go to school in the area?” the red-bearded man asked James, whose name has been changed to shield his identity, amid other small talk about technology and science.Later, as the plane taxied to its gate at Boston Logan International Airport, the man suggested the two connect on social media. But before James could agree or even give his full name, his fellow passenger pulled out his phone and asked to show him something. He opened an app, snapped a photo of James, and then showed him the phone. The app, which flashed a banner reminding its users not to talk to journalists, populated with a handful of pictures from James’ brother’s Instagram account. And James’ face was in every single one.James was dumbfounded to see himself in so many photos on a stranger’s phone. Some of his social media accounts had been set to private, and he had been careful not to post too many photos of himself to the web. But the mysterious app had found him on his brother’s Instagram account within seconds.Later that evening, James received a friend request. It was from the bearded man on the plane — Charles C. Johnson, a controversial right-wing activist and accused Holocaust denier with ties to the Trump administration. Johnson did not respond to multiple requests for comment.      After reading coverage about a new facial recognition tool, James deduced that Johnson had identified him using Clearview AI, a secretive company that’s claimed to have scraped more than 3 billion photos from social media and the web. Last month, a BuzzFeed News investigation found that people at more than 2,200 organizations have tried Clearview’s facial recognition technology, including federal entities such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the FBI, and private companies like Macy’s, the NBA, and Bank of America.Prior to BuzzFeed News’ report, Clearview insisted its tool was strictly for law enforcement. “Clearview AI’s search engine is available only for law enforcement agencies and select security professionals to use as an investigative tool, and its results contain only public information,” the company wrote in a Jan. 27 blog post. “Accordingly, the Clearview app has built-in safeguards to ensure these trained professionals only use it for its intended purpose: to help identify the perpetrators and victims of crimes.”Clearview, however, has shared its technology with organizations it designated as friends, conservative think tanks, Republican lawmakers, and more than 20 potential investors around the world, according to company documents seen by BuzzFeed News. Some of those entities have connections to the far right and the Trump administration, as do Clearview CEO Hoan Ton-That, a MAGA-supporting mobile app developer, and cofounder Richard Schwartz, who was once an adviser to former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani.Ton-That declined to answer a series of detailed questions, saying: “Once again, BuzzFeed’s information is flawed, some of it provided via illegal means. Therefore, we cannot comment.”Got a tip? Email one of the reporters of this story at Caroline.Haskins@buzzfeed.com or Ryan.Mac@buzzfeed.com, or contact us here.The widespread, unregulated use of Clearview’s technology has concerned both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Last week, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology sent a letter signed by each party’s ranking member to Ton-That asking how his company determined who gets access to its products. That was followed by a separate note to Clearview from Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who sought to understand why the startup had provided its software to organizations outside of law enforcement and to entities in countries with histories of human rights violations, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Clearview — which is facing multiple lawsuits from concerned citizens and potential legal action from tech giants including Facebook and Google for scraping their images — has maintained in media interviews that “it’s strictly for law enforcement.” But company data viewed by BuzzFeed News appeared to contradict that statement.A BuzzFeed News review of the publicly available code for Clearview’s web app found that the company had created a list of “company type” designations — including “Government,” “Bank,” and “Investor” — for entities that had access to its tool. Among those 12 labels was one for “Friend.” A security researcher on Twitter also discovered the same label in an independent review of the code.On a list of more than 2,200 entities seen by BuzzFeed News, Clearview apparently designated the “company type” of a handful of organizations as “Friend.” Among them was SHW Partners LLC, a company founded by Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign senior communications official and one-time nominee for White House communications director.      Miller, who cohosts a podcast with Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, declined to comment on Clearview or why his firm was listed as having access to the company’s facial recognition software. Clearview’s records show that an account tied to SHW had run nearly 20 searches, some as recently as October.BuzzFeed News previously revealed that Clearview’s data listed the offices of four Republican members of Congress — including Rep. John Ratcliffe, a current nominee for the director of national intelligence — as having been given accounts, along with someone associated with the “White House Tech Office.” That White House–affiliated account was credentialed in September 2019 and performed six searches.“If a current or former staff member attempted to access more information about this product, it was not an official inquiry and was not sanctioned by the White House,” a senior White House official told BuzzFeed News last month.Beyond SHW, other entities on Clearview’s list with the “Friend” designation included the Samarian Group, a New York–based private equity firm; Droese Raney, a Dallas commercial architecture company; and Tor Ekeland, Clearview’s outside law firm, whose name was misspelled “Tor Ecklund” on the list. All three organizations did not respond to requests for comment.Clearview also provided access to two conservative think tanks: the Manhattan Institute and the American Enterprise Institute.The Manhattan Institute, where cofounders Ton-That and Schwartz reportedly first met, received an account in the fall. A spokesperson for the think tank said Schwartz is a “longtime friend of the Institute” and noted that a former fellow at the organization had served as one of three judges for a supposedly independent report in which Clearview claimed its technology was “100% accurate.”Although the spokesperson denied that the Manhattan Institute used Clearview, a document reviewed by BuzzFeed News shows that one person associated with the organization ran more than a dozen searches.      An individual associated with the American Enterprise Institute is also listed with an account, which, according to Clearview documents seen by BuzzFeed News, was designed to display a banner reading “Richard Says Hi” — an apparent reference to Schwartz. AEI did not return multiple requests for comment.While the data seen by BuzzFeed News listed thousands of organizations with accounts, there were other unknown individual users who ran searches with Clearview’s app. On its list, the startup maintained an entry for “Clearview Test Users,” which included more than 220 accounts that had run more than 30,000 searches over a 19-month period.When asked if Johnson was one of its test users, Clearview, whose founders have a history of connections to individuals on the far right, declined to answer. Johnson has known Ton-That since at least 2016, when the two were photographed at a dinner together.Johnson did not respond to multiple requests for comment via email and phone.      Based on a list of credentialed users reviewed by BuzzFeed News, Clearview met with individuals from many of Silicon Valley’s most notable firms, among them Kleiner Perkins and Greylock Partners. A Greylock Partners spokesperson said a firm staffer met Ton-That at “a defense industry dinner” in late 2018 and was given a demo account that was sparsely used. Greylock is not an investor in the company, they said. A Kleiner Perkins spokesperson did not respond to an email request for comment.Other firms did not invest but are listed in Clearview documents as having run hundreds of searches. Among them was venture capital firm Data Collective Venture Capital, which ran more than 270 scans, some as recently as last month. A spokesperson for the firm confirmed it had used Clearview, but noted that “the product never made it past our preliminary due diligence phase.”“DCVC invests in Deep Tech companies including those in the AI privacy and security space,” they said. “Through preliminary market due diligence, we evaluated the application with test searches of friends and family, conducted with their full consent.”Passport Capital, a San Francisco–based firm which did not respond to a request for comment, ran more than 350 searches, according to documents seen by BuzzFeed News. Another account linked to Sequoia Capital was listed as having run more than 210 scans over a 10-month period. The New York Times previously reported that Sequoia managing partner Doug Leone had used Clearview.""We don't comment on companies we pass on,” a Sequoia spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. “We regularly test apps while we are evaluating an investment, and we no longer have access to this app.""      Founders Fund, the venture firm founded by Peter Thiel, a billionaire and Facebook board member, also appears on Clearview’s list. There were two accounts associated with the San Francisco–based venture firm that have run about 70 searches, some as recently as October, according to Clearview’s records. A company spokesperson did not reply to requests for comment.A spokesperson for Thiel, who personally invested $200,000 in Smartcheckr, Ton-That’s predecessor company — an investment that was later converted into a stake in Clearview — did not provide comment. Thiel’s personal investment firm, Thiel Capital, had a Clearview login, though it appears it was never used, based on documents seen by BuzzFeed News.Clearview didn’t just stick to traditional venture firms. According to documents seen by BuzzFeed News, it provided two accounts to individuals with ties to Iconiq Capital, an investment firm that manages the money of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other tech billionaires. Those accounts ran more than 70 searches, some as recently as February. Iconiq did not respond to requests for comment.Oculus Rift cofounder Palmer Luckey, who now leads defense contractor Anduril Industries, is also listed in Clearview's data as having an account. A spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that Anduril “has never had any relationship of any kind” with the company. Clearview data shows that account as having run more than 20 searches.""Clearview AI, as part of its fundraising efforts, contacted Palmer Luckey in his individual capacity via his personal email to ask him if he would consider investing in their company,” the spokesperson said. “He was sent a test account without requesting one.”Beyond Silicon Valley, Clearview also credentialed people associated with Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, and RIT Capital Partners, a the UK-based investor in the startup. Mubadala Investment Company, a sovereign wealth fund owned by the government of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, is listed in the data as having six accounts that ran more than 100 searches, some as recently as January. An RIT spokesperson confirmed it had made “a very small minority investment” in Clearview. SoftBank declined to answer questions, and Mubadala did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Clearview data reviewed by BuzzFeed News listed more than 20 venture and private equity firms the company had credentialed, but there were others as well. An entry titled “Clearview Investors” showed five associated accounts, though it’s unclear whom those accounts belonged to.Among the known Clearview investors who did not appear in that data was Kirenaga Partners, an investment firm based in Bronxville, New York, led by David Scalzo. A vocal proponent of the startup, Scalzo has appeared on CNBC and various podcasts to defend the company and its technology.One of those appearances was in a January interview with Dilbert creator Scott Adams, who asked the investor if he thought “it’s inevitable the public will have [Clearview AI].”“It is inevitable that this digital information will be out there,” Scalzo replied. ●Emily Ashton contributed reporting from London.

"     BURLINGTON, Vermont — The hard reality of Tuesday night wasn’t losing.And he did lose. He lost Idaho. He lost Missouri. He lost Mississippi so badly that he may only barely pick up delegates. And he lost Michigan, the state that revived his first presidential campaign four years ago. The hard reality, evident days earlier, was much tougher to accept.You could see it last week, when his motorcade arrived for a rally at the fairgrounds in Salt Lake City, and all they could do was watch as a seven-person field rapidly shrunk to a two-man race, with candidates flying in secret to line up behind Joe Biden in Dallas. As the news broke, a senior aide stood in the fairgrounds parking lot near a line of SUVs, visibly shaking with nerves.You saw it back in his Washington headquarters, where staffers reassured themselves by digging back in, as if by muscle memory, to an old trench: “Did we really think they were going to let us have it?” they told one another. You saw it after Super Tuesday, a loss across 10 states, when some senior aides began to worry that Biden wouldn’t even show up to the next debate, simply because he wouldn’t have to. And even as the campaign made a hard last play for Michigan, some aides said they could see “the writing on the wall” — and wondered if the boss did, too.Bernie Sanders promised a singular and unprecedented ability to bring young and working-class people into the political process, an antidote to the “same old, same old status quo,” a campaign of “energy and excitement.” But it was Joe Biden, not Bernie Sanders, who was expanding the electorate. It was Joe Biden who was turning non-voters into new voters. Everyone knew who Bernie Sanders was. The other guy was just getting more votes — and how could he explain that?A few days ago, when reporters asked in Phoenix, he couldn’t.He hadn’t had a chance to dig into the numbers yet, he said. “I honestly have not,” Sanders told his press corps, standing at a podium in the conference room of a private terminal at the airport.“I mean, I like doing those things, but I've been kind of frantically running around,” he said.But Biden was bringing in new suburban voters, a reporter noted. “Are you running out of time to—”Sanders cut in. “Well, we’re doing the best that we can.”“All I can say is we’re working as hard as we can,” he repeated.Maybe there was nothing else to say. The 78-year-old Vermont senator, who is a stubborn and irascible candidate, a well of resentment for the “clique” in the Democratic Party and of empathy for the working class and poor, set out to do one thing, give one speech, and lead one kind of movement. He was as single-minded in his mission as in the way he wanted to pursue it. He resisted change, most often at the urging of his own aides, including over the last few weeks as some begged him to be more aggressive in his attacks against Biden. From the start of his second presidential bid almost 13 months ago, his team liked to tell reporters that, unlike his race four years ago, this campaign was his campaign. And maybe it just wasn’t working well enough.Before Michael Bloomberg’s collapse at a debate in Nevada, before Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg dropped out to lift up Biden, Sanders had a strong chance to come out of last week with a lead in the delegate race that, in a crowded field, candidates could chase but never catch. But after Tuesday, when voters across six states cast their ballots, Biden was leading by well over 100 delegates, with favorable states such as Florida and Ohio slated for next week.At a hotel in downtown Burlington — where senior aides prepared to leave for New York ahead of a previously scheduled appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon — Sanders did not at any point say the words “I am staying in the race,” but said he looked forward to attending the upcoming Democratic debate on Sunday. His wife, Jane Sanders, and members of their senior campaign team looked on from the side of the room, all of them in matching stolid expressions.He knew he was losing the delegate race, he said. And knew he was losing the “electability debate.” His position, delivered in 10 minutes of prepared remarks, was not one of a candidate who expects to win — and Sanders, often mistaken by his critics as a movement politician with no interest in governing or institutionalizing change, wanted more than anything to win.Greg Guma, a Vermont progressive who has followed Sanders for decades, had no trouble in an interview last year naming the biggest difference between this campaign and his first four years ago.“He wants to win,” Guma said. “He wants to win as badly as a person can want to win.”Interviews with nearly two dozen aides, allies, and progressive operatives over the last week reveal a campaign struggling to reconcile the reality of the delegate math with the emotions of an entire progressive movement that now rests on the shoulders of a man who has pursued his aims with a single-minded focus for more than 50 years, who built a vast and obsessive following from almost nothing in 2016, who doesn’t easily back down — even when he knows he’s lost.“He was never able to expand his coalition,” said Mark Longabaugh, a top adviser who split with the campaign early last year over strategic disagreements with the candidate. “He just didn’t succeed at it.”      Now, Sanders has a legacy to consider. But over the last week, as he sought to reframe the race into an argument of ideas with Biden, the Vermont senator fell back into the familiar rhythms of his first presidential bid, brooding over moderates racing to “anoint” their preferred candidate and complaining about a corporate media he believes isn’t even trying to understand his cause.“'How do we stop Bernie Sanders!'” he said last week of recent “Stop Sanders” coverage, feigning panic and alarm in his mock impression of the TV networks. “That’s the frame. Not 'My god, you have a candidate who’s trying to bring working people [into] the political process.’”All week, on his plane, in hold rooms backstage, Sanders would approach aides in his gruff, matter-of-fact tone to tell them, sometimes apropos of nothing at all: We’re in a fight.Even as anxiety grew in Sanders’ Washington headquarters, the tight circle that travels around him mirrored the straightforward and laserlike focus of the candidate. Sanders is tough on his staff and prone to angry outbursts, but in pursuit of his “political revolution,” he is almost even-keeled — a temperament matched by his quiet campaign manager, Faiz Shakir. “He’s like Faiz,” communications director Mike Casca once told reporters. “He’s always at a 5 out of 10.”But for many outside the senator’s small retinue of staff, the past week unfolded as if in slow motion, a muddle of frustration and sadness as they came to terms with what was happening.On the road, Sanders and the senior aides around him pressed as if little around them had changed.“The divide isn’t between the traveling staff and headquarters,” one progressive operative close to the operation said this week. “The divide is between reality and the candidate's head.”Last weekend, a few days after Elizabeth Warren dropped out, Shakir and one of his deputy campaign managers, Ari Rabin-Havt, started contacting her top staffers and supporters to see what could be done to bring together the two camps before the primaries on Tuesday.Sanders spoke to Warren a “handful” of times throughout the week, a campaign aide confirmed, but she has declined to offer her endorsement.Several figures in Warren’s circle balked at the outreach effort — Sanders and his aides, they said, had months to lay the groundwork for that kind of partnership, but only did so this week from a position of desperation. About a month ago, when it was clear that Warren had little chance to win, one person inside the campaign said they put out feelers to Sanders’ operation in an attempt to create new lines of communication. At the time, senior Sanders officials showed little interest, the person said, in reciprocating.Others questioned whether Sanders could have prevented such a swift consolidation of the field had he reached out to candidates like Buttigieg and Klobuchar in a more concerted way.“That's the Sanders model — they were gonna do it themselves,” said Adam Jentleson, a Democratic strategist who supported Warren. “His challenge from day one was to reach out to people who weren't with him in 2016 and build a bridge to the rest of the party.”“I would feel differently about it if the other half of the equation was present for them: a wave of new voters and unprecedented youth turnout,” Jentleson added. “But it’s not there.”Meanwhile, a small group of senior aides had been pushing Sanders for months to go harder on Biden.The problem: Sanders actually liked him. Personally, they got along better than he ever did with Hillary Clinton, aides have said. (The former vice president falls into an exclusive category for the Vermont senator: the people who were nice to Sanders before he mattered, as two aides put it recently.) Back in January, it was the candidate’s decision to personally apologize to Biden after one of his surrogates, Zephyr Teachout, wrote an op-ed about Biden’s “corruption problem.”      David Sirota, the hard-charging senior adviser who has frequently made attacks on Biden go viral on Twitter, became so enraged by his unwillingness to budge on the matter that he laid out his concerns in a starkly worded email to the candidate and senior aides after Super Tuesday.The message, two people familiar with the email said: We do this or we lose.At campaign events over the next few days in Arizona and Michigan, Sanders turned his stump speech into a long list of policy disagreements with Biden, on everything from trade and social security to LGBTQ rights and abortion, threading in obvious nuggets of opposition research, citing decades-old Senate votes and a 1974 quote from Biden about Roe v. Wade.In his remarks to reporters in Burlington on Wednesday, Sanders said he would like Sunday’s debate with his “friend” Biden to be about questions concerning the future — asking a series of questions about what kind of change the former vice president would bring to working people.“Joe, what are you gonna do?” he said over and over, backdropped by four US flags.Off the side of the room, Jane nodded along.      In private conversations over the last week, Sanders staffers were already starting to talk about their mission beyond “winning.” Several pointed to a rally last Sunday in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where Rev. Jesse Jackson came off the sidelines of the race to endorse Sanders — a personal victory the candidate described privately as the most meaningful moment of the campaign.Nina Turner, the campaign’s cochair, described in a phone interview the feeling inside the Sanders operation on Wednesday morning with a single word: “heavy.”“People are talking about this campaign as if we didn’t know what we were bumping up against,” she said. “We’re bumping up against an entire world — a system, if you will — that doesn’t want to bend.”In a sense, neither does the candidate.Over the last 13 months, Sanders has held a firm, at times unyielding grip on his own strategy.      That’s led to a presidential campaign that’s spoken to working-class voters in ways never seen before, turning his massive digital following into a platform for individual stories of struggle through an unexpectedly emotional series of town halls this summer and fall on subjects such as medical debt. Sanders has described the effort as a kind of support network for people left out of mainstream politics — an effort to help millions of people, in his words, “feel less alone.”It’s also meant that Sanders, a candidate rarely willing to budge, served as his own press secretary, digital director, pollster, advertiser, and campaign manager. The true inner circle around the senator is already exceptionally tight — limited to his wife and five or so staffers — and even smaller still is the group of aides on his 2020 payroll who are willing to tell him “no.”Longabaugh, the former adviser who was a central member of the 2016 campaign, recalled urging Sanders to spend the three years in between his presidential bids building relationships inside Democratic Party structures like the big unions or the Congressional Black Caucus.More often than not, he said, the senator resisted.“He was never gonna be one of those Walter Mondale– or Hillary Clinton–esque figures who would be able to wire up the entire party. There was a potential for him to make some inroads,” he said. ""He got 42% of the vote last time. I always told him, ‘If you make small inroads, you're not too far from 50.’ But that stuff just never came naturally to Bernie Sanders.""More recently, in late February, some Sanders supporters watched in amazement as he claimed victory in the first three states, including by a massive margin in Nevada, and then proceeded to do very little to reach out to voters not already in his movement — instead continuing to rail against the establishment forces that soon after lined up against him.“It’s a fair question,” Larry Cohen, a longtime Sanders supporter who sits on the board of his political nonprofit, Our Revolution, said of whether the candidate missed a crucial opportunity. “He’s an amazing human being. And all amazing human beings are not perfect.”On the day the race began to change in Utah, reporters asked the deputy manager, Rabin-Havt, about what if anything Sanders would be willing to change. Would he appeal to moderates?“My question back at that is: Tell me what that would look like,” Rabin-Havt said.A more “inclusive message,” one reporter offered.The back-and-forth continued in quick succession.Rabin-Havt said Sanders’ message was inclusive.So he wouldn’t consider doing anything different?“What do you mean ‘consider doing anything different’?” he asked.Would he change anything?“Bernie Sanders has had the same values for his entire career,” Rabin-Havt finally said, “and he isn't changing that.”Across the fairgrounds, past a crowd of 5,800 people, the candidate was onstage, delivering his usual speech, as if by heart. ●Henry Gomez contributed reporting to this story.","The Week Bernie Sanders Realized He Was Losing

"     “You have a choice between two kinds of liberalism,” a Wisconsin official explained to the New York Times. “You have this pragmatic, I-can-win-the-election liberal, and you have this articulate, I-can-tell-you-what-you-believe-in-your-heart liberal.”Pictured next to the quote: Jesse Jackson, tall and crisp, sitting down to breakfast with a family in their Wisconsin home. He’d recently won the 1988 Michigan caucus after winning across the South. A few days later, Michael Dukakis — the pragmatic, I-can-win liberal — crushed him.A few weeks after the Wisconsin primary, in Burlington, the city’s mayor, Bernie Sanders, caucused for Jackson despite not being a member of the party.“I resent intruders who would undermine and destroy the Democratic Party,” announced one resident from the podium.A woman shouted in response from the back, “We want unity among ourselves, not with a group of outsiders.” Then she walked up to Sanders and slapped him across the face.By then, the Democratic electorate had mostly consolidated, delivering big loss after big loss to Jackson, even as he continued speaking to rolling crowds across the country. “Other candidates — vice presidents and governors — might go weeks or an entire campaign without crowds as vibrant as Jackson’s leftovers,” wrote David Maraniss in May that year. Jackson came close, so close, to the moment where all things start to fall in place, where winning begets winning, and the nomination takes hold.But the moment just collapsed.“As long as people could vote for him as sending a message to Democrats, saying [that] we support this kind of economic populist and moral voice, they were anxious to vote for him,” Robert Borosage told Jackson biographer Marshall Frady in the 1990s. “But as soon as he got close to actually winning the nomination, I think people just said, ‘Whoa. We’re never going to do this.'”“The fear factor took over,” the late Bert Lance, an ally of Jackson’s in the 1980s, told Frady. “There were people saying, ‘Oh my goodness, Jesse Jackson has a chance to gain the Democratic nomination, what’s this going to do to my seat in Congress, to my race for county commissioner, to the mayor’s race?’” (The Los Angeles Times the week of the Wisconsin primary: “What worries them is not that Jackson is unelectable. They are worried they may be unelectable running on a Jackson ticket.”)      Jackson was dealing with far different circumstances as the first black candidate to make a serious run at a presidential nomination, and his own set of problems (his 1984 bid was partially derailed by his reluctance to denounce Louis Farrakhan). And Sanders will never have the elegance or dynamism of Jackson at his peak.But as plenty of people have pointed out — including Jackson himself — Sanders’ two campaigns are interpretations of Jackson’s two campaigns, alike in radicalism, alike in establishment skepticism, and alike in the aspiration of a multiracial “rainbow coalition” that achieves “economic justice.”Jackson ran on big increases in taxes on the wealthy, big reductions in defense spending, and government-funded health care (“If government-supported health care is good enough for Congress and the Supreme Court and the White House, then it’s good enough for your house and my house”). He ran, too, against prevailing notions that the economy was in strong shape. “A kinder, gentler nation, yeah,” he said while campaigning for Dukakis during the 1988 general election, “kinder and gentler for the corporations and the merger maniacs and the mega conglomerates swallowing up the family farmer and taking factory jobs overseas. Urban America looks like it’s been bombed out, rural America abandoned like a plague’s hit. Family farms gone, jobs out, drugs in, profits up, wages down, workers abandoned.”Above all, the ethos of that 1988 campaign centered around a cross-racial, cross-gender emphasis on economics, the exact same thesis of Sanders’ 2020 campaign: “When they close down your factory or foreclose on your farm,” Jackson said then, “and comes the time when they pull the plug and the lights go out, we all — we all — look amazingly similar sitting there in the dark.”Sanders is ending up in about the same spot as Jackson in 1988: losing. On Tuesday, Joe Biden dominated the kinds of working-class states where Sanders performed well in 2016. And if you were going to try to engineer a comeback against a fixture of national politics, the worst possible one-two the day before: a pandemic combined with a market crash.It’s a sequence that automatically produces the desire for a gentle hum. “I wish he would just be quiet,” Biden said of Donald Trump on Monday. “I really mean it. That’s an awful thing to say about a president; I wish he’d be quiet. Just let the experts speak and acknowledge whatever they suggest to him is what we should be doing.”But the results in Michigan and elsewhere this week reflected the existing, underlying trends of the 2020 primary, the brick wall both Jackson and Sanders have run into: The coalition still isn’t big enough.Jackson won the vast majority of black voters during his campaigns; he led a big transformation in the electoral process, actually, through a series of voter registration drives in the 1980s, as well as in his two campaigns, with both voting and staffing patterns. (He also effectively lowered the delegate threshold from 20% to 15% and reduced the number of superdelegates.) And he did grow his coalition, performing significantly better in very white states like Minnesota. But he never won enough white voters in states like New York and Ohio to make the rainbow coalition a reality.In 2020, like Jackson between 1984 and 1988, Sanders has grown his coalition to a real degree: Latino voters powered his wins in Nevada, California, and Colorado. His command of voters under the age of 30 will likely have serious, lasting consequences electorally. But despite the advertising and the efforts to organize in states like the Carolinas, Sanders has not meaningfully improved on his support with black voters, particularly the middle-aged and older voters who now decide Democratic primaries. He remains someone without the long-standing relationships with black leaders, who welcomes but does not persuade, whose ask of the electorate about defeating Trump retains an air of risk.So how do you make the cross-generational, cross-racial economic coalition come alive? This is the essential question the ascendant, economic left faces in the 2020s.Jackson himself told the New York Times as much in January: Despite his belief that Sanders' and Elizabeth Warren’s ideas represented the future of the party, they hadn’t persuaded the kinds of middle-aged and older black voters they would need to win. “You must build a coalition and you do it through new relationships,” he said.Warren’s own (failed) bid to be the “unity” candidate gestured at that necessity. But even she complicated the idea by unleashing what Kerry Howley described as “enthralling brutality.” As she dismantled Michael Bloomberg’s presidential bid, her campaign started a “blood and teeth” refrain — a reference to her remark that her first priority would be empowered consumer protection and if she couldn’t get that, she’d leave blood and teeth on the floor. When the candidate dropped out last week, after months of enduring cheer, up went a true rage from within the Warren universe at other candidates and the press. They might be right to be angry (leave that aside) but it suggested dissonance between unity and the enthralling brutality — that if there were a coalition to be built for Warren, it could only be built in the image of insurgency.That dichotomy between aggression and welcome obviously consumes commentary about the Sanders movement, but at a much higher pitch. Take in the same week, his supporters calling up the Culinary Union leadership to tell them they’re “bitches” and “whores” for criticizing Medicare for All, and a Culinary Union member saying as she caucuses for Sanders: “I worry about other people that aren’t protected by unions. How do they get health care?” It’s the difference in whether Warren was sent from hell to destroy Sanders or a powerful figure whose endorsement would move many toward his bid when it matters most.Is it the hostility, though, or the lack of long-standing relationships? The late-in-the-game panic about someone with old-school, ’60s radical views of Cuba? The proclamations that the “nervous” establishment will be defeated?Clearly, though, there is at least one person thinking seriously about the long-term issue of coalitions. “There are folks telling Warren what to do now, when they weren’t in her camp,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post. “It’s not up to me to tell her what to do. What I do know is that if we want to win Medicare-for-all, we have to build overall.” During an Instagram Live on Tuesday night, as the returns came in, she admonished people who blamed older voters for the results. She told viewers, “We don't dismiss voters. We don't think [of] people as disposable. Your vote matters.”On Sunday, she introduced Sanders in Ann Arbor and referenced the “David and Goliath” speech given in the 1980s by Jackson, who’d endorsed Sanders earlier that day.“In order for us to win, we have to grow,” Ocasio-Cortez ultimately built up to. “We have to grow. We must be inclusive. We must bring more people into this movement. We must shed the unnecessary clothes of cynicism and exclusion and we must turn toward an embracing posture where all people are welcome into a people's movement.”","Bernie's Coalition Still Isn't Big Enough

"     CLEVELAND — Joe Biden, written off by many a month ago after a disastrous run in the New Hampshire primary, now has what top Democratic strategists are describing as an insurmountable lead in the race for the party’s presidential nomination.The former vice president’s victories Tuesday in Missouri, Mississippi, Idaho, and Michigan further weakened Sen. Bernie Sanders’ argument that he can build a winning coalition. And some who just two weeks ago were wrapping their heads around the prospects of fortifying Sanders in a fight against President Donald Trump are now pointing Sanders toward the exit.“The math is now clear,” Guy Cecil, the chair of Priorities USA — the Democratic organization that backed Barack Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s campaigns and had been neutral in the 2020 primary race — tweeted as states began going decisively in Biden’s favor. “Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for President and @prioritiesUSA is going to do everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November. I hope others will join us in the fight.”Cecil’s tweet was the first in a rapid succession of Democratic establishment flares meant to put public pressure on Sanders. Bradley Beychok of the research group American Bridge and Justin Barasky of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee issued similar calls.      And Biden, who since his big win in South Carolina last month quickly consolidated support from old rivals, got a supportive nod from another former candidate, Andrew Yang, live on CNN.""At this point, you can see very clearly that Biden is building a delegate lead that's only going to grow in the days ahead,” Yang, a contributor to the cable network, said on air soon after Biden was called as the winner of Michigan. “So we need to come together as a party starting tonight.""Biden did not go so far. In remarks from Philadelphia, where he flew after canceling a rally in Ohio due to coronavirus concerns, he said it was “premature” to celebrate, but he made a pointed pitch to Sanders and his allies, speaking of them almost as if their movement had come to an end.“I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,” Biden said. “We share a common goal, and together we’ll defeat Donald Trump. We’ll defeat him together.”Biden allowed only that his own campaign “is taking off, and I believe we’re going to do well from this point on.”“Take nothing for granted,” Biden added. “Want to earn every single vote in every single state.”      Contests in Idaho, North Dakota, and Washington state had not yet been called when Biden spoke.Sanders did not speak to reporters Tuesday night, after flying back to Burlington, Vermont. Like Biden, he decided to scrap an election night rally in Cleveland over coronavirus fears.Josh Schwerin, Priorities USA senior strategist and communications director, said late Tuesday that the group planned to invest significantly to boost Biden against President Donald Trump this fall.""We are projected to spend $150 million, including $70 million in battleground state ads, before the convention to take on Donald Trump,” Schwerin said. “If Trump and his allies attack Biden, we are prepared to defend him.""Just two weeks ago Cecil told reporters at a predebate briefing in Charleston, South Carolina, that Priorities was prepared for a scenario in which Sanders — who at that point had won the popular vote in the Iowa caucuses and finished first in New Hampshire in Nevada — was the party’s nominee.“I personally feel like if Bernie is the nominee, we're going to do everything in our power to help Bernie Sanders the next president,” Cecil said then. “And I would say the same thing about Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren.”American Bridge, meanwhile, announced it would go up Wednesday in Pennsylvania — a battleground Trump won in 2016 — with a $2.2 million advertising buy. The ads are anti-Trump and don’t mention Biden, though the group was clear Tuesday night that it’s rallying around Biden.Biden reinforced a frontrunner’s posture and message in recent days. He kept a lighter public schedule and delivered shorter speeches. He had been more confident, and less susceptible to letting his weaknesses — self-righteous indignation, verbal blunders, and meandering speeches — distract from his case to be president. And he had been workshopping the more conciliatory tone he struck Tuesday.The 77-year-old who favors old-fashioned slang (Malarkey!) and who once hated to see his age as anything other than a hard sell for experience now offers a softer pitch. At a rally Monday night in Detroit, he called himself a “bridge” to a new generation, nodding at three younger endorsers (and potential running mates) on stage with him: Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. “They are the future of this country.”And where Biden once stumbled in confrontations with hecklers — he called one a “damn liar” while also challenging him to a push-up contest; channeling John Wayne he called another a “lying dog-faced pony soldier” — he now is more welcoming. He asks his aides and law enforcement not to remove his disruptors. When police disregarded his wishes in Detroit and tossed at least a dozen protesters railing against his stances on trade and the environment, Biden off the cuff seemed to repurpose a portion of his speech specifically for his skeptics.“Every person who’s been knocked down, counted out, left behind: This is your campaign,” Biden said, using phrasing he would repeat Tuesday night in Philadelphia as he worked toward his salute to Sanders supporters. “We need you. We want you. … We need you guys. We have to unite this country.”Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, one of Biden’s Michigan backers, even reminded the Detroit audience Monday that he supported Sanders in 2016, drawing some scattered boos.“Now look, I’m sad that somebody’s booing about that,” Gilchrist responded. “But the question is, what’s different? The difference is nobody with the record, results, and relationships of Joe Biden was on the ballot [in 2016]. And what we need in 2020 is somebody who is going to have a vision that includes all of us. We are a broad, diverse, beautiful people, where everybody’s opinion matters.”The new approach still has echoes of the old.“You’re full of shit,” Biden told a laborer who questioned his position on gun rights Tuesday during a visit to a construction site in Detroit.But even in that exchange Biden’s team saw an opportunity to reclaim the high road. The retort rattled around Twitter and compelled Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, to amplify a tweet from a Republican National Committee operative. Shakir later deleted his retweet and chose instead to piggyback off a CBS reporter’s video of the incident, but Biden aides moved quickly to frame Sanders’ aides as doing Trump’s bidding.“In case anyone is wondering,” Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz tweeted in response, “I won’t be retweeting any GOP or Trump allies to go after another candidate in the democratic primary.”Where the campaign goes next is, literally, a question. Coronavirus concerns in Ohio, which holds its primary March 17, prompted Biden and Sanders to cancel rallies there Tuesday night. Biden already has postponed a Thursday event scheduled in Florida — another March 17 state — and instead will address the outbreak from his hometown, Wilmington, Delaware. Sunday’s debate in Phoenix will go on, but without a live audience or reporters on site.Shaun King, a Sanders campaign ally, tweeted as results came in Tuesday night that the primary isn’t over. Briahna Joy Gray, Sanders’ national press secretary, retweeted that message with her own.      Among Biden allies, Rep. Jim Clyburn, who was pivotal in his landslide win in South Carolina, was perhaps the most direct in arguing it was over for Sanders, especially if he did not win a state Tuesday.“I think when the night is over,” Clyburn said in an interview on NPR before polls had even closed, “Joe Biden will be the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, and quite frankly, if the night ends the way it has begun, I think it is time for us to shut this primary down. It is time for us to cancel the rest of these debates — because you don’t do anything but get yourself in trouble if you continue in this contest when it’s obvious that the numbers will not shake out for you.”Molly Hensley-Clancy contributed reporting to this story.

"     For a man who campaigned on inflammatory rhetoric and made anti-immigrant policies a cornerstone of his agenda, it should perhaps come as little surprise that appears to be the next turn in Donald Trump’s defense against the coronavirus.With COVID-19 spreading across the US, Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning that “we need the wall more than ever!” falling back on his tried and tested trope of blaming immigrants for the country’s ills.Trump’s allies in Washington and on Fox News have ramped up their rhetoric against China, as they are faced with a core dilemma: how to prepare the population for severe disruptions while ensuring no blowback on the man in the White House? At least part of the answer seems to be: xenophobia.Fox News has shifted to nearly nonstop coverage of the coronavirus. During the day, viewers get largely straightforward information about the virus’s spread, the administration’s response, the danger of cruise ships, and general health advice. When the channel’s opinion powerhouses come out at night, it’s a different story.On Monday night, two of the network’s three main opinion hosts — Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham — leaned heavily into the fact that the virus originated in China and that any response should further isolate the US from the country. (The third, Sean Hannity, focused on combating criticism of Trump’s handling of the crisis.)“People you know will get sick. Some may die. This is real,” Carlson said at the top of his hour, striking a more alarmist tone than anyone else on the network. He called out those on the right, including those in government for being overly blasé. “People you trust — people you probably voted for — have spent weeks minimizing what is a very serious problem,” he said. But first, he had words for the left, speaking next to a graphic that blared: “the Chinese coronavirus.”“On the left, you’ve heard them tell you that the real worry is you might use the wrong word to describe what’s happening to the country,” he said. “It’s racist, they’re telling you, to blame the most racist country in the world for the spread of this virus. Right.”“It's extraordinarily predictable,” said Paul Lombardo, a professor at Georgia State University and expert on eugenics. “It's consistent with the usual historical trend — you decide who you want to stay away from, people you don't want in the country, and then you exploit them.” He pointed to the anti-immigrant rhetoric coming from Trump and his allies since before they entered the White House, and the language of infestation often deployed against those looking to enter America. “The bigotry against actual or would-be immigrants kind of goes hand in hand with the scapegoating of those same groups at a time of medical crisis.”Attaching a Chinese descriptor to the virus — formally known as COVID-19 — has become a means of signaling xenophobic intent. When the virus first emerged late last year, many called it the “Wuhan flu” or something similar, but shifted after the World Health Organization formally gave the virus a name. “On the one hand I think that there could be a relatively innocent reason,” Lombardo said. “But that the messaging is coming out from people who know about messaging is not by chance.”Rep. Kevin McCarthy has taken to calling the virus “the Chinese coronavirus,” first in a tweet Monday evening and then repeatedly that night in an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox. Rep. Grace Meng, vice-chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said in a statement Tuesday that his use of the term was “embarrassing, disrespectful, offensive, and downright disgusting.” She continued: “Wrongly inserting ‘Chinese’ into the name of this disease only reinforces the disparaging and negative stereotypes of Asian Americans.” Asian Americans and Asians around the world have already been targeted by racist slurs and attacks in the wake of the virus.“The naming of a novel disease is so critically important because of the power that a name — especially tied to a particular geography, region or place — can have in producing stigma,” said Alexandre White, an assistant professor of sociology and the history of medicine at Johns Hopkins. In the past, diseases were often named after where they originated — from Lyme to West Nile — but White said those diseases were “quite old” and standards had evolved since then.The way previous outbreaks of disease were discussed worked to both stigmatize entire populations and to mask forms of transmission, White said, pointing in particular to the HIV epidemic.Both Carlson and Ingraham called on the administration to further disengage the US from the global, and particularly the Chinese, economy. “One of the first things we can do to prepare ourselves is break our dependence on China for essential medical supplies,” Carlson said. Ingraham said Trump should take “steps that harken back to his original America First agenda.”“We can’t keep flooding America with migrant families on the bogus asylum pretense. We gotta be stronger on these borders,” she said, while discussing the coronavirus. “While some people are being flown back to Mexico pending their cases, thousands are still getting in and impossible to screen completely — for health,” she said. “Now is not the time to take in any extra burdens on our schools or the health care system.”“The question I would have for Fox News especially is: What is the benefit of this blame?” White asked. “And the answer is, foundationally, that it allows you to justify very aggressive responses against the Chinese economically, which are in no way in the interest of public health and solely in the interest of racist xenophobic anxieties or economic protectionism.”“The US has a particular history of epidemic control and particularly Sinophobia,” he said, pointing to a 1900 outbreak of the bubonic plague in Hawaii following an epidemic in Asia. Local authorities dealt with the outbreak through a strict quarantine of Honolulu’s Chinatown — avoiding buildings occupied by white people. Later, they burned much of that Chinatown down.

"     FLINT, Michigan — As the political world turns its attention to Michigan’s primary on Tuesday night, the people of Flint are very much still in crisis.Flint residents have continued to die of Legionnaires disease. The city is dealing with ongoing fallout: Children whose neurological development may have been irreversibly damaged; pregnant women who had miscarriages after drinking the contaminated water — the number of miscarriages spiked by 58% after the water was switched; people whose trust in their elected officials and reliance on the infrastructure that runs through their city has been turned upside down; and corroded pipes in people’s homes that have yet to be replaced.On Monday, Joe Biden passed through — flanked by Sen. Cory Booker, Flint Mayor Sheldon Neeley, and Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist. The attention from national politicians should conceivably be a good thing but much to the frustration of local community leaders, Biden barely mentioned the ongoing disaster during his stop there, instead repeating his stump speech and touting endorsements.Those who met with the campaign before Biden’s visit were disappointed and angry that the former vice president mentioned the water crisis just once, 20 minutes into the private event he held in town, as part of a line taking aim at Sen. Bernie Sanders, and focused on showcasing endorsements from other politicians.""We're not looking for a revolution. What we want to do is to be able to trust the water that comes out of the pipes,"" Biden told the gathering, still fresh off the victories of the past week, delivered largely by black voters.Dr. Kent Key, a Flint local and public health expert at Michigan State University’s College of Human Medicine, said he’d sat down with the campaign on Sunday after they reached out for advice on what steps would mean something for people in Flint. He said he was disheartened to see Biden “not really talking about the water crisis. And to not acknowledge that it's not over.”“When people who have power to elevate your story come and totally disregard your story, you’re retraumatized,” he said on Monday, after he walked out of the event early because he didn’t think Biden was addressing the residents’ ongoing crisis in a way that was respectful or helpful.“It’s almost like being on the stranded island and you hear the helicopter and you get excited, oh good, somebody is going to be able to elevate me, lift me up,” he said. “And then when they don’t, you sink down into this despair, this mental anguish, this distress.”“The Flint water crisis is not over. No one took accountability for it. It was not a natural disaster. It was a man-made disaster, which makes it different from any other water crisis,” Key said.He, and another local community advocate, Marseille Allen, told the campaign it was important to hold a public event and to focus on the community and not elected leaders — who residents no longer trust — as the crisis drags on in various forms, six years after it began because of a cost-cutting government measure to switch the city’s water source.The Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment.At the beginning of last summer, as the first presidential candidate of the 2020 election cycle passed through Flint, Key was already concerned about politicians using his town as a token of their commitment to black voters, without understanding that people in Flint are still in crisis. Nine months later, as Michigan residents prepared to cast ballots in the primary and with the Democratic field winnowed down to two, that is exactly what he saw happening.“We are experiencing what I call water fatigue,” Key told BuzzFeed News in June. “They’re emotionally and psychologically tired. They’re tired physiologically with their health because of the effects of it. People are fatigued, and the last thing we need to do is waste any of our energy on something that’s not going to be productive.”Locals say this could have been an opportunity for the candidate to show black communities — who Biden says were solely responsible for his campaign’s comeback in recent weeks — that he understands and takes seriously the systemic failures and lasting trauma in Flint.Community advocates said that both Biden and Sanders’ approaches to Flint have been disappointing — and that events were hastily arranged in the past week ahead of the primary. Sanders did visit the town in 2018 and held an event on Saturday that included a local activist and was open to the public.But his event also drew criticism after his campaign promised a speech about racial inequality that turned mostly into a regular stump speech. Journalists at the event said the room was filled with mostly white attendees, in a town that’s 53% black, and where the black community was disproportionately hit by the contaminated water.Nayyirah Shariff, another resident and activist, was asked by Sanders’ campaign to speak at his event on Saturday. She said she thought the audience wasn’t particularly less diverse than other public events she’s attended in several years working in Flint, and appreciated the open format and the platform for her to talk about what’s happening there, but said the Sanders campaign’s last-minute approach was also disappointing.“These things happen at the last minute. Like we’re just expected to drop everything and be grateful, like we’re not fighting for our lives here in Flint,” Shariff told BuzzFeed News.Marseille Allen, a community activist who supported Sen. Kamala Harris’s campaign, also met with the Biden campaign when they reached out for advice. She said she was hearing from local activists and seeing their posts on social media railing against the way Biden spoke about Flint.“Before it was even over, I got a bunch of text messages and calls from some activists,” she said. “They’re livid … you can't put up a bunch of politicians that nobody likes and think that we’re going to vote for him.”Allen organized meetings for Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, on his visit to Flint last year — she said that was an example of the right way to visit Flint, without cameras and based around meetings with community members.She said she's not endorsing any candidates, instead focusing on local issues, but would get more involved if Harris asks her to. She, too, told them to hold a public event and to focus on the experiences of people in Flint, rather than generalized talking points from public officials.“They should have listened to me, because they’re getting slammed on social media,” she said.As Biden praised the work of the state and city governments in Flint, local news outlets broke the story that the city government is, for the second time, in violation of the federal Safe Water Drinking Act after failing to collect enough samples from residents’ homes to test water quality.","Joe Biden Went To Flint And Barely Mentioned The Water Crisis.

"     ROMULUS, Michigan — Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden canceled their election night rallies in Cleveland at the last minute Tuesday over concerns about the coronavirus outbreak.The Sanders campaign said that all future campaign events would “be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.” Biden’s campaign said they would “continue to consult with public health officials” on future events.      “Out of concern for public health and safety, we are canceling tonight’s rally in Cleveland,” Sanders communications director Mike Casca told reporters late on Tuesday afternoon, hours before he was scheduled to board a plane for a 7:30 p.m. rally in Cleveland.“We are heeding the public warnings from Ohio state officials, who have communicated concern about holding large, indoor events during the coronavirus outbreak. Sen. Sanders would like to express his regret to the thousands of Ohioans who had planned to attend the event tonight,” Casca said in a statement.Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said earlier Tuesday that he would recommend Ohioans avoid events with large crowds, after announcing three confirmed cases of COVID-19. DeWine asked that, among other things, indoor athletic events across the state proceed without spectators. The recommendation to stay away from big public events would include political rallies, DeWine spokesperson Dan Tierney said. But DeWine stopped short of calling on Sanders or Biden to cancel their planned events in Cleveland, citing First Amendment issues.Casca told reporters at an airport here outside Detroit that the candidate made the decision to cancel his event after seeing DeWine’s public guidance about spectators at athletic events.""We’re gonna continue to listen to health officials in the areas where we’re supposed to go,” he said of campaign events going forward. Sanders plans to take off for his home of Burlington, Vermont, on Tuesday evening, Casca said. Biden's campaign told reporters he would fly to speak to reporters in Philadelphia later in the night.The Sanders campaign said they had heard no new guidance on whether Sunday’s CNN debate between Sanders and Biden in Arizona would be affected by the growing outbreak.Over the last two weeks, as the virus has spread across the US, Sanders has held rallies before tens of thousands of people, including in states with active cases of COVID-19, such as California.Six states will vote in Tuesday’s primary contests, marking a crucial point for the Sanders campaign’s quest to catch up to Biden in what he’s been casting as a two-person race with a stark policy contrast.At an event in Detroit on Monday, Biden aides greeted attendees with squirts of hand sanitizer. That same afternoon, Sanders held a policy discussion on the issue of COVID-19.“All future Bernie 2020 events will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis,” Casca said in his statement.      Sanders, a 78-year-old with an underlying health condition, is considered to be at risk according to guidelines issued by the Center for Disease Control. Biden is also at risk, at 77 years old.Sanders has been reticent to discuss what precautions he is taking, if any, to protect his health, at times addressing the subject glibly. ""I am running for president of the United States and that requires a whole lot of work,"" Sanders said at his coronavirus event on Monday.Later that night, he told CNN’s Chris Cuomo, “I have used more hand sanitizer in the last two weeks than I’ve used in my entire life.”On Tuesday, during a visit to a polling site in Dearborn Heights, Michigan, where supporters were gathered to greet him, Sanders did not shake many hands, but he did give a few hugs, grip one woman’s shoulder, and exchange fist bumps.“We take this issue, unlike the president,” he said of Donald Trump, “very, very seriously.”Biden’s events in recent days have been noticeably shorter and he has spent less time shaking hands afterward on the rope lines. He told NBC News this week that his campaign would “follow the recommendations of the experts"" and suggested he would cancel rallies if need be.

"     The 2020 Democratic primary radically changed last Tuesday, when Joe Biden surpassed even the highest expectations to build a delegate lead over Bernie Sanders. This Tuesday, the race could effectively lock into place.Six states with a total of 352 delegates vote in the Democratic presidential primary today, which isn’t really a second Super Tuesday, even though many are calling it that (California, which voted last week, had 415 delegates on its own). But with Biden already up just about 80 delegates over Sanders going into Tuesday, a strong performance in these states could give him a lead that will be tough for Sanders to overcome. And alternatively, a surprising result for Sanders could make the primary more competitive than some assume it is right now, leading into states later this month that on paper look strong for Biden.So here’s what to look for tonight.      Michigan (polls close between 8 and 9 p.m. ET)This is the big state tonight, with 125 delegates. Sanders won the primary here in 2016 over Hillary Clinton in a surprise, helping to revive his campaign even as the two basically split delegates evenly (67 for Sanders and 63 for Clinton).Sanders and Biden have both spent much of the last week focused on winning the state. A win for Biden, especially one by a decisive margin, could be brutal for Sanders. A win for Sanders could prove that his promised coalition of young people — including young people of color — and the white working class still has life. Recent polls have shown a double-digit lead for Biden, but they showed one for Clinton ahead of the 2016 primary, too.WashingtonThis is tonight’s second-biggest state, with 89 delegates. Sanders won the state in a blowout in 2016 and is hoping to win by a decent margin again this year.But Sanders has a disadvantage this year relative to 2016: The state will no longer hold caucuses, where he performed well with hyper-engaged, organized supporters. Washington this year is conducting its primary entirely by mail. About 22% of ballots were returned before Super Tuesday, which could limit a Biden bounce. Voting by mail has also reduced fears about the state’s coronavirus outbreak limiting turnout. But the result here isn’t necessarily certain: There’s been limited recent polling, and neither candidate has campaigned here in the last week.Missouri (Polls close at 8 p.m. ET)Missouri has 68 delegates up for stake and was home to a very close Sanders loss in 2016.Sanders and Biden have each campaigned here in the last several days, with Sanders holding a rally in St. Louis on Monday. Polling this month gave a slight edge to Biden, but data has been limited.Mississippi (Polls close at 8 p.m. ET)Mississippi has 36 delegates up tonight. Sanders was blown out here in 2016, and likely is looking at another big loss tonight. Why? Then as now: black voters.Black voters, particularly older voters in the South, have voted decisively in Biden’s favor in the last two weeks, since the South Carolina primary. In 2016, 71% of the primary electorate was black, and 89% of the primary’s black voters sided with Clinton. Sanders has worked for years to build greater support among black voters, but may not see a much better result tonight: He was originally scheduled to campaign here in the last week, but dropped those plans.Idaho (polls close between 10 and 11 p.m. ET)Idaho has 20 delegates. Sanders won in a landslide in 2016.But again, a hiccup this year: The state has moved from caucuses to a primary. There’s not really polling of the state, so we’ll all learn together tonight if Sanders is successful in winning Idaho back even under a primary.North Dakota (Polls close by 10 p.m. ET)North Dakota has 14 delegates. Sanders did well here in 2016, winning the state by a big margin.And it’ll be awarding delegates via caucuses! Though the process is a little more like a primary this year than it was in 2016. There have not been polls of the state, so let’s see.","Here’s What To Watch For Tuesday As Six States Vote In The Democratic Primary

"     WASHINGTON — Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, who was previously one of Michael Bloomberg’s prominent supporters on Capitol Hill, will now endorse and back Joe Biden.The move is not entirely shocking, given that Bloomberg endorsed Biden as he dropped out of the presidential race. Meeks joins dozens of Congress members backing Biden. Biden has strong support on Capitol Hill — especially among members of the Congressional Black Caucus.""We are grateful for the support of Congressman Meeks as we continue to build a broad and diverse coalition that will defeat Donald Trump this fall,"" said Biden adviser Andrew Bates.Meeks told BuzzFeed News last week that Biden had not reached out to him, as did Rep. Bobby Rush, both CBC members. The campaign, however, told BuzzFeed News the campaign reached out to both members and “asked for their support previously during this election.”Sources with knowledge of the situation said that the group of Congressional Black Caucus members who had previously backed Bloomberg would soon be announcing their support for Biden. (Two sources had originally believed it would happen on Monday but was unsure of the cause of the delay).Meeks, while poised to support the more moderate candidate, told BuzzFeed News last week he would stand behind Sanders should he become the nominee. But he also denounced Sanders’ allies, saying he remains concerned about Justice Democrats, a group closely aligned with Sanders’ surrogate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the fact they were launching primary challenges to several members of the CBC.The endorsement speaks to the considerable shift in Biden’s campaign following the South Carolina primary, who up until then trailed Bernie Sanders in early primaries and caucuses. Two presidential candidates exiting the race backed Biden, as did a host of congressional members who were either supporting another candidate or had been silent, including Reps. Val Demings and Bennie Thompson. And Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, two prominent black senators who had both run for president, came out in support of Biden and planned to rally with him in Michigan on Monday night.Rep. Terri Sewell who helped deliver Alabama for Biden told BuzzFeed News “We brought it for Biden,” last week.Those gestures haven’t gone unrecognized.

"     Nobody knows what to do. Is it ethical to go for a walk? Maybe? To the movies? Probably not. How about to dinner with a friend? Likely not a great idea, but also small restaurants, and the people who work there, are suffering. What is the right thing to do?Every decision in the time of COVID-19 has taken on extraordinary weight. It’s up to us to stop this thing, we feel in our guts. We know the tests just aren’t being done, the health system not up to the task. We look to a country on total lockdown and another digging mass graves and ask: Is this our future?This is the nightmare situation some feared when Donald Trump first came to power. His favorability ratings have been about what you’d think — high among Republicans, low among Democrats. But look at how many people view him as “honest and trustworthy” and you get a better picture. One hundred days after he took office, he was viewed as such by only 36% of the public, “the lowest number ever recorded this early in a presidency,” as my colleague Dan Vergano reported at the time. That number stayed about flat at 34% by summer of last year.How do you live when you don’t trust your leader to do the right thing?We’ve seen mistakes before and disagreed with policies enacted by previous leaders. Gay men probably know better than anyone what it’s like to live with a government that refuses to adequately confront a deadly epidemic, one that can wipe out millions of people.To live amid a crisis without the basic assumption that your government is competent enough to handle it is a recipe for total anxiety. Night after night, the president’s favorite acolytes on Fox News trot out a series of platitudes, as well as bleary-eyed senators and experts, to try to calm people down. Sean Hannity, an informal Trump adviser, repeatedly insists that only elderly and immunocompromised people will die — as if those people aren’t sitting there, at home, watching him. “We’re not all gonna die,” Laura Ingraham said Wednesday night, as if this was meant to make people feel better. Later, a guest on her show assured those watching that only a fraction of the infected would face “mortality issues,” which is a new way of talking about death.Millions of people around the world live this way, and have for decades, and it is unsettling to see this blanket of horror descend upon the United States.I was living in Moscow in 2002 when a group of Chechen militants took a crowded theater hostage in the middle of a musical. The siege went on for days, and in the end 129 people were dead (though some continue to insist the number was even higher). Nearly all of them were killed not by the hostage-takers, but by a gas the Russian government pumped in through the vents to incapacitate the militants so they could storm the theater. The government told no one — not police, not doctors — what the gas was, so there was no way to treat people when they were pulled out. Many of those who died had been loaded onto buses, seated with their heads slung back, and choked on their own vomit.I was two years out of college then, a freelancer trying to make her way in the world, and have an image of myself absolutely frozen at the thought of what had just happened. I’m standing wide-eyed in my living room, my hands covering my mouth, trying to understand what it means for a government to sacrifice dozens upon dozens of its people in a bid to look tough and decisive. It could have been so different — why didn’t they do the bare minimum to ensure those people lived? Because they were fodder, a sacrifice for a bigger priority.The Trump administration squandered weeks when they could have been preparing for COVID-19 by projecting denialism instead. There they were, blaming China, hoping for warm weather, patting themselves on the back when they could have been getting tests out and laying the groundwork for a health system under strain. It seems like Trump only woke up to the crisis once the stock market began to crash, and spent the days after that focusing on the economic impact instead of informing an increasingly worried population.Now he is calling for unity and trust. Trump’s address to the nation — which contained numerous inaccuracies — was designed to project calm and resolve, according to aides. Some of his supporters see the subsequent outcry as further evidence of a grand plan to bring the president down. What they don’t see is that everyone is screaming into the void, begging for guidance, but how are they supposed to trust a man for whom they know they are not the top priority?“Epidemics do not create abnormal situations but rather sharpen existing behavior which ‘betray deeply rooted and continuing social imbalances,’” Roderick McGrew wrote in the last century, in a paper studying a cholera epidemic in Russia. This pandemic is bringing everything into sharp focus — from class structures to the chaos of US health care. It is forcing us to reckon with the US's role in the world, and our own image of ourselves. And it is revealing the president for who he truly is, what he is capable of, and where his priorities lie, more than ever before.That McGrew quote was cited in another paper, on a bubonic plague outbreak in South Africa in the early years of the previous century. It begins with a quote from Benjamin Disraeli, the 19th century–era UK prime minister, speaking in 1875: “The public health is the foundation on which repose the happiness of the people and the power of a country. The care of the public health is the first duty of a statesman.” No wonder everyone feels at a complete loss.      ","Coronavirus Is The Nightmare Situation People Worried About When Trump Won

"     California Rep. Katie Porter exacted a commitment from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to pay for coronavirus testing for uninsured Americans, grilling the Trump administration official repeatedly in the middle of a congressional hearing until he agreed the government would pay for the tests.When CDC Director Robert Redfield agreed to Porter’s demands, she quickly turned to the American public to urge them to get tested.“Everyone in America, hear that. You are eligible to go get tested for coronavirus and have that covered, regardless of insurance.”Porter cited a provision in federal administrative law to ask Redfield if he would commit to “using that existing authority to pay for diagnostic testing free to every American regardless of insurance.”      Redfield began, “Well, I can say that we’re going to do everything to make sure that everyone can get the care that they need—”“Nope, not good enough,” Porter responded, in a clip that quickly went viral on Twitter.Redfield deferred committing to Porter for several more questions, saying he was waiting for the CDC to “operationalize” payments for testing.“You don’t need to do any work to operationalize,” Porter said. “You need to make a commitment to the American people so they come in to get tested.”“I think you’re an excellent questioner, so my answer is yes,” Redfield finally said.A spokesperson for Porter’s office told BuzzFeed News that Porter “expects the CDC to keep the commitment that it made in this hearing.”The CDC did not respond to a request for comment. The office of Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading up the administration’s coronavirus response, likewise did not immediately return a request for comment.Porter is a protégé of Elizabeth Warren’s, who is known on Capitol Hill for just the strategy that Porter employed with the CDC: finding pathways within existing law and using public pressure to exact commitments from government officials to follow them.","Katie Porter Got The CDC Director To Promise Free Coronavirus Tests

"     Bernie Sanders turned a press statement on the coronavirus on Thursday into a concerted pitch for Medicare for All.“In the last few days, we have seen the crisis of the coronavirus continue to grow exponentially here in the United States and around the world, and we have witnessed a global economic meltdown which will impact millions of workers in our own country,” Sanders said during remarks in Burlington, Vermont. “In terms of potential deaths and in terms of the economic impact on our economy, the crisis we face from the coronavirus is on the scale of a major war and we must act accordingly.”Sanders spent the majority of his speech calling on Americans to unite with their neighbors and for the government to protect people from price-gouging for medical treatment. And he pushed further for Medicare for All, the signature issue that has propelled his presidential campaigns, saying that the United States is at a “severe disadvantage” when it comes to treating people for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, because the country doesn’t provide health care to all citizens.“When you are uninsured or under-insured, you hesitate about getting the medical care you need because you cannot afford to get that medical care,” Sanders said. “The result is that millions of our people cannot afford to go to a doctor let alone pay for a coronavirus test. While we work to pass a Medicare for All single-payer system, the United States government today must make it clear that in the midst of this emergency, everyone in our country, regardless of income or where they live, must be able to get all of the health care they need without cost.”Sanders’ comments in Vermont followed a speech on the coronavirus from Joe Biden, who is leading Sanders in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Biden’s remarks marked the beginnings of a shift in focus to a general election race against Trump, with the release of a lengthy plan to combat the virus. Biden’s plan, while not Medicare for All, is still extensive, including calling for free coronavirus tests and no out-of-pocket expenses for related care.Sanders made similar proposals, saying that vaccinations for coronavirus should be provided free of charge once they are developed. “We cannot live in a nation where, if you have the money, you get the treatment you need to survive, but if you're working-class or poor, you get to the end of the line. That would be morally unacceptable.”Sanders also called for a national moratorium on evictions, home foreclosures, and utility shutoffs while people who have contracted the coronavirus take time away from work or who have been fired from companies during the economic downturn. That position has gained steam among progressive activists in the weeks since the virus has spread across the country.The Miami-Dade County Police Department issued a notice that it would not be assisting homeowners in evictions until further notice, and the city of San Jose, California approved a 30-day moratorium on evictions for residents who can document that they’ve faced significant financial hardship because of the coronavirus. In New York City, City Council Speaker Corey Johnson tweeted that he agreed with a call to halt evictions during the pandemic.","Bernie Sanders Pitched Medicare For All As The Way To Fight The Coronavirus

"     WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is moving ahead with its plan to enact strict work requirements on people who use food stamps despite the coronavirus pandemic — a move that could result in hundreds of thousands of people losing their eligibility for the program.People could soon be forced to work public-facing jobs when they should stay home or else risk losing access to the assistance they get to buy food.The Department of Agriculture confirmed this week it is sticking to its timeline to tighten work requirements starting April 1. People without a disability or children must work 20 hours per week to qualify for SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program formerly known as food stamps.The White House projects 700,000 people would lose SNAP eligibility. Lauren Bauer, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, filed access to information requests for figures from all 50 states and projected the number of people losing assistance would be much higher, at 1.3 million to 1.5 million.But those projections all came out before the novel coronavirus swept across the United States, causing a wave of self-quarantines and threatening economic downturn.“That number is going to be much, much higher,” she said. “It’s going to cause harm both to the people who are eligible for SNAP, but it’s also going to cause harm for the economy.”One fear in particular is that those who work in the service industry or gig economy will see their hours cut as would-be customers stay inside rather than go out to restaurants, bars, and sporting events. If those workers fall below 80 hours per month, they can be kicked off SNAP. There’s also a public health issue: Hourly workers may go to their jobs while they feel ill, a dangerous proposition when officials are recommending most people stay home to help stop the spread of the disease.The Trump administration had considered delaying the April 1 start day for the rule change but ultimately decided to stay on schedule, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue confirmed on Tuesday to a House Appropriations Subcommittee.Since the mid-’90s, adults between the ages of 18 and 49 without a disability or children have been required to work 80 hours per month, or they are capped at three months of SNAP eligibility over three years. But states are currently waiving that requirement in high-unemployment areas. The Trump administration rule change would make it harder for states to get those waivers.Perdue said the administration, however, determined states can mitigate the effects of the coronavirus on SNAP enrollment through “good cause” waivers. These exemptions apply when someone has a good cause for missing work, such as falling ill or an office building being shut down due to infection. They can be authorized at the state level and do not need to be approved federally.“Whether you are sick or your job says you can’t come to work, the good cause will eliminate need for work requirements under this rule,” Perdue said in a statement released to BuzzFeed News.Experts have raised concerns that good cause waivers need to be processed on a case-by-case basis. This can cause case managers to become overloaded, and people may not even know they are able to make such claims.It also just seems like an odd time to be forcing people to go out and work 80 hours of predominantly public-facing jobs, said Ed Bolen, senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Because “good cause” is a relatively obscure provision, he said, it is not clear whether someone with a sick spouse would have cause to stay home from their food service job, even if that’s medically wise.“It just seems shortsighted and counterproductive to condition SNAP benefits on making those kinds of decisions during a public health emergency,” he said.Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee repeatedly pressed Perdue to delay the rule change until the coronavirus was no longer a threat, as well as taking other steps to expand the social safety net. “Really it’s a cruel rule, taking food out of the mouths of hungry individuals,” she said. “Why can’t we just postpone or delay this at least until at least this critical moment is over?”But Perdue said any response to the coronavirus involving food programs would need to be approved by both the White House and Congress as part of a “one government approach” to the problem.House Democrats included a blanket work requirement waiver during the length of the coronavirus outbreak in their signature legislation they introduced to address the crisis. However, that policy package was rebuffed in the Senate, where Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced the bill for creating a “thicket of bureaucracy” that will kill thousands of jobs. What measures ultimately get passed will depend on negotiations between Congress and the White House.","The Trump Administration Will Move Ahead With Its Plan To Kick People Off Of Food Stamps Despite The Coronavirus Outbreak

"     WASHINGTON — When Washington state emerged as the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, Sen. Patty Murray was already pushing President Donald Trump and the administration to act. Now that her home state’s death toll has reached 37 with more than 1,900 confirmed cases nationwide, Murray is furious that the president didn’t act sooner.Murray, the lead Democrat on the Senate’s Health Committee, first called on Trump’s administration to intervene as early as January and told BuzzFeed News Friday that the administration was largely unresponsive leading up to the death of a Washington resident, the first person to die in the US, two weeks ago.“Look, from day one, when we started seeing this grow and develop in China and continue to grow rapidly and expansively, all of us should have been aware that issues like a virus don’t stay in one place. That we are a global community, people travel. ... Instead, the reaction from the federal government or from the person in the White House, in particular, was ‘no worries, be happy,’” Murray told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview on Friday. “And I am so angry and frustrated at that.”      There’s a lot we still don’t know about the coronavirus outbreak.

On February 15, Murray and 25 other senators sent a letter to Trump pushing him to request emergency funding to combat the novel coronavirus. By February 24, Trump asked Congress for $2.5 billion, a figure Democrats said wasn’t enough. Four days later, Trump called coronavirus Democrats’ “new hoax.” A few days later, he told people at a town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania, that the US “got hit with the virus really three weeks ago” — this after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had declared the first confirmed coronavirus case in the country more than six weeks earlier.“It seems to me, from day one, the message from the top [of] this administration has been to downplay it,” Murray said. “I don’t believe in panicking people, but I believe that our response as a country has to be ... a sense of urgency,” she added.Murray says other members of Trump’s administration were equally unresponsive. Earlier this month, Murray and nine other senators sent a letter to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos asking how her department is coordinating with public health officials as it relates to coronavirus preparedness.“My own granddaughter’s school at that point had been closed for a week,” Murray told BuzzFeed News. “I saw specifically what they were dealing with in terms of making sure that kids get access to material, that nutritious lunches were being provided for kids whose only meal, every day, was in the school — kids who were sick themselves.”The letter went unanswered as schools across the nation have begun to close in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a former presidential candidate whom Trump called “a snake” during a news conference, announced statewide school closures on Friday and he has banned public gatherings of more than 250 people.Globally, more than 140,000 have contracted the disease with 1,998 in the US, as of Friday evening, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There have been 43 deaths in the US with 37 of them coming from Washington state. Twenty-five of those deaths were linked to the Life Care Center, a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington.Murray is one of several lawmakers who has expressed concerns about access to coronavirus testing, particularly after a briefing from administration officials on Capitol Hill left members furious with the lack of information on the issue.Murray said that after she made numerous calls to administration officials and held a hearing asking when testing would be available, health officials told senators during the closed-door briefing: “‘No, we can’t tell you when.”“I am still talking to families every day who are being told ‘we don’t have the test,’” Murray said. “The message, consistently to everybody is, if you are sick, stay home.”","A Senator From The State Hit Hardest By Coronavirus Is “So Angry And Frustrated” With Trump For Not Responding Sooner

"     WASHINGTON — After shaking hands with several CEOs of major US companies, President Donald Trump said Friday he will “most likely” get tested for the coronavirus after coming into contact with a Brazilian official who later tested positive.Trump dined with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro at Mar-a-Lago last weekend and was photographed standing next to Bolsonaro’s press secretary, Fabio Wajngarten. Wajngarten tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, on Thursday.Trump has so far declined to get tested or self-isolate, despite Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez doing so after coming in contact with Wajngarten. Suarez tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday. Several other Republicans have also self-isolated after coming into contact with an attendee at the Conservative Political Action Conference who later tested positive; Trump gave a speech at the conference.

""I asked them that same question, and they said, ‘You don’t have any symptoms whatsoever.’ And we don't want people without symptoms to go and do the test. The test is not insignificant.""      But when he was pressed on his contact with the Brazilian staffer, Trump said, “I didn’t say I wasn’t going to be tested.” Asked if he would be, he said, “Most likely. Not for that reason, but because I think I will do it anyway. Fairly soon. We’re working out a schedule.”During the same press conference, he announced that all Americans returning from Europe would be directed to self-quarantine for 14 days, regardless of whether they showed symptoms.Trump said he and Bolsonaro “sat next to each other for a long period of time” but he was not concerned, because the Brazilian president was tested and officials in that country have said it was negative.South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham announced Thursday he was self-quarantining because he also was at Mar-a-Lago last weekend, though he said he has no recollection of direct contact with Bolsonaro or Wajngarten. Graham's office said he is awaiting the results of a coronavirus test.","Trump Said He Won't Self-Isolate After Coming Into Contact With Someone With The Coronavirus But He'll ""Most Likely"" Get Tested

"     On Thursday, a prominent Chinese diplomat tweeted a false conspiracy theory that the novel coronavirus did not originate in Wuhan, China, but in the United States.“This article is very much important to each and every one of us. Please read and retweet it. COVID-19: Further Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US,” Lijian Zhao, the deputy director-general of the Information Department of China's Foreign Ministry, tweeted. In a follow-up tweet, the diplomat wrote, “Just take a few minutes to read one more article. This is so astonishing that it changed many things I used to believe in. Please retweet to let more people know about it.”The tweet linked to a story on conspiracy theory site Global Research that falsely claimed the novel coronavirus originated in the US. Experts at the World Health Organization have concluded the disease first appeared in the Chinese province of Hubei. As of Friday, the disease has infected 137,860 people and killed 5,074 around the world.The false claim was far from the only piece of propaganda that Zhao, the most prominent member of China's Foreign Ministry on Twitter, has pushed about the coronavirus outbreak in the last week — a strategy that didn't convince anyone, but appears designed to polarize the US government and disrupt any bipartisan mitigation efforts.Zhao and Hua Chunying, another spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, have flooded Twitter with posts lauding the Chinese Communist Party's response to COVID-19 and indulging in conspiracy theories about the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Unlike other parts of China’s propaganda apparatus, which are typically concerned with manipulating homegrown social networks like Weibo and WeChat, Zhao, Hua, and a small group of other diplomats have become more and more brazen about taking their information war to American platforms.Following Zhao and Hua’s tweet, the State Department summoned the Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai on Friday. The Chinese embassy did not respond to a request for comment. President Donald Trump, in a coronavirus press conference Friday, was asked about Zhao's propaganda efforts. Trump waved them away, saying they wouldn't impact trade with China.""They know where [the virus] came from, we all know where it came from,"" he said.Del Harvey, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety, said the platform is assessing things ""case by case"" and that government officials don't have special rights to post harmful information, but the platform is also taking into account if the replies to tweets are providing ""corrective"" information.Zhao, who currently has 284,000 followers on Twitter, first went viral in the US last July. He did so again last November after he fired off an eight-part tweetstorm about American racism and mocked Trump.“This is a time for Chinese diplomats to tell the true picture,” he told BuzzFeed News in December.      This week, Zhao and Hua seized on a controversy started by right-wing media and prominent Republicans, who began calling COVID-19 as “the Chinese coronavirus.”On Monday night, two of Fox News’ three main opinion hosts — Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham — promoted the fact that the virus originated in Wuhan, China.“People you know will get sick. Some may die. This is real,” Carlson said. “People you trust — people you probably voted for — have spent weeks minimizing what is a very serious problem,” he said. He spoke next to a graphic that blared: “the Chinese coronavirus.”Carlson’s “Chinese coronavirus"" set off a political dispute in the US, with prominent Republicans and right-wing influencers using the term, while Democrats like Rep. Grace Meng, vice-chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, condemned it in a statement as “embarrassing, disrespectful, offensive, and downright disgusting.”Compared to where it ended, the diplomats' Twitter campaign began this week relatively innocuously.Zhao waded into the controversy on Monday with a four-tweet thread, which included an editorial from the Global Times, an English-language Chinese state-run news site, attacking US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for calling it the “Wuhan virus."" Zhao tweeted out another Global Times editorial demanding the US apologize to the world for how it has handled the coronavirus outbreak.During the same tweetstorm, Zhao retweeted a video from China Daily, another English-language state-run newspaper, attacking Fox News for using the term “Chinese coronavirus.” Then he began retweeting Americans accusing Republicans of racism and xenophobia, like Charlotte Clymer, a Human Rights Campaign press secretary, CNN correspondent Kyung Lah, and Rep. Grace Meng.On Thursday, Zhao retweeted Hua, who shared an article by the Gray Zone, a pro-Russia independent news site, which cast doubt on China’s detention of Uighur Muslims. “It seems that some US officials enjoy smearing China around the clock and around the world,” she said.Both Hua and Zhao went on to jumped on statements made by Centers for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield during a House committee hearing on Wednesday, where he said that some Americans were diagnosed with influenza, but actually died from COVID-19. The clip was translated into Chinese and spread by state-run media, both on Twitter and YouTube, as well as Chinese platforms like Weibo.      On Thursday, Zhao tweeted an article from the Centre for Research on Globalization, a conspiracy theory site written by Canadian economist Michel Chossudovsky, who was accused by the Globe and Mail in 2017 of pushing Russian propaganda. In the article, Larry Romanoff, a regular writer for the site who has posted a bevy of misinformation about the coronavirus, cites a Chinese study, covered by Global Times, that claimed the virus began in late November somewhere else than Wuhan. It also mentioned an article from Japan’s Asahi Shimbun that also reported Americans who were diagnosed with influenza actually had COVID-19. Zhao’s tweets about the article were shared a combined 7,000 times.The Global Times jumped on Zhao’s tweets, writing two different articles about them. The CRG article, according to social metrics site CrowdTangle, has been shared over 7,000 times on Facebook.It’s unlikely that Zhao and Hua’s Twitter accounts are convincing Americans that the coronavirus originated in the US, but they have inflamed America's political divisions.According to CrowdTangle, Zhao’s tweets about a US coronavirus origin got the most attention from two Twitter users: Donald Trump Jr. and pro-Trump media personality Mike Cernovich. Trump quote-tweeted Zhao, blaming the media and Democrats for helping Zhao spread propaganda. Cernovich also quote-tweeted him, demanding the US end all trade with China because of Zhao’s tweets and also blamed US media for helping spread Chinese propaganda.Meanwhile, behind China’s Great Firewall, where the government bans Twitter, the hashtag topic “Zhao Lijian sent out five consecutive tweets questioning the US” has been read more than 4.7 million times on Weibo, with Chinese users cheering him on.

"     President Trump declared a national state of emergency on Friday over the coronavirus outbreak, unleashing billions of dollars in federal funding and ordering all states to set up emergency operations centers to combat the pandemic.""To unleash the full power of the federal government, I'm officially declaring a national emergency,"" Trump told reporters in the White House Rose Garden. ""Two very big words.""A number of cities and states have already declared states of emergency, allowing them to access federal aid to address the health crisis, but Trump said the national emergency would unleash a further $50 billion nationally.The president also ordered hospitals to activate emergency preparedness plans.""We'll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they're entitled to,"" he said. ""No resource will be spared. Nothing whatsoever.""Trump said Google is setting up an online quiz that people can take to determine whether they need to be tested for the coronavirus. Those who need the test will then be directed to a drive-thru testing area; the CEOs of Walmart, Target, CVS, and Walgreens said they will open their parking lots across the country for testing.But Google said Friday evening that Trump was incorrect, according to the Verge. The website is being developed not by Google, but another division of its parent company Alphabet, and it will only direct people to testing sites in the Bay Area, at least initially.Additionally on Friday, Trump announced a public-private partnership to increase testing for COVID-19, saying that the FDA had approved a new test within hours after receiving an application to do so.""We therefore expect up to half a million additional tests will be available early next week,"" he said. ""We'll be announcing locations probably on Sunday night.""The administration is also directing nursing homes to temporarily restrict visitors and nonessential personnel with a few exceptions, such as end-of-life situations, said Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, at the press conference. “We fully appreciate that this measure represents a severe trial for residents of nursing homes and those who love them. But we are doing what we must to protect our vulnerable elderly,” said Verma.Elderly people are at a much higher risk of dying from a COVID-19 infection. Studies show the mortality rate for people aged 80 and older could be over 20%, while the mortality rates for people under the age of 50 are significantly below 1%.The president also said he had signed executive orders to waive interest on student loans held by federal government agencies until further notice.""That's a big thing for a lot of students that are left in the middle right now,"" he said.

Trump also said the United Kingdom may be added to the list of countries that are banned from air travel to the United States. The UK was initially excluded from the ban of 26 European countries that make up the Schengen Area. When asked why the UK was excluded when it has more cases of confirmed coronavirus than many of the banned European countries, Trump said, “We may have to include them in the list.”Trump also said that due to plummeting oil prices, he has directed Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette to purchase large quantities of oil for strategic reserves.Trump was also asked Friday about his contact with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago property. A Bolsonaro staffer who was there tested positive for COVID-19, while the Brazilian president himself has said he tested negative.""We have no symptoms whatsoever,"" Trump said of himself and his staffers. He later added, ""As you know, he tested negative, meaning nothing wrong this morning, and we got that word too — because we did have dinner with him, uh, we were sitting next to each other for a long period of time.""Asked why he wasn't self-isolating, as other politicians who have interacted with those who have tested positive for the disease have done, Trump reiterated: ""I don't have any of the symptoms. We have a White House doctor — I should say many White House doctors. I asked them that same question, and they said, 'you don't have any symptoms whatsoever.'""The national emergency comes amid widespread criticism over his administration's slow response to the outbreak so far as well as the federal government's missteps in testing for the disease.States such as Washington and California had been pleading with Trump to declare a state of emergency so they can mobilize their Medicaid systems to fight the coronavirus outbreak.As first reported by Talking Points Memo, states have wanted to loosen Medicaid rules to both provide more care and offer more options for people to receive health services. Essentially, they want to make the system more flexible to prevent it from being overwhelmed.However, they’ve been hamstrung by the Trump administration because making these changes requires specific waivers — known as 1135 waivers — that can only be used when the president has declared an emergency. But for weeks now, Trump has refused such a declaration and downplayed the danger posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.      The first known case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in the US was reported on Jan. 21 in Washington state. More than 1,700 cases have been reported in nearly every state in the country since, and 41 people have died so far.Experts say it's highly likely that there are many more COVID-19 cases than the official number. After the CDC initially bungled the rollout of test kits, officials say the government is still ""failing"" at providing adequate testing for the coronavirus.As the outbreak escalates across the country, organizers have postponed major sporting and entertainment events, schools have moved to online classes, and shoppers have gone on panicked sprees, buying supplies and emptying shelves at supermarkets and pharmacies.In an effort to flatten the curve of the epidemic, people have been advised to practice social distancing, though many are struggling with mixed messages from officials — and especially from the president — on how seriously they should take this outbreak.Since the first COVID-19 case was reported, Trump has attempted to downplay the severity of the outbreak. He initially claimed he ""shut it down coming in from China,"" where the first case was reported, and asserted that the virus was ""under control"" in the US.Trump continued to praise US health officials as the number of cases rose across the country. He claimed in March that ""anybody that wants a test can get a test,"" contradicting health officials and experts who've criticized the government's inadequacy at testing for the virus.      In a Wednesday address, President Trump left people reeling and confused as he announced measures to curb the spread of the virus. He declared a ban on travel from Europe — which officials later had to clarify did not apply to US citizens or permanent residents — claimed the ban applied to cargo, which he later walked back, and said insurance companies would waive copayments for COVID-19 treatment. (Companies later said they were only waiving copayments for testing, not treatment.)","Trump Declared A National State Of Emergency Over The Coronavirus Outbreak

"     Thousands of Americans think President Donald Trump may try to cancel the 2020 election by citing the coronavirus pandemic. On the left and right, they envision him declaring a national emergency, using those newly invoked powers to suspend the November vote and extend his first term in the White House.It’s not purely paranoia. The pandemic has already canceled campaign rallies, postponed the primary election in Louisiana, and raised ideas to nix the parties’ nominating conventions. Trump, for his part, has often lied about his last election to justify his political power, and most specifically, he retweeted a suggestion last year from Jerry Falwell Jr. that his first term should be extended by two years.      Major disturbances during elections, it turns out, are an age-old American problem, and so, dear reader, we are here to answer the question: Can the president cancel the election? Or can a viral outbreak — or some other bona fide crisis, such as terrorism or war — lead to postponing voting day?The short answer is no, a president cannot defer an election unilaterally. And even with support in much of Congress and the states, it would be extremely difficult, perhaps logistically impossible, to postpone the presidential general election.But that doesn’t mean disasters can’t wreak havoc on democracy as usual.Congress could try setting a new election timeline, local election boards could be unable to operate polling sites, and the president could sow doubt in the election's legitimacy or push executive emergency powers to the legal brink to disrupt the vote. It is important that we discuss all of these scenarios right now.      There’s a lot we still don’t know about the coronavirus outbreak. Our newsletter, Outbreak Today, will do its best to put everything we do know in one place — you can sign up here. Do you have questions you want answered? You can always get in touch. And if you're someone who is seeing the impact of this firsthand, we’d also love to hear from you (you can reach out to us via one of our tip line channels).      What if Trump wants to postpone Election Day?In a viral Twitter thread last month, former assistant US attorney Glenn Kirschner, now an analyst for MSNBC, envisioned Trump delivering a national TV address in October 2020 to announce, “I am declaring a national emergency and postponing the presidential election.”While Trump could say that, he couldn’t follow through on it on his own — a point where Democratic and Republican experts agree.Hans von Spakovsky, an election law specialist for the conservative Heritage Foundation, told BuzzFeed News in an email this week, “The president has no power to change the date of a federal election.”His answer jibes with Justin Levitt’s, who led the Justice Department’s Voting Section during the Obama administration. “The president saying we are not having an election until X date has as much authority as me saying it, which is zero,” he said in a phone call. “He might well try, even thought the answer is, ‘No, he cannot.’”This is because only Congress sets the “times, places and manner” of federal elections, according to the Constitution. While the Constitution doesn’t prescribe those dates, exactly, Congress did in 3 U.S. Code § 1. That federal law schedules presidential elections — brace for this sentence — “on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, in every fourth year succeeding every election of a President and Vice President.”This year, that is Nov. 3.      What if Congress wants to change the date?In addition to changing Election Day, Congress would need to rewrite 3 U.S. Code § 7, which sets the timeline for electors — chosen by states — to vote in the Electoral College and install the new president. That law says the electors “shall meet and give their votes on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.” This year, it’s Dec. 14.Even if Congress did all that, however, lawmakers still couldn’t delay Election Day by more than a couple months without rewriting the Constitution itself, which says the president can only “hold his Office during the Term of four Years.” The upshot: After four years, the president’s term — and authority — expires.“There’s no holdover,” John Conklin, the director of public information at the New York State Board of Elections, told BuzzFeed News, about what happens if that four-year term ends without the state electors choosing the president. “There’s no one to replace the president and vice president.”A Congressional Research Service report in 2004 noted the 20th Amendment terminates each presidential term at noon on Jan. 20. As a result, the report found, “Congress could not postpone elections indefinitely.”Extending the president’s term by amending the Constitution would require two-thirds of the House and the Senate. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who runs the Democrat-controlled House, didn’t answer questions about her willingness to postpone the election.“I can promise you that this Congress will not do that,” Levitt said of delaying the vote due to the novel coronavirus. “If virus fears are bad enough in early November that you can’t hold an election in many places, they’re still going to be that bad on December 31.”      What if Trump tries to use a national emergency to delay the election?The president can quickly amass dozens of powers by declaring a national emergency, citing the National Emergencies Act and other laws for crisis, as detailed in this handy table created by the Brennan Center for Justice.But the president only gets emergency powers domestically that are given to him by federal law, Levitt explained. “Those have to be locked in by statute.” None of those emergency laws apply to changing the time we vote.As a result, the 2004 Congressional Research Service report, “Executive Branch Power to Postpone Elections,” concluded: “The Executive Branch does not appear to currently have the authority to establish or postpone the dates of elections at either the federal or state level in the event of an emergency situation.”      What if states want to change their Election Day?A peculiarity of US federal elections — both for Congress and the White House — is that the federal government doesn’t administer them. The states do.The president only commands federal agents; the 10th Amendment stops the federal government from commandeering state officials. The officers who actually run elections — secretaries of state, state and county election boards, election supervisors, the list goes on — simply don’t report to the White House.The laws they follow aren’t primarily federal, either. Conklin, whose office oversees New York elections, explained, “All of the elections are codified in the state laws.” In order to change procedures on the ground nationally, 50 states would need to be on board. “I think legislatures would have to act,” Conklin said, except where certain authority is already vested governors or other officials. Even then, he added, “Most states would want the legislature to give legitimacy for any change to an election.”Despite the states’ autonomy to run the show, they can’t stray much from the national timeline. They are bound to pick their presidential electors in mid-December, as required by federal law, Conklin added. “Most states would have to keep their election in place to send electors to vote in the Electoral College.”This creates a sort of baked-in lethargy to any possible change; a slew of federal and state laws, plus constitutional amendments to term limits, may need to be rewritten en masse to change Election Day for the president. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to announce a change in October and enact all of that by early November.      What if a bona fide emergency threatens to upend the election?We have examples. The 9/11 attackers hit New York City the morning of the state’s 2001 primary election, so the governor postponed voting for two weeks.Historically, however, disruptions haven’t changed the date of US elections so much as turnout and practices at the polls.In late October 2012, when Hurricane Sandy hit New York and New Jersey — two states currently facing viral breakouts — “schools, nursing homes, and dozens of other poll sites were no longer available,” Conklin recalled. “In some places, they were putting up tents in parking lots and brought in generators to run lights.”During the coronavirus pandemic, he said, “the problem seems to be not bringing people together in large clumps.”That was an issue during the Spanish flu, which engulfed the country amid the 1918 midterm elections for Congress, killing an estimated half million people in the United States, despite quarantines.“In Idaho, the governor mandated that all voters queue single file in their polling places to avoid the crowds that the flu liked to feed on,” according to a 2010 study by Jason Marisam in the Election Law Journal. In San Francisco, poll workers and voters all had to wear masks.“The flu likely had a significant impact on voter turnout — perhaps keeping hundreds of thousands away from the polls on Election Day,” said the study, which reported turnout down about 10% from the previous midterms, despite newspapers urging people to vote. “But surprisingly, in most places the election was held with relatively few complications. There was no national debate about the legitimacy of the election results.”Like the Spanish flu, the coronavirus may require quarantines. A 2006 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza: Implementation Plan, sets out “a range of options, such as reductions in non-essential travel and, as a last resort, mandatory restrictions.”Although the CDC’s pandemic plan makes no mention of what happens in the event of an election, the federal government’s powers to quarantine domestically and punish violators are restricted: Federal officials can only block domestic travel between states, a power created by the Constitution’s Commerce Clause. A CDC quarantine can’t keep Americans in their homes on its own. However, states could establish more stringent rules for travel, potentially impeding voters trying to reach the polls.“I have a hard time seeing anything other than a mass disaster being a reason to delay an election,” von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation said, dismissing the coronavirus as a reason to stall. “The outbreak of a disease with an extremely low fatality rate does not even come close.”      What if Trump tries to discourage voting, even if he can’t stop it?The Atlantic last year described a hypothetical situation where Trump abuses his power to win another term. By deploying the Presidential Alert system, he would send a text message to every cellphone about the “risk of violence at polling stations,” saying “troops will be deployed as necessary” to keep order. Scared Democrats would stay home and, voila, Trump would win.“He could claim authority he does not have, which would not be the first time,” Levitt said. An analysis by the Washington Post last year found judges had ruled against the administration 63 times, often for violating the Administrative Procedure Act and running afoul of the Constitution, including on issues of immigration, the census, and law enforcement.Trump has a predilection for lying about elections. The White House voter fraud commission was created after Trump claimed 3 to 5 million people voted illegally, but the board shut down after being sued for records by one of its own Democratic members. Those records, the member said after getting the documents, showed Trump’s voting fraud claims were “false.”At least two laws could stop efforts to deploy federal resources, like troops, to intimidate voters. The Posse Comitatus Act, as described in a 2018 report to Congress, “outlaws the willful use of any part of the Army or Air Force to execute the law unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress.” Likewise, the Antideficiency Act prevents federal workers from using their resources beyond the purpose of their funding appropriations — so FBI agents can’t be stationed outside polling places for the purpose of scaring away voters.Levitt warned, however, those laws may not stop the president from using troops in ways that are “right up to the border of what is legal.” Trump may not have the backing of the military to push those limits, he said. “That doesn’t mean you won’t read about it on Twitter.”      What if we try to protect the vote now?States’ legislatures can expand the right to vote by mail — getting people out of crowded polling places and, according to research, increasing voter participation. Dale Ho, a voting rights lawyer for the ACLU, noted in the New York Times, “In the 2018 midterms, for example, states that permit voting by mail had, on average, a 15.5 percentage point higher turnout than states that did not.” A handful of states have switched to this system entirely, including Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington.States can also expand the right to vote absentee for any reason (known as no-fault absentee voting).The House last year passed H.R.1, a bill to expand voting access — including, among other provisions, to ensure ballots cast by mail are counted. The Republican-controlled Senate hasn’t touched it. ●      ","What Happens If Trump Tries To Cancel The Election Because Of The Coronavirus?

"     Joe Biden won the endorsement of the nation’s largest union on Saturday, adding to his surge of support from unions, members of Congress and elected officials around the country.The National Education Association endorsed Biden because he “understands that as a nation we have a moral responsibility to provide a great neighborhood public school for every student in every ZIP code,” union president Lily Eskelsen García said in a statement.She added that Biden’s K-12 and higher education plans, along with his commitment to raising teachers’ salaries and funding support staff positions. Biden’s wife, Dr. Jill Biden, was a teacher both in public high schools and community college.“Biden has championed public education throughout this campaign and beyond. He and Dr. Jill Biden, herself an educator and NEA member, have consistently reached out to NEA members across the country building the broad support among NEA members,” Eskelsen Garcia said. “He attended all three of NEA’s presidential forums, including in Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Texas, as well as sat for a video interview to make his case to educators.”The NEA has over 3 million members, more than 75% of whom are college-educated women — a group of voters that both parties will be vying to win over in the general election — making them the largest union in the country as well as one of the most influential.The union’s leadership voted to endorse Biden on Saturday.The leadership of several larger national unions including the second-largest teachers’ union, the American Federation of Teachers, have avoided making endorsements on behalf of their members this cycle, after rank and file members took issue with leadership-level decisions to back Hillary Clinton in 2016. Various local affiliates have backed Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who recently dropped out of the race.In January, Nevada’s largest teachers’ union, the Clark County Education Association, endorsed Sanders, and the United Teachers Los Angeles endorsed Sanders last November.While the AFT has not made an official endorsement, the union leadership has said that after a process including members surveys and polls, they encourage affiliates, members and leadership to “to be actively involved in supporting and helping Vice President Biden, Sen. Sanders, and/or Sen. Warren.”The AFT’s president, Randi Weingarten, individually endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren before she dropped out of the race.","Joe Biden Won The Endorsement Of The Nation’s Largest Union

"     CLEVELAND, Ohio — Before she joined Bernie Sanders’ revolution, Nina Turner wanted to lead her own in Ohio.Once on a trajectory to be the next mayor of Cleveland, Turner instead challenged the status quo. She fought for local government reforms that ended an era of corruption but also enraged leaders in the local black political establishment. And then she threatened to primary Rep. Marcia Fudge, who owed her seat in Congress, at least in part, to those leaders.This rivalry between Fudge and Turner, now going on a decade, is an insider vs. outsider story that helps explain Democratic campaigns in the most Democratic part of Ohio — and in the county that provides the largest share of the state’s black vote. It’s also instructive as the presidential race shifts here this week amid bleak prospects for Sanders. Fudge and most of the other insiders are backing former vice president Joe Biden. Turner, a Sanders campaign co-chair and one of his most visible allies, is again pushing from the outside.“I always find myself doing the hardest work, doing the most life-altering work, not going with the status quo,” Turner said in an interview last week, the morning after Biden beat Sanders soundly in several big primaries, including Michigan’s. “When you take on the hardest assignments, you know the difficulty is there. I don’t run from that. I have a history in this state of being an independent thinker and doing what I believe is right, even if the political headwinds are against me. And I’m going to continue to do that as long as I have the breath to do it.”There’s been little reliable polling in Ohio since the field narrowed to Biden and Sanders. But the state’s demographics (a sizable black vote in the three largest cities, a big working-class population, and plenty of moderate suburbanites) reflect the type of voter coalition Biden has built elsewhere. Biden’s endorsement list in the state features some of the party’s most reputable organizers and vote-getters, including Rep. Marcy Kaptur, the longest-serving woman in the House — and a Sanders supporter in 2016.Fudge, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, initially endorsed Kamala Harris, before she ended her presidential campaign in December. She came to Biden late, after his victory in the South Carolina primary revived his candidacy, and as other mainstream Democrats lined up behind him. In a statement the campaign circulated to announce her support, Fudge praised Biden’s commitment to civil and voting rights. “But above all,” she said, “I believe in winning — because that’s where all paths forward to every other big thing we want to do start.”In an interview last week, Fudge said she’s known Biden for years, though they are not close. “I thought Joe Biden was the fit for the district,” Fudge explained, “and for me, personally.”The district is the only one in Ohio where most of the constituents are black. The seat itself is the legacy of Louis Stokes, who became Ohio’s first black member of Congress after winning a racial gerrymandering case in the late 1960s. When he retired in 1993, the seat went to Stephanie Tubbs Jones, who like Stokes was one of the most influential Cleveland politicos of her generation. When Tubbs Jones died suddenly in 2008, party leaders helped elevate Fudge, who had been Tubbs Jones’ chief of staff, as her successor.      Fudge started off quiet and deferential to her elders — very much unlike the vivacious Tubbs Jones. Through attrition, she grew into at least some of the influence that comes with her job. Stokes and others who maintained a long-lasting grip in the black wards and precincts either died or backed away from public life in recent years. Frank Jackson, now in his fourth term as mayor of Cleveland, doesn’t much care for state or national politics.Fudge’s loyalty sometimes costs her, as it did when she vouched for the character of former judge Lance Mason after he pleaded guilty to charges he assaulted his wife. (“Lance accepts full responsibility for his actions and has assured me that something like this will never happen again,” Fudge wrote in a supportive letter that became public in 2018, after Mason killed his then ex-wife, and just as Fudge was considering a run for speaker of the House.)And Fudge’s candidates don’t always win. Her endorsement doesn’t carry the same weight as, say, Jim Clyburn’s did in South Carolina last month after he backed Biden, setting in motion Biden’s big victory there. She “seems popular with voters,” longtime Cleveland political writer Brent Larkin observed recently, “but has yet to demonstrate that unique ability to transfer that popularity.” Even so, Fudge’s hand is often felt in local politics, including at the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, chaired by a Fudge protégé.“Marcia’s reach to elected leaders and political leaders is significant in Northeast Ohio,” Dean DePiero, a former mayor of the large Cleveland suburb of Parma and a well-wired Democrat in the state, said when asked about her Biden endorsement. After first endorsing Michael Bloomberg, DePiero now supports the former vice president.“She understands Ohio well — that it’s maybe a center-right state,” DePiero added.As Fudge settled into Congress in 2009, Turner, then a state senator, joined with a cast of predominantly white leaders in Cleveland’s progressive circles to overhaul the Cuyahoga County government. The party chair at the time, also a county commissioner, was at the center of a federal corruption investigation that resulted in dozens of convictions. Turner’s group favored replacing the three elected commissioners, and a row of other elected officeholders staffed by patronage hires, with an elected executive, an 11-member county council, and appointed administrators. Nearly every other black leader, including Fudge, opposed the ballot initiative, fearful it would rewind the progress black candidates had made winning countywide office.Cleveland’s black newspaper, owned by boxing promoter Don King and at the time largely under the editorial control of a prominent powerbroker in the black community, depicted Turner in a front-page cartoon as Aunt Jemima — an image meant to brand her as subservient to white authority.Still, Turner’s side won, and she subsequently was mentioned as a future mayor or a top prospect for the new county executive position. Instead, she began preparing to take on Fudge.Turner pulled petitions for the primary and, sounding a lot like the presidential candidate she would eventually work for, said she saw an “opportunity to represent a constituency that feels they have been disillusioned.” But, much like how moderate and establishment Democrats rallied around Biden in recent weeks to keep the democratic socialist Sanders at bay, many of Greater Cleveland’s top black activists closed rank around Fudge, culminating with an endorsement event headlined by Stokes. Turner withdrew her candidacy a few weeks later.She stayed active in progressive causes and became a minor MSNBC celebrity, back in the days of The Ed Show. She ran for Ohio secretary of state in 2014, losing badly in a year when a weak gubernatorial candidate dragged down the entire Democratic ticket. And then, after being an early booster for Hillary Clinton, Turner abruptly joined Sanders’ 2016 campaign. She quickly became one of the Vermont senator’s top surrogates.      Soon Fudge and Turner would collide again. After leaked emails showed Democratic National Committee officials mocking Sanders during the 2016 primaries, Fudge was pressed into a high-profile gig presiding over the convention that nominated Clinton. Turner joined with protesters sympathetic to Sanders, including actor Susan Sarandon, after plans for Turner to address the convention fell apart. A few days later, she openly considered an invitation to be the Green Party’s candidate for vice president.Both women downplay their rivalry. “That was something the media wanted to drive,” said Fudge, who believes Turner “brings great value” to Sanders’ campaign. “We don't always have to agree,” a similarly diplomatic Turner offered. “I think we have a healthy respect for one another. Oftentimes we find ourselves in disagreements politically, and that’s OK.”More recently they have been on opposite sides of other Ohio races. In 2018, Fudge endorsed Richard Cordray in the Democratic primary for governor. Our Revolution, the pro-Sanders political organization that Turner led at the time, backed Dennis Kucinich. Cordray won handily, with a big showing in Cuyahoga County. (Biden endorsed him after the primary.) But Fudge’s support was of little help in a state senate race, where the former Cleveland city council member she backed lost in a primary. And a Turner protégé — her handpicked successor on the city council — lost his reelection bid in 2017.These mixed results show that neither has a local political network likely to sway Tuesday’s race to Biden or Sanders, though Fudge at least has an operation that’s been in recent use. She said she has loaned her political consultant, Kenn Dowell, to the Biden campaign and has signaled for other allies to help the effort however they can. Fudge also cut a minute-long radio spot for Biden’s Ohio campaign.“We had a meeting yesterday, and within 24 hours of [Fudge’s] support, 50 elected officials and grassroots organizers came out to put the wheels in motion,” Blaine Griffin, a Cleveland city council member and pledged Biden delegate, told BuzzFeed News two days after Fudge endorsed Biden.      Griffin also admires Turner. “You won’t hear any of us say anything bad about Nina,” he said. “That’s our hometown lady. But I will tell you that Nina has not been on the ground the last few years, and the dynamics on the ground here have changed dramatically. She won’t bring the same kind of clout that Fudge does.”Turner acknowledged as much.“Well, that’s certainly my hope,” she replied when asked if her connection to Ohio would be an advantage to Sanders. “This is home, no doubt, but I’ve really been on the road a lot.”Turner said Sanders’ Ohio team from 2016 — an operation she helped assemble — remains mostly intact, though she was reluctant to take credit for it. Tara Mosley-Samples, a Sanders ally and member of Akron’s city council, noted the more than 1 million votes Turner won in her secretary of state race six years ago.“I think Nina brings a lot to the table for the state and especially for Cuyahoga County,” said Mosley-Samples, who was Kucinich’s running mate in 2018. “I think what she has been able to do, not only for the Sanders campaign but also for the city of Cleveland will show up in the numbers greatly.”But Mosley-Samples also conceded Biden’s lead in big-name Ohio endorsements. “It seems like we’re bucking up against the machine.”So Turner draws inspiration from her past fights in the state, especially the county government overhaul that passed in spite of its many powerful opponents.“All of the forces were against us and certainly mounted against me,” Turner said. “But ultimately the people rejected that and had a different idea.”“The headwinds are strong, no doubt about it,” she said of the Sanders campaign, before wryly reaching for a rallying cry for Elizabeth Warren, the former presidential candidate who competed for similarly progressive voters but has not thrown her support to Sanders.“Nevertheless we persist.”","How Nina Turner’s Ohio Rivalries Foreshadowed Her Future With Bernie Sanders

Mike DeWine to postpone the primary until June 2.DeWine had said earlier Monday that state officials could not unilaterally change the date of a primary and recommended extending absentee voting until the June make-up date.""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at a unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,” DeWine said in a statement late Monday night. “As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.""Polls were due to open in Ohio at 6:30 on Tuesday morning.Online court records in Franklin County, Ohio, where Monday’s lawsuit was filed, showed an appeal to the judge’s ruling had been filed, with LaRose listed as a respondent.It was not clear late Monday what would happen to early votes already cast or if the state would tabulate any results Tuesday.","Ohio’s Governor Says Primary Polls Will Be Closed Tuesday Because Of The Coronavirus

"     Rudy Giuliani stepped out of his apartment on Sunday night and, like he does most Sundays, walked into Nicola’s Restaurant on the Upper East Side.“That place is [usually] packed on a Sunday night — packed, packed, packed,” he said. “When I walked in, I was the first one there — I got the best table in the house.” He had dinner, some drinks. “By the time I left there was no more than 10 people.”Giuliani gets the freakout over the coronavirus pandemic, but he doesn’t really get it. He wants people to wash their hands and drink lots of water and cough into their elbows, but these empty flights? Eating dinner at home? Canceling playdates? What is this, a war?“When I walked down my city yesterday and I saw her empty, I said, this is out of a movie. Like Mars has invaded, or — it reminded me of the man in the closet, that HBO thing.” (He probably meant Man in the High Castle, that Amazon thing.) “I mean, I was looking for the Nazis coming down the street. I mean, it's a little too much.”In fact, the city he was once mayor of has been far from empty, and many, like Giuliani, went out to dinner and bars and cafés over the weekend despite the urging of public health professionals. That is set to change on Tuesday, after Bill de Blasio, the current mayor, ordered all restaurants to switch to delivery or takeout only as New York implements a series of measures to try to keep people at home.Giuliani doesn’t know what he’s going to do. “One of my good friends pointed out to me I could starve to death because I don't know how to cook,” he said. “Could you put out an advertisement for a cook — for a nice man, eats reasonably, not picky?” Surely he could make...something. “I've been trying to learn — I'm a couple of days behind. Some guy was gonna show me how to make pasta. I could probably do it by instinct.”At 75, Giuliani is in the range of people for which the coronavirus could be very serious if caught. But, reached by phone on Monday, he said he was feeling fine and was in an unusually chipper mood.The president’s personal lawyer has faded from the headlines (and, mainly, into a podcast studio) after months of shouting — on Fox, into the ear of any journalist who would listen — about his conspiracy theory connecting Joe Biden to corruption in Ukraine, an elaborate plot against the president’s presumptive rival for the election in November that prompted an impeachment trial that engulfed Washington and now feels several light-years away.But now is the time of the coronavirus, and everything is upside down. We live in a world where Sen. Ted Cruz, a staunch Republican, is praising Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for giving “good advice” on how to behave in these uncertain times. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, is praising Trump for some of his handling of the crisis, and is in turn getting praised by right-wing personalities like Tomi Lahren. Those who were once enemies, are now — at least temporarily — partners. What is a yeller like Giuliani to do?Jump on the bipartisan train of kindness. In the course of our 20-minute conversation, Giuliani offered — with no prompting — defenses of Biden, Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer.He didn’t get why people were teasing Biden for coughing into his hand during the Democratic debate on Sunday night (coughing into your elbow is not “the way we were taught” and “I probably would’ve done the same thing”). For some reason he brought up Obama, and said he was once unjustly criticized for underestimating the deaths in a war zone (the military was to blame because they were “sucking his you-know-what”). Pelosi and Schumer, he said, “got a little political, but they backed off it right away.”He didn’t even have harsh words for de Blasio, who drew the ire of the city and much of the internet after he was caught distinctly not socially distancing himself by attending his favorite gym on Monday morning. “Look, you know I'm a reflexive critic of de Blasio,” Giuliani said. “I empathize with the position the mayor is in, and the governor and the president. After all, these people did not invent this virus.”What the actual hell is going on?Lest you think the whole world truly has gone topsy-turvy, rest assured that Giuliani borders on coronavirus truther, questioning whether it really is that different from the flu. He worries that canceling playdates will turn children into “a bunch of social invalids” and compares the harsh measures being implemented by federal and local governments to if he had decided to crack down on crime by “locking everybody up.”He thinks that, come November, when the president is up for reelection, everyone will have forgotten about the coronavirus, as if the economic fallout is not something the country, and the world, will be grappling to recover from for a still-unknown period of time, even if the pandemic subsides by then (which is no certainty).“I don't think it'll be tough for his reelection because I think it's going to be over with by June or July, by nature of science,” he said, relying on theories that COVID-19 could be seasonal, which remains unknown. “By mid-July, given the human memory, you're not gonna remember it. The only people remembered West Nile in the off-season was me and my Department of Health.”“The minute that people don't have the illness, they go back to watching the basketball games,” he said. “And by the time we get to September and October, the Yankees are five games ahead. I'm not gonna be thinking about the coronavirus.”Giuliani, who toyed with the idea of extending his term and delaying New York City’s mayoral election in the wake of Sept. 11, said it was too soon for Trump to consider something similar. “Oh, no, no. It's way too early on the general election, way too early…. By July, this is going to look very different than right now.”Giuliani said he had talked to Trump in recent days, and that the president didn’t sound more stressed than usual. “I have to tell you about Donald J. Trump — he is never overwhelmed.”Giuliani said Trump asked for what he learned from dealing with the West Nile Virus outbreak in New York, and the anthrax attacks in the wake of 9/11. “I told him my first bit of advice on emergency management, which I learned from reading Winston Churchill,” Giuliani said. “Tell people all the facts, tell them the unvarnished truth, even scare them if you have to, but never leave them that way, always find a way to give them hope in the end.”In his press briefing Sunday night, Trump tried to do something like that, coming out to tell reporters that Americans shouldn’t worry about running out of groceries, and then skipping out to “make some calls.” On Monday, he stayed longer, and told Americans to avoid being in groups of more than 10 people, while admitting, in response to a question, that the virus was not under control.

"     Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said the state’s Tuesday primary cannot meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for preventing community spread of the coronavirus and is recommending postponing the vote until June 2 while continuing to accept absentee ballots by mail in the interim.At an afternoon press conference, DeWine talked of a tough decision, made in consultation with other officeholders and voters calling with concerns about plans to go through with the primary as scheduled.“We should not force them to make this choice,” DeWine said of senior citizens, pregnant voters, and others worried about their health. “The choice between their health and their constitutional rights and their duties as American citizens. Further, we should not be in a situation where the votes of these individuals who are conflicted are suppressed.”Technically, DeWine cannot cancel or postpone the election himself. A third-party lawsuit will be filed Monday in Franklin County, home of Columbus, the state capital. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, the state’s chief elections administrator, appeared at the press conference and said the state would not contest the lawsuit and submit to the court the recommendations DeWine outlined.The situation was still in flux Monday night: a judge rejected the attempt to delay the election. It was not immediately clear if the plaintiffs — independent of the state government but operating with their public blessing — would appeal.DeWine and LaRose issued a joint statement late Monday that made no explicit order or any clear indication of their next moves, though they reiterated their belief that a primary cannot be held Tuesday.""The only thing more important than a free and fair election is the health and safety of Ohioans,"" DeWine and LaRose said in the statement. ""The Ohio Department of Health and the CDC have advised against anyone gathering in groups larger than 50 people, which will occur if the election goes forward. Additionally, Ohioans over 65 and those with certain health conditions have been advised to limit their nonessential contact with others, affecting their ability to vote or serve as poll workers. Logistically, under these extraordinary circumstances, it simply isn’t possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by Ohioans. They mustn’t be forced to choose between their health and exercising their constitutional rights.""The circumstances around Tuesday's primaries have shifted rapidly in just the last three days. On Friday, as some states with primaries later in March or April began to move toward delaying their elections, state officials from Ohio, Arizona, Illinois, and Florida said in a joint statement that they intended to stay on track.""Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,"" they said.But in the days since then, states across the country, including Ohio and Illinois, have virtually shut down to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Some states scheduled to vote Tuesday, including Ohio, have also reportedly had trouble recruiting poll workers. And on Sunday, the CDC recommended that public gatherings of more than 50 people in the next two months be canceled or delayed. Polling centers often have at least that many people in one location at a given time.“We understand the apprehension that voters have right now,"" Katie Hobbs, the secretary of state in Arizona, another state with a Tuesday primary, said in a statement late Monday. ""I have been in consultation with election officials across the state, health experts and leaders from the Democratic Party who agree that the election should move forward tomorrow.""“This decision was not made lightly, and what it all comes down to is that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future, and elections do not end on Election Day,"" Hobbs added. ""There are thousands of workers in communities across the state that must continue the job of counting the ballots in the days following the election. The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous it could become.""Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee, meanwhile, said early Monday night that the state's primary would go forward as planned.      Bernie Sanders, after Sunday's debate with Joe Biden, suggested in a CNN interview it may be prudent for Tuesday's primaries to be delayed. He pointed to the New York City Democratic primary for mayor and other local offices that was stopped while underway on Sept. 11, 2001, and then rescheduled for one month later.David Pepper, the chair of the Ohio Democratic Party, prefaced a Sunday night post to his social media accounts with praise for DeWine and LaRose — both are Republican officeholders whom Pepper has worked to defeat in the past — before proposing an extension to the vote-by-mail period.""Things are moving so fast,"" Pepper wrote. ""Thousands of people who had no reason to request an absentee ballot even days ago might now desperately want one. They are seeing restaurants and bars close. They are seeing schools close. They are scared. They are vulnerable. They suddenly have three kids at home.""They may have caught a cold, or worse, and are being rightfully told to stay in, and they want to be responsible and do so. But they still want to vote.""The state party on Monday issued a statement from Pepper, who said he had heard from the governor and the state's health director, Dr. Amy Acton, before their press conference.""In deference to their expertise on this critical health crisis, I support that decision regarding in-person voting tomorrow,"" Pepper said.“Extending an election is an unprecedented step, so we as a party are weighing alternatives on how to best do so — including the possibility to conduct the primary election entirely by vote-by-mail, as is done in several other states, with a deadline much earlier than June 2,"" he added. ""This could better serve the interests of Ohio voters and the primary process that is already well underway, and we will consider offering those alternatives to the court once the case is filed.”      ","Ohio's Governor Recommended His State Move Tuesday's Presidential Primary Because Of The Coronavirus

"           WASHINGTON — The coronavirus pandemic is worsening across the United States, with some states limiting bars and restaurants to carry-out only and forcing gyms and other businesses to close.Early Saturday morning, the House passed legislation to enact paid sick leave for some people affected by the coronavirus, increase food assistance to students and families, and provide free testing for the disease.“It's about putting families first,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last Thursday at her weekly press conference.But it’s also an opportunity, congressional progressives have said, to prove that their policies work at a time when they’re consistently under attack for being too expensive or unrealistic.“I really think that our push for Medicare for All is being highlighted — or the need for a system like that is being highlighted — right now with this,” Congressional Progressive Caucus cochair Rep. Pramila Jayapal said in an interview with BuzzFeed News Thursday. “You can see we're having to waive costs of tests … we're waiving the costs of other barriers that would prevent people from seeking medical care. And all of you know, a lot of those things would be a) so much easier and b) wouldn't be an issue if we have Medicare for All.”Jayapal’s home state of Washington has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus. The state had 769 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and 42 deaths, according to the most recent data from Johns Hopkins University researchers.      There’s a lot we still don’t know about the coronavirus outbreak. Our newsletter, Outbreak Today, will do its best to put everything we do know in one place — you can sign up here. Do you have questions you want answered? You can always get in touch. And if you're someone who is seeing the impact of this firsthand, we’d also love to hear from you (you can reach out to us via one of our tip line channels).      As of last Thursday, about a dozen people in nursing homes in the state had tested positive, including one person in Jayapal’s own district, she said, a development that’s highly concerning due to the fact that older people are at the most risk should they contract the disease.The coronavirus response package that passed the House requires some employers to provide full-time employees with up to 10 days of paid leave. Jayapal said she believes it could be a rare test run for progressive policies.“We are clairvoyant,” Jayapal said, referring to the inclusion of many progressive policies in the Democratic response to coronavirus. It’s not only an opportunity to prove their priorities will work, she said, but also “that they are necessary for the rest of the economy to survive.”“A lot of times what happens is, you know, these things get pitted against some other cost,” she said. “They're said to be too expensive or impractical or not necessary. And what a crisis like this shows — in a time like this shows — is that they are actually all of those things. They're practical, they're necessary, and we can afford them because the cost of not doing them is way more unaffordable.”But it’s not a perfect test for Jayapal. After BuzzFeed News spoke with the Democrat, the bill’s paid sick leave policy was altered to exempt large companies with more than 500 employees.The legislation, which also includes increased food security benefits, is still the subject of intense negotiation on Capitol Hill. It still needs to pass the Senate and President Donald Trump is pushing for a payroll tax cut and federal assistance for the oil and gas industry in response to the pandemic.“Not only is he trying to focus on corporations and, really, corporate interests, but also doing things that are illogical, like trying to bail out [the] oil industry that you know are completely unrelated ” Rep. Mark Pocan, who serves as Jayapal’s cochair on the Progressive Caucus, said in an interview with BuzzFeed News Thursday.Trump’s bailout plan is similar to the response to the 2008 financial crisis, Pocan said, and he thinks it’s misguided.“We gave money to Wall Street, we gave money to the auto industry, we gave it to big companies or big industries,” he said. “This time, Nancy [Pelosi] has been very, very clear that this is something that's family-focused first.”Republicans on Capitol Hill have balked at Trump’s payroll tax cut proposal, and though they have resisted House Democrats’ plan, Jayapal said Thursday she believed it was possible to pick up some Republican votes on the package, particularly because the proposals are temporary and tied to the virus.“I've never believed that these ideas are partisan. I believe that they would bring enormous comfort to and support to everybody across the country, whether you're in a red district or a blue district,” she said — especially, now, she added, “because the cost is death.”Earlier Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the Democrats’ proposal “as currently drafted” was dead on arrival in the Senate and merely “left-wing political messaging.” But Friday afternoon, House Democrats and the White House struck a deal, which passed the House last week and is set to pass the Senate early this week.","Medicare For All And Paid Sick Leave Are Often Dismissed As Impractical.

"     WASHINGTON — As the coronavirus pandemic continues to hit the US, people nationwide are being encouraged to stay inside their homes, and states and cities are beginning to close restaurants, bars, and other businesses.Utah Sen. Mitt Romney has a plan he thinks can help: Give every adult in the US $1,000.“Every American adult should immediately receive $1,000 to help ensure families and workers can meet their short-term obligations and increase spending in the economy,” a press release from Romney said Monday. “Congress took similar action during the 2001 and 2008 recessions. While expansions of paid leave, unemployment insurance, and SNAP benefits [the program formally known as food stamps] are crucial, the check will help fill the gaps for Americans that may not quickly navigate different government options.”The proposal to give every adult $1,000 is one of several put forth by Romney to try and address the pandemic — and was central to entrepreneur Andrew Yang’s Democratic presidential campaign.Yang, who qualified for several debates before exiting the race last month, ran a campaign almost entirely focused on a universal basic income proposal that would give every American adult $1,000 per month.Early Monday morning, ahead of the release of Romney’s proposal, Yang tweeted, “Putting money into people’s hands is the obvious thing to do in this situation. I hope Congress wakes up to this before it’s too late. Every day is enormous at this point.”Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, another Democrat running for president, has also called for all Americans to receive $1,000 per month for the remainder of the coronavirus crisis.The House passed a bipartisan emergency coronavirus spending bill last week. The bill requires paid leave for some workers — though large companies of more than 500 employees are exempted — and provides increased nutrition benefits as well as free testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The package is supported by the White House and still needs to pass the Senate.“We also urgently need to build on this legislation with additional action to help families and small businesses meet their short-term financial obligations, ease the financial burden on students entering the workforce, and protect health workers on the front lines and their patients by improving telehealth services,” Romney said in the statement from his office Monday. “I will be pushing these measures as Senate discussions continue about an additional relief package.”In addition to the $1,000 checks, Romney is also proposing grants for small businesses, including “unexpected costs due to COVID-19” as part of the consideration for how much money students receive from Pell Grants, deferring loan repayment for students impacted by the disease, and requiring all insurers to temporarily cover telehealth visits.","Mitt Romney Wants The Government To Give Every American Adult $1,000 During The Coronavirus Outbreak

"     Joe Biden said that he would choose a woman as his running mate during Sunday’s Democratic presidential debate.Bernie Sanders, the only other candidate on stage with Biden, also told the moderators that he would “in all likelihood” choose a woman to be his vice president if he won the nomination. He added that his thought process behind the decision was not “just nominating a woman” but pushing a progressive woman, and that there are progressive women that could receive the nomination. “My very strong tendencies is to move in that direction,” Sanders said.“If I'm elected president, my cabinet, my administration will look like the country and I commit that I will, in fact, appoint a, pick a woman to be vice president,” Biden told the debate moderators. “There are a number of women qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president.”Biden has previously floated the possibility of nominating a woman to be vice president but had not fully committed to the idea until Sunday night.“It’s something he thought about a lot recently and he decided he wanted to make a big commitment on a big stage,"" Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders told reporters on a call after the debate.In the past, Biden has floated four specific women who he might select: New Hampshire Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, former acting attorney general Sally Yates, and former Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia Stacey Abrams. Biden has also received endorsements from two former presidential candidates, Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris, whose supporters have called for his campaign to pick them to be on his ticket.Later on the post-debate call, which included other Biden campaign officials, a reporter asked specifically about Abrams, who’s often mentioned as a vice presidential prospect and was among those House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn — a Biden supporter — suggested in an interview with Axios.“There are a number of women who would be great in that position, and he is committed to picking one,” Rep. Cedric Richmond, a cochair of Biden’s campaign, responded on the call. “I don’t think it would be appropriate to say who he’s talked to or not talked to.”Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang tweeted that when he’d spoken with Biden that he hadn’t brought up that he was committing to picking a woman as vice president.

"     CLEVELAND, Ohio — Before she joined Bernie Sanders’ revolution, Nina Turner wanted to lead her own in Ohio.Once on a trajectory to be the next mayor of Cleveland, Turner instead challenged the status quo. She fought for local government reforms that ended an era of corruption but also enraged leaders in the local black political establishment. And then she threatened to primary Rep. Marcia Fudge, who owed her seat in Congress, at least in part, to those leaders.This rivalry between Fudge and Turner, now going on a decade, is an insider vs. outsider story that helps explain Democratic campaigns in the most Democratic part of Ohio — and in the county that provides the largest share of the state’s black vote. It’s also instructive as the presidential race shifts here this week amid bleak prospects for Sanders. Fudge and most of the other insiders are backing former vice president Joe Biden. Turner, a Sanders campaign cochair and one of his most visible allies, is again pushing from the outside.“I always find myself doing the hardest work, doing the most life-altering work, not going with the status quo,” Turner said in an interview last week, the morning after Biden beat Sanders soundly in several big primaries, including Michigan’s. “When you take on the hardest assignments, you know the difficulty is there. I don’t run from that. I have a history in this state of being an independent thinker and doing what I believe is right, even if the political headwinds are against me. And I’m going to continue to do that as long as I have the breath to do it.”There’s been little reliable polling in Ohio since the field narrowed to Biden and Sanders. But the state’s demographics (a sizable black vote in the three largest cities, a big working-class population, and plenty of moderate suburbanites) reflect the type of voter coalition Biden has built elsewhere. Biden’s endorsement list in the state features some of the party’s most reputable organizers and vote-getters, including Rep. Marcy Kaptur, the longest-serving woman in the House — and a Sanders supporter in 2016.Fudge, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, initially endorsed Kamala Harris, before she ended her presidential campaign in December. She came to Biden late, after his victory in the South Carolina primary revived his candidacy, and as other mainstream Democrats lined up behind him. In a statement the campaign circulated to announce her support, Fudge praised Biden’s commitment to civil and voting rights. “But above all,” she said, “I believe in winning — because that’s where all paths forward to every other big thing we want to do start.”In an interview last week, Fudge said she’s known Biden for years, though they are not close. “I thought Joe Biden was the fit for the district,” Fudge explained, “and for me, personally.”The district is the only one in Ohio where most of the constituents are black. The seat itself is the legacy of Louis Stokes, who became Ohio’s first black member of Congress after winning a racial gerrymandering case in the late 1960s. When he retired in 1993, the seat went to Stephanie Tubbs Jones, who like Stokes was one of the most influential Cleveland politicos of her generation. When Tubbs Jones died suddenly in 2008, party leaders helped elevate Fudge, who had been Tubbs Jones’ chief of staff, as her successor.      Fudge started off quiet and deferential to her elders — very much unlike the vivacious Tubbs Jones. Through attrition, she grew into at least some of the influence that comes with her job. Stokes and others who maintained a long-lasting grip in the black wards and precincts either died or backed away from public life in recent years. Frank Jackson, now in his fourth term as mayor of Cleveland, doesn’t much care for state or national politics.Fudge’s loyalty sometimes costs her, as it did when she vouched for the character of former judge Lance Mason after he pleaded guilty to charges he assaulted his wife. (“Lance accepts full responsibility for his actions and has assured me that something like this will never happen again,” Fudge wrote in a supportive letter that became public in 2018, after Mason killed his then ex-wife, and just as Fudge was considering a run for speaker of the House.)And Fudge’s candidates don’t always win. Her endorsement doesn’t carry the same weight as, say, Jim Clyburn’s did in South Carolina last month after he backed Biden, setting in motion Biden’s big victory there. She “seems popular with voters,” longtime Cleveland political writer Brent Larkin observed recently, “but has yet to demonstrate that unique ability to transfer that popularity.” Even so, Fudge’s hand is often felt in local politics, including at the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, chaired by a Fudge protégé.“Marcia’s reach to elected leaders and political leaders is significant in Northeast Ohio,” Dean DePiero, a former mayor of the large Cleveland suburb of Parma and a well-wired Democrat in the state, said when asked about her Biden endorsement. After first endorsing Michael Bloomberg, DePiero now supports the former vice president.“She understands Ohio well — that it’s maybe a center-right state,” DePiero added.As Fudge settled into Congress in 2009, Turner, then a state senator, joined with a cast of predominantly white leaders in Cleveland’s progressive circles to overhaul the Cuyahoga County government. The party chair at the time, also a county commissioner, was at the center of a federal corruption investigation that resulted in dozens of convictions. Turner’s group favored replacing the three elected commissioners, and a row of other elected officeholders staffed by patronage hires, with an elected executive, an 11-member county council, and appointed administrators. Nearly every other black leader, including Fudge, opposed the ballot initiative, fearful it would rewind the progress black candidates had made winning countywide office.Cleveland’s black newspaper, owned by boxing promoter Don King and at the time largely under the editorial control of a prominent powerbroker in the black community, depicted Turner in a front-page cartoon as Aunt Jemima — an image meant to brand her as subservient to white authority.Still, Turner’s side won, and she subsequently was mentioned as a future mayor or a top prospect for the new county executive position. Instead, she began preparing to take on Fudge.Turner pulled petitions for the primary and, sounding a lot like the presidential candidate she would eventually work for, said she saw an “opportunity to represent a constituency that feels they have been disillusioned.” But, much like how moderate and establishment Democrats rallied around Biden in recent weeks to keep the democratic socialist Sanders at bay, many of Greater Cleveland’s top black activists closed rank around Fudge, culminating with an endorsement event headlined by Stokes. Turner withdrew her candidacy a few weeks later.She stayed active in progressive causes and became a minor MSNBC celebrity, back in the days of The Ed Show. She ran for Ohio secretary of state in 2014, losing badly in a year when a weak gubernatorial candidate dragged down the entire Democratic ticket. And then, after being an early booster for Hillary Clinton, Turner abruptly joined Sanders’ 2016 campaign. She quickly became one of the Vermont senator’s top surrogates.      Soon Fudge and Turner would collide again. After leaked emails showed Democratic National Committee officials mocking Sanders during the 2016 primaries, Fudge was pressed into a high-profile gig presiding over the convention that nominated Clinton. Turner joined with protesters sympathetic to Sanders, including actor Susan Sarandon, after plans for Turner to address the convention fell apart. A few days later, she openly considered an invitation to be the Green Party’s candidate for vice president.Both women downplay their rivalry. “That was something the media wanted to drive,” said Fudge, who believes Turner “brings great value” to Sanders’ campaign. “We don't always have to agree,” a similarly diplomatic Turner offered. “I think we have a healthy respect for one another. Oftentimes we find ourselves in disagreements politically, and that’s OK.”More recently they have been on opposite sides of other Ohio races. In 2018, Fudge endorsed Richard Cordray in the Democratic primary for governor. Our Revolution, the pro-Sanders political organization that Turner led at the time, backed Dennis Kucinich. Cordray won handily, with a big showing in Cuyahoga County. (Biden endorsed him after the primary.) But Fudge’s support was of little help in a state senate race, where the former Cleveland city council member she backed lost in a primary. And a Turner protégé — her handpicked successor on the city council — lost his reelection bid in 2017.These mixed results show that neither has a local political network likely to sway Tuesday’s race to Biden or Sanders, though Fudge at least has an operation that’s been in recent use. She said she has loaned her political consultant, Kenn Dowell, to the Biden campaign and has signaled for other allies to help the effort however they can. Fudge also cut a minutelong radio spot for Biden’s Ohio campaign.“We had a meeting yesterday, and within 24 hours of [Fudge’s] support, 50 elected officials and grassroots organizers came out to put the wheels in motion,” Blaine Griffin, a Cleveland city council member and pledged Biden delegate, told BuzzFeed News two days after Fudge endorsed Biden.      Griffin also admires Turner. “You won’t hear any of us say anything bad about Nina,” he said. “That’s our hometown lady. But I will tell you that Nina has not been on the ground the last few years, and the dynamics on the ground here have changed dramatically. She won’t bring the same kind of clout that Fudge does.”Turner acknowledged as much.“Well, that’s certainly my hope,” she replied when asked if her connection to Ohio would be an advantage to Sanders. “This is home, no doubt, but I’ve really been on the road a lot.”Turner said Sanders’ Ohio team from 2016 — an operation she helped assemble — remains mostly intact, though she was reluctant to take credit for it. Tara Mosley-Samples, a Sanders ally and member of Akron’s city council, noted the more than 1 million votes Turner won in her secretary of state race six years ago.“I think Nina brings a lot to the table for the state and especially for Cuyahoga County,” said Mosley-Samples, who was Kucinich’s running mate in 2018. “I think what she has been able to do, not only for the Sanders campaign but also for the city of Cleveland will show up in the numbers greatly.”But Mosley-Samples also conceded Biden’s lead in big-name Ohio endorsements. “It seems like we’re bucking up against the machine.”So Turner draws inspiration from her past fights in the state, especially the county government overhaul that passed in spite of its many powerful opponents.“All of the forces were against us and certainly mounted against me,” Turner said. “But ultimately the people rejected that and had a different idea.”“The headwinds are strong, no doubt about it,” she said of the Sanders campaign, before wryly reaching for a rallying cry for Elizabeth Warren, the former presidential candidate who competed for similarly progressive voters but has not thrown her support to Sanders.“Nevertheless we persist.”","How Nina Turner’s Ohio Rivalries Foreshadowed Her Future With Bernie Sanders

Biden’s wife, Dr. Jill Biden, was a teacher both in public high schools and community college.“Biden has championed public education throughout this campaign and beyond. He and Dr. Jill Biden, herself an educator and NEA member, have consistently reached out to NEA members across the country building the broad support among NEA members,” Eskelsen García said. “He attended all three of NEA’s presidential forums, including in Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Texas, as well as sat for a video interview to make his case to educators.”The NEA has over 3 million members, more than 75% of whom are college-educated women — a group of voters that both parties will be vying to win over in the general election — making them the largest union in the country as well as one of the most influential.The union’s leadership voted to endorse Biden on Saturday.The leadership of several larger national unions including the second-largest teachers’ union, the American Federation of Teachers, have avoided making endorsements on behalf of their members this cycle, after rank-and-file members took issue with leadership-level decisions to back Hillary Clinton in 2016. Various local affiliates have backed Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who recently dropped out of the race.In January, Nevada’s largest teachers’ union, the Clark County Education Association, endorsed Sanders, and the United Teachers Los Angeles endorsed Sanders last November.While the AFT has not made an official endorsement, the union leadership has said that after a process including members surveys and polls, they encourage affiliates, members and leadership to “to be actively involved in supporting and helping Vice President Biden, Sen. Sanders, and/or Sen. Warren.”The AFT’s president, Randi Weingarten, individually endorsed Sen.

"     WASHINGTON — When Washington state emerged as the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, Sen. Patty Murray was already pushing President Donald Trump and the administration to act. Now that her home state’s death toll has reached 37 with more than 1,900 confirmed cases nationwide, Murray is furious that the president didn’t act sooner.Murray, the lead Democrat on the Senate’s Health Committee, first called on Trump’s administration to intervene as early as January and told BuzzFeed News Friday that the administration was largely unresponsive leading up to the death of a Washington resident, the first person to die in the US, two weeks ago.“Look, from day one, when we started seeing this grow and develop in China and continue to grow rapidly and expansively, all of us should have been aware that issues like a virus don’t stay in one place. That we are a global community, people travel. ... Instead, the reaction from the federal government or from the person in the White House, in particular, was ‘no worries, be happy,’” Murray told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview on Friday. “And I am so angry and frustrated at that.”      There’s a lot we still don’t know about the coronavirus outbreak.

And if you're someone who is seeing the impact of this firsthand, we’d also love to hear from you (you can reach out to us via one of our tip line channels).      On Feb. 15, Murray and 25 other senators sent a letter to Trump pushing him to request emergency funding to combat the novel coronavirus. By Feb. 24, Trump asked Congress for $2.5 billion, a figure Democrats said wasn’t enough. Four days later, Trump called coronavirus Democrats’ “new hoax.” A few days later, he told people at a town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania, that the US “got hit with the virus really three weeks ago” — this after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had declared the first confirmed coronavirus case in the country more than six weeks earlier.“It seems to me, from day one, the message from the top [of] this administration has been to downplay it,” Murray said. “I don’t believe in panicking people, but I believe that our response as a country has to be ... a sense of urgency,” she added.Murray said other members of Trump’s administration were equally unresponsive. Earlier this month, Murray and nine other senators sent a letter to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos asking how her department is coordinating with public health officials as it relates to coronavirus preparedness.“My own granddaughter’s school at that point had been closed for a week,” Murray told BuzzFeed News. “I saw specifically what they were dealing with in terms of making sure that kids get access to material, that nutritious lunches were being provided for kids whose only meal, every day, was in the school — kids who were sick themselves.”The letter went unanswered as schools across the nation have begun to close in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a former presidential candidate whom Trump called “a snake” during a news conference, announced statewide school closures on Friday and he has banned public gatherings of more than 250 people.Globally, more than 140,000 have contracted the disease with 1,998 in the US, as of Friday evening, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There have been 43 deaths in the US with 37 of them coming from Washington state. Twenty-five of those deaths were linked to the Life Care Center, a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington.Murray is one of several lawmakers who has expressed concerns about access to coronavirus testing, particularly after a briefing from administration officials on Capitol Hill left members furious with the lack of information on the issue.Murray said that after she made numerous calls to administration officials and held a hearing asking when testing would be available, health officials told senators during the closed-door briefing: “‘No, we can’t tell you when.”“I am still talking to families every day who are being told ‘we don’t have the test,’” Murray said. “The message, consistently to everybody is, if you are sick, stay home.”","A Senator From The State Hit Hardest By The Coronavirus Is “So Angry And Frustrated” With Trump For Not Responding Sooner

Mike DeWine to postpone the primary until June 2.DeWine had said earlier Monday that state officials could not unilaterally change the date of a primary and recommended extending absentee voting until the June makeup date.""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at a unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,” DeWine said in a statement late Monday night. “As such, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.""Polls were due to open in Ohio at 6:30 on Tuesday morning.Online court records in Franklin County, Ohio, where Monday’s lawsuit was filed, showed an appeal to the judge’s ruling had been filed, with LaRose listed as a respondent.It was not clear late Monday what would happen to early votes already cast or if the state would tabulate any results Tuesday.","Ohio’s Governor Said Primary Polls Will Be Closed Tuesday Because Of The Coronavirus

"     Voters and poll workers reported chaos, nonfunctional polling places, unsanitary conditions, and low turnout across the state of Illinois on Tuesday as the primary election continued despite the coronavirus outbreak.After the state scrambled to move polling places away from nursing homes and other vulnerable populations, some voters said they were unable to vote because their new polling places lacked basic voting supplies.With scores of election judges and volunteers dropping out at the last minute in the face of the outbreak, the city of Chicago was asking “able bodied voters” to act as last-minute poll workers as a way to deal with understaffed polling locations, according to an email viewed by BuzzFeed News. The Cook County Clerk’s Office posted that it was “waving all training requirements” for applicants who wanted to serve as election judges.“This was a very rushed process, and our local election officials are trying to handle it the best way that they can,” said Matt Dietrich, a spokesperson for the Illinois State Board of Elections. He said local areas had been “doing everything they possibly could” to provide cleaning supplies to polling locations.“Everyone needs to keep in mind that this is an unprecedented situation,” he added.Some election workers who did show up, meanwhile, said they felt unsafe because of a lack of sanitary supplies. Some precincts had zero hand sanitizer, voters said, or only a few bottles that had been brought in by poll workers themselves.Rebecca Gross, 16, a high school student who is staffing one of two precincts being served by a polling place at the Broadway United Methodist Church in Chicago, said Tuesday morning that her precinct had still not received the ""blue box"" full of election materials necessary to conduct voting, as of late morning. They had turned away roughly 70 voters so far Tuesday, Gross estimated.Gross said she and others working at the precinct had been told the materials would be on their way around 7 a.m., but they still hadn't arrived, and that staff had now been told it might not come at all. She said she and the other workers had called the Chicago Board of Elections ""countless times"" in an effort to get the box. They have begun redirecting voters to an early-voting location in their ward.      An election judge in central Groveland, Illinois, who did not want their name used said that after consolidating three polling places into one, their location had no hand sanitizer, and their only cleaning supplies were those brought in by other poll workers.“Everyone else is older, and it’s upsetting to think that I could spread the virus to them,” the election judge said. “There are not enough cleaning supplies and we were given no instruction on what and how often we should be cleaning.”Kyle Mauerman, a voter in Washington, Illinois, near Peoria, said he was “shocked” to find that his polling place had not a single bottle of hand sanitizer and no warnings about social distancing posted where he could see them. Most of the poll workers were elderly, Mauerman said.“Seemed like that should be the place we are reinforcing the social distancing message and proper hygiene to combat this virus,” Mauerman said.Matt Lindner, who works in marketing in Lincoln Park, in Chicago, said he had turned up to vote at 8 a.m. at a precinct whose location had been moved away from a senior citizens’ home. But he was turned away because the location lacked voting equipment.“It was absolutely the right call” to move the polling location, Lindner said. But he didn’t understand why the state had not prepared better, especially when it came to providing equipment.“A functioning democracy should not have this,” he said.Toya H., the coordinator at Lindner’s polling place in Lincoln Park, confirmed she had to turn away voters because she had no equipment.“Voters are very upset,” she said. She’d started sending them to a different polling place, only for that location to run out of provisional ballots. By late morning, she was forced to redirect people to a polling place more than a mile away.“The number I’ve been dialing isn’t even ringing,” Toya said. “I’ve worked the elections for over 10 years and I have never experienced anything like this.”Primaries are also underway Tuesday in Florida and Arizona. In Ohio, the governor has shuttered polling locations under a ""health emergency,"" amid a court fight over his attempt to delay the scheduled primary.","The Coronavirus Outbreak Has Made Voting In Illinois Today A Full Mess

"     WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has awarded dozens of government contracts to businesses in recent weeks in an effort to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus and show how the federal government is planning to spend millions of dollars to respond to the growing crisis.The recent flurry of contracts, some awarded without an open competition, reflect the urgency with which the US government is attempting to contain the coronavirus outbreak, which the World Health Organization recently declared a pandemic. COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has already killed more than 3,100 people in China. Congress has approved an $8.3 billion emergency spending package to help agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fight the spread of the virus, and President Donald Trump declared a national state of emergency to free up billions more in funding.Between the start of this year and Monday, the Department of Health and Human Services has issued $5.8 million in contracts mentioning the term “coronavirus” — more than all of 2019 combined. (Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that have been around for years; the novel coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, in 2019 is the current strain.) When the term “COVID-19” is added, the total hits $7.3 million. Government-wide spending mentioning just “coronavirus” sits at $7.5 million — higher than any of the 10 preceding years.      Government departments and agencies are making plans to buy everything from cleaning wipes to respirator masks, and the total number and value of the contracts will undoubtedly increase in the weeks ahead as the number of cases increases. The figure also leaves out many contracts connected to the outbreak that don’t explicitly mention the coronavirus in their description.Earlier this month, FEMA said that due to the “significant increase of the COVID-19 virus,” it was looking for disinfecting wipes and sprayers, as well as “the ability to immediately deploy personnel to provide and administer disinfectant cleaning services” for FEMA facilities in Oregon, Alaska, Idaho, and Washington state, which has been home to a recent coronavirus outbreak.“The contract is currently being competed and we can’t comment on contracts being competed,” a FEMA spokesperson said.The government is also looking to purchase masks to deal with the outbreak. Last week, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it was paying a Florida-based company $338,234 for special air purifying masks as part of the “COVID-19 response.” Neither Veterans Affairs nor the company, Native Instinct, returned a request for comment.      Veterans Affairs has awarded Native Instinct more than $519,000 in other contracts since the outbreak began for more breathing equipment and an “emergency diesel generator w/ trailer,” among other things, but it’s uncertain if the items are connected to the coronavirus response.The Treasury Department’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service also said last week that it was spending $13,878 on a “bulk order” of 3M-brand “respirator masks.” The name of the contractor was not provided. The Fiscal Service did not answer questions about whether the masks were connected to the coronavirus response.The urgent spending presents a possible windfall for contractors who land deals to provide the government the goods and services it needs to quickly handle an outbreak that threatens to kill scores of Americans. But urgency, especially if combined with understaffing or lack of experience, can also lead to poorly sourced or written contracts, as evidenced during past national crises.“Unfortunately there are lots of examples of waste, fraud, and corruption when the government spends money quickly,” said Sean Moulton, a senior policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight who specializes in government spending. “But the problems that lead to poor spending decisions in emergency situations have been around for years — poor planning and preparation, inadequate competition, and minimal accountability and transparency. We issued a report after Hurricane Katrina (almost 14 years ago) detailing these problems that is still directly relevant today. We haven't adequately addressed these shortcomings for hurricane response spending much less for other emergencies.”“Obviously in disaster situations the urgency of need necessitates a fast contracting process,” Moulton said. “That is why we have continually encouraged Uncle Sam to fully review and vet disaster response contractors ahead of time and have contracts and rates in place for goods and services. Such steps, plus including contract provisions for additional oversight and accountability of performance and billing, will ensure that taxpayers are not being gouged by profiteers.”      There’s a lot we still don’t know about the coronavirus outbreak. Our newsletter, Outbreak Today, will do its best to put everything we do know in one place — you can sign up here. Do you have questions you want answered? You can always get in touch. And if you're someone who is seeing the impact of this firsthand, we’d also love to hear from you (you can reach out to us via one of our tip line channels).      One of the contractors hired to help respond to the coronavirus outbreak has experience with a poorly written contract. Bruce Wagner, whose company Rapid Deployment has received more than $26 million in contracts from HHS since early January, runs a second company whose deal with FEMA after Katrina came under scrutiny by a government watchdog.FEMA paid that company, Clearbrook, more than $76 million to provide base camps for first responders to live in after the storm ravaged Louisiana in 2005. But later that year, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general said it had “identified several significant problems with the contract and its billings,” and urged FEMA to stop paying Clearbrook until the issues were fixed. The inspector general’s office later issued a review recommending that FEMA disallow $16.4 million in charges that Clearbrook had billed.A lawyer who responded to questions from BuzzFeed News on behalf of Wagner said that Clearbrook is “a separate and distinct company from” Rapid Development and that the issue with the FEMA contract has been resolved.“After a lengthy internal review by the Office of Investigator General, with Clearbrook’s full cooperation, no penalties or charges were levied against Clearb[r]ook and the contract was final billed and paid, with interest, by the contracting agency,” attorney John P. Browning said in an email Thursday.FEMA directed questions about the contract to the Inspector General’s Office, which didn’t respond to a request for comment. HHS did not respond to questions for this story, either.In more than two dozen recent contracts and modifications with Rapid Deployment, the government lists many of the emergency services it has hired the Alabama-based company to provide, including meals, port-a-potties, generators, and more at US quarantine sites. Hundreds of Americans who were possibly exposed to the virus abroad have been repatriated and subject to two-week quarantines at military bases across the country.      The largest single contract awarded to the company so far is valued at $16.2 million and was sole-sourced, according to publicly available documentation. “Any delay in the contract award would have resulted in serious injury to the agency's mission and to the lives of hundreds of citizens/repatriates arriving in the United States, or to individuals within the United States that interacted with the repatriates that may have come into contact with 2019-nCoV,” CDC officials wrote when justifying why an open bidding process wasn’t an option. “The time available to solicit and issue award could easily be measured in hours/days.”At the time, the officials said the “core nature of the services to be provided are commercial in nature — housekeeping and providing food/drinks,” and listed four military bases in California, Texas, and Hawaii as the locations needing the services. The government listed additional military bases in California, Texas, and New Jersey in other contracts awarded to the company.Rapid Deployment — which said it has also done work in “Iraq, Lebanon, Yugoslavia, Nigeria and other countries, conflicts, and disasters” — has been hired to provide everything from janitorial to laundry services at the bases. “All operations and contract performance is being achieved as planned,” Browning said.      The tasks share similarities with Clearbrook’s responsibilities after Katrina, a storm that killed more than 1,000 people and ravaged New Orleans. At the time, the company provided “food and lodging to hurricane Katrina disaster responders at seven base camps throughout Louisiana,” the DHS inspector general said in its first writeup on the contract in November 2005.Over a year later, the Inspector General’s Office published a longer review of the Clearbrook contract. “As a result of FEMA’s haste to establish base camps, and the shortage of trained and experienced contracting officials, the Clearbrook contract was not effectively awarded and administered, leading to contractual deficiencies, excessive billings, and questionable costs of $16.4 million,” the February 2007 report read.The $16.4 million were charges for “staging costs” that the Inspector General’s Office concluded should have been included in the fixed rate for the camps. “There was no evidence that direct costs could be billed separately,” the report said.But nearly three years later, FEMA had yet to recoup the money, according to a local news report. FEMA had responded to the audit in 2008, saying it wouldn’t pursue a claim because most of the billings were supported by documentation, the story said.Wagner’s company is among several helping the US government respond to the coronavirus crisis. In late February, the US Army published a notice announcing its plans to sole-source the purchase of a medical testing device known as the Panther Fusion platform, acknowledging issues with the CDC’s tests for the virus.“The deployment of the U.S. CDC Emergency Use Authorization assay has been plagued by problems with reagents, thus delaying implementation of testing in U.S. civilian and DOD laboratories,” read the notice from late February. It said that as a result, current testing systems were slower and limited in their “ability to scale up to high-volume testing required in the dynamically changing epidemic situation.” The Panther Fusion platform “can be implemented for rapid coronavirus detection,” the notice said, adding that “Gen Probe is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Panther System.”The Army did not respond to questions about the notice.","The US Government Is Giving Out Millions In Federal Contracts To Fight The Coronavirus

"     The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus. To help keep this news free, become a member and sign up for our newsletter, Outbreak Today.WASHINGTON — Hours before the world learned members of Congress tested positive for the coronavirus, senators insisted they needed to keep physically coming to the Capitol to show leadership.A few senators are calling for committees to meet via teleconference and for votes to be cast by some method other than forcing members to be in the same room. Experts and government officials are warning that extreme isolation measures are the only way to avoid overrunning the health system, which could cause millions of deaths. COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is particularly lethal to older people, and the average senator is 63 years old.Dick Durbin started the push Tuesday when he took the Senate floor to ask why they were still meeting despite pleading with Americans to stay home and work remotely. “It’s time for the Senate to wake up to the 21st century and to make sure we’re using technology that allows us to communicate to each other without any risk to public health,” he said.But the movement quickly hit a brick wall. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected changing the voting rules, and, based on conversations with many senators, there was no groundswell of support Wednesday for working remotely. Quite the opposite: Several senators argued it is important for them to be seen working in the Capitol.“I think it’s important that we let the country know that we’re still on the job and we’re not leaving until we get it done,” said Sen. Mike Rounds.Sen. Joni Ernst said senators showing up for work shows leadership. Sen. Thom Tillis said that, just as it is critical for health care workers to show up to work, it is also critical for senators to be there and do their jobs.“There is what I consider the obligation of example and reassurance,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer. “And I think us being here provides that.”McConnell rejected remote voting, but he did enact new social distancing policies. Votes are held open for a half an hour so senators can show up one or two at a time, vote, then head back to their offices.This was only partly effective. With the usual crowd of tourists gone and reporters down to a skeleton crew, the Capitol felt half deserted. But only half. Security continues to attend the doors, staffers run the cafeterias and keep the place clean, political aides ferry around their bosses and set up press conferences.Senators tried social distancing to mixed results. Some walked to votes side by side, discussing the next big economic aid bill. At one point, Sen. Bernie Sanders had to squeeze around Sen. Susan Collins, who was in an impromptu hallway media scrum. Everyone is supposed to keep several feet of distance, but this breaks down regularly. Because of all this, a few senators openly said that showing up to the Capitol freaks them out.“Yeah, more than normally,” said Sen. Jon Tester.Tester said it was tone deaf to require senators to congregate at the same time Americans are being told that self-isolating is a matter of life or death. “It makes me wonder if leadership around here really understands what the magnitude of this is,” he said.Sen. Rand Paul, not a big fan of government in normal times, said Congress should probably practice what it preaches.Still, they remain a clear minority. Several senators told BuzzFeed News, from a few feet away, that their social distancing measures and handwashing should be sufficient. In the House, more than two dozen members signed a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi urging her to let them vote remotely. The House is planned to be in recess this week and next, while the Senate currently plans to sit indefinitely until a coronavirus aid package is passed.Two members of Congress have now tested positive for COVID-19, and an employee of Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell’s became the first Hill staffer to test positive. Several senators have come into contact with infected people and subsequently self-quarantined, such as Sens. Ted Cruz, Rick Scott, Cory Gardner, and Lindsey Graham. House Reps. Matt Gaetz, Mark Meadows, Doug Collins, and Paul Gosar have done the same.Ultimately, Congress may find the decision is made for them. Sen.

Mario Diaz-Balart and Ben McAdams announced Wednesday that they have tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first members of Congress to do so since the pandemic was declared.Diaz-Balart, a 58-year-old Republican from Florida, said he began experiencing symptoms on Saturday “including a fever and headache,” according to a statement from his office. He was informed that he tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, on Wednesday.""I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better,” the lawmaker said in the statement. “However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus. We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times.”      Later on Wednesday, McAdams announced his diagnosis on Twitter, saying he got tested after developing ""a fever, a dry cough and labored breathing.""He added that he continued to work from home under self quarantine.      At the start of the 116th Congress, the average age of House representatives was 57.6 years, and the average age among senators was 62.9 years, according to the Congressional Research Service. Many members are in their seventies and eighties, putting them at the highest risk for the disease.While the House is currently out on recess with members back home in their districts, the Senate has continued to work in spite of the national recommendation that people not gather in groups of more than 10 people. The House is expected to return as well; both chambers are working on legislation to address the coronavirus.Although Diaz-Balart and McAdams are the first members of Congress to be diagnosed with the disease, several others have self-quarantined in recent days after contact with someone who has been tested positive. This includes Sen. Ted Cruz and Reps. Matt Gaetz and Doug Collins, all of whom did so after coming into contact with a person last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference who was diagnosed with the disease. Gaetz and Collins each also met with President Donald Trump following the conference.Cruz extended his original self-quarantine after learning he had interacted with a second person who tested positive. He concluded his quarantine Tuesday.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a top ally of Trump's, also self-quarantined on Thursday, March 12, after coming into contact with at least two individuals who tested positive for the disease. He announced on Twitter on Sunday night that his test came back negative.Graham had been at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property the weekend of March 7 with the president as well as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whose press secretary recently tested positive.Democratic Rep. Julia Brownley was the first member of Congress to self-quarantine after coming into contact with a person who tested positive who was not at CPAC. Sen. Rick Scott announced last week that he, too, was self-quarantining after being in contact with a member of the Brazilian delegation who tested positive.“My office was alerted today by the Brazilian Embassy that a member of President Bolsanaro’s delegation tested positive for Coronavirus. On Monday, I met with [Bolsanaro] in Miami, and while I do not believe I interacted with the infected person, that individual was in the same room as me,” Scott said in a statement.Scott said he had no symptoms and was quarantining out of an abundance of caution.Rep. Jason Crow, who served as one of the Democratic impeachment managers, announced Tuesday that he was self-quarantining as well after interacting with a constituent who tested positive.Diaz-Balart is not the first major Florida politician to test positive for the disease — Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said last week that he had contracted COVID-19 after meeting with Bolsonaro.","Two Members Of Congress Have Tested Positive For The Coronavirus

"     The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus. To help keep this news free, become a member and sign up for our newsletter, Outbreak Today.      WASHINGTON — Members of Congress are outraged that President Donald Trump released White House guidelines to address the coronavirus in just one language during the global pandemic. Now some are taking translations into their own hands to help spread information on how to respond to the pandemic to non-English speakers.The English-only two-page document titled “The President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America” is a quick how-to guide of what to do if you feel symptoms or have tested positive for the disease. The document ultimately directs people to their state and local authorities. But the White House, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have only published an English version of the guidelines. (The CDC does have some information on its website in other languages.)After the publication of this story, the Trump administration released a Spanish language version of the guidelines.BOLD PAC, the political arm for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, created its own translation of the guidelines for Spanish speakers and posted it on Twitter on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the PAC, Jazmin Vargas, said she relied on BOLD PAC’s bilingual staff and double-checked translation with Spanish-language media for the final product.But, Vargas said, “the President has the biggest platform in the country.”“It is not only cruel but irresponsible for this Administration to not make critical public health information accessible to everyone — in a language they can understand and trust,” Rep. Tony Cárdenas, who chairs BOLD PAC, told BuzzFeed News in a statement Wednesday. ""We are a diverse nation with more than 40 million Americans who speak Spanish at home and over 20 percent of Americans who speak another language. It's a failure of leadership on behalf of the White House to ignore this reality.”More than 25 million US residents self-reported having limited English proficiency, according to census data compiled by Migration Policy Institute, a nonprofit focused on immigration policy.A spokesperson for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the lawmaker concurs with BOLD PAC in that “there has been a dangerous lack of communication to Spanish-speaking communities from White House.”Asked by BuzzFeed News if it had plans to offer coronavirus information in other languages earlier Wednesday, the White House said it would do so “as soon as possible” but did not specify when. The Spanish language guidelines were posted hours later.Members of Congress who also represent Asian American communities were also dismayed by the administration’s handling of information to non-English speakers.“It is crucial that we are getting the message out however we can, and the White House and Trump administration definitely has the capability to put out these translations,” Rep. Grace Meng, who chairs ASPIRE PAC, the political arm for Asian American members of Congress, told BuzzFeed News. She credited grassroots organizations and “in-language” media for helping with translations to the large Asian community that she represents in New York City.Meng said the coronavirus has received lots of attention from ethnic media largely because of the president’s anti-Chinese rhetoric when speaking about the pandemic. In a press conference Wednesday, Trump referred to the coronavirus as the “China virus” and denied that the term was racist when pushed by reporters.“What happens when you don’t have translations, is that, what we’re seeing, for example, in the Chinese community, in the Bangladeshi community we have many people who are not able to read or watch mainstream media outlets and they are getting false information from God knows where,” Meng said. “But it is in-language and so they are believing it.”Meng said she’s heard rumors in her community along the lines of, “Oh, someone at a certain supermarket has the virus. Stay away!”Rep. Ted Lieu of California echoed Meng’s sentiment in a statement to BuzzFeed News.“There’s lots we don’t know about COVID-19 [the disease caused by the novel coronavirus], but what we do know is that coronavirus can make nearly anyone sick — that includes Americans and US residents who speak languages other than English,” Lieu said. “Social distancing and measures to reduce its spread require buy-in from everyone, regardless of whether they speak English, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic or something else. We are all safer when all Americans act together to prevent the spread of coronavirus. For that to work, everyone needs access to critical information.”      Do you have questions you want answered?

"     The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus. To help keep this news free, become a member and sign up for our newsletter Outbreak Today.WASHINGTON — The Senate passed a multibillion-dollar coronavirus aid package Wednesday. It is expected to be quickly signed into law by President Donald Trump.The Families First Coronavirus Response Act passed by a vote of 90–8. It expands Medicaid and unemployment benefits, orders free coronavirus testing, and mandates paid sick leave and childcare leave — but only for certain employees.Many Senate Republicans criticized the package. But most held their noses and voted for it after the White House lobbied to pass the bill immediately rather than get bogged down with amendments.“I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,” said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell before the bill passed on Wednesday.The bill is projected to authorize well over $100 billion worth of aid. The Senate will now turn to negotiating a much larger aid bill — potentially worth up to $1 trillion — to save the economy, primarily focused on keeping small businesses and the airline industry afloat. An $8.3 billion spending package to fight and treat the virus passed in early March.The House first passed the Families First Act early Saturday morning. In response to Republican objections, significant amendments were passed Monday, including limiting who will qualify for paid sick leave. The bill offers two weeks of paid sick leave to employees who have COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. They will be paid their entire salary, up to $511 per day (which works out to about $130,000 per year).However, the bill contains many loopholes that allow employers not to offer sick leave. Large companies with over 500 employees are exempt, and businesses with under 50 employees can be exempted as well. Health providers such as hospitals and nursing homes are also exempt.      Do you have questions you want answered? You can always get in touch. And if you're someone who is seeing the impact of this firsthand, we’d also love to hear from you (you can reach out to us via one of our tip line channels).      Parents will be eligible for three months of paid family leave if their children’s schools are closed. Both the sick leave and family leave provisions expire at the end of the year.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she will push to expand paid leave in the next funding package. That one will be designed to keep workers paid and businesses afloat at a time when the government is urging everyone to stay home and nonessential businesses to close.A variety of measures are on the table, ranging from bridge loans to grants to Sen. Mitt Romney’s proposal to provide monthly $1,000 payments to every American adult. The Trump administration has taken up Romney’s idea, and it seems likely to be included in the next bill.The path forward looks to be rocky and partisan. Rather than working on the aid package together, the two parties will go to their own corners to hammer out separate plans. McConnell announced Monday that Republicans would work with the White House on a Republican plan and then take it to Democrats. Making any aid package a reality means passing it through both the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democrat-controlled House.The House is expected to work through the weekend and stay in session until the next phase of aid is agreed to. The House is currently on recess and would need to be recalled to go to a vote. Both sides have said they expect further aid packages to be necessary over the coming weeks.","Congress Passed A Major Coronavirus Aid Bill And Is Already Working On Another

"     WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that, in an effort to fight the coronavirus pandemic, he will invoke the Defense Production Act, which will help increase the production of necessary medical supplies like ventilators.“It can do a lot of good things if we need it,” he said of the DPA. “No matter what you have, it’s not enough. If we need to use it, we’ll be using it at full speed ahead.”Ahead of Wednesday’s White House briefing, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Trump to invoke the act, as did Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.The White House also announced Wednesday that the Department of Housing and Urban Development is suspending all evictions and foreclosures until the end of April, and that Health and Human Services will issue a regulation that will allow doctors to practice across state lines. Vice President Mike Pence asked Americans to postpone any elective surgeries, and formally announced that the US and Canada have mutually agreed to close the border to any nonessential travelers.Trump also called the coronavirus “the China virus” at the press conference and argued it wasn’t a racist term. When a reporter noted that dozens of Chinese Americans have faced racist attacks because of the virus in recent weeks, the president doubled down.“It's not racist at all, no. Not at all,” Trump said. “It comes from China.”      There’s a lot we still don’t know about the coronavirus outbreak.

And if you're someone who is seeing the impact of this firsthand, we’d also love to hear from you (you can reach out to us via one of our tip line channels).      One senator, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, has vowed to “punish” China for the virus. “We will emerge stronger from this challenge, we will hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world,” he said last week.Asked Wednesday if he agreed with Cotton, Trump said, “I don’t know if you’d say China is to blame. Certainly we didn’t get an early run on it. It would’ve been helpful if we knew about it earlier.”As the press conference came to an end, one reporter asked about a tweet from CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang, who wrote on Tuesday, “This morning a White House official referred to #Coronavirus as the ‘Kung-Flu’ to my face. Makes me wonder what they’re calling it behind my back.”Trump sidestepped the question about whether he thought the remark was appropriate, and doubled down on his earlier comments, saying again, “It comes from China.”Asked if he thought well-connected people like celebrities and athletes were getting priority access to testing, Trump said he didn't think that was the case. But, he added, ""Perhaps that’s been the story of life. That does happen on occasion. I’ve noticed where some people have been tested fairly quickly.""Trump also encouraged people to heed the Centers for Disease Control guidelines and not gather in large groups.“I do want people to be calm,” Trump said. “We’re going to win this. It’s just a question of time.”","Trump Announced New Measures To Fight The Coronavirus And Also Said It Wasn't Racist To Keep Calling It The ""China Virus""

"     On Monday afternoon, as portions of the United States planned to shut down due to the novel coronavirus, the right-wing website Gateway Pundit delivered a message: It was misinformation.“The Coronavirus Fatality Rate Reported by the Media Is COMPLETELY INACCURATE,” the pro-Trump site said. “The Actual Rate Is LESS THAN THE FLU – MEDIA LYING AGAIN!”The claim that the “liberal media” concocted a coronavirus panic followed a pattern that has occurred in hyperpartisan media from the beginning of the crisis: downplaying its significance, blaming the mainstream media for overhyping it, and hammering Democrats for trying to capitalize on it. All this has had an impact: Only 40% of Republicans now say the coronavirus is a real threat, down from 72% last month.“Don’t believe what the media is telling you,” the Gateway Pundit said.But, in their efforts to protect the president (who finally seems to have grasped the virus’s full dangers), the Gateway Pundit, One America News Network, and Fox News run a risk.Unlike previous challenges for the Trump administration, including impeachment, Russian election interference, and payouts to Stormy Daniels, the coronavirus could kill large numbers of viewers or readers. If it did, it might be hard to rebuild trust.“It's definitely a risk,” Mohamad Bazzi, an associate professor of journalism at NYU, told BuzzFeed News. “This feels like a culmination of the risk-taking, where it's now putting tens and hundreds of thousands of American lives at risk, as opposed to some other risks that might have impacted other parts of the world.”“What's different about this crisis, compared to constant cascading of crises the Trump administration has either caused or made worse, is that people can actually see what's happening,” Eric Alterman, distinguished professor of English and journalism at Brooklyn College and author of Lying in State, told BuzzFeed News. “They couldn't really see what was happening at the border. They couldn't really see what was happening in Puerto Rico. They couldn't really see whatever the hell he did with Russia and Ukraine. But this one people can see.”Still, a reckoning for the pro-Trump media is not assured. “It seems to have been absolutely correct when Trump said he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and his people wouldn't give a shit,” Alterman said. “So it's quite possible that as long as they have someone to blame — the liberal media, immigrants, China — he can keep it up. Nobody knows how long. I'm not making a prediction.”Bazzi felt similarly. “I think we're already seeing the signs of a shift from Trump and from his supporters to basically pretend that the last two months didn't happen,” he said. “To say he'd been planning for this and preparing for this all along.”Many on Fox News are only now warning of the virus’s dangers, after weeks of shrugging it off, as the fast-moving pandemic has changed peoples' lives — and minds. Jesse Watters, a personality on Fox News’ The Five, said Monday he’s taking social distancing seriously, after claiming earlier this month that he wasn’t afraid of the virus. Last Friday, Fox Business put Trish Regan’s show on hiatus after she said the coronavirus was “another attempt to impeach the president.” And Fox News’ Tucker Carlson’s warning about the dangers of the coronavirus last Monday — a break with his network’s broader tone — resonated with the president.But while Fox News appeared to be coming around to the expert consensus on the severity of the pandemic, late on Tuesday, the Gateway Pundit published a story claiming the World Health Organization had ""severely overstated the fatality rate"" of the outbreak.","Conservative Media Still Isn't Sure What To Think About The Coronavirus

"     WASHINGTON — More than two dozen members of Congress have signed onto a bipartisan letter asking Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to allow the House to vote remotely as the coronavirus pandemic rages on.“Tonight we ask that you bring to the floor a simple rule change that would permit remote voting for Members of Congress during this national public health emergency,” the letter says.Members are at home in their districts for a week, but are expected to return to vote on a third coronavirus stimulus bill, likely next week.“We in Congress are asking businesses, schools, [and] local governments to execute strong plans to ensure continuity of essential services: Congress should be no exception. … We are undermining our bipartisan message to the American people when we come together [on] the crowded House floor to vote,” the letter, which is still in progress and currently signed by 28 members, says. “The image of over 430 members and approximately 100 staffers clustered together on the House floor during votes is inconsistent with public health guidance from public health officials.”CNN first reported the existence of the letter.

DC’s metro service has also reduced service.In a dear colleague letter on Sunday, Pelosi encouraged Capitol Hill employees to promote social distancing, including teleworking from home during the weeklong in-district work period. But Pelosi has consistently maintained that the Capitol will remain open in the face of a public health crisis. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“We must lead by example. During this global pandemic, we need to do all that we can to follow the guidance of medical experts and the Center for Disease Control,” Rep. Tony Cárdenas, one of the Democratic members who signed onto the letter, told BuzzFeed News Wednesday. “Forcing members into a confined spaces and hours of public travel goes against the health guidance of the CDC to combat the coronavirus. If remote voting is necessary to slow the spread of the virus, then Congress can and should adjust parliamentary rules to allow it.”The Sergeant at Arms, in consultation with the House attending physician and leadership, limited visitor tours in the Capitol on Thursday until April 1.“We recognize this is a change,” says the letter to Pelosi and McCarthy. “But the moment demands that we have the courage to change. The House of Representatives should expect of itself the same flexibility and high standards of hygiene that we are asking of others.”This is a developing story.

"     WASHINGTON — In an election marked by low turnout and lack of basic voting supplies because of coronavirus concerns, Marie Newman, a progressive, pro-abortion rights challenger to incumbent Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski has won the Democratic primary in Illinois’s 3rd Congressional District.It’s a major victory for the progressive movement, and an especially welcome one after a disappointing loss in Texas earlier this month, where Jessica Cisneros fell short in her primary challenge against incumbent Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, another anti-abortion moderate Democrat.Decision Desk HQ called the race for Newman Tuesday night just after 10 p.m.; she led Lipinski, 47% to 44%, with 68% of precincts reporting.Last week, ahead of the election, Illinois officials told BuzzFeed News they planned to go forward with voting without any adjustments or changes.Later, they joined with officials from Arizona, Ohio, and Florida — all of which had primaries scheduled for Tuesday — to release a statement saying that they were “working closely with our state health officials to ensure that our poll workers and voters can be confident that voting is safe.”""Unlike concerts, sporting events or other mass gatherings where large groups of people travel long distances to congregate in a confined space for an extended period of time, polling locations see people from a nearby community coming into and out of the building for a short duration,"" the release said. (Ohio’s governor later decided to close the polls Tuesday due to the coronavirus.)But voting Tuesday in Illinois was nothing short of disastrous. Voters and poll workers in the state told BuzzFeed News that many polling places didn’t have any hand sanitizer, or that if they did, it was only because poll workers brought bottles in themselves.One worker said she had to turn away dozens of people because she hadn’t received voting supplies from the state, and another voter, Matt Lindner, reported having been turned away when he went to vote.“A functioning democracy should not have this,” Lindner said.      Both Newman and Lipinski urged supporters to head to the polls, and stay in line if they faced issues voting, on Twitter Tuesday.Newman ran in 2018 as well and lost by just two points. This cycle, she was backed by Planned Parenthood, NARAL, Emily’s List, and Justice Democrats, the progressive group that helped Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat former Rep. Joe Crowley in 2018. Newman also secured endorsements from Sen. Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez herself.Lipinski is one of the most conservative Democrats left in the House and is known nationally for his staunch anti-abortion beliefs. He has a failing grade of just 25% from Planned Parenthood and, in January, signed on to an amicus brief pushing the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.Newman’s campaign was buoyed by the swath of anti-abortion legislation signed into law in states across the country last summer that led to protests nationwide and donations to her campaign. In an interview with BuzzFeed News last May, she called Lipinski anti-worker, anti-woman, and anti–middle class.“He is no better than many of the Republicans out there,” she said. “He is so one-issue focused [on anti-abortion issues], it affects all of his decision-making. He’s preoccupied night and day by it.”Lipinski was supported by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party’s official House campaign arm. The DCCC also blacklisted all organizations working with primary challengers last year, which Newman said resulted in her campaign losing several consultants.The race became the subject of national attention last spring as well, when Rep. Cheri Bustos, the head of the DCCC, scheduled and then canceled a fundraiser for Lipsinki after activist outcry. “Every dollar spent trying to defeat one of our Democratic incumbents is a dollar that we cannot spend defeating Republicans,” Bustos said in a statement when she canceled the event.","A Progressive Challenger Has Beaten One Of The Last Anti-Abortion Democrats In Congress

"     Joe Biden is blowing out Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois, and Arizona on Tuesday night. Also, over 6,000 people in the country have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and it's difficult to think about anything else.Even in a normally functioning world, this primary night would have lacked drama (Ohio's primary was ordered shuttered amid coronavirus fears). Biden, in the last two weeks, has built up a lead in delegates and polling support that looks basically impossible for Sanders to overcome. The Democratic presidential primary had already lost most of its suspense.And this is not a normally functioning world.When the federal government strongly recommends not being in a group of more than 10 people, voting and campaigning take on a very different mood. What’s the greater civic responsibility right now: voting in our democracy or slowing the spread of the coronavirus by avoiding the crowds many polling centers bring out? Outcomes of individual state primaries, where turnout is significantly different than what it would have been in a normal environment, feel unremarkable.Do you remember anything that happened in the presidential debate Sunday night? Aside from the brief terror I felt when Biden coughed twice at its start, I do not. I get paid to remember these things.The primary isn’t exactly over: Sanders is, for now, still in it. Tulsi Gabbard is still out there, presumably surfing. It just feels beside the point when most of us are sitting in our homes waiting for something catastrophic to happen. At this moment, we can’t even say for sure when the next primary votes will be.This is not to pretend the differences in policy and approach between Sanders and Biden aren’t meaningful, that democracy should be disregarded in a crisis, or that the candidates don’t represent very different ideas for what the future of this country could look like. It’s just hard to think about January 2021 when there’s so much uncertainty about next Monday.The whole of this primary campaign has been bizarre. Twenty-eight Democrats at one point or another declared their candidacies, including a scammy small-city Florida mayor and a surprisingly successful small-city Indiana mayor, two Johns, two Joes, a mass of men with last names beginning with the letter B, and Marianne Williamson. When the primaries were beginning, many candidates were unable to campaign because they were in the middle of trying to remove the current president from office. Now with the primaries winding down, the remaining candidates are unable to campaign because they’re in the middle of a pandemic.It’s a particularly unsettling sensation for those of us who have been covering this election and for the people working within it. It’s a feeling of running in sleet as fast as you possibly can while your family is shouting at you for your attention, and then suddenly hitting a wall and everything going silent. The Iowa caucus disaster was six weeks ago. Biden’s collapse in New Hampshire, what I and many others thought could’ve been the end of his campaign, was five. Just about four weeks ago, Sanders came out of Nevada looking like the likely nominee. It’s barely been two weeks since Biden came back in South Carolina and rallied the establishment, two weeks since Super Tuesday when he swept up.I was in Iowa for a little over a week leading up to the caucuses there, starting to read stories in the hotel lobby with other campaign reporters about the virus going around China. International businesses had started canceling travel. We were able to get an extra few days at our nice hotel in Des Moines before getting bumped to the not-so-nice hotel, and it seemed like a pretty good deal. I went to Las Vegas for the first time in my life in the days before the Nevada caucuses and got absolutely lost trying to figure out how to find the street from inside the sprawling neon. I spent about 15 minutes watching a dozen men play craps shoulder to shoulder, completely unable to figure out what the rules were. When I landed back at JFK in New York after, I first noticed how many people were wearing masks.These moments now feel like artifacts of another world. Joe Biden is winning the primary, Joe Biden seems likely to keep winning the primary, and I have no idea when any of us will next be in a place like a casino.","Joe Biden Won Tuesday's Primaries.

"     Last week, when it began to look likely that the NCAA would cancel March Madness, MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki proposed a solution:“If there’s no NCAA tournament this year,” he wrote on Twitter, “I think CBS should go into the archives and assemble all the footage from one from years ago — commercials, pregame and halftime shows, in-game updates, everything. Use 1992 or something. Then just run it all like it’s new.”Since then, the leagues have canceled or postponed March Madness, the Masters, the NBA season, the NHL season, spring training and the Major League Baseball season, and more because of the coronavirus. Basically the only thing remaining on the schedule to cover live is the NFL draft, while more and more people get stranded at home.So could TV networks air old college basketball tournaments? Or the 2000 NBA playoffs? What about the 1997 Masters where Tiger won that first time?I emailed representatives for a few of the major broadcasters earlier today with this general question of whether they would consider airing old playoffs and tournaments, or what issues might prevent them from doing so.A spokesperson for ESPN quickly pointed me to a Tuesday Q&A with Burke Magnus, an EVP, about their programming plans without live sports to air (or even talk about).The general answer is...it's thinking about airing old games:Re-airing full-game presentations is not a right that we or other media companies typically have at our disposal at all times. Each one of these circumstances requires individual conversations with the specific league or property to determine what’s possible.Since we’ve heard from fans that would love to relive full-game presentations, particularly at this moment in time, we are exploring that possibility for events and content that we don’t have re-air rights already.We are working with the leagues themselves to free up the possibility to show encore presentations and discussing how we can present them. In some instances, we aren’t even the original rightsholder, which is the case for the Men’s NCAA Basketball Tournament, for example. Event programming will continue to be supplemented by ESPN live studio and news programming, plus original shows and films.Basically, there are some real rights issues here. At a minimum, you’d need a willing partnership between network and league.Elsewhere in the Q&A, Magnus said the network is currently geared toward covering the NFL draft (which is supposed to continue, just minus events) but are also looking at scaling “fun, compelling archival content and/or themed and stunt event programming that will provide a diversion at a time that there are virtually no other live sports to watch.”(I also emailed reps for CBS Sports, Turner Sports, and Fox Sports earlier with the same question — no answer as of yet.)But the beauty of Steve’s original suggestion is that a full tournament would provide narrative. In a situation where everyone is at home and isolated, you’re looking for something that could potentially create a communal experience with a beginning, middle, end, and surprises.To get this, you need something that runs end to end — not just the one-off selection of Yankees Classics that air on the YES Network.You need something that isn’t too recent to give a little mystery and fuzziness. (Nobody really remembers most of anything from, for example, 1992’s March Madness — except the Grant Hill–Christian Laettner play.) You need this to air with a little fanfare in an easily accessible place — nobody wants to harass their friends to dig up some random grainy clips on YouTube. And you need some good surprises in there too, like the actual ads from forever ago, since there’s no joy like seeing what was supposed to be cool 25 years ago.You need an old basketball tournament! That’s what you need!","*Could* TV Networks Actually Air Old Basketball Tournaments?

"President Donald Trump on Friday announced a new series of measures to combat the coronavirus and treat those who are affected, while pushing back on criticism that his administration was unprepared to confront the pandemic.Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Trump declared a national emergency that could free up $50 billion to help fight the pandemic and said that he was empowering the secretary of Health and Human Services to waive certain laws and regulations to ensure the virus can be contained and patients treated.""To unleash the full power of the federal government … I am officially declaring a national emergency,"" Trump said.""Two very big words,"" he added.Trump said the action would ""open up access"" to up to $50 billion ""for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.""Flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top federal officials and corporate executives from companies such as Walmart, Trump said that the ability to waive certain laws and regulations would allow for easier admission to nursing homes and end limits on the length of hospital stays and the number of beds available.Trump: We are in 'very strong shape' to provide necessary coronavirus testsMarch 13, 202002:35He announced that 1.4 million new tests for the coronavirus would be available next week and that 5 million would be available within the next month — although he added that ""I doubt we'll need that"" quantity. He also said there were plans to allow ""drive-thru"" virus tests.In an unusual and lengthy news conference, a parade of business leaders took turns speaking after Trump — before the president and other federal officials made additional key announcements related to the administration’s coronavirus response.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakTrump shook hands with several of those business leaders as he introduced them at the lectern — a breach of best practices recommended by public health experts across the United States.After the corporate leaders spoke, Trump and other officials finally announced additional measures to confront the pandemic, which included the waiving of interest on federal student loans and the purchase of “large quantities” of oil for the U.S. strategic oil reserve. Officials also said they would be offering guidance to suspend all visitations to nursing homes, with exceptions being made only for end-of-life situations.Nevertheless, the stock market — which had in recent days fallen 20 percent from its latest high, delving formally to bear territory — reacted favorably to the announcement.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose steadily as Trump spoke and closed for the day up nearly 2,000 points, or 9.4 percent.Trump, seen in photographs to have been in close proximity with people who have since tested positive for the coronavirus, also suggested Friday he would “most likely” get tested for the disease.Let our news meet your inbox.

Plans for the emergency declaration were first reported by Bloomberg News.Under the Stafford Act, an ""infectious disease emergency declaration"" by the president would allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide disaster relief funding to state and local governments, as well as federal assistance to support the coronavirus response. The law allows the agency to circumvent legal barriers to more quickly distribute such aid.Emergency declarations are most often used in the event of natural disasters, but can also be applied to disease outbreaks.The president had tweeted earlier about the Friday press conference amid the rapid spread of the virus and as the White House has scrambled to craft a strategy to shift Trump's response to the outbreak, which had been focused on downplaying the threat and accusing the media of creating undue concern.Trump has come under increasing fire in recent weeks over his response to the outbreak while his administration weathered criticism for the lack of coronavirus testing being done compared with other countries.Asked Friday at his press conference by NBC News’ Kristen Welker whether he should take responsibility for the failure to disseminate larger quantities of tests earlier, Trump declined.""I don't take responsibility at all,” he said.Trump also responded testily to a question from another reporter about a decision made by the administration in 2018 to disband the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense — a unit sometimes referred to as the White House pandemic office.Trump called the question “nasty” and replied, “I didn’t do it.”“You say we did that, I don't know anything about it,” Trump said.In addition to having insisted for weeks that he had the outbreak under control, Trump has also propagated personal beliefs about the coronavirus that contradict those of veteran health officials and experts.As panic began to set in over the outbreak, Trump tried to quell the fears of Americans across the country by giving a speech from the Oval Office on Wednesday night. He announced that he would ban many foreign travelers from Europe for the next 30 days and offered a series of economic relief actions to help workers and companies deal with the outbreak. But his speech was met with swift pushback after he misstated several aspects of the policy and failed to propose any new action to combat the outbreak domestically.Health officials in recent days have sounded the alarm, warning the public that the outbreak is likely to get worse. Many major public events, including all NBA, NHL, MLB and Major League Soccer preseason games and Broadway shows, have been canceled this week, and Thursday saw the Dow's worst day since the 1987 crash.Wall Street, however, rallied Friday, bouncing firmly back after lawmakers and the White House appeared close to finalizing an economic relief package to address the coronavirus pandemic.",Trump declares national emergency to combat coronavirus,Mar 13 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-hold-friday-afternoon-press-conference-coronavirus-n1157981,nbc
"With the coronavirus pandemic wreaking havoc on stock markets, sports leagues and everyday life, it comes as no surprise that the presidential race isn't being spared.Enter: the virtual campaign.Say goodbye to big rallies with long lines, smaller meet-and-greets, volunteers knocking on your door. All you'll need now to ""attend"" your favorite candidate's event is an internet-connected device — please do so in your pajamas if you like.""We're in a moment where I think the requirement of having your face out there for campaigns has perhaps faded a little,"" said Rick Wilson, a former GOP consultant.Faced with the very real and rapidly growing fear about the spread of the coronavirus, the remaining candidates — Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders — are doing everything they can to keep their supporters excited without doing so in the large venues that public health experts say is where the virus can be easily spread.Biden, Sanders cancel rallies amid coronavirus concernsMarch 10, 202000:52Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, announced this week that his campaign had changed all of its scheduled coming campaign events to be ""virtual"" with no large crowds attending.That included a previously scheduled event Friday in Chicago and a previously scheduled appearance Monday in Miami. The Chicago event has been recast as a ""virtual town hall."" (Biden also canceled a campaign event that had been scheduled for Thursday in Tampa, Florida, out of concern for public health and replaced it with a speech on the coronavirus epidemic, which he delivered from his hometown, Wilmington, Delaware, and was broadcast online.)Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakWhat exactly those coming virtual campaign events will look like isn't clear, but experts said they're very likely to closely resemble a Biden event on Tuesday.

Campaigns are essentially reaching voters on their computers, tablets and mobile phones as much as they are via school gymnasiums,"" Ferguson added. ""So these changes are just supercharging a phenomenon that had already been happening.""The shift may also help candidates maintain control of their messages and of the events — which can often be disrupted by protesters.In addition, the Biden campaign said Thursday that all employees at the Philadelphia campaign headquarters and in all field offices across the U.S. will work from home starting Saturday. The campaign also said all campaign offices will be closed to the public.The Trump campaign, on the other hand, hasn't unveiled any specific plans for virtual campaign events, although campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told NBC News that because the campaign is ""built on data and uses technology to its highest advantages,"" it is better positioned to ""virtually engage voters than any other campaign.”Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsThe campaign has in recent days canceled or postponed several events that Trump or surrogates had been scheduled to attend. The White House also said a California fundraiser that first lady Melania Trump had been scheduled to attend next Wednesday had been canceled, and the campaign canceled a ""Women for Trump"" bus tour that was supposed to have taken place this week in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as a ""Catholics for Trump"" event that was to have taken place in Milwaukee next Thursday.Murtaugh said the Trump campaign was letting staffers work from home.And Trump Victory, the joint operation between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, said Thursday night that it will shift to ""virtual events"" for volunteer-oriented gatherings.The Sanders campaign, for its part, said Thursday that it would no longer hold ""large events or door-to-door canvasses, instead moving to digital formats and outreach wherever possible.""Mike Casca, the campaign's communications director, added that the campaign had asked all staff to work from home.Sanders has already delivered two speeches — one Wednesday about staying in the presidential race and one Thursday about the coronavirus — that had no audiences.Wilson, the GOP consultant, said it may offer a preview of the future of campaigning.""There are so many tools now to propagate a livestream, so many tools that give you the capacity to watch on your device, to watch your candidate streaming on your tablet, on your phone,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden is winning the delegate race over Bernie Sanders. Now comes the hard part — winning over Sanders' supporters.""Bernie brothers,"" as Biden himself called them at a fundraiser last week, are known for their loyalty to the senator from Vermont and their defections in 2016 to Donald Trump and third-party candidates may have contributed to Hillary Clinton's loss.At the end of their long, bitter primary, Clinton put the onus on Sanders to bring his backers into the fold. To avoid a repeat of four years ago, Biden will likely have to be more proactive and not count on Sanders to do the work unifying the party for him — even if that means the former vice president will have to turn the other cheek to ongoing attacks and rein in his own supporters' desire to gloat or to speed Sanders' exit.Sanders: Our campaign 'won the ideological debate' despite Biden's delegate leadMarch 11, 202004:29Jennifer Palmieri, who was Clinton's communications director four years ago, said Biden needs to give Sanders' campaign space, pay homage to the movement it built, and recognize that attempts to strong-arm the candidate or his supporters will most likely backfire.""You can't force Bernie Sanders supporters to do anything. Even Bernie Sanders can't force Bernie Sanders supporters to do anything,"" she said. ""Letting Sanders determine what's best for his people is probably ultimately what's best for Biden, so long as Sanders supporters are not echoing Trump's arguments.""""Outside pressure, forcing Sanders out of the race, is, I think, a big mistake,"" she added. ""Either Bernie Sanders is going to want to help the Democratic nominee or not. I believe that he does, so then you've got to give that campaign the room to do this the best way they can.""Bernie Sanders vows to stay in race after Joe Biden solidifies delegate leadMarch 11, 202001:30Biden got off on the right foot, she said, by extending the olive branch in a speech after his victories on Tuesday.""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless passion,"" Biden said. ""We share a common goal, and together we'll defeat Donald Trump.""Sanders plans to stay in the race through at least Sunday's debate, the first one-on-one with Biden, when it will become clear how aggressively Sanders plans to go after his rival.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceStill, in a sign of how difficult this will be, some Sanders allies chafed at that sentiment, saying it's too soon to talk about the Vermont senator dropping out since voters in more than half the states have not yet voted.""It's premature and getting off on the wrong foot to stand there and welcome Bernie supporters before Bernie has made a decision about whether to proceed or not,"" said Jonathan Tasini, a progressive activist and former Sanders surrogate. ""I really thought it was tone deaf and actually probably hurt as the first outreach to Bernie Sanders supporters.""Tasini said Biden will need to go beyond rhetoric, adding, ""The price of unity has to be extracting some very specific concessions on big issues that speak to what Bernie supporters want.""But some Biden supporters say Sanders is no position to make any demands. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn went so far as to call on the Democratic National Committee to ""shut this primary down"" and cancel future debates.But that attitude led to walkouts of Sanders supporters at the 2016 convention and thousands of Sanders supporters staying home or voting for Trump.And even if Biden ends up easily winning the party's nomination, it will be because of his perceived ability to beat Trump more than his policy agenda or anything else.""Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,"" Biden said Monday at an event with Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both former rivals for the nomination who have endorsed Biden. ""There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.""Biden is still missing a key pillar of the vaunted Obama coalition that Sanders won — young people — and Sanders also beat him among Latinos in the West.Young voters are a large and growing share of the electorate and are more likely to be progressive than previous generations, but are also more likely to not affiliate themselves with either party, making winning them over ""the 'Manhattan Project' both for the Biden campaign and the party,"" as former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said on MSNBC Wednesday.In Michigan, for instance, a state Biden otherwise won handily, the former vice president lost 3 out of 4 voters aged 18-29. And he lost 30- to 44-year-olds, 54 percent to 42 percent.Four years ago, after it became clear Sanders had no path to winning the Democratic nomination, his campaign shifted its focus to influencing the Democratic Party platform and rules.Working into the wee hours in a hotel ballroom in Orlando, Florida, Sanders and Clinton officials hammered out compromises on everything from the minimum wage to abortion.In the end, Sanders ended up getting almost everything he wanted, which means the low-hanging fruit has already been picked and Biden may need to make concessions on bigger, thornier issues.""We need a vision for this country and for our party. And if it's not 'Medicare for All,' what is it? If it's not a Green New Deal, what is it?"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters on Wednesday. ""There are real electorates that Biden has lost, and I think it's important for the sake of unity that we get real commitments on issues.""Sanders seemed to open the first round of negotiations in public during his remarks Wednesday when he notably refrained from directly criticizing Biden and instead ticked through a litany of policy questions that he intends to ask Biden about at Sunday's debate, including student debt, mass incarceration and immigration.""On Sunday, I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend, Joe Biden. And let me be very frank as to the questions that I will be asking Joe,"" Sanders said.Mainstream Democrats are sure to worry that anything that extends the primary will only end up hurting Biden and helping Trump. And Sanders allies acknowledge there are some members of his coalition that will never come along with Biden, no matter how many progressive activists the ex-VP breaks bread with between now and November.But Ana Maria Archila, the co-executive director of the progressive group Center for Popular Democracy, which backed Sanders, said Biden's electability can only be enhanced by systematically courting progressives.""I don't see how the party is going to be able to defeat a movement candidate — because Donald Trump is a movement candidate — without a movement candidate,"" Archila said. ""So Joe Biden is going to have to do the work.""",Biden's delicate dance to win over the 'Bernie Brothers',Mar 11 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-s-delicate-dance-win-over-bernie-brothers-n1155931,nbc
"The only way to beat President Donald Trump in November is for Democrats to be self-critical about what went wrong in 2016 and fix those mistakes. We failed to connect enough with the working-class voters who should be the backbone of our party. We didn’t get enough young people and voters of color out to the polls. And we underestimated the power of an energized political movement — both on the left and the right.Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and not former Vice President Joe Biden, is the antidote to each of those problems in 2020 — but political pundits have all but declared the Democratic primary over and the latter the winner.RelatedOpinionOpinionBernie Sanders in 2020 is having a rock star moment (literally)That, despite the fact that there are still millions of ballots to be cast and more than 2,300 delegates to be awarded as of Wednesday morning. But they are foolish to dismiss my friend Bernie so easily. Remember this time last year? CNN had him sixth in its rankings of Democratic contenders, and they weren’t alone in counting him out of the top tier. Still, he’s once again proven conventional wisdom wrong and is still very close in the delegate count with Biden — much as he was at this point in 2016.Want more articles like this?

It’s not real voters, but the establishment political class and pundits who worry they’ll lose their privileges and influence. It’s James Carville saying he's ""scared to death"" of Bernie and longtime members of Congress gossiping to CNN about his lack of institutional support.Here’s the truth: Most of those people don’t understand how politics work anymore.RelatedOpinionOpinionHow a socialist candidate can win the U.S. presidential election in 2020Today’s voters don’t care about newspaper endorsements or whom the party leaders most want to work with. They care about who will help them afford health care or take on climate change and they vote accordingly. So let’s listen to the people — the young and the Latino voters Bernie has inspired , the polls that show him beating Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the general election and the 56 of 60 national polls going back more than a year that show Bernie winning the general election. If you’re pragmatic about winning, vote for Bernie.We also hear people say stuff like, “I want someone who gets things done,” because, for the past four years, the media has ignored decades of Bernie’s record. They’ve branded him as a stubborn, uncompromising outsider who puts ideology ahead of results. It’s an easy caricature — and it’s dead wrong.RelatedOpinionOpinionMillennials support socialism because they want to make America great — but for everyoneIn Burlington, Vermont, when he was elected mayor, he led a renaissance by working with people across the political spectrum and was voted one of the best mayors in America by U.S. News and World Report in 1987. And for 30 years in Congress, he’s been a reasonable, respected member . He reached across the aisle to work with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs, and singlehandedly got $11 billion added to the Affordable Care Act for community health clinics in poor areas.Bernie’s values will never change — and that’s a great thing. But he has shown over and over again he’s not naive about how government works. He’s gotten truly meaningful things done.RelatedOpinionOpinionWe want to hear what you THINK. Please submit a letter to the editor.Finally, and most confusingly, we've heard people say, “I want someone with heart and empathy.” I understand the perception that Bernie can sometimes be a curmudgeon and I can’t lie — he’s guilty as charged. But there is also a deep warmth and humanity to both Bernie and his campaign. He connects with real people because he is real.Watch his town halls and see for yourself how people who interact with him react with him. Really watch the next Bernie rally, including the speakers before him. There is a feeling of love in his campaign — a moral argument beyond policy that is unique in our politics. There is a beauty to how he speaks about the power of fighting for someone you don’t know. His campaign has tapped into a humanity in each of us, and that really matters.And one more key point for a lot of Democrats reading: For decades, progressives in our party have come along for the ride when the party nominated a moderate. We worked our butts off for nominees who didn’t fully align with our own vision for the party and the country, because we knew that moderate Democrats were far better than Republican alternatives. Now it’s time for moderates to return the favor.Bernie, not Biden, is the answer to the many of the mistakes we made as a party in 2016. He can reach the working class, inspire young voters and lead a powerful movement to take back the White House. It’s not too late to vote for him to be our party's nominee; this is not remotely over yet.

"It's not Super Tuesday, but there are six more Democratic contests coming up Tuesday. Joe Biden comes to them with a lead over Bernie Sanders in the overall delegate count, thanks to his victories in 10 states last week.Now, Biden has an opportunity to build on his advantage, while Sanders is desperately seeking to put some headline-grabbing wins on the board. Here's my look at the state of play in Tuesday's battlegrounds:1. MichiganDelegates: 125. Type of election: PrimaryThe most symbolically important contest of the day. Sanders won here in 2016 and is pushing hard for a repeat performance.On the heels of a disastrous Super Tuesday, he badly needs to post a victory in a big state like Michigan to prove that he's still a contender. Conversely, a Biden breakthrough in a state that resisted Hillary Clinton in both the primary and general elections would make a powerful statement.Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden set for Michigan showdownMarch 7, 202001:49A Detroit Free Press poll on Monday put Biden up by a whopping 24 points, although Sanders' loyalists are quick to note that pre-primary polling also put Hillary Clinton ahead in 2016.Of more concern for Sanders is his support among white voters without a college degree — a big chunk of Michigan's Democratic electorate. In '16, he won these voters by 15 points in Michigan, key to his overall victory. But in contests so far this year, Sanders hasn't been doing as well with non-college whites. Last Tuesday in Minnesota, for instance, he lost them by 12 points to Biden.Add in Sanders' continuing struggle to attract support from African Americans — about 20 percent of Michigan's primary electorate — and there are some worrying signs for him in what could amount to a must-win state.2. WashingtonDelegates: 89. Type of election: PrimaryThe single most important fact about this contest is that it is a primary, and not a caucus. It matters because Sanders tends to excel in caucus states, with their narrower voting universes, where the most committed activists hold disproportionate sway.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceWashington was a caucus state in 2016, and Sanders romped to a 73 percent to 27 percent win over Clinton, good for a sizable delegate haul. But the state Democratic Party decided to switch to a primary this year — and it looks like a big problem for Sanders.Consider what happened last Tuesday in Minnesota, another state that made the switch to a primary this year. In '16, Sanders rolled up 62 percent in Minnesota's caucuses, but facing a primary electorate this time around, he lost to Biden by 9 points. Notably, Washington also held a nonbinding presidential primary in '16, two months after its caucuses. In that primary, Sanders actually lost to Clinton by 5 points. It didn't count for any delegates, but that result is worth recalling now.Even if Sanders wins Washington's primary, his margin will likely be much narrower than his caucus rout four years ago. And that means that even in victory, his net delegate haul here will be severely reduced, something Sanders can ill afford now that he's playing catchup against Biden.3. MissouriDelegates: 68. Type of election: PrimaryJust two-tenths of a point separated Sanders from victory here in 2016, but now Missouri looms as a big question mark. In other contests so far, Sanders hasn't been performing as well as he did in '16 among blue collar and rural white voters, a significant component of the electorate. For that matter, Sanders also ran particularly well with white college graduates here in '16, a group that surged strongly to Biden on Super Tuesday.Sanders will need deep support from white voters in Missouri to make up for an expected lopsided loss with black voters, who should account for about 20 percent of the primary electorate. Sanders notched just over 30 percent of the black vote in Missouri in '16, better than his performance in Deep South states but still a major problem for him.In the last week, Biden has loaded up on endorsements from the state's political class. A solid Biden win here would go a long way toward making Tuesday a big night for him.4. North DakotaDelegates: 14. Type of election: Firehouse caucusWhat is a firehouse caucus? It's not a quite a primary, but it's pretty close.It's run by the state political party, not the state (which administers traditional primaries), and allows voters to show up at party-designated polling sites during an eight-hour window and cast ballots. The hours are shorter and there aren't nearly as many voting locations as in a primary, but otherwise the procedure is basically the same.What that adds up to is a headache for Sanders, since North Dakota has previously held caucuses, the type of contest best suited for Sanders. In 2016, he racked up a 38-point win over Clinton here. The new process should erode that advantage, though it's not clear to what degree.5. IdahoDelegates: 20. Type of election: PrimaryHere it is again: another state where Sanders dominated caucuses in 2016 that has switched to a primary this time around. Four years ago, Sanders earned nearly 80 percent in Idaho's caucuses. It's hard to see him getting close to that in a primary. Could he still win the state? It's anyone's guess, but if the contest is even close, no one will net a significant number of delegates out of this state.6. MississippiDelegates: 36. Type of election: PrimaryIt's a small state, but it may end up being more consequential than any other state  Tuesday night. The reason: Biden should run up the score here, massively. He's been crushing Sanders among black voters, and black voters should make up around 70 percent of Mississippi's Democratic primary electorate — the largest share of any state.In 2016, this state was an absolute disaster for Sanders, who lost it 83 percent to 16 percent to Clinton. Just last week, he was routed 63 percent to 16 percent in next-door Alabama. There's every reason to believe that Sanders is in for more of the same here Tuesday. And that would mean that Biden would take the vast majority of the state's delegates.In other words, it's possible that Sanders could narrowly win all the other states Tuesday and still have his net delegate gain from them erased by Biden's Mississippi landslide.",It gets a whole lot harder for Sanders today.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump told lawmakers he wants a payroll tax cut that would last at least through the election to give consumer spending a jolt as the coronavirus threatens to cripple economic growth.The president told Republicans at a closed-door lunch Tuesday that he wants the payroll tax rate to drop to zero through the end of the year, according to a White House and a Senate official.Another White House official added that different timelines were discussed. Trump is currently backing only those that would stretch through at least November or December, with some talk of expanding the cuts beyond 2020. The official argued that anything shorter would be bad politically and make less economic sense, with the impact of the coronavirus likely to stretch through the summer.Trump has made the growing economy, record stock market numbers and low unemployment a keystone of his re-election pitch, sometimes telling crowds that they have no choice but to vote for him or else their retirement savings will be at risk. Under the president's timeline, he would ensure that the tax is zeroed out throughout his re-election campaign.Trump also repeated to senators his comments from Monday expressing a desire for federal assistance to provide paid sick leave, loans for small businesses and tax relief for specific industries, according to White House aides and senators who attended the lunch.Help for the oil industry was also discussed, senators said. The White House is considering federal assistance for the shale oil industry, which has been hit hard by the oil price collapse this week, a White House official said. But the official cautioned that the situation is still fluid and that any aid would not be on the level of an industry bailout.Let our news meet your inbox.

""I think we do need more information, more detail.

"WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor will not participate next month when the court hears one of two cases that could change a key element of the system America uses to elect its president — the Electoral College.The court disclosed Tuesday that Sotomayor took herself off a case from Colorado involving a challenge to a state law directing how presidential electors must cast their votes because of a personal friendship with one of the challengers. That friend, Polly Baca, was one of three electors who argue that they ought to be able to vote for the candidate of their choice instead of the person who won the popular vote in the state — what's known as a ""faithless elector.""In a letter to the lawyers in the case, the Supreme Court's clerk, Scott Harris, said Sotomayor concluded that ""her impartiality might reasonably be questioned due to her friendship with respondent Polly Baca.""

The two cases will be argued April 28 and were originally to be considered in a single one-hour argument. On Tuesday, the court separated the cases and set an hour of argument for each case.Sotomayor's recusal is unlikely to make any practical difference. Even if the justices turned out to be divided 5-4 in the Colorado case, her absence would result in a 4-4 tie, meaning the outcome would have no legal significance; her participation in the other case would count, however, and it would be the controlling decision.More than half the states have laws requiring electors to obey the results of the popular state vote and cast their ballots accordingly. When an elector refuses to follow the results of a state's popular vote, the state usually simply throws the ballot away.The cases before the Supreme Court involve faithless electors during the 2016 presidential election. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated Colorado's law requiring conformance with the popular vote. But faced with a similar challenge, Washington's Supreme Court upheld that state's similar law.The nation's highest court ruled in 1952 that states do not violate the Constitution when they require electors to pledge that they will abide by the popular vote.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump turned insulting big-name rivals and celebrities into a form of modern political art. His top Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, has refined it into a post-modern name-calling style exhibited in limited fashion to voters who confront him with cheap shots.""Don't be such a horse's ass,"" Biden scolded a worker at an auto plant in Detroit on Tuesday as Michigan voters went to the polls.The worker had falsely asserted that Biden wants to ""end our Second Amendment right"" to own guns. Biden, the author of a decadelong 1994 ban on certain semi-automatic weapons, has proposed new gun control measures but not a repeal of the Second Amendment — which as president he would have no formal role in adopting.But the heated exchange, in which Biden threatened to slap the man and said he was ""full of s---,"" was just the latest example of a tough-talk tactic the former vice president has deployed repeatedly to push back on critics on the campaign trail. While allies of Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders say the aggressive approach will backfire politically, many Democrats and some anti-Trump Republicans like the unusually muscular response.They see a candidate who has risen in the polls and in early state primaries by demonstrating his resilience to Democratic voters and one who is telegraphing to the broader electorate that he's ready to go toe-to-toe with the bombastic Trump if he wins his party's nomination.""Kind of amazing that anybody thinks this video makes Biden look anything other than terrific,"" David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush who supports Biden, wrote on Twitter. ""He shushes the aide who wants to lead him away — and then engages a hostile critic face to face, fact to fact.

He challenged the man to take an IQ test and to do push-ups with him.At times, though, Biden's penchant for snapping back has been less clearly directed at someone attacking him with false information.In New Hampshire last month, Biden called a woman a ""lying, dog-faced pony soldier"" after she asked whether he could win the nomination following his poor performance in the Iowa caucuses and then told him she had caucused before. His campaign played down the line, which comes from a John Wayne movie, as a joke.Trump's campaign and the conservative media echo chamber jumped on Biden on Tuesday, repeating the false claim that Biden is trying to repeal the Second Amendment and expressing outrage at his use of profanity.Trump himself has repeatedly used profanity on the campaign trail and in office. He called Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a fellow Republican, a ""p----"" in 2016, he has branded various Democratic politicians with nicknames that are ethnically insensitive or made fun of their intelligence or physical features, and he often mocks or suggests that violence might be done to protesters at his rallies.But it wasn't just the Trump campaign that said it found Biden's interaction with the Michigan worker uncouth. Faiz Shakir, who manages Sanders' campaign, tweeted out video of the moment. The first time, he subtweeted the Republican National Committee's rapid response director before deleting that version and retweeted another version.Conservatives were split on whether to suggest Biden had an angry moment or whether he was being dishonest with the voter.Mark Levin, the conservative radio host, said Biden ""loses it again,"" while Dana Loesch, a former spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, said Biden had admitted ""the exact thing about gun confiscation that the worker questioning him described,"" adding that ""Biden called the worker a liar, blamed Trump and cussed at him in response.""But in the interview Loesch promoted, Biden said he was going after assault weapons specifically and explained why he believes that the Second Amendment does not prevent the government from enacting laws that restrict the ownership of certain firearms — like currently banned machine guns — as he told the worker in Detroit.Ultimately, voters will decide whether they think Biden's right to hit back when he thinks he's being unfairly attacked — whether it's by Trump or a guy with a hard hat.

"The six states voting in the primaries and caucuses Tuesday are bracing for a strong turnout after some voters in California and Texas waited hours in long lines to cast their ballots.Election officials and experts are hoping that with less new technology, more paper-based methods and early and absentee voting options, the states — Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Washington, and North Dakota — are expected to have fewer bottlenecks. But other changes may delay reporting of the results.“We do not anticipate unusually long lines in the March 10 states, primarily due to variables such as voting methods, state sizes and the absence of major process changes such as the introduction of Vote Centers,” Eddie Perez, an election administration analyst with the OSET Institute, said in an email.NBC News has collaborated with the OSET Institute since 2016 to monitor U.S. election technology and voting issues.Voters and local administrators have hit roadblocks with newer machines and polling technology that can sometimes result in unanticipated problems — such as the Iowa app that was confusing for precinct chairs to use and encountered a coding issue that caused it to crash and be abandoned on caucus night.In some states this primary season, new technology or processes were implemented in locations that also saw long lines or administrative errors, highlighting the challenges of instituting cutting-edge election systems and processes and the need for election infrastructure resilience and contingency planning.The states voting Tuesday, however, should not encounter such problems, election integrity experts say. All states except Mississippi will be using some form of hand-marked paper ballots.In Michigan, the state with the most delegates up for grabs Tuesday, more than 800,000 ballots have already been cast under the state’s policy that allows anybody to cast an absentee ballot.

Alabama cited its new e-poll books as cutting down on check-in times. Minnesota reported an increase in voter participation of more than 175 percent over its 2016 caucuses.But a handful of counties had issues that will require closer review. Harris County, Texas, which uses voting machines from Hart InterCivic, opened an investigation after a vote was registered as cast after polls closed and a pollworker reported security seals missing on one device the next morning. This same location, Texas State University, also experienced lines in excess of 6 hours on Super Tuesday.Scrutiny was higher on jurisdictions using new equipment. ES&S, the dominant U.S. voting system maker, said that as of November, it has delivered nearly 35,000 new ExpressVote and ExpressVote XL universal voting machines, and over 7,500 ballot scanners and tabulation machines to more than 150 jurisdictions.Biden and Sanders vie for delegates in 6 states, with Michigan the prizeMarch 10, 202001:56The new machines have been heavily marketed across the county for their ease of use for voters and security and accuracy for administrators. ES&S said many new customers were delighted with the new equipment and experienced no issues. But NBC News found some isolated cases of reported problems.“Our call center was active, but typical and on par with previous elections as election officials familiarize themselves and voters with newer secure technologies,” Katina Granger, an ES&S spokesperson, said in an email.One Texas county that used new ES&S equipment is taking extra steps to review the results. A Dallas County judge ordered a recount of paper ballots from 44 new ES&S machines after thumb drives containing the ballots weren't included in final results.One South Carolina county, Richland, replaced its election director and is looking for answers after malfunctions, frozen screens and printer jams affected at least 10 new ExpressVote machines during its Feb. 29 primary voting and forced poll workers to break security seals to fix printers.Election board members said humidity and back-end administration issues may have played a factor, but the number of errors were excessive for the state’s brand new $51 million equipment, said Duncan Buell, a board of elections member and a computer scientist who has researched voting system issues.“That sort of failure of scanner should happen so rarely. It should be once in an entire county, not one in every four,” Buell said. “This should be a big issue.

"A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that House Democrats are entitled to get materials gathered by a grand jury during former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of the Trump campaign and Russian election meddling in 2016.By a 2-1 vote, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the House Judiciary Committee can receive the materials, along with an unredacted version of the Mueller report, even though such materials are normally shielded by federal rules that protect the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.The ruling, which can be appealed to the full D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court, is a major victory for the power of Congress to demand investigative materials over an issue that has long divided federal courts. But it is likely to have little immediate effect.No ‘credibility’: Trump losing 2020 battle to hide secret parts of Mueller reportMarch 6, 202006:08The appeals court said the House ""has repeatedly stated that if the grand jury materials reveal new evidence of impeachable offenses, the committee may recommend new articles of impeachment."" But there is little interest in another around of impeachment hearings in the House or another impeachment trial in the Senate.After the Senate acquitted President Donald Trump, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, said, ""There's not much appetite for revving up the engines of impeachment, because the Senate is behaving like a bunch of religious cultists. Next thing you know, they'll be selling flowers at the airport.""Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceUnder federal law, materials gathered by a grand jury must remain secret, with only a few exceptions. One of them is ""preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding."" The court upheld an October 2019 ruling by a federal judge which concluded that a Senate impeachment trial is a judicial proceeding, not a legislative one.Tuesday's ruling said the Constitution's framers understood impeachment to be an exercise of judicial power. It said that as long ago as 1811, the courts were providing grand jury materials during congressional investigations.The Justice Department objected to the release of the Mueller materials, but a key holding of the appeals court was that the courts, not the executive branch, control access to grand jury materials.""Grand jury records do not become executive branch documents simply because they are housed with the Department of Justice,"" the decision said.Whatever the government's interests may be in upholding general grand jury secrecy, they ""do not outweigh the committee's compelling need for disclosure,"" it said.In her dissent, Judge Neomi Rao, who was appointed by Trump, said the House might have had a need for the documents last fall, but she questioned whether that was still true with the impeachment process now over.""A reasonable observer might wonder why we are deciding this case at this time,"" Rao said. ""Why is this controversy not moot?""The issue of congressional access to grand jury materials has long been debated. In 1974, after a federal grand jury in Washington finished an investigation of the Watergate scandal, it prepared a special report on its findings and recommended that it be forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee, which had begun impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon.U.S. District Court Judge John Sirica ruled that while a grand jury's proceedings are secret, he had the authority to release the material to the House. His decision said that the normal reason for keeping grand jury proceedings secret — such as preventing the escape of someone who might be indicted or insulating the grand jury from outside influence — no longer applied once the grand jury's work was done.Subsequent rulings have said the judicial proceedings exception to grand jury secrecy was not the central holding of Sirica's ruling, but Tuesday's appeals court decision makes it clear that the rule applies to an impeachment proceeding.A Justice Department spokesman said the administration was studying the ruling and had no immediate comment on whether it would appeal. But an appeal by the government seems likely, in part because of the consequences of the decision on future legal battles between Congress and the White House.","House Democrats can get secret Mueller information, appeals court rules",Mar 10 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-democrats-can-get-secret-mueller-information-appeals-court-rules-n1154631,nbc
"DETROIT — Former Vice President Joe Biden told a factory worker he was “full of s---” at a campaign event here after the man claimed the Democratic presidential candidate was going to take away his guns.The heated altercation happened during a meet-and-greet with workers at a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant ahead of Michigan's crucial primary. While supporters were waiting in line, Biden was immediately confronted by a worker who claimed he would try to do away with his Second Amendment right after seeing videos of him and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, talking gun control.“You’re full of s---,” Biden said. “I did not.”Beto O'Rourke: I see three reasons to support BidenMarch 3, 202007:45O’Rourke, who endorsed Biden last week, dropped out of the 2020 Democratic field in November.

In December, Biden called an Iowa voter a ""damn liar"" and challenged him to a pushup contest after the man questioned his age, as well as his son's business dealings in Ukraine.At a pre-planned event in Ohio on Tuesday to reiterate his commitment to passing gun control legislation, Biden reacted to the confrontation in Detroit.

"WASHINGTON — Super Tuesday resurrected Joe Biden’s campaign and powered him into a delegate lead. Super Tuesday II must revive Bernie Sanders or the nomination could slip away from him again.A new CNN poll shows Biden leading Sanders by a margin of 52 percent to 36 percent in a two-person race. The biggest dividing line is age — voters under 45 said they prefer Sanders by nearly 2-to-1, while voters 45 or older picked Biden by more than 4-to-1.That generational gap looms over another big day of voting Tuesday, with Democratic voters in Michigan, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington set to deliver their verdict on who should be the party’s nominee to take on President Donald Trump. It’s also the last day for Democrats living abroad to participate in the primary.Here are five things to watch on Super Tuesday II.1. Will Sanders see a turnout revolution?Sanders has said his path to the presidency involves young and irregular voters turning out in big numbers to outnumber establishment-friendly Democrats. So far, the opposite has happened. There hasn’t been a progressive revolution for change; there has been a suburban revolution for normalcy.Consider the results from Virginia last week. Compared to 2016, the Democratic primary turnout surged in upscale suburban areas like Loudoun County from 36,149 to 71,632, and in Fairfax County from 139,818 to 244,664. Biden lapped Sanders in both counties.Meanwhile, voters younger than 30, who overwhelmingly voted for the Vermont senator, shrunk as a share of the Virginia primary electorate from 16 percent in 2016 to 13 percent in 2020.Sanders desperately needs that trend to change.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceHow Bernie Sanders can stay competitive with wins in Michigan, WashingtonMarch 9, 202004:272. Michigan, Michigan, MichiganIn 2016, Michigan delivered Sanders a stunning come-from-behind victory that revived his campaign and gave him staying power in his battle with Hillary Clinton. If he is to mount a comeback this year, it would have to begin in Michigan.It’s the most delegate-rich contest on the map Tuesday. And as a key battleground state, Sanders must show strength to close Biden’s perceived “electability” advantage nationwide, which soared to 40 points in the new CNN poll. That’s not sustainable if he wants to win over a base that is desperate to defeat President Donald Trump.A Detroit Free Press poll showed the former vice president leading Sanders by 24 points, while a Monmouth survey had him ahead by 15 points. Sanders beat the polls last cycle, and he has placed a big bet on the state this time, with a packed campaign schedule over the weekend and a focus on trade in the industrial Midwestern hub.“I still have PTSD from 2016. We certainly thought we were going to win Michigan by 10 points and we lost by a point and a half,” former Clinton campaign aide Adrienne Elrod said on MSNBC. “So you never know what’s going to happen in a state like Michigan.”3. Margins matter more than victoriesThe contest is no longer about winning states, but rather about delegate math. Delegates are awarded proportionally based on margins, so big victories matter more than narrow ones. Sanders needs to notch big victories to cut into Biden's delegate lead.Apart from Michigan, Sanders handily won North Dakota, Idaho and Washington state in 2016. He lost Missouri by a wafer-thin margin. In theory, Sanders could narrowly win those five states and still fall behind in delegates if he gets walloped again in Mississippi.In 2016, 7 in 10 Mississippi primary voters were black, and Biden showed his dominance among African American Southerners last week. He paid a visit to Mississippi over the weekend to rally voters after Sanders canceled a planned speech there Friday to spend more time in Michigan.4. Where will Warren supporters go?Super Tuesday results indicated Biden was the main beneficiary of former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s supporters after they dropped out and endorsed him. Since then, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has also dropped out, but she has not endorsed either Biden or Sanders — and it’s unclear where her voters will go.Biden has a chance to win older and college-educated white women in her base, while Sanders may add to his base of young liberals who were torn between the two progressives who aligned on policy.A Morning Consult poll taken last week found that among Warren supporters, 43 percent prefer Sanders as their second choice while 36 percent choose Biden.5. Will caucus-to-primary switches hurt Sanders?Sanders has proven stronger in caucuses — which tend to be low-turnout affairs that draw the most enthusiastic voters — than primaries. It boosted him to a big victory in the Nevada caucuses. But he lost Minnesota, which switched to a primary system after caucuses in 2016 that Sanders won handily.Washington and Idaho have also switched from caucuses to primaries. Can Sanders carry those states? Having fallen behind in delegates, he can ill-afford to lose places he won last time.",5 things to watch on Super Tuesday II,Mar 10 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/5-things-watch-super-tuesday-ii-sanders-revolution-faces-reckoning-n1153581,nbc
"WASHINGTON — Four years ago, Bernie Sanders shocked the political world and defied the public polling by winning the Michigan primary — even though he was unable to change the overall delegate math.But here are three reasons why Sanders winning Michigan tonight on this Above-Average Tuesday (with a total of 365 pledges delegates up for grabs) would be an even bigger surprise than it was in 2016.One, Joe Biden’s bounce after winning South Carolina and most of the Super Tuesday states has been enormous. A national CNN poll released Monday found Biden leading Sanders by 16 points (after Sanders was ahead by 3 points in January). And a national Quinnipiac poll had Biden ahead by 19 points (after Sanders led in February).Biden and Sanders vie for delegates in 6 states, with Michigan the prizeMarch 10, 202001:56If you’re leading nationally by double digits, chances are you’re ahead in Michigan, too.Two, the coronavirus story that’s been dominating the news has probably helped Biden more than Sanders. That same CNN poll shows that Democratic voters — by a 42-point margin — believe Biden would better handle a major crisis than Sanders would.And three, Sanders has been underperforming among white working-class voters in the north. “Overall, Mr. Biden defeated Mr. Sanders by 10 points, 38 percent to 28 percent, in counties across Maine, Minnesota and Massachusetts where white voters made up at least 80 percent of the electorate and where college graduates represented less than 40 percent of the electorate,” the New York Times’ Nate Cohn writes.That seems to suggest that part of Sanders’ success in 2016 was because he was running against Hillary Clinton.Outside of Michigan, Sanders might even have a bigger problem tonight: Idaho and Washington state have replaced their caucuses with primaries.And to show you how that could change the delegate math, Sanders won 72 percent in Washington’s caucuses four years ago. But when the state party held a primary that same year — which didn’t count for the delegates sent to the convention — Clinton actually edged Sanders in that contest (when a lot more voters were participating).Two weeks ago, Joe Biden was making his final stand in South Carolina, and it worked for him — better than anyone could have imagined.Today, Sanders is making his own final stand in Michigan.But he’s making it on much more unfavorable turf.Data Download: The number of the day is … 77Seventy-seven.That’s Joe Biden’s delegate lead over Bernie Sanders heading into tonight’s contests.Biden has been allocated 652 delegates, according to the NBC News Decision Desk, while Sanders has 575.That doesn’t include 143 delegates that have NOT been allocated from contests that have already taken place.Of those 143, 63 are from California, while 80 are from other Super Tuesday States.California: 63Utah: 20Colorado: 16North Carolina: 9Massachusetts: 9Tennessee: 8Texas: 5Maine: 4Alabama: 3Oklahoma: 2Virginia: 2Arkansas: 1Minnesota: 1Trump’s looking at stimulus measures to boost the economy“President Donald Trump said Monday that he is looking at a possible payroll tax cut, along with other measures, to help American workers and boost the economy, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak,” per NBC News.Let our news meet your inbox.

"WASHINGTON — Two weeks ago, Bernie Sanders was the Democratic presidential front-runner, the U.S. economy was humming and President Donald Trump had reason to be optimistic about his re-election prospects.Then the first American died from the coronavirus. The campaign as we knew it would soon be over.The pandemic subsumed businesses and sports leagues, hammered the travel industry and caused some analysts to project an economic downturn, if not a global recession. Democrats who rated the coronavirus as important to their vote picked former Vice President Joe Biden by wide margins in primary contests, padding his victory margins and handing him a commanding delegate lead.The president and his two main rivals canceled rallies, allowed or directed staff to work from home and began shifting their events to online gatherings. Democrats moved their Sunday debate from Phoenix to Washington and eliminated the live audience, while Louisiana became the first state to postpone its primaries due to the virus. American public life was grinding to a halt.In the nation’s capital, Trump struggled to contain the fallout, initially downplaying the magnitude of the crisis and offering mixed messages that went against guidance from public health officials.The coronavirus outbreak has challenged Trump as he has never been challenged before. The scorched-earth playbook that has gotten the former reality TV star out of trouble in the past is failing on a complex problem that requires technocratic competence and expertise. A president who has confounded his critics with an apparent invincibility in one crisis after another now sees the virus attacking his two biggest assets heading into re-election — a growing economy and the approval of older Americans, whose lives are disproportionately threatened.Let our news meet your inbox.

He underperforms his rivals on the question of who would better handle a crisis: American voters picked Joe Biden over Trump by 16 points, and Sanders over Trump by 6 points, a Quinnipiac poll said.This week, the president delivered an Oval Office address that misstated his own policy of restricting travel from Europe, which panicked Americans abroad and further tanked the markets. On Friday, one day after the worst stock market crash since 1987, he declared a national emergency in order to unlock resources to help states and localities address the pandemic. He denied responsibility for the slow rate of coronavirus testing.""No, I don’t take responsibility at all,"" he told reporters at a White House press conference, blaming the ""set of circumstances"" he inherited, flanked by administration officials and corporate executives enlisted to help mitigate the crisis. Hours later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a deal with the administration on a bill to protect Americans with two weeks of paid sick leave, three months of family and medical leave, enhanced unemployment benefits and a boost in Medicaid and nutrition funding.Before Trump came around to declaring an emergency, he latched onto the rosiest forecasts and sought to blame his predecessor, attack the press and accuse Democrats of perpetuating a “hoax” to bring down his presidency. Meanwhile, the death toll has gradually risen, testing remains scarce compared to other developed countries and the president’s response has fueled criticism that he’s more worried about his political health than the pubic's.“The administration’s failure on testing is colossal, and it’s a failure of planning, leadership and execution,” Biden said in remarks on the crisis Thursday. “We must know the true extent of this outbreak so we can map it, trace it and contain it. Nor should we hide the true number of infections in hope of protecting political interest or the stock market.”Biden’s speech came one day after the president’s Oval Office address, offering Americans a visual comparison of how their two most likely options this fall would act in a crisis. Voters in recent general elections have not necessarily been drawn to the candidate with the most governing experience — Hillary Clinton, John McCain and John Kerry all lost — but a pandemic could change that.Sanders said Friday the virus “has radically changed our campaign,” by preventing him from hosting big rallies and relegating his staff to work from home. He touted his signature issue of “Medicare for All” and argued that a national insurance plan would make the U.S. better equipped to combat public health threats like the coronavirus.“We need fundamental changes to our economy, we need fundamental changes to our health care system,” he told reporters in Burlington, Vermont. “I would hope that this crisis should be a moment in which people ask fundamental questions about the dysfunctionality of our current health care system.”At his press conference Friday, Trump sought to look ahead to the light at the end of the tunnel.""This will pass,"" he said.

"New York state opened its first drive-thru coronavirus test site Friday in New Rochelle, the city that Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said has the biggest cluster of coronavirus cases in the country.With 158 cases in Westchester County, many of them in New Rochelle, the city has become a hot spot not just for the outbreak but also for unique ways to track and minimize the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, Cuomo implemented a ""containment zone"" around a one-mile radius of the city as an emergency measure to limit movement in the area and shut down schools, houses of worship and other gathering places.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakThe drive-thru test site is capable of testing up to 200 people a day at the moment and will eventually be able to test 500 a day, Cuomo said.

People with underlying conditions or those who are elderly are considered more vulnerable populations and will get appointments first.""You want to find the positive cases because you want to be able to isolate those positive cases.""""You want to find the positive cases because you want to be able to isolate those positive cases, and then find out who that person may have been in touch with so you can get them the assistance they need,"" Cuomo said at a press conference Friday.

"WASHINGTON — Many of the nation's mayors and governors are ordering schools, courthouses and even large public gatherings shut down, but where do they get the power to do that?Every state in the United States — and virtually every country in the world — has laws conferring this legal authority. They're some of the oldest on the books, stemming from the plagues of past centuries that devastated Europe and were reworked again after the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic and the more recent Ebola outbreak.""There's no question that states have very broad powers to do rather extraordinary things in public health emergencies,"" professor Wendy Parmet, an expert on public health law at Northeastern University, says.President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency Friday, but that largely would provide more assistance to state and local governments and would not enlarge federal power to restrict public gatherings or travel. It provides the same kind of aid that is made available in response to national disasters like hurricanes.Trump plans to declare national emergency over coronavirusMarch 13, 202001:50The federal government has long had authority to prevent people who could be carrying disease from entering the country.

It's the same provision Trump invoked in the past, with varying degrees of success, to limit travel from mostly Muslim countries and to restrict immigration at the southern border.Chief Justice John Roberts referred to this power two years ago when the court upheld a modified version of Trump's Middle Eastern travel ban. If the opponents were right about the limits of the law, ""the president would not be able to suspend entry from a particular country in the event of an epidemic in that country or even if the United States were on the brink of war with that country.""Separately, federal public health laws give the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the authority to detain and examine anyone arriving in the U.S. suspected of carrying a communicable disease. The federal government could even limit travel from one state to another by people deemed a public health risk, though the practical limitations of actually doing it make that largely theoretical.Professor George Annas, a public health law expert at Boston University, said, ""I don't think you're going to see any restriction on interstate travel in the United States.""Most of the restrictions popping up now in response to the coronavirus pandemic are local ones. All states and the District of Columbia have laws, as part of their general police powers, authorizing quarantine, which is a restriction on people who may have been exposed to see if they become sick, and isolation, which is intended to stop people known to be sick from spreading a disease.While these laws vary widely, most give governors or public health officials authority to limit public interactions in emergencies.Washington state's law, for example, says the governor ""after proclaiming a state of emergency ... may issue an order prohibiting ... any number of persons, as designated by the governor, from assembling or gathering on the public streets, parks, or other open areas of this state, either public or private.""That includes banning such nongovernment gatherings such as sporting events or concerts. The ability of private businesses to successfully challenge these restrictions is very limited, assuming the state and local authorities follow the rules and don't act irrationally or with intent to illegally discriminate.""If somebody were to challenge something like (New York) Gov. Andrew Cuomo's containment order or the one shutting down Broadway, I think it would be very hard in this climate to prevail in court,"" Parmet said. ""Things may change depending on how long this goes on, but courts have traditionally been extremely deferential to public health emergency powers.""Some states restrict how local officials can close public gathering places, and places like movie theaters can be closed without further authority from a legislature, Annas says. ""In general, as long as you have the support of the public, the power is nearly unlimited.""President Bill Clinton used that authority in 2000 to help New York and New Jersey deal with an outbreak of the West Nile virus, allowing them to conduct spraying against mosquitoes that spread the disease.

Are we listening? Are we getting all the information we need to?” he said. He didn't say whether he would sign or veto any of the bills.Utah barred abortion after 18 weeks last year, becoming one of several states to adopt strict bans.

"WASHINGTON — This has been a week that has changed the trajectory of the 2020 election, as well as the trajectory for the entire nation.The disruption from the spread of the coronavirus — and the political reaction to it — is certainly the biggest part of that change.An economic recession now seems almost inevitable.Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders got to contrast their leadership abilities with President Trump’s.And as for Trump, the coronavirus plays into all of his weaknesses — blaming others, misstating facts, not leading by example and an inability to unite the country — and few of his strengths.But the coronavirus isn’t the only thing that changed the 2020 race this week.Joe Biden has taken absolute command of the race for the Democratic nomination, and the next two weeks of contests look even better for him.And when it comes to the 2020 race for the Senate, Democrats convinced Montana Gov.

"CHICAGO — Chicago mom Rya Smith has no doubts about backing the top prosecutor in the nation's second-biggest county for another term, even while acknowledging the office fumbled a criminal case against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's involvement in the Smollett case has dominated much of the attention in her reelection campaign, but Smith contends the focus instead should be on her record exonerating the innocent, tossing minor marijuana convictions and as the first black woman in the job.“She’s done a great many things, especially for minorities,” Smith said. “The Jussie Smollett case was a pebble in the giant boulder of her career. That shouldn’t discredit her for one little mistake. She isn’t getting a fair shake.”Jussie Smollett due in court for his first appearance on new chargesFeb. 24, 202000:29Foxx is counting on more voters like Smith as she seeks a second term against three Democratic primary challengers who've seized on the Smollett case and a fractured relationship with police. In what's likely the most expensive race of its kind, they've called it a bungled prosecution that benefited a politically-connected person and undermined public trust.The controversial decision to dismiss charges against Smollett, who's accused of fabricating a racist, anti-gay attack, has haunted Foxx, something that's increasingly frustrated her. She declined an Associated Press interview but recently called the Smollett focus “B.S.""Defeating Foxx will be tough with her establishment backing, union support and super PACs targeting her opponents. But challengers — including Navy veteran Bill Conway, whose first run for office is being fueled by his billionaire father — believe they've found an opening for Tuesday.“She just kept not telling the truth to the public,” said Conway, 41, a former assistant state's attorney.He's aired television ads since November, with far more money combined than all candidates — including two Republicans. About $10.5 million of the roughly $11.5 million he’s raised, comes from William Conway, co-founder of Carlyle Group, a Washington D.C.-based investment firm. Foxx, 47, has raised nearly $3.5 million.Foxx acknowledged missteps. She recused herself from the Smollett case, but questions linger about whether she acted improperly for speaking to a Smollett relative and aide to former first lady Michelle Obama before the charges were dismissed. A special prosecutor reinstated the charges last month, which Foxx blasted as political.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service“That we are continuing to talk about this in a city that continues to deal with gun violence, in a city that is continuing to reckon with police accountability,” Foxx told the Chicago Sun-Times. “That somehow this case has been elevated to one of the greatest criminal injustices in our time feels disingenuous.”There’s wide agreement she's made reforms.Foxx's office was the first to dismiss low-level marijuana convictions as part of Illinois’ law legalizing recreational marijuana. She personally handed over roughly 1,000 petitions to a judge.She ramped up a Conviction Integrity Unit with prosecutors vacating convictions of roughly 100 people linked to a former Chicago police sergeant’s scheme to shake down poor and black public housing residents.Josh Tepfer of the Exoneration Project at the University of Chicago Law School called Foxx’s office “the most transparent” he’s worked with, noting she apologized to victims even though they were convicted before her tenure.“She speaks to the unfair treatment of people of color in ways that are very unique,” he said.That resonates with Tanya Watkins, who runs Soul in Action, a PAC that focuses on black candidates. Nearly one quarter of Cook County's 5.1 million residents are black.Watkins believes Foxx hasn't received fair treatment because of race. The other candidates are white.“She has no margin for error,” Watkins said. “The things I’ve heard said about this black woman have reminded me how much more difficult it is to be a black woman in the public arena.”Defense attorneys note the easing up on charges for lower-level crimes and alternative punishments. Some also praise her cash bail reforms. Her office has allowed the release of detainees held on nonviolent charges who can't afford bonds up to $1,000.But others aren’t so complimentary.Foxx has a rocky relationship with police, who dislike her reforms, including for nonviolent crimes like shoplifting. Things worsened when the Smollett charges were dropped. The tensions hit a peak in April with dueling protests outside her office involving the police union.“There’s this attitude among law enforcement that this is a ‘catch and release’ system,” said Kulmeet Galhotra, who's retired as the head of the Cook County Public Defender’s Homicide Task Force.The sentiment is echoed by challenger former Chicago Alderman Bob Fioretti, 67. He and former federal prosecutor Donna More, 62, who’s also running, say the office needs to be more independent.Some defense attorneys are also critical of her office for inconsistencies, saying the policies aren't applied evenly.Still, the Smollett case does resonate with some.Chicagoan Demetrius Williams, 35, voted for Foxx before but thinks Smollett got off easy and will support Conway.“I believe he has enough money to take on Kim Foxx,” said Williams, 35. “I’m not going to say that I’m so Conway crazy. I’ll take a chance.

"WASHINGTON — An unexpected crisis has sent the stock market into free fall, Congress is divided on how to respond, and experts across the political spectrum are demanding unprecedented action to stave off catastrophe.It’s a situation that’s all too familiar for Jason Furman, who advised President Barack Obama’s campaign during the 2008 financial crisis and went on to serve as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.Now a professor at Harvard University, Furman has been pushing Congress to go big with a rescue package that includes sending one-time checks of $1,000 for every American adult and $500 for every child to help cope with the fallout from the coronavirus.NBC News talked to Furman about what to expect from the ongoing situation and how the federal government might prevent a worst-case scenario when it comes to the economy. Here's what he had to say in the interview, edited for length and clarity:NBC News: A lot of Americans are seeing the stock market plummet this week and trying to figure out what it means, beyond just the immediate health crisis. How worried should they be?Furman: I think the economic side is very serious, potentially more serious than the financial crisis.In the financial crisis, millions of people lost their jobs, but most people kept their jobs, and many people maintained their consumption. In this case, everyone is cutting their spending and lots of people, even if they don’t lose their jobs, will lose time at work, hours, tips, potentially a large blow to their income.NBC News: Some are making the opposite argument, including the president. The financial crisis occurred because the underpinning of the economy was bad, they say, but this is a temporary situation and eventually things will go back to normal.Furman: If the virus goes away in two months, I wouldn't be that worried. My expectation based on the medical professionals is that it is not realistic to expect it to go away in two months, and that if it did, it could come back even more virulently again in the flu season next year.The problem with the economic side is that if it lasts more than a few months, it then takes on its own momentum. If you look across the United States and across other countries, the unemployment rate can go up very quickly, but it can’t come back down very quickly. It never has. A business whose balance sheet is in tatters after nine months without revenues might go bankrupt, it might go out of business, or it won’t be in position to hire people back immediately even if demand returns.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceNBC News: You have proposed a one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult and $500 to every child in the country. Why do you think that’s the best approach? In part, because I exhausted all other alternatives. You should spend as much as you can on health, on testing, on hospital infrastructure. You should spend as much as you can in a targeted way on things like unemployment insurance, nutritional assistance, paid leave, and help for states.Once you've gone through all of that, you’ve maxed out on health and maxed out on targeted assistance, you have two problems: One is millions, or tens of millions, of households are going to be hurting from lower incomes, lost jobs, or time off work. Second, just from a macroeconomic perspective, the amount of stimulus you want for the economy under that scenario is still smaller than what you need. The only way to reach everyone you need and get to the size you need is with some broad-based tax transfer.NBC News: What level of spending do you think we need to avert the worst consequences?Furman: A week ago, I called for $350 billion. Today, I would say $700 billion.NBC News: The president hasn’t put out details, but he’s said his preferred approach is a payroll tax cut. What do you make of that idea? Furman: I don't think a payroll tax cut is a terrible idea. I think it's an imperfect idea, but I think it’s moving in some respects in the right direction. The problems it has is it gives a lot more money to high income than to middle income, it gives nothing to people who aren't getting a paycheck, and in the current circumstances it dribbles out slowly.NBC News: Democrats in Congress want to boost federal aid to states to help pay for Medicaid while Republicans are skeptical of the idea. You’ve argued this is an essential part of any rescue package. Why? Furman: In a normal recession, state revenues go down a lot and that can lead them to cut back. That is going to happen. In addition, state spending is going to go up a lot to take all the public health measures and treatment measures we’re going to need to do right now.We need to make sure states can afford public health, that they can afford to treat people, and from a macroeconomic perspective, aren’t cutting back spending in some areas to meet their balanced budget requirement.NBC News: You say that any bill should renew automatically if the economy continues to suffer. A number of Democrats have said they’re worried the next Democratic president could take office in a crisis and find Republicans suddenly very concerned with deficits and unwilling to fund more help. Furman: You can obviate that concern, and I strongly think you should, by passing something today and including with it triggers that continue based on economic circumstances. So, you can write people checks this year and if the unemployment rate is above 5.5 percent, they get the checks next year, or raise the Medicaid match rate, then make a formula that links it to the unemployment rate by state.I've been a longtime fan of automatic stabilizers. In the current political environment it's especially important, because it’s always hard for Congress to pass anything.NBC News: What do you think of the White House’s economic response so far and is there anything more they can do at the executive level? Furman: The White House response has been pathetic, inconsistent, at times too small, and sometimes flailing in different directions. I've been really disappointed. As recently as Friday of last week, their top economic advisers were talking about how very little needed to be done, just little targeted measures. They keep floating a payroll tax cut, but they haven’t proposed it.My experience also is Congress has a lot of great people, but even on legislation at a time like this, really the administration needs to take a big lead.

Many major public events, including all NBA, NHL, MLS and MLB preseason games and Broadway shows, have been canceled this week, and Thursday saw the Dow's worst day since the 1987 crash.As panic began to set in, Trump tried to quell the fears of Americans across the country by giving a speech from the Oval Office on Wednesday night. He announced that he would ban many foreign travelers from Europe for the next 30 days and offered a series of economic relief actions to help workers and companies deal with the outbreak. But his speech was met with swift pushback after he misstated several aspects of the policy and failed to propose any new action to combat the outbreak domestically.Meanwhile, voters have seemed to express a growing sense of trust in Biden's ability to handle a crisis — even before Biden made his latest moves.An NBC News exit poll on Super Tuesday found that Biden was the candidate of choice of nearly half of those who rated the outbreak as an important factor, above Sanders.

"LONDON — President Donald Trump's ban on most travel from 26 European countries caused uproar on the continent early Thursday, with E.U. leaders blasting Trump's decision and saying they were not consulted, as chaos and confusion erupted at several major airports.European Union leaders issued a rare joint statement condemning Trump's move, saying it was taken ""unilaterally and without consultation."" They also condemned attacks he made on them during an address Wednesday night, when he accused the E.U. of spreading the virus in the U.S. by not imposing sufficient travel restrictions on China and elsewhere.""The coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent, and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,"" said a joint statement from Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the presidents of the European Commission and the European Council respectively.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak""The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,"" they added. ""The European Union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the virus.""Meanwhile, Americans and foreigners scrambled to work out what it meant for their plans to travel to the U.S. Others questioned the logic of Trump's move and whether it would actually help the effort to slow the spread of the contagion.Trump announces travel restrictions from Europe over coronavirusMarch 12, 202000:59The president announced late Wednesday that he was banning travel to the U.S. for any foreign nationals who had traveled to one of more than two dozen European countries within the past 14 days.Trump explicitly called it a ""foreign virus"" and said ""a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.""The U.S. had more than 1,600 confirmed cases as of Thursday, including 41 deaths, with the Trump administration coming under enormous criticism for the lack of coronavirus testing that's being done compared with certain other countries.The travel ban goes into effect Friday at midnight, and the restrictions apply only to foreign nationals, not U.S. citizens, green card holders or the families of U.S. citizens.However, during the president's initial address to the nation, the distinctions were less clear, with Trump saying the U.S. would ""be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.""Let our news meet your inbox.

As such, both countries were exempt from Trump's travel ban.That has led some to question whether it would be possible to get past the restrictions simply by connecting in London or Dublin. The statement released by Trump did not answer that point.Furthermore, both the U.K. and Ireland had more cases, 459 and 43 as of Wednesday respectively, than many countries that were included within the ban. Slovakia, for example, had 10 confirmed cases, and Poland had 41.A study published last week in Science Magazine, a peer-reviewed academic journal, found that travel restrictions ""will have modest effects"" and that other domestic measures to prevent the spread would ""provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the epidemic.""That was echoed by the U.K.'s finance minister, Rishi Sunak, early Thursday.Following the travel ban @realDonaldTrump announced, we will assess the situation today.

Ireland and the U.K. are exempt, although it is not clear why because the virus is also present in Britain.The travel ban does not apply to European trade or goods, though Trump suggested that that was the case during his prime-time address.

"The Supreme Court said Wednesday that the Trump administration can continue its practice of returning asylum-seekers to Mexico along the entire southern border while immigration authorities process their claims.In a brief, unsigned order, the court said enforcement can go on while the justices decide whether to hear an appeal of lower court rulings that declared the program illegal. Only Justice Sonia Sotomayor said she would have denied the permission.The policy, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, or ""Remain in Mexico,"" was launched in January 2019.

"WASHINGTON — Halfway through the primary contests, more Democratic voters have made it abundantly clear that they want Joe Biden’s restoration over Bernie Sanders’ revolution.That’s the message from last night’s decisive Biden victories in Mississippi (where he’s ahead 81 percent to 14.8 percent), Missouri (60 percent to 35 percent), Michigan (53 percent to 37 percent) and even Idaho (49 percent to 43 percent).NBC News’ Decision Desk says that Washington state is “too close to call” (where Sanders is ahead by 2,000 votes with 69 percent in), and NBC just projected Sanders the winner of North Dakota’s caucuses.Joe Biden ‘is consolidating the Democratic party,’ analyst saysMarch 11, 202002:36So in the 20 Democratic contests beginning with Super Tuesday last week, African Americans, older voters, moderates and voters who call themselves somewhat (but not very) liberal overwhelmingly broken for Biden — and many of those are the most reliable voting blocs for Democrats.That’s compared with younger voters, very liberals and Latinos who have sided with Sanders.In Mississippi, Missouri, Michigan and Washington state, strong majorities of Democratic voters – once again – said their top priority was a candidate who could beat President Trump, versus a candidate who agrees with them on most issues.“Our very democracy is at stake in this election,” Biden said last night from Philadelphia. “As I said from the moment I announced not far from here, that I believe we're in the battle for the soul of this nation. With Donald Trump as president, our core values, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America is truly at stake.”And with Biden now leading Sanders by 150 delegates per NBC’s latest count (double the 77-delegate edge he had going into last night’s contests), much of the party is already starting to coalesce around the former vice president.Guy Cecil, who heads the Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA, tweeted: “The math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for President and @prioritiesUSA is going to do everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November.”Another Dem group, American Bridge, did the same.It all raises important questions for Sanders: How does he go forward, especially with the upcoming contests later this month (Florida, Georgia) on even more unfriendly terrain for him?If he stays in the race, how does he campaign against Biden, especially with Trump waiting in the wings?And what message does he send to his young, progressive and Latino-heavy supporters – particularly since the Dem nominee is going to need them to win in November?Tweet of the dayRep. Clyburn on NPR just now: ""I think when the night is over, Joe Biden will be the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination...

But unlike those nights, he projected confidence—and at one point full acceptance—that he could be the party’s nominee. ‘This campaign is taking off, and I believe we're going to do well from this point on.’ Biden said. He also thanked Sanders for the race he has run thus far in remarks that sounded similar to ones delivered by past nominees whose opponents had conceded the race. ‘I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal, and together we'll defeat Donald, we'll defeat him together.’”But of course, Sanders has not conceded the party’s nomination. While he hasn’t addressed last night’s results, his press secretary tweeted that she is “excited” about this week’s Democratic debate and that America will get “to see Biden defend his ideas, or lack thereof, on Sunday.”The Lid: Primary colorsDon’t miss the pod from yesterday, when we looked at how Sanders’s 2016 success was largely built around his dominance in caucuses — and what the demise of those contests in favor of primaries has meant for his chances in 2020.ICYMI: New clips you shouldn’t missSahil Kapur has these key takeaways from last night’s primaries — and they’re not good news for Sanders.Gabby Giffords is backing Joe Biden just days before the Arizona primary.There won’t be a live audience at the Sunday debate amid coronavirus concerns.President Trump is proposing an elimination of the payroll tax through the end of the year (and through his reelection campaign).Trump Agenda: (Tele)work it outThe Trump administration is preparing to move hundreds of thousands of federal workers to telework amid the coronavirus scare.Sonia Sotomayor is recusing herself from a Supreme Court case involving the electoral college.There’s a new FISA deal.

"Joe Biden extended his delegate lead over Bernie Sanders in Tuesday night's primaries, according to NBC News projections.The former vice president now has a nearly 150-delegate lead over the Vermont senator after winning four of the six states that voted Tuesday, according to NBC News. Nationally, Biden has 837 delegates to Sanders' 689, as of 8 a.m. ET.Biden appears on track to win Mississippi and Missouri by lopsided margins, which will lead to big delegate hauls since Democrats award delegates in proportion to the margin by which candidates win in each state. He won Idaho by a narrower margin, NBC News projected early Wednesday.Biden has also won the biggest state on the map, Michigan, with 125 delegates at stake.

Biden has a wide lead in the few public polls that have been taken of those states, with a recent Florida Atlantic University poll showing Biden ahead 61 percent to 25 percent.A week later will come Georgia, the type of Southern state with a large black population where Biden has been especially strong this year. Sanders could hope for success in Puerto Rico later that week given his strength with Latinos.April 4th is the next best slate of states for Sanders, with contests in Alaska, Hawaii, Wyoming, all of which Sanders won in 2016.

"As results began coming in on Super Tuesday, some of the most vulnerable Democratic members of Congress breathed a sigh of relief: Joe Biden was surging.A week later, those sighs became a veritable exhalation: The former vice president won primaries in key states, including Michigan, to solidify his lead over Bernie Sanders in the all-important delegate chase.""I'm thrilled to have Joe Biden at the top of the ticket — I think he is exactly the type of candidate we need to overcome the divisiveness of the Trump administration,"" Rep. Harley Rouda of California told NBC News last week. “I think he's going to help a lot of down-tickets such as myself on the ballot.”Rouda, a first-term congressman, is part of the wave of Democratic candidates who turned traditionally red seats blue to help flip the House in the 2018 midterms. He and other ""Frontliners"" — what House Democrats' campaign arm is calling those members attempting to win tough re-election battles in 2020 — had been watching the party's early presidential nominating contests with keen interest and no small amount of anxiety.Bernie Sanders vows to stay in race after Joe Biden solidifies delegate leadMarch 11, 202001:30For those lawmakers fighting to stay in office in districts that have elected Republicans for decades, a Democratic socialist at the top of the party's ticket felt like it would be an in-kind donation for their opponents. Many held back on endorsing any candidate. And prior to Biden's surge, Sanders' presidential bid had already emerged as a trigger point in those re-election battles, with some facing attacks of ""socialism,"" despite their own moderate agendas.Strategists say it’s almost impossible for House candidates to distance themselves from the presidential nominees in a presidential election year, and Sanders’ promise of “revolution” makes that all the more difficult.“What these Frontliners are looking at is, they don’t want to spend every single day being consumed by having to answer for Sanders rhetoric or Sanders policy,” said Rodell Mollineau, a longtime Democratic strategist who is an adviser to Biden’s super PAC. “The more time — as a candidate — that you’re spending having to defend or deflect from any sort of national phenomenon is a day that you’re not talking about the issues that your constituents care about.”Democratic Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, who represents Texas' 7th District and has yet to endorse a primary presidential candidate, hardly aligns with Sanders on politics — her West Houston district is reliant on energy jobs and she openly opposes policy positions like his fracking ban. But after Republican Wesley Hunt won his party's primary on Super Tuesday, he released an attack ad telling voters that “a vote for Lizzie is a vote for Bernie.""Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceMollineau said that the distance between Sanders and Fletcher on policy hardly mattered. “If you’re explaining, you’re losing,” he said.Strategists and candidates said Biden — who endorsed and campaigned for many of the Frontliners in 2018 as a surrogate — fits into their political brands, too.“The way that many of these Frontliners won their elections was by not being hyper partisan, by communicating a message of working together to make the lives of constituents better,” he said.Earlier on, as Biden struggled and Sanders soared in the first voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, vulnerable down-ballot candidates offered endorsements sparingly: Some threw their support behind home-state candidates or Mike Bloomberg, who was competing against Biden and others for the moderate lane in a still-crowded field of candidates.Of the 42 at-risk Democrats in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Frontline program, none have endorsed Sanders. Nine endorsed Biden before voters went to the polls on Super Tuesday, but after his wins started pouring in, the endorsements started flowing: Biden picked up 11 more nods in less than two weeks.Rouda endorsed Biden after Super Tuesday's returns, as did Reps. Sean Casten of Illinois, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Andy Kim of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Haley Stevens of Michigan, and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida. After Biden's big wins in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan on March 10, more Frontliners joined the list, with Reps. Lucy McBath of Georgia, Max Rose of New York, and Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill, both of New Jersey, adding their names to his list of endorsements on Wednesday.Spanberger said Biden’s surge confirmed that voters still want the same thing they did when they sent her to Washington last year: “Forward movement,” not “complete upheaval.”Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, one of the handful of Frontliners who endorsed Biden in January prior to any ballots being cast, said voters wanted to know “what we were actually going to do — things that were achievable.”“I was raised by a single mother in Dallas,” he said, adding that “people like my mother don’t have time to wait for supermajorities"" in Congress, something moderates have argued would be necessary for there to be any hope of passing Sanders' agenda.The Sanders campaign argues they’re building an infrastructure that will boost down-ballot candidates by bringing new voters to the party while inspiring a political movement that will elect a new generation of Democrats, like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.The campaign also told NBC News they’re working to build relationships with down-ballot candidates, including those who aren’t likely to endorse Sanders.Rouda said he was never personally approached by Sanders' team, and Spanberger's and Allred's campaigns said the same.Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., who represents a reliably Democratic district and endorsed Sanders in January, argued that Democrats embraced establishment candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and still lost.“Too often people forget that the best way we win elections — people like Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin has made a career of this — is not fighting over a few people in the middle,” he said in interview, arguing that bringing new voters to the party was key to winning big.Pressed for proof — first-time voters favored Sanders but were a small share of Super Tuesday’s voters, according to NBC exit polls  — Pocan argued the nomination fight wasn’t over yet.“Joe Biden had one good week out of the last year, and everyone wants to think that the last week is the next year,” he said. “Just looking at Super Tuesday and deciding that is the end all, be all? It’s a huge mistake.”",Sanders had some vulnerable Democrats worried.

He underperforms his rivals on the question of who would better handle a crisis: American voters picked Joe Biden over Trump by 16 points, and Sanders over Trump by 6 points, a Quinnipiac poll said.This week, the president delivered an Oval Office address that misstated his own policy of restricting travel from Europe, which panicked Americans abroad and further tanked the markets. On Friday, one day after the worst stock market crash since 1987, he declared a national emergency in order to unlock resources to help states and localities address the pandemic. He denied responsibility for the slow rate of coronavirus testing.""No, I don’t take responsibility at all,"" he told reporters at a White House press conference, blaming the ""set of circumstances"" he inherited, flanked by administration officials and corporate executives enlisted to help mitigate the crisis. Hours later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a deal with the administration on a bill to protect Americans with two weeks of paid sick leave, three months of family and medical leave, enhanced unemployment benefits and a boost in Medicaid and nutrition funding.Before Trump came around to declaring an emergency, he latched onto the rosiest forecasts and sought to blame his predecessor, attack the press and accuse Democrats of perpetuating a “hoax” to bring down his presidency. Meanwhile, the death toll has gradually risen, testing remains scarce compared to other developed countries and the president’s response has fueled criticism that he’s more worried about his political health than the public's.“The administration’s failure on testing is colossal, and it’s a failure of planning, leadership and execution,” Biden said in remarks on the crisis Thursday. “We must know the true extent of this outbreak so we can map it, trace it and contain it. Nor should we hide the true number of infections in hope of protecting political interest or the stock market.”Biden’s speech came one day after the president’s Oval Office address, offering Americans a visual comparison of how their two most likely options this fall would act in a crisis. Voters in recent general elections have not necessarily been drawn to the candidate with the most governing experience — Hillary Clinton, John McCain and John Kerry all lost — but a pandemic could change that.Sanders said Friday the virus “has radically changed our campaign,” by preventing him from hosting big rallies and relegating his staff to work from home. He touted his signature issue of “Medicare for All” and argued that a national insurance plan would make the U.S. better equipped to combat public health threats like the coronavirus.“We need fundamental changes to our economy, we need fundamental changes to our health care system,” he told reporters in Burlington, Vermont. “I would hope that this crisis should be a moment in which people ask fundamental questions about the dysfunctionality of our current health care system.”At his press conference Friday, Trump sought to look ahead to the light at the end of the tunnel.""This will pass,"" he said.

He underperforms his rivals on the question of who would better handle a crisis: American voters picked Joe Biden over Trump by 16 points, and Sanders over Trump by 6 points, a Quinnipiac poll said.This week, the president delivered an Oval Office address that misstated his own policy of restricting travel from Europe, which panicked Americans abroad and further tanked the markets. On Friday, one day after the worst stock market crash since 1987, he declared a national emergency in order to unlock resources to help states and localities address the pandemic. He denied responsibility for the slow rate of coronavirus testing.""No, I don’t take responsibility at all,"" he told reporters at a White House press conference, blaming the ""set of circumstances"" he inherited, flanked by administration officials and corporate executives enlisted to help mitigate the crisis. Hours later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a deal with the administration on a bill to protect Americans with two weeks of paid sick leave, three months of family and medical leave, enhanced unemployment benefits and a boost in Medicaid and nutrition funding.Before Trump came around to declaring an emergency, he latched onto the rosiest forecasts and sought to blame his predecessor, attack the press and accuse Democrats of perpetuating a “hoax” to bring down his presidency. Meanwhile, the death toll has gradually risen, testing remains scarce compared to other developed countries and the president’s response has fueled criticism that he’s more worried about his political health than the public's.“The administration’s failure on testing is colossal, and it’s a failure of planning, leadership and execution,” Biden said in remarks on the crisis Thursday. “We must know the true extent of this outbreak so we can map it, trace it and contain it. Nor should we hide the true number of infections in hope of protecting political interest or the stock market.”Biden’s speech came one day after the president’s Oval Office address, offering Americans a visual comparison of how their two most likely options this fall would act in a crisis. Voters in recent general elections have not necessarily been drawn to the candidate with the most governing experience — Hillary Clinton, John McCain and John Kerry all lost — but a pandemic could change that.Sanders said Friday the virus “has radically changed our campaign,” by preventing him from hosting big rallies and relegating his staff to work from home. He touted his signature issue of “Medicare for All” and argued that a national insurance plan would make the U.S. better equipped to combat public health threats like the coronavirus.“We need fundamental changes to our economy, we need fundamental changes to our health care system,” he told reporters in Burlington, Vermont. “I would hope that this crisis should be a moment in which people ask fundamental questions about the dysfunctionality of our current health care system.”At his press conference Friday, Trump sought to look ahead to the light at the end of the tunnel.""This will pass,"" he said. ""This will pass through and we're going to be even stronger for it.'He — and the nation — can hope.","Coronavirus upends the 2020 race, tests Trump invincibility",Mar 14 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/virus-upends-2020-election-tests-trump-s-invincibility-n1158631,nbc
"WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives passed a sweeping bill early Saturday addressing the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak, aiming to soften the economic blow that many Americans are expected to feel as stores close, people stay home and stock markets plunge.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., hashed out the details of the plan's safety net benefits this week, disagreeing over how much paid time off should be extended to workers. Mnuchin and the White House had raised concerns that too much paid leave would hurt businesses already reeling from the financial effects of the outbreak, while Pelosi and the Democrats argued that a permanent paid leave program needed to be extended to all workers.President Donald Trump has said he supports the legislation, and the Senate is expected to pass it sometime next week.Here’s what is included:Free coronavirus testingThe bill calls for free testing for anyone whose doctor says a test is needed. Patients will not be responsible for any deductibles or copayments.The free testing extends to those on Medicaid or Medicare and provides a pathway for uninsured people to get free testing through federal coverage programs.Expanded family and medical leave — for someThe House bill expands the existing family and medical leave program.Under current law, employers are required to give up to 12 weeks of job protected medical leave (meaning you cannot be fired) but they are not required to provide any pay during that time.Let our news meet your inbox.

The benefits can be paid retroactively and will be available for those who had to leave work starting Jan. 19.But there's a catch: this benefit applies only to companies with fewer than 500 employees. Anyone employed by a company larger than that — which is more than half of all American workers — is ineligible.U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) arrives to deliver a statement on a coronavirus economic aid package ahead of a vote in the House of Representatives in Washington on FridayYURI GRIPAS / ReutersPaid emergency sick leave — (also) for someIn addition to the expansion of paid family leave, the bill also establishes a new paid sick leave program that calls for employers to immediately grant 14 days of paid sick leave that can be used by infected people, caretakers and parents whose children's schools have been closed.This benefit, too, is available only to people working at companies with fewer than 500 employees. Small businesses (defined as having 50 employees or less) will be reimbursed for providing the 14 days of additional paid sick leave.For employers who already provide paid sick leave, the additional leave made available under the House bill should still be provided, and employers are not allowed to make changes to their existing policies to avoid offering additional paid leave.Unemployment benefitsThe bill provides additional funds to states that experience a 10 percent increase in unemployment.States would be required to loosen eligibility requirements for unemployment, such as work search requirements or waiting periods.Food assistanceThe bill allocates an additional $500 million to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children, which provides access to food for low-income pregnant women and mothers, with young children, who have lost their jobs due to the outbreak.An additional $400 million will be granted to the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which would help food banks meet the increased demand they are likely to experience.The bill allows for states to provide families whose children receive free or reduced-price school meals with money to buy food in the event of school closures. The assistance will kick in after five consecutive days of canceled school.It also calls for emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program aid to families with children who receive free or reduced-price meals at school. The work requirements for SNAP will be temporarily suspended under the bill.For older Americans, the bill provides emergency funding for programs such as Home-Delivered Nutrition Services, which provides meals to senior centers and homes of older adults who live alone.Protections for health care workersMany health care workers could be at risk of being exposed to the coronavirus, especially as care facilities fill up with sick patients.The bill requires state and local hospitals and nursing facilities, some of which are not subject to certain federal regulations, to comply with additional safety and health plans.",What's in Congress' emergency coronavirus bill?

On Friday, the Department of Defense announced they were halting domestic travel for all service members, civilian employees and their families in an effort to combat the coronavirus.“We’re considering a broad range of measures,” Pence said when asked about the possibility of domestic travel restrictions.Trump had been repeatedly criticized for refusing to get tested for the virus after it was reported that he was in close contact with multiple people at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida who had tested positive for the coronavirus.Trump's announcement that he had gotten tested appears to be in contrast to a Friday memo from Sean P. Conley, physician to the president, stating that Trump did not need to be tested because the interactions he had with known patients were ""low risk.""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended testing for people who have had ""close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19"" or have experienced ""potential exposure through attendance at events or spending time in specific settings where COVID-19 cases have been reported.""When asked by reporters Saturday to explain the discrepancy between Trump's announcement and the White House physician's memo, Pence said he would ""speak immediately after this press conference with the White House physicians office,"" but did not provide a direct answer.Pence said that he and his wife did not have any symptoms, but were ""more than happy to be tested.”During his remarks Saturday, Trump said he had his temperature taken before entering into the press briefing room.“I had my temperature taken coming into the room,” Trump said. “We are all looking good,"" he said, later adding that his temperature was ""totally normal.""Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakPrior to the briefing, a member of the White House Physician’s Office took temperatures of every member of the press corps in attendance.“Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President,” said White House spokesperson Judd Deere.A member of the press was turned away from the press conference after registering a 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit temperature.The House of Representatives passed a coronavirus aid package early Saturday morning in a bipartisan vote that includes free testing, paid emergency leave and other resources intended to help stem the crisis and stabilize financial markets.

"Civil rights advocates are reminding Spanish-speaking voters living in 32 Florida counties that they have the right to access election materials and assistance in their native language before the state's primary on March 17.Florida's secretary of state as well as officials in Manatee County, Sarasota County and 30 other Florida counties are required to grant these services on Election Day. This follows a federal judge's ruling last year that determined the state was in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for not making bilingual voting materials and assistance available to the state's growing number of Spanish speakers — in particular, Puerto Rican voters who have moved from the island.Puerto Ricans are born with U.S. citizenship; once they move to the mainland they can register and vote in stateside elections. But many of those who were raised on the island speak primarily Spanish.RelatedNewsNewsJudge orders 32 Florida counties to comply with Voting Rights Act for Spanish speakersIt's estimated that over 50,000 Puerto Ricans moved to Florida after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico in September 2017.

"WASHINGTON — With President Donald Trump fading further into the background as a leader on coronavirus action, House Democrats and Trump lieutenants are battling to bolster the federal response.Separately for the most part, but with some collaboration, they are racing to shape legislative and executive policy solutions to a pandemic that has spread rapidly from the public health arena to infect the economic health of the nation. The officials — elected Democrats, Trump-administration Republicans and nonpartisan federal agency chiefs — are also seeking to deliver accurate and consistent information to the public about the importance of slowing down the virus, after weeks of Trump downplaying the risks.In doing so, they find themselves fighting the fierce partisan instincts of Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who vowed to crush a bill that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., spent much of her morning discussing with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the telephone.It all boils down to a monumental test of Washington's ability to confront a crisis when the president is unwilling to fully acknowledge its scale, and that could have serious consequences for the political fortunes of Trump and Republicans in Congress — not to mention a vice president who is widely believed to have presidential aspirations of his own.""The air is rapidly escaping Trump's re-election balloon,"" Dan Eberhart, a Trump supporter and major fundraiser for the Senate GOP, said in a text message to NBC News. ""The economic data that is going to show up in a month or so is going to be universally negative.""'Families have needs': Pelosi calls for passage of coronavirus relief billMarch 12, 202002:12There has been some ""irresponsible rhetoric,"" Vice President Mike Pence told the ""TODAY"" show's Savannah Guthrie on Thursday morning after she read him a tweet from Trump accusing Democrats of overhyping the threat of coronavirus.Though Pence went on to say Trump's top priority is public safety, the rebuke was an unusually harsh assessment from a vice president who less than two weeks ago was handed the brutal task of coordinating a government-wide response to a crisis his boss once dismissed as a hoax.Pence will no doubt be judged in part on how he walks the tightrope of trying to show loyalty to Trump while avoiding blame for anything the president does to make the situation worse — all while actually managing the sprawling federal effort to contain the intertwined threats to public health and the economy.Let our news meet your inbox.

""We need presidential leadership.""By Wednesday night, Biden had named a task force of advisers he said he would turn to for counsel on the matter.Trump, who devoted just the second Oval Office address of his presidency Wednesday night to the coronavirus response, has declined so far to declare a national emergency, which would effectively send billions of dollars to states. That appears to be related to his reluctance to stoke fears that could further damage the economy and his re-election chances.But denying reality has its own pitfalls. If the president starts to lose the trust of his own supporters, he could launch into a political tailspin.His tardy reaction to the threat allowed the risk of an uncontrolled outbreak to grow over the last two months. All across the country, public officials and businesses are canceling major gatherings, from NBA games to St. Patrick's Day parades.And stocks continued to take a beating Thursday morning, with trading halted at the New York Stock Exchange for the second time in a week — the first time that has happened in more than two decades.McConnell calls Democrats' coronavirus relief bill 'an ideological wish list'March 12, 202002:09On Capitol Hill, lawmakers announced that the Capitol complex would be closed to the public through the end of the month, and senators and House members attended separate bipartisan briefings featuring a panel of administration officials that mixed in health officials with loyal Trump appointees.That did little to ease the partisan divide at the leadership level, as Democrats complained they weren't getting good enough information and Republicans accused Democrats of trying to turn the situation into an opportunity to sneak favored policy items into law.McConnell berated Pelosi from the Senate floor over her draft of a second emergency bill to address the crisis, and he told Americans not to worry at all about the economic repercussions of the coronavirus.""The good news is that our nation’s economy remains strong,"" McConnell said. ""The president is continuing to take action himself. We just passed billions in urgent funding last week. And the Senate will continue to stand ready and willing to work toward further bicameral, bipartisan actions when the House Democrats decide to get serious.""McConnell, who has not prepared a similar comprehensive emergency bill, said his colleagues would try to pass ""smaller, noncontroversial pieces of legislation right away that would bolster particular aspects of the fight against coronavirus.""The House aid package would require agencies and private business to cover the costs of diagnostic testing for the illness — an idea Trump appeared to support in his Wednesday night remarks — and provide various types of financial aid to people affected by what has quickly become a pending economic crisis.McConnell blasted the proposal as a Democratic ""wish list"" that would put ""unfunded mandates"" on businesses and create a ""brand-new bureaucracy"" within the Social Security Administration, which would be responsible for overseeing an expansion of paid leave benefits for affected workers.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the latter provision would strain the ability of the Social Security Administration to process checks for the elderly — the population most at risk of dying from coronavirus. The agency's current administrative costs amount to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of its expenses, it completes more than 150 million online transactions per year, and in 2018 it reduced the number of pending actions at processing centers by 3.2 million.In short, it's one of the most efficient agencies in the federal government.Shortly after McConnell spoke, Mnuchin and Pelosi held their third call of the morning.""Language discussions"" regarding the House bill ""are continuing,"" Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill wrote on Twitter.",The twisted politics of Washington's coronavirus response,Mar 12 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/twisted-politics-washington-s-coronavirus-response-n1156856,nbc

It comes after an Indian Health Service patient in Charles Mix County, where the school and reservation are, tested positive Wednesday for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, health officials said.An Indian Health Service official said the person had traveled to a conference in the United States, and others who came into contact with the patient were being tested as well.""We'll have to start looking at relational ties to the individual and if there are any relatives in attendance in our school,"" Beheler said.Even in this sparsely populated prairie land of rolling hillsides and bluffs, the paralyzing effects of the global coronavirus outbreak have hit home.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakThe tribe on Friday approved a ""declaration of disaster,"" which means its offices will be closed this week for cleaning, while employees are banned from traveling to major cities and states affected by the virus, and the tribe's 9,000 members are being asked to stay away from public gatherings. For students at Marty Indian School, a plan to see the Minnesota Timberwolves play the Los Angeles Lakers this month was abandoned after the NBA announced it is suspending the rest of the season.""Demographically, we have a situation here that a lot of our kids live with elders and their grandparents, and so we have to take these precautionary measures,"" Beheler added.But leaders of Native American tribes across the country acknowledge that it's only a matter of time before they may be thrown into a similar situation as the Yankton Sioux, and have begun banning forms of travel and declaring a state of emergency.Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez, center, meets with other Navajo Nation officials to discuss the coronavirus crisis.Navajo NationMost pressing is the need for federal funding that can provide medical supplies and testing kits, said Jonathan Nez, the president of the Navajo Nation, the largest tribal reservation in the United States spanning the corners of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.""We're asking Congress to intervene to make sure that we get the funding we need,"" Nez said.This month, Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., the vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, led a bipartisan group of 27 senators to ask Vice President Mike Pence to ensure all tribal leaders and urban Indian health departments are not left out of the conversation to combat the coronavirus and are provided with the $40 million in funding for their efforts.The House of Representative's emergency relief package, which is awaiting Senate approval, allocates $64 million to the Indian Health Service to address the coronavirus' impact on the more than 2.5 million American Indian and Alaska Native population the agency services.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceThe amount, however, still falls short of the $94 million for emergency funding sought by the National Council of Urban Indian Health. But council spokeswoman Meredith Raimondi said it's still an improvement from when Urban Indian Organizations missed out in past emergency funding, such as for the Zika virus.""Our biggest concern right now is that there's not really a funding mechanism for the CDC to distribute funds to Indian country,"" Raimondi said, adding that she'd like to see an interagency agreement coordinate funding.""Because of bureaucracy, it can take a while,"" Raimondi said.The majority of Native Americans don't live on a reservation, she added, but many still get health care through Indian health programs.Udall said the Trump administration's ""insufficient response"" to COVID-19 could leave Native American communities to ""bear the worst costs of this public health crisis."" He told NBC News that his office is in contact with federal agencies to make sure funds are dispersed swiftly, there's a funding release timeline and that coronavirus testing is accessible in Indian country.On Wednesday, Udall introduced a bill that would allow tribes to apply directly to the CDC's public health emergency preparedness program, which provides states and some cities access to federal resources meant for getting them ready for public health emergencies. Tribes are currently ineligible.""Tribal communities face unique challenges in responding to public health threats, and we need to do everything we can to make sure that Native Americans don't get left behind,"" Udall said.House passes emergency coronavirus relief packageMarch 14, 202001:52The potential spread of the coronavirus on reservations is compounded by already existing disparities affecting the Native American population, including barriers to accessible health care, poor health, unemployment and generational poverty.In 2017, the chairman of the Yankton Sioux Tribe, Robert Flying Hawk, testified before the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs about how the closing of inpatient care at an Indian Health Service hospital and the shuttering of a 24-hour emergency room had created hardships for his community.A series of extreme weather events that devastated South Dakota last year and affected reservations, including the Yankton Sioux, exposed how difficult it was for tribes to get federal funding.The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, home to the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, was in a state of emergency a year ago because of the extreme flooding.On Tuesday, Oglala President Julian Bear Runner declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus. He said the tribe had still not received any testing kits from the federal government.""Who knows how long we will be walking with this disease and not be able to properly diagnose that, quarantine and treat those who have been affected,"" he told the Argus Leader. The tribe has also banned travel for tribal employees.As of Saturday, South Dakota reported one death related to the coronavirus: a man in his 60s with underlying health conditions.RelatedNewsNewsNative Americans, the census' most undercounted racial group, fight for an accurate 2020 tallyIn an email, Indian Health Services told NBC News that all of its facilities are capable of testing patients for COVID-19 at no cost. After the case in Charles Mix County, the agency added that it is ""working closely with [South Dakota] to identify anyone else in the community who has been in close contact with the patient and may need to be tested.""In eastern Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation had to temporarily close its casino last week after an employee contracted the coronavirus. Tribal officials said there were no known cases involving tribal residents.The Navajo Nation has also declared a state of emergency, although there were no confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the reservation as of Saturday. Some residents have been tested, but the testing was done through state health departments, not through Indian Health Service, which could reach more people.Nez said his COVID-19 Preparedness Team is monitoring the states and counties within the reservation and community health representatives have been going door to door to check on the elderly and other vulnerable people. At least 30 to 40 people have been tested, with drive-up testing also available in New Mexico.To get the word out to more people, tribal leaders announced the translation of COVID-19 into the Navajo language: Dikos Ntsaaígíí-Náhást'éíts'áadah.The Navajo Nation is susceptible to the spread of the virus as a popular tourist destination and the home of four casinos, Nez said. Arizona has tracked at least 12 coronavirus cases, while New Mexico has had at least 10.#embed-20200128-coronavirus-us-count iframe {width: 1px;min-width: 100%}The reservation dealt with its own outbreak in 1993 of the hantavirus, a severe pulmonary disease spread by rodents. The mortality rate for the Navajo was 44 percent, higher than the general population, according to a 2016 federal government report.""It's going to be a test,"" Navajo member Vernon Livingston, 38, said of the response to the latest outbreak.Livingston, who lives on the reservation near Window Rock, Arizona, said the news of the coronavirus has sent people panic-buying toilet paper and food at markets. While he applauds the community health representatives and tribal leaders with making sure residents understand the coronavirus, Facebook remains the common way for people to share what's going on.He worries about the stigma of dealing with illness and some people seeking the use of medicine men and local traditionalists with warding off a new disease that currently has no vaccine.""If people start getting sick, us Navajos will think of how we're going to fix it,"" he added. ""A lot of us Navajo men can be really stubborn about going to the hospital — we think, we'll stay home and fight it. But this is something different.""",Native American tribes brace for coronavirus: 'It's going to be a test',Mar 15 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/native-american-tribes-brace-coronavirus-it-s-going-be-test-n1156961,nbc

"The 11th Democratic debate is set for Sunday night, and the first one-on-one face off between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will look much different than was originally planned.Here's everything you need to know about the debate:What time is the debate?The two-hour debate is scheduled for 8 p.m. ET, in a different location than originally planned. It had been scheduled to take place in Phoenix — Arizona is one of four states that have a primary on Tuesday — but the venue was switched to Washington, D.C., after organizers decided to do away with the audience because of coronavirus concerns. The debate will be held at the studios of CNN, which is hosting the event with Univision.The location and lack of an audience aren't the only coronavirus-driven changes. One of the scheduled moderators, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, had to bow out because he'd been in proximity of somebody who'd been in direct contact with a person who tested positive for the virus. Ramos is symptom free, but staying away out of ""an abundance of caution,"" organizers said. Univision's news anchor, Ilia Calderón, will moderate in his place.Let our news meet your inbox.

Tulsi Gabbard still in the race. The Democratic National Committee said that to qualify for the stage, candidates need at least 20 percent of the delegates that have been allocated to date. That means no Gabbard, who's only claimed two delegates in her quest for the Democratic presidential nomination. As of Sunday, Biden had 860 and Sanders 706, according to NBC News' delegate counter.The rules for the debate have not yet been announced, but Sanders said in a speech this past week that he has several questions he'd like to ask Biden, including about healthcare costs, immigration and climate change. ""Joe, what are you going to do?"" Sanders said in his address, which came after what the Vermont senator acknowledged had been a ""tough night"" for him at the ballot box, including losing to Biden in Michigan and a slew of other states.With Sanders on the ropes, the debate comes before voting on Tuesday in Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Arizona. If Sanders doesn't do well and close the delegate gap with Biden, the end of his campaign could be approaching.Where to watch the debate?The debate will air live on CNN, CNN en Español, CNN International and Univision and stream live on CNN.com's homepage.NBCNews.com will cover the debate with a live-blog, stories and analysis.",Democratic debate between Biden and Sanders: Everything you need to know,Mar 15 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/democratic-debate-between-biden-sanders-everything-you-need-know-n1157416,nbc

I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for over-reacting.""The United States has surpassed 2,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, though the actual number of those infected could be much larger because testing isn't yet widespread. At least 60 people have died in the U.S. due to complications from the virus.Fauci said that the goal now is to ""blunt"" the curve of confirmed cases, keeping the number of those infected low enough so as to not overwhelm the U.S. hospital system.""If you let the curve get up there, then the entire society is going to be hit,"" he said.Let our news meet your inbox.

"WASHINGTON — The last time Democrats debated, Bernie Sanders had just won two consecutive states and Joe Biden’s campaign was on the brink of collapse. The two men will debate one-on-one Sunday in a transformed campaign landscape.The stage has shrunk from six to two candidates, Biden has taken a dominant lead in the race, and the coronavirus outbreak has ground much of American public life to a halt. Candidates have been forced to cancel their rallies and host online events instead, while Democrats moved Sunday's debate from Phoenix to CNN's Washington, D.C. studio to avoid cross-country travel.After crushing the field in South Carolina and two successive Tuesdays of victories across the country, Biden leads by about 150 delegates, which will be so difficult to erase that some party elites are already treating him as the presumptive nominee.Here are five things to watch at Sunday night's faceoff.1. Who wins the coronavirus clash?Americans are desperate to know when normal life will resume after the virus has shuttered schools, businesses and sports leagues, causing layoffs and sending stocks tumbling. Biden and Sanders won’t have good answers for them, but they’ll be looking to offer themselves as a foil to someone they call a reckless president who has catastrophically mishandled the pandemic.Watch for the two men to sell Americans on why they’d be best to deal with such an emergency.Biden has presented himself as a steady leader with the experience to handle a crisis. Sanders has said the outbreak underscores the need for universal health care, his signature policy issue, arguing that such a system would leave the U.S. better prepared to save lives.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceSo far, it’s advantage Biden: Democrats in Super Tuesday states who rated the coronavirus as important to their vote preferred the former vice president, according to NBC News exit polls.Biden and Sanders campaigns go virtual amidst coronavirus outbreakMarch 14, 202002:212. Will Biden make concessions to progressives?Biden has already begun speaking like the nominee and positioning himself as a uniter. He has cemented the support of moderate Democrats, but has a long way to go before winning the trust of many progressives, who view him as a milquetoast moderate who’s too wedded to the status quo to meaningfully improve the lives of struggling Americans.The former vice president made one notable concession Friday at a virtual town hall with Illinois voters: He endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan, which restores protections removed in a Biden-backed 2005 law and let young people discharge student debt in bankruptcy. It was a major reversal for Biden, and an outstretched hand to progressives.Keep an eye out for more possible olive branches.“He will make overtures to Bernie and to his supporters to show that there’s space for them on Team Biden,” a Biden aide told NBC News. “We are extremely aware of the need to unite the party.”3. Will Sanders be kind or scorch the earth?Biden-allied Democrats are desperate to end the primary and turn their attention to the faceoff with President Donald Trump. Many are nervous about a possible repeat of 2016, with a protracted primary battle that gets ugly and leaves the nominee wounded. Sanders has promised to steer clear of personal attacks and stick to debating the issues, and he made clear Wednesday he intends to challenge Biden in the debate on medical bankruptcies, climate change and billionaires trying to buy elections.The Vermont senator has dominated with primary voters under 45 years old, who have been outmatched at the ballot box by older Democrats but will be key for Biden in the fall. The senator senator has said that winning their support requires embracing their preferred policies.""I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,"" he said Wednesday. ""And you must speak to the issues of concern to them.”Sanders to Democratic establishment: You must win voters who represent the futureMarch 11, 202004:294. Will Trump keep 'defending' Sanders?Trump has sought to maximize chaos among Democrats by claiming — with no evidence — that the Democratic National Committee is conspiring to stop Sanders from claiming the nomination. It’s a repeat of his 2016 playbook, aimed at nudging Sanders supporters to stay home or vote for a third-party candidate in the fall and enable his re-election.As he coasts to renomination with no serious Republican competition, the president has developed a knack for playing pundit in the Democratic primary. Expect that to continue during Sunday’s debate — and watch to see how Sanders responds. So far, the senator has brushed back Trump’s attempts to manufacture Democratic unrest, and vowed to support the party's nominee this fall.5. How long will Sanders stay in?Sanders said last Sunday on ABC’s This Week he’s “not a masochist who wants to stay in the race that can't be won.” How does he define a winnable contest? The Vermont senator still has a mathematical possibility of becoming the nominee, but that outcome would require a precipitous Biden collapse and Sanders victories by wide margins in the remaining primaries. There’s no hint of that happening. Sanders may drop some clues in the debate about his potential exit strategy.",5 things to watch in the Biden-Sanders debate,Mar 15 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/5-things-watch-biden-sanders-debate-amid-coronavirus-crisis-n1159081,nbc
"WASHINGTON — With the Democratic nomination race now down to a one-on-one contest between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Democratic primary voters now back Biden — who was a distant second to Sanders just one month ago — by an overwhelming two-to-one margin, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.The survey found that 61 percent of Democratic voters support Biden, while just 32 back Sanders. Four percent choose Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who has not yet dropped out of the race despite failing to finish in the top three in any U.S. state primary or caucus to date.Biden’s surge of more than 45 percentage points in four weeks shows how quickly he became the consensus choice of Democratic voters as the field narrowed down to just two major candidates. The NBC News/WSJ poll in February, which was conducted before Biden’s decisive win in the South Carolina primary changed the trajectory of the race, found Sanders besting Biden 27 percent to 15 percent, while candidates who have since dropped out — former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar — split the remainder of the vote.Each of those candidates except Warren has since thrown their support behind Biden.Democratic voters are also significantly more likely than they were last month to say they are enthusiastic about Biden’s campaign. In February, just 13 percent said they were enthusiastic about him, while 43 percent said they were merely comfortable, and a combined 43 percent said they had reservations or were uncomfortable. Now, 37 percent say they’re enthusiastic about Biden, 37 percent say they are comfortable, and just 25 percent express reservations or discomfort.For Sanders, less has changed since February. This month, a combined 66 percent of Democratic voters say they are either enthusiastic (27 percent) or comfortable (39 percent) with him. Last month, it was a combined 65 percent.Let our news meet your inbox.

Among voters under 35, just a quarter chose Biden, while seven-in-ten pick Sanders.Biden leads Trump by 9 points in a one-to-one matchupAmong all registered voters, Biden leads President Trump outside the poll’s margin of error in a head-to-head contest. In a hypothetical one-on-one general election contest, 52 percent of all voters say they would choose Biden, while 43 percent say they would choose Trump.For Sanders, it’s 49 percent saying they would support the Vermont senator, while 45 percent back Trump.In the matchup between Biden and Trump, Biden has the backing of a majority of independents (59 percent), women (63 percent), and white voters with a college degree (53 percent). He is also the overwhelming choice of nonwhite voters, getting support from 70 percent of Latinos and 84 percent of black voters.Trump receives majority support from white voters (51 percent), men (53 percent), and white voters without a college degree (57 percent.)Among suburban voters, Biden gets 49 percent while Trump gets 45 percent.And among voters in 2016 swing states, Biden gets 50 percent, while Trump gets 42 percent.Still, Trump continues to enjoy the most fervent support from his backers. Among all voters, 27 percent say they’re enthusiastic about his candidacy, compared with 15 percent for Biden and 13 percent for Sanders.But nearly half of all voters — 48 percent — say they’re very uncomfortable with his run. That’s compared with 31 percent who say the same of Biden and 42 percent who say the same of Sanders.The NBC News/WSJ live-caller poll was conducted March 11-13, 2020.

"WASHINGTON — A majority of American voters say they’re worried that someone in their immediate family might catch the coronavirus, and six-in-10 believe the worst is yet to come for the outbreak inside the United States, a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds.In addition, more than 40 percent say their day-to-day lives will change as a result of the pandemic.But public attitudes about the coronavirus — including President Donald Trump’s handling of it — are starkly divided along partisan lines, with nearly nine-in-10 Republican voters having confidence in Trump dealing with the outbreak, compared with just a sliver of Democrats who agree.Indeed, 45 percent of all voters approve of Trump’s handling of the issue, which is almost identical to his overall job rating in the poll.“What’s clear is that we are at the beginning of the story of coronavirus in America, and Americans are beginning to understand what its impact could be,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his firm, Public Opinion Strategies.McInturff adds that the coronavirus — so far — has affected some states and cities disproportionately from other parts of the country.“It’s a very big country with a lot of different people,” he said.Only 30 percent of Republicans are likely to avoid gatherings during coronavirus pandemicMarch 15, 202002:03The NBC News/WSJ poll was conducted March 11-13, and it comes as there have now been 2,600 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, as well as 58 deaths from it in the country.In the poll, a whopping 99 percent of respondents say they’ve seen, heard or read about the spread of the coronavirus, including 89 percent who say they’ve heard “a lot” about the story — the highest percentage the NBC News/WSJ poll has registered for a major event going back to 2009.A combined 53 percent say they’re either “very” or “somewhat” worried that someone in their immediate family might catch the coronavirus, while a combined 47 percent say that they aren’t too worried or worried at all.Forty-one percent of voters believe their day-to-day lives will change in a major way in the future, versus a combined 56 percent — a majority — who say their lives will change only in a “small way” or won’t change at all.And 60 percent think that the worst is yet to come, while 31 percent say the coronavirus is not likely to be a major problem.But a glaring partisan divide exists within these numbers.Sixty-eight percent of Democratic voters are worried that an immediate family member might catch the coronavirus, compared with just 40 percent of Republicans who agree.Let our news meet your inbox.

"WASHINGTON — From music festivals to sporting events, the cancellations that have accompanied the spread of COVID-19 seem likely to give a shock to the economy — or at least important parts of it.While the anger of fans and devotees of events such as the NCAA Basketball Tournament or the SXSW Festivals has made headlines, the real-world economic impacts for communities around the country may be dramatic. And when you add up all the cancellations there are signs a major economic hit is coming, with the biggest hits falling on people who are likely not well-equipped to handle them.Start with some of the biggest headlines in the last few weeks, the major sporting events and festivals that have already been put on ice.The massive SXSW festival in Austin, Texas brought in about $355 million to the area in 2019 according to an analysis by the firm Greyhill Advisers. That’s a lot of empty hotel beds and meals not served this year.The Final Four for the NCAA was supposed to bring more than $100 million into Atlanta in early April. And those are just for the semifinal and championship games. Across the country, there were other cities that were going to host first and second-round games — Albany, Cleveland, Greensboro, Omaha, St. Louis, Sacramento, Spokane and Tampa. In Cleveland they estimated the city would derive $8 million from the event, so figure similar hits in those other cities.And in Detroit, the NCAA’s hockey equivalent, the Frozen Four, was estimated to bring in about $10 million to the area with a few small NCAA events, all of which are canceled.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceThe losses of those events, and countless others, are about more than performers or coaches and league officials not getting paid. There are a lot of ripple effects — fewer drinks being poured at bars, fewer cabs rides around townOne place the virus impacts are already clear is in air travel. No events mean no need for transportation to those events.A look at some a random selection of flights on Friday found some very low fares. Looking to go somewhere warm from New York? On Friday afternoon, roundtrip airfare from LaGuardia to Orlando from Saturday to Saturday was $157 on Delta. If you wanted to fly in two months, the roundtrip fare from May 9 to May 16 was only $97.There were similar fares for other routes. Chicago to Dallas (on American) and Denver to Los Angeles (on United or Delta) were also both $97 if you traveled roundtrip May 9 to May 16.Those are great deals if you’re looking to fly, but those are also deep cuts for airlines to take in their fares. Those numbers over a prolonged period of time are going to have serious impacts for airlines. Flight schedules have already been slashed to levels even lower than they were after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. That means fewer days of work for pilots, crews and mechanics. Unpaid leave is already being discussed.And then there are the hotels where people stay in those places. The numbers this week showed cancellations were already spiking, according to the site Knowland.In Asia, where the pandemic has been a story for much longer, the cancellation rate of hotel rooms over the next few months is 90 percent. In Europe the figure is just over 50 percent. And here, in the United States, the cancellation rate is about 40 percent — or it was as of March 11. That’s compared to a rate after July 1 of only about 20 percent.Those are steep drops and they likely mean fewer people needed to clean rooms or work in hotel kitchens or at front desks.When you add all those declines together and factor in a timetable no one yet truly knows, the economic picture — macro and micro — looks challenging to say the least. And remember, none of this adds in the impacts of the suspended NBA, NHL or Major League Baseball seasons. That will bring drops in revenues in neighborhood bars and restaurants every game day.Also missing here are all the impacts of workers telecommuting to their jobs. That means fewer work lunches and fewer cups of coffee being purchased. The workers at those establishments, in turn, have less to spend in their pockets.The point is these impacts can grow remarkably fast.And with all that in mind, remember this figure: $25,580. That’s the mean annual income for a worker in the Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations for 2018, according to the U.S. Census.There were a lot of eyes on the stock market this past week and a lot of complaints about 401(k) plans. But the numbers here show how far-reaching the coronavirus outbreak could be and how quickly the impacts could be felt — all in a year with a presidential race.The COVID-19 story is first and foremost about the health and well-being of Americans, but its impacts seem likely to extend into other areas long after the virus is eventually tamed.",Adding up all the coronavirus economic hits,Mar 15 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/adding-it-coronavirus-leave-deep-impact-economy-n1159356,nbc

"WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives passed a sweeping bill early Saturday addressing the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak, aiming to soften the economic blow that many Americans are expected to feel as stores close, people stay home and stock markets plunge.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., hashed out the details of the plan's safety net benefits this week, disagreeing over how much paid time off should be extended to workers. Mnuchin and the White House had raised concerns that too much paid leave would hurt businesses already reeling from the financial effects of the outbreak, while Pelosi and the Democrats argued that a permanent paid leave program needed to be extended to all workers.President Donald Trump has said he supports the legislation, and the Senate is expected to pass it sometime next week.Here’s what is included:Free coronavirus testingThe bill calls for free testing for anyone whose doctor says a test is needed. Patients will not be responsible for any deductibles or copayments.The free testing extends to those on Medicaid or Medicare and provides a pathway for uninsured people to get free testing through federal coverage programs.Expanded family and medical leave — for someThe House bill expands the existing family and medical leave program.Under current law, employers are required to give up to 12 weeks of job protected medical leave (meaning you cannot be fired) but they are not required to provide any pay during that time.The House bill, however, provides paid leave for workers if they have been diagnosed with the coronavirus or if they are caring for a family member who has it, or if they are caring for a child or another dependent due to a school or care facility closing.Let our news meet your inbox.

The benefits can be paid retroactively and will be available for those who had to leave work starting Jan. 19.But there's a catch: this benefit applies only to companies with fewer than 500 employees. Anyone employed by a company larger than that — which is more than half of all American workers — is ineligible.U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) arrives to deliver a statement on a coronavirus economic aid package ahead of a vote in the House of Representatives in Washington on FridayYURI GRIPAS / ReutersPaid emergency sick leave — (also) for someIn addition to the expansion of paid family leave, the bill also establishes a new paid sick leave program that calls for employers to immediately grant 14 days of paid sick leave that can be used by infected people, caretakers and parents whose children's schools have been closed.This benefit, too, is available only to people working at companies with fewer than 500 employees. Small businesses (defined as having 50 employees or less) will be reimbursed for providing the 14 days of additional paid sick leave.For employers who already provide paid sick leave, the additional leave made available under the House bill should still be provided, and employers are not allowed to make changes to their existing policies to avoid offering additional paid leave.Unemployment benefitsThe bill provides additional funds to states that experience a 10 percent increase in unemployment.States would be required to loosen eligibility requirements for unemployment, such as work search requirements or waiting periods.Food assistanceThe bill allocates an additional $500 million to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children, which provides access to food for low-income pregnant women and mothers, with young children, who have lost their jobs due to the outbreak.An additional $400 million will be granted to the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which would help food banks meet the increased demand they are likely to experience.The bill allows for states to provide families whose children receive free or reduced-price school meals with money to buy food in the event of school closures. The assistance will kick in after five consecutive days of canceled school.It also calls for emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program aid to families with children who receive free or reduced-price meals at school. The work requirements for SNAP will be temporarily suspended under the bill.For older Americans, the bill provides emergency funding for programs such as Home-Delivered Nutrition Services, which provides meals to senior centers and homes of older adults who live alone.Protections for health care workersMany health care workers could be at risk of being exposed to the coronavirus, especially as care facilities fill up with sick patients.The bill requires state and local hospitals and nursing facilities, some of which are not subject to certain federal regulations, to comply with additional safety and health plans.",What's in Congress' emergency coronavirus bill?

"WASHINGTON — The last time Democrats debated, Bernie Sanders had just won two consecutive states and Joe Biden’s campaign was on the brink of collapse. The two men will debate one-on-one Sunday in a transformed campaign landscape.The stage has shrunk from six to two candidates, Biden has taken a dominant lead in the race, and the coronavirus outbreak has ground much of American public life to a halt. Biden and Sanders have been forced to cancel their rallies and host online events instead, while the party moved Sunday's debate from Phoenix to CNN's Washington studio to avoid cross-country travel.After crushing the field in South Carolina and two successive Tuesdays of victories across the country, Biden leads by about 150 delegates, which will be so difficult to erase that some party elites are already treating him as the presumptive nominee.Here are five things to watch at Sunday night's faceoff.1. Who wins the coronavirus clash?Americans are desperate to know when normal life will resume after the virus has shuttered schools, businesses and sports leagues, causing layoffs and sending stocks tumbling. Biden and Sanders won’t have good answers for them, but they’ll be looking to offer themselves as a foil to a president who they say has catastrophically mishandled the pandemic.Watch for the two men to sell Americans on why they’d be best to deal with such an emergency.Biden has presented himself as a steady leader with the experience to handle a crisis. Sanders has said the outbreak underscores the need for universal health care, his signature policy issue, arguing that such a system would leave the U.S. better prepared to save lives.Let our news meet your inbox.

Will Biden make concessions to progressives?Biden has already begun speaking like the nominee and positioning himself as a uniter. He has cemented the support of moderate Democrats, but has a long way to go before winning the trust of many progressives, who view him as a milquetoast moderate who’s too wedded to the status quo to meaningfully improve the lives of struggling Americans.The former vice president made one notable concession Friday at a virtual town hall with Illinois voters: He endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan, which restores protections removed in a Biden-backed 2005 law that let young people discharge student debt in bankruptcy. It was a major reversal for Biden, and an outstretched hand to progressives.Keep an eye out for more possible olive branches.“He will make overtures to Bernie and to his supporters to show that there’s space for them on Team Biden,” a Biden aide told NBC News. “We are extremely aware of the need to unite the party.”3. Will Sanders be kind or scorch the earth?Biden-allied Democrats are desperate to end the primary and turn their attention to the faceoff with President Donald Trump. Many are nervous about a possible repeat of 2016, with a protracted primary battle that gets ugly and leaves the nominee wounded. Sanders has promised to steer clear of personal attacks and stick to debating the issues, and he made clear Wednesday he intends to challenge Biden in the debate on medical bankruptcies, climate change and billionaires trying to buy elections.The Vermont senator has dominated with primary voters under 45, who have been outmatched at the ballot box by older Democrats but will be key for Biden in the fall. Sanders has said that winning their support requires embracing their preferred policies.""I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,"" he said Wednesday. ""And you must speak to the issues of concern to them.”Sanders to Democratic establishment: You must win voters who represent the futureMarch 11, 202004:294. Will Trump keep 'defending' Sanders?Trump has sought to maximize chaos among Democrats by claiming — with no evidence — that the Democratic National Committee is conspiring to stop Sanders from claiming the nomination. It’s a repeat of his 2016 playbook, aimed at nudging Sanders supporters to stay home or vote for a third-party candidate in the fall and enable his re-election.As he coasts to renomination with no serious Republican competition, the president has developed a knack for playing pundit in the Democratic primary. Expect that to continue during Sunday’s debate — and watch to see how Sanders responds. So far, the senator has brushed back Trump’s attempts to manufacture Democratic unrest, and vowed to support the party's nominee this fall.5. How long will Sanders stay in?Sanders said last Sunday on ABC’s ""This Week"" that he’s “not a masochist who wants to stay in the race that can't be won.” How does he define a winnable contest? He still has a mathematical possibility of becoming the nominee, but that outcome would require a precipitous Biden collapse and Sanders victories by wide margins in the remaining primaries. There’s no hint of that happening. Sanders may drop some clues in the debate about his potential exit strategy.",Tonight marks the first one-on-one face off for Biden and Sanders.

"WASHINGTON — Bernie Sanders is running the wrong campaign at the wrong time, and that is the greatest gift he could give Joe Biden.In an election season in which most Democratic voters told candidates, party leaders and pollsters they cared only about beating President Donald Trump, Sanders focused first on smashing party pillars with a purist brand of progressive politics that demonized Democrats nearly as much as Republicans.He chose to divide a party desperate for unity, and he ended up with the smaller share. Now, the rest of the party has turned on him.On Tuesday night, voters soundly rejected Sanders in favor of Biden, who has leaned away from ideology and presented himself unremittingly as the singular answer to Trump. The immediate result was a wider lead for Biden in the race to accumulate delegates for the party's presidential nomination and calls from some Democratic insiders to bring the contest to an early close.""I think when the night is over, Joe Biden will be the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, and quite frankly, if the night ends the way it has begun, I think it is time for us to shut this primary down — it is time for us to cancel the rest of these debates,"" House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally, said Tuesday night on NPR.The two candidates are scheduled to face each other one-on-one on a debate stage for the first time Sunday in Arizona, a matchup that Sanders has been gearing up for as an opportunity to demonstrate that he is the better foil to Trump.But even as Biden has continued to consolidate support in whiplash fashion, the ghosts of a lost 2016 election are giving some observers reason to wonder whether it's wise to drop a hammer on Sanders.""Shutting this down prematurely would be the absolute worst thing the Democratic Party could do,"" Princeton historian Kevin M. Kruse said on Twitter. ""You can make the case that Sanders should drop out, but that's different than saying the party should come in and end this thing halfway through it. That would be bad for democracy and the Democrats alike.""Sanders: Our campaign 'won the ideological debate' despite Biden's delegate leadMarch 11, 202004:29In 2016, when Sanders ran a campaign similarly imbued with anti-establishment rhetoric, a notable percentage of his supporters refused to back the eventual nominee, Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump. To win a general election, Biden would likely need the vast majority of Sanders voters in his camp, and exit polls show that he has work to do to convince some of them to join up if he is the nominee.Let our news meet your inbox.

""We share a common goal, and together, we'll defeat Donald Trump; we'll defeat him together.”While Biden appeared ready to turn toward the general election, Sanders allies said they believe Sunday night's debate could be a turning point in the nomination contest. As of 8 a.m. ET Wednesday, as results in some areas were still being tabulated, Biden led Sanders in the delegate race 836 to 686 — still well short of the 1,991 delegates required to attain a majority at the party convention this summer.""With half of primary voters left to cast their vote, we can say one thing for certain: Voters deserve to see a one-on-one debate between the two front-runners of the Democratic Party,"" said Nomiki Konst, a Sanders ally. ""I believe the debate will highlight the clear differences between the two candidates...[and] show that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate who has the energy, ideas and movement to defeat Donald Trump.""It's little wonder why Biden's friends want the primary to end now. His performance on the campaign trail has been uneven.Less than two weeks ago, Biden looked hapless. He was winless in three primary contests, including Iowa and New Hampshire, where voters get the most face time with candidates. Democratic Party luminaries were worried about the possibility that the combination of a committed Sanders political base and a splintering of remaining voters among Biden and other candidates would allow Sanders to run away with the nomination.Then Biden won South Carolina, in large part on the strength of more than 60 percent of the state's black voters backing him. Three rivals quickly dropped out of the race, despite having publicly laid out plans to keep running. Two of them, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Pete Buttigieg rushed to Dallas to endorse Biden before last week's Super Tuesday contests in 14 states.They joined up to help Biden crush Sanders. It worked. Biden cruised through Super Tuesday, again drawing on the strength of big margins among black voters in Southern and East Coast states to rack up delegates. Surprising performances in other parts of the country helped Biden pad his edge.Ultimately, Sanders' plan to divide Democrats was effective. He just ended up on the wrong side of the split.At some level, that was probably inevitable. Even when he was winning — he finished first in the popular vote in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada — he wasn't capturing a majority. It would have been difficult in any scenario for Sanders to claim a majority of the delegates to the convention. Instead of risking an ugly floor fight in Milwaukee this summer, party leaders fell in line behind Biden.Now, Sanders needs a turnaround as abrupt as Biden's to make a comeback. After spending another campaign cycle bashing the ""establishment,"" alienating the party power-brokers who are now aligned behind Biden, that's a tall order.Biden's allies want to protect him from Sanders — and from Trump. The debate is a possible point of exposure for the former vice president.Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist who works with progressive candidates, said that's one good reason for her party not to prematurely end its primary.“We haven’t even seen him go one-on-one in a debate,” she said of Biden. “We once had a helluva field. We can’t have buyer’s remorse here.”In the NPR interview, Clyburn recalled that when Vice President George H.W. Bush's campaign attacked Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the Democratic nominee, in 1988 over a state prison furlough program, the issue had previously been raised by Al Gore, then a senator from Tennessee, in a Democratic primary debate.""People will say things,” Clyburn said, “that you cannot overcome.""For Sanders, the hope is that happens in time to reverse the course of the nomination fight.",Sanders divided Democrats and handed Biden the lion's share,Mar 11 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/sanders-divided-democrats-handed-biden-lion-s-share-n1155216,nbc

"WASHINGTON — No one needs to ""flatten the curve"" more than President Donald Trump, and he may have begun to bend the politics of coronavirus on Friday.Before Trump declared a national emergency, critics insisted, and some allies worried, that his response to the pandemic posed a greater threat to the health of the American public and the stability of the national economy than the disease itself.If the two-track crisis gets worse, his protestations that he's not to blame for a slow federal response — ""I don't take responsibility at all,"" he said — won't spare him the wrath of voters or the judgment of history. He will look like he shirked accountability after failing to see the threat as it gathered and then spread through society.But if Americans are able to slow the outbreak of coronavirus — to ""flatten the curve"" of infection, as epidemiologists say — if equity markets bounce back and the overall hit to the economy is contained, his Rose Garden news conference on Friday could amount to a turning point in which he finally signaled to the public that he would take the threat seriously enough to lead the fight against it.His relatively somber and focused remarks accompanied a bear hug of congressional Democrats that could help him stabilize his standing if all goes well from here on out. Graded on a curve, Friday was a good day for the president, according to longtime observers of Washington politics.""America only has one president at a time, and, whatever your partisan affiliation, you should want the one we have to be as efficient and successful as possible — especially in a crisis like this one,"" said Michael Steel, a former aide to then-Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceFor those watching the news conference on cable stations with stock-market tickers on the screen, it was obvious the president had done nothing to reverse a rally on Wall Street. It's hard to pin broad gains or losses on any single event, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped briefly during the president's remarks before gaining nearly 1,200 points while he continued through the closing bell.Trump's new attitude toward the coronavirus appeared to result from — or at least coincide with — a rare bipartisanship around the response from other officials in Washington.Little more than an hour after his declaration, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced that two days of intense negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over a second emergency spending bill on the coronavirus had produced a deal.""We are proud to have reached an agreement with the administration to resolve outstanding challenges, and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act,"" she said in a statement sent to the media. That came on the heels of a quick pivot from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the previous day, who went from attacking Pelosi's plan on the Senate floor to lauding her work with Mnuchin on Twitter in the span of a few hours. Trump was expected to sign off on the deal — though the ink wasn't quite dry yet.Likewise, Trump won praise from Democrats on Capitol Hill for declaring the national emergency, freeing up $50 billion in aid for states and granting extraordinary authorities to federal agencies to help the health care system respond to contingencies. As they worked with officials in his administration on emergency spending legislation, congressional Democrats had been troubled by the president's uneven public posture on a pandemic he often dismissed as ""low risk.""""We have a public health crisis in this country and the best way to help keep the American people safe and ensure their economic security is for the president to focus on fighting the spread of the coronavirus itself,"" Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement after Trump delivered an Oval Office address on the disease response Wednesday. ""Alarmingly, the president did not say how the administration will address the lack of coronavirus testing kits throughout the United States.""At the time, they called on him and Republican lawmakers to help them pass the legislation Pelosi negotiated with Mnuchin.But Trump's decision to give only his second-ever Oval Office address this week was taken by some observers, even amid his misstatements, as a strong signal that he wanted the public and investors to view him as taking the coronavirus threat very seriously.The slope of everything looked straight down, from historic market drops to suspended major league sports seasons and the availability of hand sanitizer.It's unlikely that Trump reversed all that by managing to complete a press conference without giving off the impression he's unconcerned about coronavirus.But right now, just flattening the curve a bit is a victory for him.",How Trump may have flattened the political curve of coronavirus,Mar 14 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/how-trump-may-have-flattened-political-curve-coronavirus-n1158616,nbc
"President Donald Trump on Friday announced a new series of measures to combat the coronavirus and treat those who are affected, while pushing back on criticism that his administration was unprepared to confront the pandemic.Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Trump declared a national emergency that could free up $50 billion to help fight the pandemic and said that he was empowering the secretary of Health and Human Services to waive certain laws and regulations to ensure the virus can be contained and patients treated.""To unleash the full power of the federal government … I am officially declaring a national emergency,"" Trump said.""Two very big words,"" he added.Trump said the action would ""open up access"" to up to $50 billion ""for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.""Flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top federal officials and corporate executives from companies such as Walmart, Trump said that the ability to waive certain laws and regulations would allow for easier admission to nursing homes and end limits on the length of hospital stays and the number of beds available.Trump: We are in 'very strong shape' to provide necessary coronavirus testsMarch 13, 202002:35He announced that 1.4 million new tests for the coronavirus would be available next week and that 5 million would be available within the next month — although he added that ""I doubt we'll need that"" quantity. He also said there were plans to allow ""drive-thru"" virus tests.In an unusual and lengthy news conference, a parade of business leaders took turns speaking after Trump — before the president and other federal officials made additional key announcements related to the administration’s coronavirus response.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakTrump shook hands with several of those business leaders as he introduced them at the lectern — a breach of best practices recommended by public health experts across the United States.After the corporate leaders spoke, Trump and other officials finally announced additional measures to confront the pandemic, which included the waiving of interest on federal student loans and the purchase of “large quantities” of oil for the U.S. strategic oil reserve. Officials also said they would be offering guidance to suspend all visitations to nursing homes, with exceptions being made only for end-of-life situations.Nevertheless, the stock market — which had in recent days fallen 20 percent from its latest high, delving formally to bear territory — reacted favorably to the announcement.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose steadily as Trump spoke and closed for the day up nearly 2,000 points, or 9.4 percent.Trump, seen in photographs to have been in close proximity with people who have since tested positive for the coronavirus, also suggested Friday he would “most likely” get tested for the disease.Let our news meet your inbox.

Plans for the emergency declaration were first reported by Bloomberg News.Under the Stafford Act, an ""infectious disease emergency declaration"" by the president would allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide disaster relief funding to state and local governments, as well as federal assistance to support the coronavirus response. The law allows the agency to circumvent legal barriers to more quickly distribute such aid.Emergency declarations are most often used in the event of natural disasters, but can also be applied to disease outbreaks.The president had tweeted earlier about the Friday press conference amid the rapid spread of the virus and as the White House has scrambled to craft a strategy to shift Trump's response to the outbreak, which had been focused on downplaying the threat and accusing the media of creating undue concern.Trump has come under increasing fire in recent weeks over his response to the outbreak while his administration weathered criticism for the lack of coronavirus testing being done compared with other countries.Asked Friday at his press conference by NBC News’ Kristen Welker whether he should take responsibility for the failure to disseminate larger quantities of tests earlier, Trump declined.""I don't take responsibility at all,” he said.Trump also responded testily to a question from another reporter about a decision made by the administration in 2018 to disband the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense — a unit sometimes referred to as the White House pandemic office.Trump called the question “nasty” and replied, “I didn’t do it.”“You say we did that, I don't know anything about it,” Trump said.In addition to having insisted for weeks that he had the outbreak under control, Trump has also propagated personal beliefs about the coronavirus that contradict those of veteran health officials and experts.As panic began to set in over the outbreak, Trump tried to quell the fears of Americans across the country by giving a speech from the Oval Office on Wednesday night. He announced that he would ban many foreign travelers from Europe for the next 30 days and offered a series of economic relief actions to help workers and companies deal with the outbreak. But his speech was met with swift pushback after he misstated several aspects of the policy and failed to propose any new action to combat the outbreak domestically.Health officials in recent days have sounded the alarm, warning the public that the outbreak is likely to get worse. Many major public events, including all NBA, NHL, MLB and Major League Soccer preseason games and Broadway shows, have been canceled this week, and Thursday saw the Dow's worst day since the 1987 crash.Wall Street, however, rallied Friday, bouncing firmly back after lawmakers and the White House appeared close to finalizing an economic relief package to address the coronavirus pandemic.",Trump declares national emergency to combat the coronavirus,Mar 13 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-hold-friday-afternoon-press-conference-coronavirus-n1157981,nbc

"WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump jetted back to Washington on Monday after a weekend of golfing and fundraising in Florida, an intervention was awaiting him at the White House.Administration officials, increasingly concerned about the messaging on and response to the coronavirus, had spent the weekend scrambling to craft a strategy to shift the president's response, which had been focused on downplaying the threat and accusing the media of creating undue concern, according to people involved in the effort.So, as Trump stepped off Marine One and walked straight to the West Wing just after 3 p.m. Monday, his top economic and health officials were waiting to make their case for why a more serious fiscal and public health response was urgently needed. Those at the meeting included economic adviser Larry Kudlow, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin.Shortly after the meeting wrapped, Trump appeared ready to start taking a stronger approach — at least compared to the one he had offered that morning, when he likened the coronavirus to the seasonal flu, tweeting of the flu that ""nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on.""He made an impromptu visit to the White House briefing room that evening, just the fifth time he has appeared behind the podium, telling reporters he was considering a payroll tax cut and promising ""dramatic"" and ""major"" economic steps.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakThose remarks Monday night marked the beginning of a notable, if uneven, shift in the president's tone as the scope of the crisis he was dealing with began to sink in, culminating just over 48 hours later in an Oval Office address warning the nation of a ""horrible infection.""Beyond the input of concerned advisers, a constellation of events over the past week — from tumbling stocks to the rising death toll and the World Health Organization's official declaration of a pandemic — played a role in prompting Trump to shift to a more somber tone, an administration official said.It resulted in presidential statements in stark contrast to remarks just two weeks earlier, when Trump had predicted that the United States would soon have zero cases of the illness, despite warnings from his own health officials that the virus' spread across the nation wasn't a matter of if but when.We apologize, this video has expired.Normal life comes to a halt for Americans in response to coronavirusMarch 13, 202002:08As Trump left Washington last Friday for his Mar-a-Lago resort, he stopped at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where he touted the administration's response and mused about not wanting to let passengers on a stranded cruise ship back in the U.S. because it would reflect poorly on the statistics.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service""I like the numbers being where they are. I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship,"" Trump told reporters.Over the weekend, he golfed with players from the Washington Nationals and raised $10 million in a series of fundraisers. During a dinner with the president of Brazil, Trump told reporters Saturday night that he wouldn't be canceling his crowded political rallies.On Sunday, while Trump was at his Palm Beach golf course, Pence was about an hour away meeting with cruise industry executives about the coronavirus threat.Back in Washington, aides had grown frustrated with Trump's consistent bids to downplay the severity of the outbreak. A person close to the White House said the president believed it helped him politically to keep projecting a positive picture, rather than leaving the messaging to public health officials.But Trump's week started with a jolt. Oil markets crashed overnight and stocks plunged so much at the start of trading Monday that it tripped a New York Stock Exchange circuit breaker aimed at preventing a broader panic by investors. Trump tried to put a positive spin on the events that morning, tweeting that tumbling oil prices would mean cheaper gas for consumers.The next day, he traveled to Capitol Hill, where Republican senators warned him about the negative impact the crash in oil prices would have on the U.S. oil industry and the risk to the nation's economy as a whole.The same day, even his own campaign advisers — who had previously downplayed the need to change his schedule — pressed Trump not to announce a planned rally in Florida because of fears of the virus' spread. The president initially pushed back on the request.But it came amid news of a cascade in new infections, with states taking swift action, such as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's move to send in the National Guard to try to contain an outbreak in a New York City suburb.The virus also began affecting Trump's inner circle. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who flew back from Florida to Washington with Trump on Monday, learned midflight that he had interacted with an infected patient and would need to self-quarantine immediately.By Wednesday morning, when WHO declared that the coronavirus was officially a pandemic, White House aides began discussing the possibility of an Oval Office address. Trump tweeted out that he would be speaking to the nation later that night.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakIn the runup to his prime-time speech, the White House rushed to put restrictions on travel from Europe in place — without informing European leaders, who were furious over being blindsided by the move. Trump said the affected countries hadn't been notified because ""we had to make a decision, and I didn't want to take time and — you know, it takes a long time to make the individual calls.""The hastily assembled speech was full of statements the administration had to correct and clarify soon after. Trump erroneously said trade would be affected by the travel restrictions. He also said all travel from Europe would be banned, even though the new restrictions apply only to foreign nationals who have traveled through some European countries. His claim that insurance copayments for coronavirus treatment would be waived was contradicted by health insurers themselves, who said the waiver would apply only to testing.The stumbles, people close to the White House acknowledged, detracted from the intended effect of the address: portraying Trump as a commander in chief steering the country through a crisis.On Thursday, Trump's Twitter account took on a much more serious tone, retweeting warnings from public health officials about how people could protect themselves, as both the White House and his campaign weighed allowing staffers to work from home. But as with many previous Trump tone shifts, his attempt at a more traditional presidential approach was inconsistent and impermanent.Meanwhile, one of the nation's top health officials was telling lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the federal response was falling short on a key front, with the nation failing to meet the necessary capacity for coronavirus testing. That didn't keep Trump from heaping praise on his own response Thursday.""Because of what I did and what the administration did with China, we have 32 deaths at this point. Other countries that are smaller countries have many, many deaths,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with the Irish prime minister.""Thirty-two is a lot. Thirty-two is too many,"" he said. ""But when you look at the kind of numbers that you're seeing coming out of other countries, it's pretty amazing when you think of it.""",Behind Trump's coronavirus shift,Mar 12 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/behind-trump-s-coronavirus-shift-n1157321,nbc
"WASHINGTON — Underdog Bernie Sanders came to fight, and front-runner Joe Biden promised a woman vice presidential candidate.The Democratic debate Sunday began as a genteel conversation over how to address the coronavirus and descended into a testy battle over records and who has the courage to do the right thing. The candidates clashed over issues from bankruptcy policy and same-sex marriage to health care and immigration, highlighting their differing visions for the country.The debate was hosted by CNN and Univision in the nation's capital with no live audience and 6 feet between the candidates' podiums. There was no handshake as the two men instead elbow-bumped to practice social distancing as the coronavirus ravages the U.S. and shuts down much of American public life.Here are five key takeaways from the evening.Biden promises a female running mateFor the first time, Biden committed Sunday to selecting a woman to be his running mate if he's the Democratic nominee, adding that he wants his Cabinet to look like the diverse country.""I would pick a woman to be my vice president,"" he said.Sanders said he was inclined to pick a woman but stopped short of an ironclad promise, saying it's important that his running mate is progressive.

Biden pointedly said he'd call on the military to help address the crisis, while Sanders said the use of the National Guard might be appropriate.Biden followed a familiar playbook — accept Sanders' concerns but resist his prescriptions. He said that his rival was right about the broken health care system but that single payer was not the solution; he said that economic inequality was a real issue but that the imminent crisis required a targeted solution in the form of ""a major, major, major bailout package"" that rewards individuals, not corporations.Biden was also eager to defuse the tension as he courts Sanders' supporters, saying at one point, ""I don't want to get this into a back and forth in terms of our politics."" The former vice president, who is trying to unite the party behind him, let it be known on several occasions when he agreed with Sanders.Sanders: Pandemic exposes 'incredible weakness' of health care systemMarch 16, 202001:30Sanders draws blood on Social SecurityThe most heated part of the debate came when Sanders tore into Biden for a litany of past positions — his stance on the 2005 bankruptcy law (which Biden has agreed to try to unwind), his vote to authorize the Iraq war, his support for the Defense of Marriage Act in the '90s. He also knocked Biden for supporting efforts that would have cut Social Security, such as the Bowles-Simpson commission and balanced budget amendments.""You're an honest guy. Why don't you just tell them the truth here?"" Sanders said in a feisty clash full of interruptions and cries of ""Bernie!"" and ""Joe!""""We did not cut it,"" Biden said.""I know, because people like me helped stop it,"" Sanders retorted.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsSanders said Biden lacked the courage to take difficult stances when they were unpopular. Biden said Sanders had previously voted against background checks for gun sales and to grant immunity to firearm manufacturers (two positions the senator from Vermont has since disavowed).""He's making it hard for me now — I was trying to give him credit for some things,"" Biden quipped, saying that when it comes to addressing climate change, ""we disagree on the detail of how we do it. But we don't disagree on the principle.""Sanders evokes ObamaIt was a role reversal: When Biden tore into Sanders for opposing the 2007 immigration bill that would have granted undocumented people a pathway to citizenship, Sanders name-checked President Barack Obama in reference to the so-called Dorgan amendment, which gutted the guest-worker program and ultimately derailed the measure in the Senate.""Y'know who voted with me on that one, Joe? Barack Obama,"" Sanders said.He was correct that Obama, then in the Senate, voted for the amendment, but he neglected to mention what happened next: Obama voted ""yes"" to advance the legislation to a final vote, while Sanders voted ""no"" and joined the coalition that killed it.Team Trump was watching BidenThe Trump campaign kept an eagle eye on Biden during the debate in the hope of amassing an opposition research file on its likely general election opponent. It has paid special attention to his verbal stumbles in recent public events, and it delighted Sunday in pointing out mid-debate that the former vice president, who overcame a speech impediment as a young man, got tongue-tied early on and called the H1N1 virus the ""N1H1"" virus.An aide to President Donald Trump also highlighted Biden's suggestion that he'd limit deportations to people who have committed felonies, a sign that the president may try to weaponize the issue in the fall.",5 takeaways from the Democratic debate,Mar 16 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/5-takeaways-democratic-debate-joe-biden-promises-woman-vp-n1160001,nbc

If you are in an area where there's clear community spread, you have to be much, much more intense about how you do that,” he said on “Meet the Press” yesterday.“I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting,” he also said on “Meet” yesterday, adding: “I think Americans should be prepared that they're going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing.”And here was Fauci on CNN: “I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and in bars.”Data Download: The number of the day is … 50 people or more50 people or more.Let our news meet your inbox.

We don't want to be getting in the habit of messing around with them,” Sanders began, before bringing up the precedent of the postponed New York primary after 9/11. “I would hope governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is, you just indicated, we don't want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Sanders said. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people – all that stuff. It does not make a lot of sense. I'm not sure that it does.”The Lid: Going the (social) distanceDon’t miss the pod from Friday, when we wondered how campaigning can go on in a world of social distancing.ICYMI: News clips you shouldn’t missSahil Kapur offers his takeaways from last night’s debate.Biden pledged to pick a female running mate, while Sanders said he’s likely to do the same.And the former vice president is shifting his stances on free college and bankruptcy in an effort to reach out to progressives.The Fed is slashing interest rates to zero.Andrew Gillum is entering rehab.Trump Agenda: In like FlynnTrump says he’s “strongly considering” pardoning Michael Flynn.The president’s superfans are starting to fracture over the virus.Governors like J.B.

"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Former Florida candidate for governor Andrew Gillum disclosed Sunday that he is entering a rehabilitation facility, saying he had fallen into a depression and alcohol abuse after losing his bid for the state’s highest post.The Democrat’s statement came days after Gillum was named in a South Florida police report Friday that said he was “inebriated” and initially unresponsive in a hotel room along with a male companion where authorities found baggies of suspected crystal methamphetamine.Gillum, the former Tallahassee mayor who ran for governor in 2018, was not charged with any crime. The Miami Beach police report said Gillum was allowed to leave the hotel for home after he was checked out medically.Gillum said in his statement Sunday night that he resolved to seek help after conversations with his family and deep reflection, calling the decision “a wake-up call for me.”“Since my race for governor ended, I fell into a depression that has led to alcohol abuse,” he said, pledging to work to “heal fully and show up in the world as a more complete person.”He said he would be stepping down from “all public facing roles” at this time.Let our news meet your inbox.

Police say Gillum and two other men were in the hotel room.“Mr. Gillum was unable to communicate due to his inebriated state,” the police report said.Police say one of the men came into the hotel room and found Gillum and Travis Dyson, 30, apparently under the influence of an “unknown substance.” Officials began chest compressions on Dyson and he was taken to a hospital, where authorities say he is in stable condition.Gillum had stable medical signs when authorities returned for a welfare check and was allowed to leave the hotel for home, according to the police report.Gillum was the first black nominee in a major political party to run for governor in Florida. He lost narrowly to Republican Ron DeSantis in the 2018 election.Since then, Gillum has mounted an effort to register Democratic voters in Florida and frequently appears on cable news channels as a political commentator.In 2019, the Florida Commission on Ethics found probable cause that Gillum violated state ethics laws when he accepted gifts during out-of-town excursions with lobbyists and vendors and failed to report them. This included tickets to a performance of the musical “Hamilton.” A settlement of $5,000 was agreed to in that case.",Ex-Florida gov. candidate Andrew Gillum to enter rehab for alcohol abuse,Mar 16 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/ex-florida-gov-candidate-andrew-gillum-enter-rehab-alcohol-abuse-n1160161,nbc
"The nation's response to the coronavirus outbreak dominated much of the discussion in the 11th Democratic debate on Sunday night — the first time that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders went head to head on stage in the 2020 election cycle.Also a first: Biden vowing to name a woman as his running mate if he wins the nomination.The former vice president and Vermont independent senator squared off in dramatically different surroundings than initially planned, Washington instead of Phoenix, and in CNN's studio instead of a 5,000-seat theater with a live audience — a venue change prompted by coronavirus fears as the nation goes into lockdown over the pandemic.Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination following a string of state primary victories since winning in South Carolina last month.

"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden's campaign rolled out two new policy positions that borrow from Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren ahead of Sunday's debate, both aimed at courting progressive voters as he marches to the Democratic nomination.The former vice president said Sunday he'll support a policy to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for students with family incomes under $125,000.The position is a significant shift in the direction of Sanders, the senator from Vermont who wrote a bill to the same effect in 2017 but has since called for free college to be universal regardless of household income. Biden's new stance mirrors a policy plank that Hillary Clinton announced in summer 2016 with the similar aim of reaching out to Sanders voters after she defeated him.Biden leads Sanders by 2-to-1 margin among Democratic primary votersMarch 15, 202001:43Let our news meet your inbox.

The reversal of his position on bankruptcy echoes his U-turn on some tough-on-crime positions that he successfully fought for in 1994 but which voters have since turned against.Biden's recent shifts track the direction of a Democratic electorate that has been embracing more progressive positions since the last time the former vice president was on the ballot in 2012, and they aim to show liberals and younger voters that he can be a vehicle to advance their causes.Sanders addressed his rival's new policy Sunday, saying in a statement that it is ""great that Joe Biden is now supporting a position that was in the Democratic platform four years ago."" He called on him to ""go much further"" by endorsing universal free college, canceling all student debt and taxing ""Wall Street speculation.""Sanders' prospects of winning the nomination have dimmed in the last two weeks. He has said in recent days that he will press Biden on numerous issues at the debate, including how to address the issues that liberal Democratic voters care about if he becomes president.""Joe Biden will make it clear to Senator Sanders' supporters that there's space for them and that we welcome their support,"" a senior Biden campaign adviser said, previewing the debate.

"WASHINGTON — The last time Democrats debated, Bernie Sanders had just won two consecutive states and Joe Biden’s campaign was on the brink of collapse. The two men will debate one-on-one Sunday in a transformed campaign landscape.The stage has shrunk from six to two candidates, Biden has taken a dominant lead in the race, and the coronavirus outbreak has ground much of American public life to a halt. Biden and Sanders have been forced to cancel their rallies and host online events instead, while the party moved Sunday's debate from Phoenix to CNN's Washington studio to avoid cross-country travel.After crushing the field in South Carolina and two successive Tuesdays of victories across the country, Biden leads by about 150 delegates, which will be so difficult to erase that some party elites are already treating him as the presumptive nominee.Here are five things to watch at Sunday night's faceoff.1. Who wins the coronavirus clash?Americans are desperate to know when normal life will resume after the virus has shuttered schools, businesses and sports leagues, causing layoffs and sending stocks tumbling. Biden and Sanders won’t have good answers for them, but they’ll be looking to offer themselves as a foil to a president who they say has catastrophically mishandled the pandemic.Watch for the two men to sell Americans on why they’d be best to deal with such an emergency.Biden has presented himself as a steady leader with the experience to handle a crisis. Sanders has said the outbreak underscores the need for universal health care, his signature policy issue, arguing that such a system would leave the U.S. better prepared to save lives.Let our news meet your inbox.

Will Biden make concessions to progressives?Biden has already begun speaking like the nominee and positioning himself as a uniter. He has cemented the support of moderate Democrats, but has a long way to go before winning the trust of many progressives, who view him as a milquetoast moderate who’s too wedded to the status quo to meaningfully improve the lives of struggling Americans.The former vice president made one notable concession Friday at a virtual town hall with Illinois voters: He endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan, which restores protections removed in a Biden-backed 2005 law that let young people discharge student debt in bankruptcy. It was a major reversal for Biden, and an outstretched hand to progressives.Keep an eye out for more possible olive branches.“He will make overtures to Bernie and to his supporters to show that there’s space for them on Team Biden,” a Biden aide told NBC News. “We are extremely aware of the need to unite the party.”3. Will Sanders be kind or scorch the earth?Biden-allied Democrats are desperate to end the primary and turn their attention to the faceoff with President Donald Trump. Many are nervous about a possible repeat of 2016, with a protracted primary battle that gets ugly and leaves the nominee wounded. Sanders has promised to steer clear of personal attacks and stick to debating the issues, and he made clear Wednesday he intends to challenge Biden in the debate on medical bankruptcies, climate change and billionaires trying to buy elections.The Vermont senator has dominated with primary voters under 45, who have been outmatched at the ballot box by older Democrats but will be key for Biden in the fall. Sanders has said that winning their support requires embracing their preferred policies.""I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,"" he said Wednesday. ""And you must speak to the issues of concern to them.”Sanders to Democratic establishment: You must win voters who represent the futureMarch 11, 202004:294. Will Trump keep 'defending' Sanders?Trump has sought to maximize chaos among Democrats by claiming — with no evidence — that the Democratic National Committee is conspiring to stop Sanders from claiming the nomination. It’s a repeat of his 2016 playbook, aimed at nudging Sanders supporters to stay home or vote for a third-party candidate in the fall and enable his re-election.As he coasts to renomination with no serious Republican competition, the president has developed a knack for playing pundit in the Democratic primary. Expect that to continue during Sunday’s debate — and watch to see how Sanders responds. So far, the senator has brushed back Trump’s attempts to manufacture Democratic unrest, and vowed to support the party's nominee this fall.5. How long will Sanders stay in?Sanders said last Sunday on ABC’s ""This Week"" that he’s “not a masochist who wants to stay in the race that can't be won.” How does he define a winnable contest? He still has a mathematical possibility of becoming the nominee, but that outcome would require a precipitous Biden collapse and Sanders victories by wide margins in the remaining primaries. There’s no hint of that happening. Sanders may drop some clues in the debate about his potential exit strategy.",5 things to watch in the Biden-Sanders debate,Mar 15 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/5-things-watch-biden-sanders-debate-amid-coronavirus-crisis-n1159081,nbc
"WASHINGTON — With the Democratic nomination race now down to a one-on-one contest between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Democratic primary voters now back Biden — who was a distant second to Sanders just one month ago — by an overwhelming 2-to-1 ratio, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.The survey found that 61 percent of Democratic voters support Biden, while just 32 percent back Sanders. Four percent choose Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who has not yet dropped out of the race despite failing to finish in the top three in any state primary or caucus.Biden's surge of more than 45 percentage points in four weeks shows how quickly he became the consensus choice of Democratic voters as the field narrowed to just two major candidates. The NBC News/WSJ poll in February, which was conducted before Biden's decisive win in the South Carolina primary changed the trajectory of the race, found Sanders besting Biden, 27 percent to 15 percent, while candidates who have since dropped out — former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — divided the rest of the vote.All of those candidates except Warren have since thrown their support behind Biden.Democratic voters are also significantly more likely than they were last month to say they are enthusiastic about Biden's campaign. In February, just 13 percent said they were enthusiastic about him, while 43 percent said they were merely comfortable, and a combined 43 percent said they had reservations or were uncomfortable. Now, 37 percent say they're enthusiastic about Biden, 37 percent say they are comfortable, and just 25 percent express reservations or discomfort.For Sanders, less has changed since February. This month, a combined 66 percent of Democratic voters say they are either enthusiastic (27 percent) or comfortable (39 percent) with him. Last month, it was a combined 65 percent.Let our news meet your inbox.

Among voters under 35, just a quarter chose Biden, while 7-in-10 pick Sanders.Biden leads Trump by 9 points in a one-to-one matchupAmong all registered voters, Biden leads President Donald Trump outside the poll's margin of error in a head-to-head contest.

He is also the overwhelming choice of nonwhite voters, getting support from 70 percent of Latinos and 84 percent of black voters.Trump receives majority support from white voters (51 percent), men (53 percent) and white voters without college degrees (57 percent).Among suburban voters, Biden gets 49 percent, while Trump gets 45 percent.And among voters in 2016 swing states, Biden gets 50 percent, while Trump gets 42 percent.Still, Trump continues to enjoy the most fervent support from his backers. Among all voters, 27 percent say they're enthusiastic about his candidacy, compared with 15 percent for Biden and 13 percent for Sanders.But nearly half of all voters — 48 percent — say they're very uncomfortable with his run. That's compared with 31 percent who say the same of Biden and 42 percent who say the same of Sanders.The NBC News/WSJ live-caller poll was conducted March 11-13, 2020.

In answering that question, he has given variations on wanting or hoping to choose a woman running mate — but never gave such a clear-cut commitment until now.Biden has enjoyed getting that question on the trail in part because it has allowed him to pivot to discussing, often at considerable length, what made his working relationship  with President Barack Obama so effective. He often says historians considered their relationship one of the best working relationships between a president and vice president in history, and adds that the reason they worked so well together is because Obama had complete trust in him and their views were “simpatico,” to use one of his favorite words.Among the current or former officials Biden has either explicitly or implicitly included in his list of potential VP picks are Sen.

President Donald Trump said Monday that the outbreak could be contained by July, August, or potentially later in the year.Asked about the possibility of postponing elections, Trump told reporters he thought such measures were ""unnecessary.""""I'd leave that up to the states, that's a big deal postponing an election,"" he said.Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a statement that he supported the recommendation to postpone the primary.""Extending an election is an unprecedented step, so we as a party are weighing alternatives on how to best do so — including the possibility to conduct the primary election entirely by vote-by-mail, as is done in several other states, with a deadline much earlier than June 2,"" Pepper said. ""This could better serve the interests of Ohio voters and the primary process that is already well underway, and we will consider offering those alternatives to the court once the case is filed.""Soon after the push from Ohio leaders, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections said the state was moving forward with its Tuesday vote.""As already noted, much of the voting for this election already has been done,"" the spokesman said. ""Also, at this point there is no date in the foreseeable future when we can expect greater safety with any certainty. Taking action to move to an all-mail ballot system, as has been suggested by some media members, fails to take into account the needs of many disabled voters who are unable to cast paper ballots by mail.""Later Monday, Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams announced his state's primaries would be pushed back from May 19 to June 23.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakOn Sunday, former Vice President Joe Biden asked voters in the four primary states scheduled to weigh in this week to ""please vote."" At the time, all four states had already announced that the elections would go on as planned, but with added precautions taken.In a joint statement Friday, the secretaries of state for those states said those precautions included moving polling locations out of retirement homes and nursing facilities to protect older residents.""Unlike concerts, sporting events or other mass gatherings where large groups of people travel long distances to congregate in a confined space for an extended period of time, polling locations see people from a nearby community coming into and out of the building for a short duration,"" the officials said.""Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday,"" they continued.The election officials asked those who did not feel well to stay away from the polls. Residents, they said, should vote early or cast ballots by mail if possible.DeWine had told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that his state was ""going to go ahead"" with the election, advising voters then to ""be careful.""",Ohio primary thrust into chaos after governor defies judge's decision not to delay election,Mar 17 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/ohio-governor-calls-state-postpone-tuesday-s-primary-elections-n1160816,nbc

"Joe Biden has vowed to choose a woman as his running mate if he's the Democratic presidential nominee. Here's a look at a shortlist of frequently mentioned potential candidates — each of whom would bring something different to the ticket.It just depends on what the former vice president is looking for — age, ideology, race, experience and geography could all matter.1. Kamala HarrisBiden became the 2020 Democratic front-runner in the first place largely because of the overwhelming support he's received from African American voters.Key Democratic groups, as well as the powerful Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., have not been reluctant to suggest that Biden would be wise to choose a woman of color as his running mate — and one of the top names mentioned has been Harris, including by Clyburn himself.Biden commits to picking woman as his vice presidentMarch 16, 202000:30Harris, 55, a senator from California, would help balance a ticket led by a 77-year-old white man and could help further cement the party's relationship with the most loyal Democratic voters in the country (94 percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in 2016, according to exit polls).She may, however, face continued questions over her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, including a controversial decision to prosecute parents of truant children and an appeal of a California court ruling that had declared the death penalty unconstitutional.A recent internal poll of members conducted by She the People, a group of women of color, found Harris to be one of two top contenders.2. Stacey AbramsAbrams is regarded as a rising star in the party, and her presence on the ticket, political strategists told NBC News, could electrify voter turnout in Georgia, which could help put either of the state's Senate seats in play (there are elections for both this fall).And at 46, she would create important generational balance on the ticket and might even help Biden draw in younger Democratic voters — many of whom have opted for Bernie Sanders during the primaries.But Abrams is also likely to face concerns over not being qualified to step in if Biden became unable to carry out his duties as commander in chief.Abrams, the former minority leader of the Georgia state House, who narrowly lost her bid for governor in 2018 amid widespread claims of voter suppression, was the other top contender in the She the People internal poll — and the personal preference of the group's leader.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service""On a personal note, I believe the most qualified candidate for VP is the country is a progressive woman of color: Stacey Abrams,"" said Aimee Allison, the founder and president of She the People.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics3. Amy KlobucharThe senator from Minnesota, who as a presidential candidate frequently pitched her crossover appeal with GOP voters, could help Biden build his own electability message with disaffected Republicans unhappy with Trump.She also might boost Biden's prospects in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which, like Klobuchar's home state, are upper Midwest battlegrounds crucial for a path to victory.Klobuchar's decision to drop out and endorse Biden ahead of Super Tuesday was credited with helping him quickly consolidate the moderate faction of the Democratic Party and cruise to a series of critical victories.Klobuchar, however, wouldn't bring a lot of balance to the ticket, Democratic political strategist Joel Payne said.""Philosophically, she is maybe too much of the same thing as Joe Biden,"" Payne said.Payne also suggested that passing over African American women like Harris and Abrams risks ""reinforcing some of the negative thinking about how African American voters are treated as part of the Democratic coalition — that they are leveraged for turnout but not prioritized.""4. Elizabeth WarrenThe senator from Massachusetts has the clear progressive bona fides needed to bring in voters from that wing of the party.And Biden, in recent days, has begun actively courting them, having endorsed Warren's proposal to bolster bankruptcy protections for people struggling financially.Warren wouldn't face any questions about her readiness to take over for Biden.But Biden has explicitly pitched himself as ""a bridge"" to a new generation of Democratic candidates. And while Warren proved to have mass appeal among younger progressive voters, at 70, she might not be in the best position to be the future face of a post-Biden party.5. Gretchen WhitmerThe Michigan governor turned heads after delivering the Democratic Party response to Trump's State of the Union address last month.Her age — 48 — gives her the ability to be the future of the party, while her standing as a governor dispels any notion that she wouldn't be able to step in for Biden. And her being from an upper Midwest swing state bodes well for the geographic mix of the ticket.One possible issue? She said Monday she didn't think she'd be the one.""It's not going to be me,"" Whitmer said during an interview on MSNBC.Other contendersOther women who have been frequently mentioned by politicians, strategists and voters include Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., who commanded attention as a House manager during Trump's impeachment trial; Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., the preference of former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid; New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham; and New Hampshire's pair of senators, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan.Adam Edelman reported from New York and Alex Seitz-Wald from Washington, D.C.CORRECTION (March 16, 2020, 8:50 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the party to which Rep. Val Demings of Florida belongs.

"WASHINGTON — For the first time Monday, President Donald Trump laid out a truly bleak picture of America in the time of coronavirus — pointing to an ""invisible enemy"" he said could plunge the nation's economy into recession and possibly even require quarantines of geographic ""hot spots,"" if not the whole country.The abrupt shift in tone matched a more gradual acceptance by the president that his response to the pandemic so far has failed to inspire confidence in the public, investors and lawmakers. Last week, he delivered an Oval Office address and a Rose Garden press conference that sent the mixed signal he was taking the threat of the disease more seriously, yet still didn't fully grasp the risk at hand.His salesman's tendency to minimize the downside and play up the bright side left him looking like he couldn't judge the gravity or complexity of a situation that his own aides described in catastrophic terms.By Monday, with more experienced federal and state officials proposing new restrictions on public interactions and economic relief packages in the hundreds of billions of dollars, Trump had largely dispensed with the happy talk.

"MIAMI — In the months leading to the presidential primaries Tuesday in Florida and Arizona, the names Fidel Castro and Joe Arpaio have become part of the mix for Latino voters as they choose between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.But the escalating coronavirus pandemic has made the issues surrounding the late Cuban communist leader and the ex-sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, secondary to whether to venture to the polls at all.Florida and Arizona, as well as Illinois are going forward with their primaries despite the national emergency over the outbreak; Ohio's governor called for the primaries to be postponed. State and county officials have said they are taking precautions such as cleaning polling stations and closing voting locations with vulnerable populations, such as nursing and retirement homes.Latinos make up 20.5 percent of eligible voters in Florida and 23.6 percent in Arizona, according to the Pew Research Center.In Florida, fierce opposition to communism and socialism has contributed to many Latinos rejecting Sanders' ""political revolution,"" while in Arizona, what critics view as racist policing and anti-immigrant tactics by Arpaio has mobilized a generation of Latinos who want more than a decade of Republican policies reversed.Dem candidates debate amid coronavirus outbreakMarch 16, 202007:26Biden is the clear leader in the nomination race, and polls don’t offer much hope for Sanders' chances of turning things around, especially in Florida.The primaries provide a chance to see whether Sanders can still grab large chunks of the Latino electorate in Arizona and possibly Illinois as he did in Nevada, California and Texas. Biden meanwhile must show he is becoming the preferred candidate of Latinos of all ages, not just older Latinos as he has been in other primaries.In Illinois and Ohio, Latinos are 11.6 percent and 2.7 percent of the electorate. Illinois, however has almost as many voting-eligible Latinos — 1.1 million, mostly in the Chicago area — as Arizona, where there are an estimated 1.2 million.RelatedNewsNewsLatino groups to Florida: Voting materials for Spanish speakers 'is the law'In Tucson, Arizona, Jacky Vazquez, 19, was trying to decide last week who would get her vote. She said she was leaning toward Sanders, but was doing her own research because ""no one tells me what my views are."" She had only been contacted by the campaign of Mike Bloomberg, who has dropped out and endorsed Biden.""I'm really focused on immigration ... and that is something that decides who I vote for, and I manage my family's business and anything that is for small-business owners, that's what decides my vote,"" she said.She gets her ballot by mail and planned to walk it to her precinct on Tuesday. ""I know people are worried about the virus but dropping off my ballot is going to take me a few minutes, a small action that is important for me and my community,"" she said. She added she's following other measures to keep her and her family healthy.Sanders 'should have known better'In a poll for Telemundo by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy, 48 percent of Florida Latinos surveyed said they’d vote for Biden and 37 percent for Sanders, while 12 percent remained undecided.Before this primary, Sanders angered the large voting bloc of Cuban Americans — about half of whom voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the 2016 election. In a recent ""60 Minutes"" interview, Sanders said that the reason many Cubans didn't challenge Castro and help the U.S. overthrow him is because ""he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed society.""Sanders' praise for the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua in the 1980s, his refusal to call Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro a dictator and his characterization of Evo Morales’ exit from the Bolivian presidency as a ""coup"" has also been criticized by some Florida Latinos whose families fled leftist-authoritarian Latin American countries.Outraged Democrats in the state, whose constituents are known to split votes between parties, quickly repudiated the comments, hoping to distance themselves as they seek their own re-elections amid GOP hammering of all Democrats as ""socialists.""Eduardo Siman, 37, said his family left El Salvador after the country's bitter civil war, whose leftist insurgency would not have been funded ""if it weren't for Castro."" Originally a Pete Buttigieg supporter, Siman cast an ballot for Biden, saying the former vice president “carries all the values of a centrist platform.”The Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceJoe Biden speaks about the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic at an event in Wilmington, Del. on March 12, 2020.Carlos Barria / ReutersSenior Biden campaign adviser Cristobal Alex told NBC News that the former vice president has a better record with Latinos than Sanders. ""We as a campaign need to be sure we are sharing that message,"" Alex said, criticizing Sanders' record not just on foreign policy but ""his vote against immigration reform or position on gun manufacturers.""But some Florida voters say they support the Vermont senator's message.Carmen Plasencia, 40, a Cuban American from Tampa, told NBC News that Sanders “should have known better” than to make the comments about Castro and should be “more connected to the trauma and the pain that people from Cuba have faced.”But Plasencia, a single mother who works as a masseuse and yoga instructor, said she remains supportive of Sanders because “he is for the people.” Unlike her father, who worked as a landscaper and could buy a home, she said she doesn't have that opportunity.In Sunday night's debate, Sanders was asked why Cuban American voters in Florida would support him in light of the praise of the politics of a dictator ""who jailed, tortured and killed thousands of Cubans."" Sanders said he “opposed authoritarianism everywhere.”“We condemn authoritarianism whether it’s in China, Russia, Cuba, anyplace else. But to simply say that nothing ever done by any of those administrations had a positive impact on their people would, I think, be incorrect,” Sanders said.Florida's growing Puerto Rican voteThe state has had an influx of Puerto Ricans during the past 10 years after the island's economy collapsed and especially after the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017. (As U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans who move to the mainland can register to vote in state and national elections.)Stephanie Ramirez, 26, a Port St. Lucie resident who was born in Puerto Rico, said that her salary as a credentialing analyst disqualifies her for the Affordable Care Act, yet private health insurance is too expensive.Although Sanders’ values on health care and education appeal to her, she said she doesn’t think they’re realistic.“Health care is important, and it pulls me toward Biden,” Ramirez said.Sanders' senior adviser Chuck Rocha said that in Illinois, the campaign has focused on reminding Puerto Ricans that the U.S. government has bailed out Wall Street, but has been unwilling to bail out the island as it grapples with its $70 billion debt.Courting Arizona's mobilized LatinosArizona's Latinos are more likely to be Mexican American, and they have felt directly targeted by Trump and state-elected Republicans, said Tucson Mayor Regina Romero, the first Latina and woman elected to the office.""The immigration issue, the in-your-face racist remarks have been clearly very directed to Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants,"" said Romero, who originally endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren but is not endorsing anyone else before the primary.Arizona officials and Latino advocates say many of the state's Latinos have felt the sting of Arpaio's policing and SB1070 —the 10-year-old immigration law that allows police to racially profile Hispanics to check their citizenship and immigration status. Add to that the state's ban on Mexican American studies and the state's constitutional amendment declaring English its official language.Grecia Lima, the Tucson-based national political director for Community Change Action, said the state's increased Democratic mobilization, which she called a transformation, ""is the product of young people and their commitment to their communities.""It is young Latinos who have been most enthusiastic about Sanders' campaign and turned out for him strongly in other states. The NBC News Super Tuesday exit poll showed Sanders won voters ages 17-29 48 percent to 17 percent over Biden.In the debate Sanders warned Biden that, if he is the nominee, to beat Trump in the general election ""you're going to have to bring Latinos ... who have the agenda that we need, but also don't vote in the numbers that we need."" He said he doubted Biden's campaign ""can generate that energy and excitement and that voter turnout.""But Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who originally endorsed Sen. Kamala Harris and now has endorsed Biden, said Biden and former President Barack Obama have a history with the state's Latinos.""They are the ones that came in and protected the Latino community against Sheriff Arpaio and sued the state over SB1070 and then passed DACA,"" Gallego said, referring to the Obama program that shielded younger immigrants from deportation and that Trump is attempting to end.DNC Chairman Tom Perez was serving as Obama's civil rights division chief when he led civil rights investigations of Arpaio and sued the state over SB1070, winning elimination of some of its harshest provisions.Although in the debate Biden failed to directly answer why he isn't getting as much of the Latino vote as Sanders, he championed quality education for the increasingly Latino public school population.""The idea that any American thinks it doesn't pay for us to significantly invest in their future is absolutely a bizarre notion, because if we do not invest, everything that the very wealthy are concerned about and the xenophobes are concerned about will, in fact, get worse, not better,"" Biden said.A supporter wears a shirt that says ""Tio Bernie"" during a rally for Sen.

The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.A Univision and Arizona State University's Center for Latina/os and American Politics poll found 44 percent of Latino Democratic voters favored Sanders and 39 percent supported Biden, with 12 percent undecided.

He grew up moving from house to house because of his parents' status. His father lost his job in the Great Recession and in 2010, they moved to Texas to avoid Arpaio and SB1070.He'll cast his first vote Tuesday for Sanders, which LUCHA endorsed. Sanders ""shares the values of my family, my community and my neighborhood,” Delgado said.But if Biden is the nominee, Delgado said he'd support him, “because Trump is the greater evil.”""I can't risk not showing up,"" he added.Suzanne Gamboa reported from Austin, Texas, and Carmen Sesin from Miami.Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.","Latinos will show clout in Florida, Arizona primaries",Mar 16 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latino-voters-will-be-showing-electoral-clout-florida-arizona-democratic-n1157396,nbc
"WASHINGTON — As the coronavirus continues to spread, one prescription that has yet to be written is one for Democratic presidential campaigns scrambling to win over voters during the crisis.While the outbreak has led to mass closures across the country, Tuesday’s presidential primaries in key battleground states of Florida, Arizona and Illinois are still on (Ohio's governor is calling for that state's primary to be moved to June 2). That’s led the campaigns of both former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to mobilize support digitally while telling staffers to work from home.Biden leads Trump by 9 points in a one-to-one matchupMarch 15, 202000:52The restrictions put in place by both campaigns to step physically away from the campaign trail come as the two men face perhaps the last day of major primary contests. Biden has moved into a sizable delegate lead, and a strong showing for him in the Tuesday contests could effectively end the nominating battle, making it all but impossible for Sanders to catch up.Both campaigns are doing what they can to remain competitive ahead of Tuesday’s primaries, while continuously adapting to the circumstances at hand.Traditional campaign events — large public rallies and town hall meetings — have been jettisoned, leaving the candidates to campaign via internet livestreams and modern “fireside chats.” Biden and Sanders will almost exclusively be seen on the airwaves and online now that door knocking has been replaced by more phone banking and surrogate events have become dial-in town halls, all in an effort to practice social distancing.The lack of public appearances has made it doubly hard for Sanders to pick up steam ahead of Tuesday’s contests. Big public rallies in front of enthusiastic supporters have long been a selling point for the Sanders campaign, something the candidate acknowledged Sunday night in the CNN debate.“I love doing rallies and we bring many thousands of people out to our rallies,” Sanders said. “I enjoy it very much. We’re not doing that right now.”Yet Sanders’s advisers believe the campaign has been well prepared to succeed during this challenging time, pointing to their investments in digital and social media early on in the campaign.“It has affected our campaign,” Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir said of the crisis Saturday night during a livestream “fireside chat” with Sanders from his home in Burlington, Vermont.“We have moved to a completely remote operation,” Shakir said. “We don't have offices because we've deemed them to be a public health risk for our own staff, we're heeding the public health experts on this so we've moved away from field offices and headquarter offices and everyone's working remotely. But this campaign, more so than any campaign potentially in presidential history, is best suited and prepared for this kind of a campaign.”Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceThe fireside chat drew 100,000 concurrent views online across digital platforms. The Sanders campaign has been working on other ways to build community while also following the CDC’s guidelines, and planned to host a digital rally with Sanders and campaign surrogates Monday night.“The senator feels that community, especially in a crisis like this, is important,” Sanders communications director Mike Casca told NBC News.Biden, for his part, held a virtual town hall with Illinois voters Friday evening. But it hit a few technical snags that initially involved a garbled-voiced Biden that was not immediately published to Facebook Live after several delays. Once the video did begin to stream more than halfway through the town hall, it ended roughly four minutes after it began.“Well, I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections,” a frustrated Biden said before wrapping the town hall.Asked about the technical difficulties and overall strategy involved, Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said: “It’s a brave new world we’re dealing with. It’s like building an airplane on the runway a little bit.”Still, Biden campaign officials insist they have shifted their priorities to a digital strategy.Jen O’Malley Dillon, in her first memo to staff since becoming Biden’s campaign manager last week, addressed the shift.“The functions of this campaign — disseminating the vice president’s message, educating voters, and earning their votes — will not change,” she wrote. “Our challenge now is to do that in new and creative ways that mitigate public health risk. We are confident that this team can rise to this challenge.”The campaign has indicated that Biden will continue to hold virtual town halls, including one scheduled Monday with his wife, Jill, where they will field questions from voters in primary states.Biden and Sanders campaigns go virtual amidst coronavirus outbreakMarch 14, 202002:21Jill Biden, already a top campaign surrogate, has also begun moving her efforts online. She held a pre-debate online watch party with Women for Biden and is making get out to vote calls with volunteers living in Tuesday’s primary states.The Biden campaign says people should expect to see the candidate on television more often given travel constraints, and that they will rely on their text banks and phone application to mobilize phone banks and target voters with voter turnout information ahead of Tuesday.The Sanders campaign held a national call with volunteers and supporters on Saturday night, led by organizing director Misty Rebik, leaning on their efforts to use digital canvassing. While Sanders fell short in many Super Tuesday states, Rebik told volunteers that voters in those states who were contacted through the campaign’s “BERN” iPhone application were the most likely to end up voting for Sanders.The campaign-enforced limitations on large public gatherings has led the Biden campaign to rely on an extensive team of surrogates. Tapping into their pool of over 2,000 endorsers, the Biden campaign will be assembling surrogates to hop on tele-town halls with constituents and appear on local TV stations across the country.Over the weekend, congressional campaign surrogates hosted numerous tele-town halls across Tuesday’s primary states where surrogates were able to field questions from voters. Some calls were themed, like South Carolina Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn’s call with Florida faith leaders, and Illinois Rep. Robin Kelly’s call with Chicago residents addressing gun safety.In a tele-town hall with Ohio residents Sunday, Reps. Tim Ryan and Marcy Kaptur — both Biden supporters — reassured participants that polling stations will be thoroughly sanitized while pitching to voters why a President Biden would be needed in a time of crisis.“This is the backdrop to this primary election and to Tuesday that explains why we need Joe Biden. I mean he’s been through Zika, he’s been through the Ebola scare, been through the financial crisis,” Ryan said.Public events scheduled for this weekend were also moved to phone calls, including multiple Latino-targeted outreach “Todos Con Biden” events in Miami.The urgency is also felt among staffers who are relying on old, but common communications tactics of conference calls, emailing and texting to brainstorm new ideas and execute projects as best as technology allows. While staffers describe the new work-from-home lifestyle as boring compared to the lively office atmosphere, staffers from both campaigns say it is firing them up to go back to the drawing board to reassess and best adapt to the circumstances to campaign forward.","On eve of another primary day, presidential campaigns adapt to new rules",Mar 16 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/eve-another-primary-day-presidential-campaigns-adapt-new-rules-n1160501,nbc
"The nation's response to the coronavirus outbreak dominated much of the discussion in the 11th Democratic debate on Sunday night — the first time that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders went head to head on stage in the 2020 election cycle.Also a first: Biden vowing to name a woman as his running mate if he wins the nomination.The former vice president and Vermont independent senator squared off in dramatically different surroundings than initially planned, Washington instead of Phoenix, and in CNN's studio instead of a 5,000-seat theater with a live audience — a venue change prompted by coronavirus fears as the nation goes into lockdown over the pandemic.Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination following a string of state primary victories since winning in South Carolina last month.

Because he's undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people.""""It is unacceptable to be blabbering with unfactual information that is confusing the general public,"" Sanders said.Sanders: This pandemic exposes ‘incredible weakness’ of our health care systemMarch 16, 202001:30Biden focused on his plan to tackle the crisis, saying he'd rely on scientists and work with the country's international partners.""This is a crisis. We're at war with a virus,"" Biden said. ""In a war, you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people.""The crisis ""is bigger than any one of us. This calls for a national rallying to everybody move together,"" Biden said, calling on the Defense Department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to begin building temporary hospitals.Let our news meet your inbox.

Biden said he's ""taking all the precautions.""""I do not shake hands any longer,"" Biden said, and ""I wash my hands God knows how many times a day.""Sanders said, ""I'm using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers."" Both noted that they've halted traditional campaigning and rallies since the pandemic worsened.Trump raised eyebrows by repeatedly shaking hands  with business leaders at a Rose Garden event Friday.The pair were facing off in the first one-on-one debate of the Democratic presidential primary season and the first since Trump declared the pandemic a national emergency. The pandemic has stricken over 3,000 people nationwide and claimed over 60 lives.Earlier in the day, Trump took a shot at Biden, who's leading Sanders in the delegate count and is now the favorite for the nomination. The president complained on Twitter about the Obama administration's handling of the swine flu epidemic in 2009, writing ""Biden in charge"" and ""very late response time"" and exaggerating the number of people who died from the flu strain at the time.Biden was not in charge of the response.","Debating coronavirus: Sanders blasts, 'Shut this president up,' and Biden says, 'This is like a war'",Mar 16 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/debating-coronavirus-sanders-blasts-shut-president-biden-says-we-re-n1159671,nbc

"The nation's response to the coronavirus outbreak dominated much of the discussion in the 11th Democratic debate on Sunday night — the first time that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders went head to head on stage in the 2020 election cycle.Also a first: Biden vowing to name a woman as his running mate if he wins the nomination.The former vice president and Vermont independent senator squared off in dramatically different surroundings than initially planned, Washington instead of Phoenix, and in CNN's studio instead of a 5,000-seat theater with a live audience — a venue change prompted by coronavirus fears as the nation goes into lockdown over the pandemic.Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination following a string of state primary victories since winning in South Carolina last month.

In answering that question, he has given variations on wanting or hoping to choose a woman running mate — but never gave such a clear-cut commitment until now.Biden has enjoyed getting that question on the trail in part because it has allowed him to pivot to discussing, often at considerable length, what made his working relationship  with President Barack Obama so effective. He often says historians considered their relationship one of the best working relationships between a president and vice president in history, and adds that the reason they worked so well together is because Obama had complete trust in him and their views were “simpatico,” to use one of his favorite words.Among the current or former officials Biden has either explicitly or implicitly included in his list of potential VP picks are Sen.

"The nation's response to the coronavirus outbreak dominated much of the discussion in the 11th Democratic debate on Sunday night — the first time that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders went head to head on stage in the 2020 election cycle.Also a first: Biden vowing to name a woman as his running mate if he wins the nomination.The former vice president and Vermont independent senator squared off in dramatically different surroundings than initially planned, Washington instead of Phoenix, and in CNN's studio instead of a 5,000-seat theater with a live audience — a venue change prompted by coronavirus fears as the nation goes into lockdown over the pandemic.Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination following a string of state primary victories since winning in South Carolina last month.

In answering that question, he has given variations on wanting or hoping to choose a woman running mate — but never gave such a clear-cut commitment until now.Biden has enjoyed getting that question on the trail in part because it has allowed him to pivot to discussing, often at considerable length, what made his working relationship  with President Barack Obama so effective. He often says historians considered their relationship one of the best working relationships between a president and vice president in history, and adds that the reason they worked so well together is because Obama had complete trust in him and their views were “simpatico,” to use one of his favorite words.Among the current or former officials Biden has either explicitly or implicitly included in his list of potential VP picks are Sen.

"WASHINGTON — For the first time Monday, President Donald Trump laid out a truly bleak picture of America in the time of coronavirus — pointing to an ""invisible enemy"" he said could plunge the nation's economy into recession and possibly even require quarantines of geographic ""hot spots,"" if not the whole country.The abrupt shift in tone matched a more gradual acceptance by the president that his response to the pandemic so far has failed to inspire confidence in the public, investors and lawmakers. Last week, he delivered an Oval Office address and a Rose Garden press conference that sent the mixed signal he was taking the threat of the disease more seriously, yet still didn't fully grasp the risk at hand.His salesman's tendency to minimize the downside and play up the bright side left him looking like he couldn't judge the gravity or complexity of a situation that his own aides described in catastrophic terms.By Monday, with more experienced federal and state officials proposing new restrictions on public interactions and economic relief packages in the hundreds of billions of dollars, Trump had largely dispensed with the happy talk. But given his own dire forecast, the time it took for him to understand the problem may have been costly in terms of the health and economic standing of the nation.""We'd much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it,"" he said at a briefing for White House reporters.Trump tells Americans to stay home to 'defeat' coronavirusMarch 16, 202001:26Let our news meet your inbox.

Later, he added that ""the best thing I can do for the stock market is we can get through this crisis.""Save for giving himself a perfect ""10"" on handling the response to coronavirus, the words coming out of Trump's mouth were hardly recognizable. He praised the media for being ""fair"" in its coverage and clarified that when he said that things were ""under control"" Sunday he only meant the government's efforts were coordinated.The other major shift was Trump's emphasis on stopping the virus to the exclusion of concerns about the health of the economy. He announced a new set of guidelines for the public to combat the spread of the pandemic, including educating kids from home, limiting social gatherings to 10 or fewer people, avoiding bars and restaurants, and ending discretionary travel.""We have an invisible enemy,"" he said. ""My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything else is going to fall into place.""From what administration officials and outside experts have said, there was no time to waste in grasping the severity of the crisis and concentrating on fighting it.

"WASHINGTON — The House on Monday night passed a bill containing technical corrections to the coronavirus relief bill it passed over the weekend, sending it to the Senate to be considered for a vote at some point this week.Around 8:10 p.m. ET, the House passed the corrections by unanimous consent during a pro forma session since the lower chamber is on recess this week.Earlier in the day, Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, held up the process because he insisted on reading them, a Democratic leadership aide confirmed Monday. He spoke on the floor Monday night and said that the technical corrections make the bill better and he withdrew his objection to pass the measure by unanimous consent.Senate GOP leaders have not yet specified an exact day for voting on the bill, but a number of senators want to act on it as soon as possible and want to get started on a third relief package.Let our news meet your inbox.

"The nation's response to the coronavirus outbreak dominated much of the discussion in the 11th Democratic debate on Sunday night — the first time that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders went head to head on stage in the 2020 election cycle.Also a first: Biden vowing to name a woman as his running mate if he wins the nomination.The former vice president and Vermont independent senator squared off in dramatically different surroundings than initially planned, Washington instead of Phoenix, and in CNN's studio instead of a 5,000-seat theater with a live audience — a venue change prompted by coronavirus fears as the nation goes into lockdown over the pandemic.Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination following a string of state primary victories since winning in South Carolina last month.

The candidates clashed over issues ranging from bankruptcy policy and same-sex marriage to health care and immigration and highlighted their differing visions for the country.Here are five key takeaways from the evening.Share this -1d ago / 2:55 AM UTCWatch Biden, Sanders debate coronavirus, more in 2 minutesMarch 16, 202002:23Share this -Lauren Egan1d ago / 2:54 AM UTCTrump campaign attacks Biden, Sanders for ‘plagiarizing’ his coronavirus planPresident Donald Trump's re-election campaign attacked Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders for their debate performance, arguing that neither candidate provided a sufficient response to the coronavirus pandemic.“Unable to articulate a coronavirus plan, both Bernie and Biden offered little more than plagiarizing President Trump’s response, which will now be the model for all future pandemics,” said Kayleigh McEnany, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign.Trump has been heavily criticized for his bungled reaction to the virus. He insisted for weeks that the virus was under control and misled the public about the severity of the situation. Biden and Sanders have both delivered speeches outlining how they would have responded to the outbreak from day one.“It doesn’t matter which of these two is the Democrat nominee, either one would reverse the hottest economy in modern history and the great gains we have made under President Trump,” said McEnany.Share this -Mike Memoli and Marianna Sotomayor1d ago / 2:54 AM UTCWhy Biden made his running mate commitmentJoe Biden’s commitment in Sunday’s debate to name a female running mate tonight was not an accident or ad lib: The former vice president entered the debate looking for an opportunity to make that commitment explicit as he seeks to reinforce the perception in the minds of Democrats that he is very close to being, if not is already, the presumptive nominee, a senior campaign official told NBC News.Biden has often been asked in town hall-style events about his vice presidential pick. In answering that question, he has given variations on wanting or hoping to choose a woman running mate — but never gave such a clear-cut commitment until now.Biden has enjoyed getting that question on the trail in part because it has allowed him to pivot to discussing, often at considerable length, what made his working relationship  with President Barack Obama so effective. He often says historians considered their relationship one of the best working relationships between a president and vice president in history, and adds that the reason they worked so well together is because Obama had complete trust in him and their views were “simpatico,” to use one of his favorite words.Among the current or former officials Biden has either explicitly or implicitly included in his list of potential VP picks are Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Deputy Attorney Gen. Sally Yates, who recently endorsed Biden, former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, and New Hampshire Democratic Sens.

Skip the handshake. No audience. An unusual debate, thanks to coronavirus.If you deliver an applause line and there's no one around to clap, did it really land?That was the question at Sunday night's debate on CNN between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden when, because of fears of the coronavirus, there was no live audience to boo! or woo! when, say, the former vice president pledged to name a woman as his running mate.The septuagenarian candidates started with an elbow bump in lieu of a handshake, and their podiums (highly sanitized, CNN assured ahead of time) were as far apart on the stage (also highly sanitized) as the candidates were on the issues. It was also almost certainly the first presidential debate in history to include the phrases ""I'm using a lot of soap"" (Sanders) and ""I wash my hands God knows how many times a day"" (Biden).But the real innovation was what was missing.

The candidates clashed over issues ranging from bankruptcy policy and same-sex marriage to health care and immigration and highlighted their differing visions for the country.Here are five key takeaways from the evening.Share this - 1d ago / 2:55 AM UTCWatch Biden, Sanders debate coronavirus, more in 2 minutesMarch 16, 202002:23Share this - Lauren Egan1d ago / 2:54 AM UTCTrump campaign attacks Biden, Sanders for ‘plagiarizing’ his coronavirus planPresident Donald Trump's re-election campaign attacked Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders for their debate performance, arguing that neither candidate provided a sufficient response to the coronavirus pandemic.“Unable to articulate a coronavirus plan, both Bernie and Biden offered little more than plagiarizing President Trump’s response, which will now be the model for all future pandemics,” said Kayleigh McEnany, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign.Trump has been heavily criticized for his bungled reaction to the virus. He insisted for weeks that the virus was under control and misled the public about the severity of the situation. Biden and Sanders have both delivered speeches outlining how they would have responded to the outbreak from day one.“It doesn’t matter which of these two is the Democrat nominee, either one would reverse the hottest economy in modern history and the great gains we have made under President Trump,” said McEnany.Share this - Mike Memoli and Marianna Sotomayor1d ago / 2:54 AM UTCWhy Biden made his running mate commitmentJoe Biden’s commitment in Sunday’s debate to name a female running mate tonight was not an accident or ad lib: The former vice president entered the debate looking for an opportunity to make that commitment explicit as he seeks to reinforce the perception in the minds of Democrats that he is very close to being, if not is already, the presumptive nominee, a senior campaign official told NBC News.Biden has often been asked in town hall-style events about his vice presidential pick. In answering that question, he has given variations on wanting or hoping to choose a woman running mate — but never gave such a clear-cut commitment until now.Biden has enjoyed getting that question on the trail in part because it has allowed him to pivot to discussing, often at considerable length, what made his working relationship  with President Barack Obama so effective. He often says historians considered their relationship one of the best working relationships between a president and vice president in history, and adds that the reason they worked so well together is because Obama had complete trust in him and their views were “simpatico,” to use one of his favorite words.Among the current or former officials Biden has either explicitly or implicitly included in his list of potential VP picks are Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Deputy Attorney Gen. Sally Yates, who recently endorsed Biden, former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, and New Hampshire Democratic Sens. Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen.Share this - NBC News1d ago / 2:49 AM UTCMcCaskill on Biden's VP commitment: Women get Democratic party 'across finish line'March 16, 202002:11 Share this - Adam Edelman1d ago / 2:48 AM UTCSanders slams Trump in post-debate interviewSanders, in an interview on CNN after the debate concluded, slammed Trump over his response to the coronavirus pandemic, accusing him over undermining his own scientists.“The truth of the matter is that you’ve got a president who is arrogant” and “who is literally undermining the good work” of government scientists and public health experts dealing with the outbreakTrump, Sanders said, “underestimated” and “diminished the initial threat facing this country.”“A president who has a brain in his head would have brought the scientists together,” he said.Later in the interview, Sanders, who is trailing Biden in the delegate count, was asked about his path ahead in the process — and he didn’t suggest he was dropping out any time soon.“The path ahead is to bring as many people who do not traditionally vote into the political process,” Sanders said.Asked if he was helping to bring those people in so they could vote for Biden, Sanders answered in the negative.“They’re not going to vote for Biden,” he said.Share this - NBC News1d ago / 2:32 AM UTCBiden camp says this was best debate day online fundraising of whole cycleThis debate showed that Joe Biden is the leader we need during these uncertain times.

"WASHINGTON — It’s likely — if not certain — that tonight’s Democratic presidential primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois will be the last ones for the next two months.And it’s unclear what, exactly, is going to happen today in Ohio, where the state’s governor said he wouldn’t open the state’s polling places, defying a judge who declined to postpone the state’s primary.It all freezes into place a Democratic nominating contest — with uncertainty about when it all begins again.And that raises questions about the state of Bernie Sanders’ campaign (given that Joe Biden’s lead is going to grow after tonight’s contests), about the Democratic convention in July (will the health landscape improve by then?), and about whether states and the federal government can institute a vote-by-mail system for November.Already, Georgia (originally set for March 24), Louisiana (April 4) and Kentucky (May 19) have postponed their primaries to later dates, as other upcoming states are almost guaranteed to follow.Here is the state of the Democratic race heading into tonight’s contests: Joe Biden leads Bernie Sanders by 152 pledged delegates, according to NBC News’ count.That’s with about half of all delegates now awarded, and it will be about 60 percent done after tonight (and depending on what happens in Ohio).Biden has won 871 pledged delegates, or 50 percent of all pledged delegates allocated so far.Sanders has won 719, or 42 percent.To reach the magic number of 1,991 pledged delegates, Biden will need to win 50 percent of the remaining unallocated pledged delegates.Sanders will need to win 56 percent.Those numbers will change after tonight – most likely helping Joe Biden and hurting Bernie Sanders.And then we’re going to have to wait.Tweet of the dayAs ordered by @OHdeptofhealth Director @DrAmyActon and in consultation with @GovMikeDeWine, Ohio’s primary has been postponed.Here’s the action I took to make sure your voice is heard. https://t.co/FwEp95O1OJ pic.twitter.com/Z9yfPuSJTY— Frank LaRose (@FrankLaRose) March 17, 2020 Why President Trump’s tone changed on the coronavirusPresident Trump’s tone certainly changed when it comes to the coronavirus.“This is a bad one, this is a very bad one. This is bad in the sense that it's so contagious,"" he said yesterday.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceFox News changed its tone, too.And the New York Times gives a possible explanation for Trump’s change.“Sweeping new federal recommendations announced on Monday for Americans to sharply limit their activities appeared to draw on a dire scientific report warning that, without action by the government and individuals to slow the spread of coronavirus and suppress new cases, 2.2 million people in the United States could die,” the Times writes.More: “The authors said that so-called mitigation policies alone — isolating people suspected of having the virus at home, quarantining their contacts and separating the most vulnerable people from others — might reduce the peak demand on the health care system by two-thirds and deaths by half if applied for three months. But that would still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and in health systems “overwhelmed many times over,” they said.”2020 Vision: Everything you need to know about the March 17 primariesFour states hold their Democratic presidential primaries today, and here’s a breakdown of what you need to know about each contest — by final poll closing time.7:30 p.m. ET: Ohio (136 pledged delegates at stake – unaffiliated and GOP voters can request a Democratic ballot). Note: That’s assuming that the state’s primary is not postponed tonight.8:00 p.m. ET: Florida, though most polling places in the state close at 7:00 p.m. ET (219 pledged delegates — closed primary for Democrats).8:00 p.m. ET: Illinois: (155 pledged delegates — unaffiliated and GOP voters can request a Democratic ballot).10:00 p.m. ET: Arizona (67 pledged delegates – closed primary for Democrats).Also in Illinois today, keep an eye on the Dan Lipinksi-versus-Marie Newman Democratic rematch in the state’s third congressional district. Newman, a progressive, narrowly lost to the antiabortion-rights incumbent two years ago.Dispatches from NBC’s campaign embedsOn the eve of Primary Day, Bernie Sanders admitted that his campaign isn’t panning out quite the way he planned, per NBC’s Gary Grumbach. “We are winning the generational battle. Now, for whatever reason, and I plead guilty to this, maybe it's some of my own doings or lack of doings, we're doing poorly with older people that's just, simply a fact,” he said during his virtual rally on Monday. “I gotta work on that,” Sanders admitted.But the campaign’s national co-chair Nina Turner said they are not going to relent: “We are not relenting, we are pressing on towards the high prize which is justice, economic justice, political justice, social justice, and environmental justice,” she said. “We are going to continue to fight, to turn this thing around and, baby, we can do it because there is no force greater on this Earth than a conscious minded people on the move.”Grumbach, along with NBC’s Marianna Sotomayor and Amanda Golden wrote more about what this campaign will continue to look like without in-person campaign events, and perhaps with postponed voting here.Data Download: The number of the day is … 21,36121,361.That’s Joe Biden’s margin of victory over Bernie Sanders in Washington state — in the actual number of votes — with 99 percent in.On Monday, a week after the contest took place on March 10, NBC News projected Biden the apparent winner in Washington, with Biden at 575,291 votes (38 percent) and Sanders at 553,930 (36 percent).With Biden’s victory in Washington, that means he won five out of the six Democratic contests last week — with his sole defeat in North Dakota.The Lid: Worried sickDon’t miss the pod from yesterday, when we looked at the partisan divides in how Americans are viewing the coronavirus crisis.ICYMI: News clips you shouldn’t missThe president finally pivoted to talking about the gravity of the coronavirus situation.

"The nation's response to the coronavirus outbreak dominated much of the discussion in the 11th Democratic debate on Sunday night — the first time that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders went head to head on stage in the 2020 election cycle.Also a first: Biden vowing to name a woman as his running mate if he wins the nomination.The former vice president and Vermont independent senator squared off in dramatically different surroundings than initially planned, Washington instead of Phoenix, and in CNN's studio instead of a 5,000-seat theater with a live audience — a venue change prompted by coronavirus fears as the nation goes into lockdown over the pandemic.Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination following a string of state primary victories since winning in South Carolina last month.

The prospect of entire industries shutting down, from travel and tourism to live entertainment, threatens to send the economy into a tailspin. And that's to say nothing of the actual health peril that has public officials warning this could be just the beginning of a global catastrophe.But according to Trump, everything's still ""perfect,"" from the way he handled the outbreak to availability of test kits. Many Americans recall that he played down the threat last month — ""the risk to the American people remains very low,"" he said as he questioned whether it would spread — and mocked politicians who implored him to take it more seriously. He used the word ""hoax"" at a rally in South Carolina, later explaining that he meant criticism of his response was a hoax.President Trump has not been tested for coronavirus, White House saysMarch 10, 202000:44So at the exact time when administration officials, state-level officials and the public needed the president to sound the alarm, Trump told everyone there was nothing to worry about. He tried to sell Americans on the idea that they didn't need to protect themselves because he had it all under control.Now, the risk is bigger, both because of the slow-footed response and because it appears that investors, health officials and the general public don't feel they can trust what the president is saying.All of that makes the coronavirus, and the potential for greater illness and economic damage it could bring, a singular threat to Trump's re-election. Even if minimal damage is done, many voters will recall that Trump either didn't see the possible risk, or pretended it wasn't that bad.Even on Monday, he continued to minimize the problem, implying it was far less dangerous than seasonal influenza. ""So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year,"" he tweeted Monday. ""Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!""Let our news meet your inbox.

""Lives depend on the wisdom and judgment of the president,"" Pete Buttigieg, who recently exited the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, said Monday on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""""And there are certain things that no one else in the government can do to coordinate the response, to manage the issue, to convincingly reassure the American people,"" he said. ""And we don’t have that and that is incredibly costly. It's costly medically, it's costly economically.""The view on Capitol Hill is as obvious in the deeds of Trump's Republican allies as it is in the words of Democrats: What he's saying doesn't comport with reality.Several GOP lawmakers have self-quarantined, after possibly making contact with someone with the virus — and, following that, with the president. A senior congressional Democratic aide told NBC's Sahil Kapur that Trump's use of the bully pulpit is causing deep concern in Congress.""Members and staff are very concerned about the White House response and how bad this can get across the country,"" the aide said. ""There’s a feeling that the country could look a lot different in two weeks' time in terms of people’s ability to move freely, go to work and school. ... There was a thinking developing that the country had made it this far without a genuine crisis that Trump had to deal with and may get through an election with the status quo holding. That’s not true anymore.""Indeed, this crisis is unique in the degree of difficulty for Trump because he didn't create it, he can't distract from it and he's already tried to make it go away with his patented ""nothing-to-see-here"" news conference in which he generally declares victory and moves on — this time, to no avail. If it gets better, not worse, it will be a miracle for public health and for his presidency.Trump is sticking to the tactic presidents typically use to keep investors calm during periods of economic instability — sometimes resulting in stabilization, sometimes not. The old line is, ""the fundamentals of the economy are sound."" Variations of it have been used by administrations and presidential campaigns from those of Herbert Hoover to John McCain in times of distress.Trump, however, is dealing with an underlying public health crisis, and underplaying that threat could have major consequences for both the safety of the American public and the relatively strong economy he has centered his re-election campaign around.Global stocks tumble as oil prices crash on coronavirus fearsMarch 9, 202002:16""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation,"" Trump tweeted earlier Monday. ""Far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, 'The risk is low to the average American.'""A tanking economy would put Trump in greater jeopardy of losing his job. Just a few weeks ago, before he was acquitted of House impeachment charges by the Senate, he delivered a relatively well-reviewed State of the Union address and watched the Democrats' Iowa caucuses fall apart. Trump was at a political apex.But now, if the economy turns and more of the public loses faith in his leadership over his handling of the coronavirus, he could find himself facing an emboldened front-runner for the Democratic nomination for the first time since his inauguration. Former Vice President Joe Biden's commanding victory in the Super Tuesday primaries last week made him the prohibitive favorite to be the nominee.Right now, Trump is fighting his own vice president over a matter as simple as whether to praise a Democratic governor who has worked with the administration on the coronavirus response.On Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence lauded Washington Gov. Jay Inslee for coordinating with the federal government.""I do want to commend, Gov. Inslee, your team's effort and the seamless partnership that was forged from the very beginning between our administration and your administration here at the state level,"" Pence said Thursday while visiting Washington state.On Friday, Trump chastised Pence for saying nice things about Inslee, who briefly ran for president last year, and called the governor a ""snake,"" which did not appear to be intended as a compliment.And as Trump persists in his disputes, Wall Street investors and Main Street voters are clamoring for him to take the threats to their physical and financial health seriously.","As he minimizes the crisis, Trump puts re-election at risk",Mar 09 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-s-minimized-view-coronavirus-crisis-puts-his-re-election-n1153206,nbc
"A video of Joe Biden that was deceptively edited to make it appear as if he endorsed President Donald Trump for re-election triggered warning labels from Twitter and Facebook, one of the first instances in which new policies meant to curb misinformation have been applied to the Trump campaign.The video, which was tweeted Saturday by White House social media director Dan Scavino and later retweeted from Trump's account, shows Biden claiming ""we can only re-elect Donald Trump"" before the audio stops and the video fades out.In the full clip, Biden says: ""We can only re-elect Donald Trump if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. It's got to be a positive campaign."" The clip was taken from Biden's speech in Kansas City, Missouri, earlier Saturday.While the labels are the newest indication that Facebook and Twitter are beginning to act on their policies around misinformation, the spread of the video shows how even clear warnings can be little match for the power of the social media infrastructure that has been built up by both parties in recent years.The labels are also already at risk of taking on a political tinge, according to Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center.""Some in the right wing considered the label a badge of honor,"" Donovan said.

That post got more than 7,000 retweets.The clip is what information researchers refer to as a ""cheap fake,"" a piece of content that's been sped up, slowed down, cut off or easily edited in a way that deceptively strips it of content or changes the meaning.Twitter users reported Scavino's misleading tweet en masse Saturday, which flagged Twitter's site integrity team. Users employed the new reporting function, which allows tweets that are considered ""misleading about a political election"" to be flagged to Twitter's moderation staff for a potential takedown.Feb. 21: Twitter testing new ways to fight misinformationFeb. 21, 202001:42The site integrity team quickly decided that the video, which flipped the meaning of Biden's statement by cutting it off prematurely, broke Twitter's manipulated content rules, which went into place on Thursday.The clip originated from @thebradfordfile, a user known to boost pro-Trump conspiracy theories and conservative talking points. After it was shared by the White House, it was viewed on Twitter at least 6.4 million times and on Facebook more than 1 million times, according to the social media tracking tool Crowdtangle. It was further disseminated to millions more across social media by well-known Trump supporters, including Charlie Kirk, leader of the conservative group Turning Point USA.Facebook labeled the video Monday with a more prominent screen that obscured the content, describing it as ""partly false information."" Per its policy, Facebook's label was triggered only after Lead Stories, one of its partner fact-checking organizations, identified the video as misleading.A Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the company was reducing the video's distribution and including a warning label for people who try to share it.But Facebook's actions were too slow, according to Biden's campaign manager, Greg Schultz, who criticized Facebook in a statement that said the company's ""malfeasance when it comes to trafficking in blatantly false information"" was a ""national crisis.""The complaints from Biden's campaign mirror those from other Democratic politicians, including the chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who last month called out Facebook for failing to act on a video that was edited to repeatedly show Pelosi tearing up the president's State of the Union speech as he honored guests in the gallery. Former Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg was also accused of creating ""doctored"" content in a video ad that appeared to show him stumping his rivals at a debate when no such moment occurred.Donovan, of the Shorenstein Center, said putting labels on videos won't change the growing problem of misinformation.""When it comes to the question of manipulated video content, there needs to be sanctions for actual users beyond the label,"" she said.Some conservatives claimed that the labels were misapplied and that the video was part of normal political speech.""We're seeing an intentional and coordinated effort by established gatekeepers to equate political speech they don't like with the entirely separate categories of doctored deep fakes, illegal content and deceptive cheap fakes,"" tweeted Brendan Carr, a Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission.",How new rules at Facebook and Twitter led to a warning beneath a Trump retweet,Mar 09 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-twitter-put-warning-label-edited-video-biden-n1153506,nbc
"WASHINGTON — The Texas Democratic Party announced Monday that it is launching the largest voter registration campaign in its history, building up a team of organizers to try to bring millions of new voters into the party ahead of the November election.Texas Democrats say they have identified nearly 2.6 million people who would vote Democratic if they were registered. The state party says they are using money from the Democratic National Committee to launch an organizing team focused on registering minorities in rural and suburban areas, groups that have often been underrepresented in Texas' electorate.“We know what works in one part of Texas is not necessarily going to work in another part of Texas,” said Olivia Stitilis, who was recently hired as the state party's organizing director, highlighting her plan to tailor outreach strategies to different communities of could-be voters.Will Biden make inroads with Latino vote on Super Tuesday?March 2, 202009:47Stitilis said part of the party’s outreach strategy will focus on making sure volunteers become more ingrained in different communities throughout Texas — from Asian Americans in the growing suburbs to Latinos in the Rio Grande Valley — and will try to ensure that Texas Democrats are “building relationships with community gatekeepers” who can help drive up registration and boost turn out at the polls.Let our news meet your inbox.

Democrats, who have long dreamed of turning delegate-rich Texas blue, argue that the state's rapidly growing and diversifying electorate could make 2020 the year for that to happen.“If you win Texas, Donald Trump can't win the election,” said Rahman. “The year that is changing is now — it's 2020. This is the year that demographics finally meets destiny.”Texas has 38 Electoral College votes, second only to California. Hillary Clinton lost Texas to Donald Trump by roughly 800,00 votes, or about 9 percent of the total votes cast in the state, in 2016. Former Rep.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates Texas as “likely Republican” in the 2020 general election.And while the DNC’s money will allow Texas Democrats to have a robust operation in the state, the Republican National Committee and Trump’s re-election campaign pulled in nearly half a billion dollars in 2019 and will be prepared to counteract any ground Democrats hope to gain.",Texas Dems announce largest-ever voter drive in 2020 flip effort,Mar 09 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/texas-dems-announce-largest-ever-voter-drive-2020-flip-effort-n1152646,nbc
"WASHINGTON — Elizabeth Warren has not endorsed anyone since dropping out of the 2020 race, but one of her key allies is siding with Bernie Sanders in the hopes of advancing their shared progressive agenda as rival Joe Biden consolidates moderate support.The Working Families Party, a labor union-backed coalition of state-based groups that work to elect progressive public officials, was one of the first major left-leaning groups to pick sides in the 2020 Democratic primary last September when the group backed Warren at a massive rally in Washington Square Park in New York City.“We said from the very beginning that there were two progressive champions in this race, and that our North Star was to elect one of them as president,” said the party's national director, Maurice Mitchell. “Now, the Working Families Party will marshal its grassroots supporters and staff to help Senator Sanders win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump.”How will Elizabeth Warren use her influence after withdrawing from the 2020 race?March 6, 202003:43The organization will hold a call for Warren supporters Monday night to discuss what they should do next, featuring elected officials who had backed the Massachusetts Democrat but are now supporting Sanders, I-Vt. The group has a particularly active presence in several states that vote in upcoming primary contests, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New York and Connecticut, where it hopes to help Sanders.The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, another longtime Warren ally, urged members in Michigan to vote for Sanders in the Tuesday’s primary, but stopped short of a full endorsement.“If your top priority is beating Trump, and you want to be super sure Bernie or Biden are tested and can go the distance if they are the nominee, a vote for Bernie is a vote to let the contest continue instead of prematurely coronating Biden,” the group said in an email to supporters Saturday.Let our news meet your inbox.

Ayanna Pressley and surrogates like former Housing Secretary Julián Castro, are also taking their time as well.Meanwhile, Biden earned the support in recent days of two former presidential rivals, Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J.Time is running short. Six states will vote Tuesday and then another four big ones — Florida, Ohio, Arizona and Illinois — will vote next week, after which some analysts predict Biden’s delegate lead could become insurmountable.Nelini Stamp, the director of strategy and partnerships at Working Families, said her group hopes its endorsement of Sanders will push others who backed Warren to consolidate around the progressive candidateBut she said the group is not trying to pressure Warren herself and acknowledged Warren's base is unlikely to move unanimously in any direction.“We hope to see progressives in lockstep with each other, but it’s not our place to tell Warren what to do,” Stamp told NBC News. “We hope we can signal some of the Warren coalition that they can join us.""The Working Families Party backed Sanders during his 2016 bid against Hillary Clinton, so their Warren endorsement last year led to some blowback online. For instance, the socialist magazine Jacobin, which supports Sanders, wrote at the time that the group had “written itself out of history.”Stamp said the group would move past that, but acknowledged the online vitriol may dissuade some former Warren supporters from joining Sanders’ movement — something Warren herself warned against in her interview with Maddow.“We're not going to act like the reaction to our endorsement was where we wanted it to be and what we wanted it to be,"" Stamp said.

Baucus, the former U.S. ambassador to China, said the meeting of Schumer, Bullock and their wives in Big Sky was key to the decision, but he did not know the substance of those talks.Baucus also said it “probably helped” that former Vice President Joe Biden has surged in the Democratic presidential primary race, making it less likely that self-described democratic socialist Vermont Sen.

"It's not Super Tuesday, but there are six more Democratic contests coming up Tuesday. Joe Biden comes to them with a lead over Bernie Sanders in the overall delegate count, thanks to his victories in 10 states last week.Now, Biden has an opportunity to build on his advantage, while Sanders is desperately seeking to put some headline-grabbing wins on the board. Here's my look at the state of play in Tuesday's battlegrounds:1. MichiganDelegates: 125. Type of election: PrimaryThe most symbolically important contest of the day. Sanders won here in 2016 and is pushing hard for a repeat performance.On the heels of a disastrous Super Tuesday, he badly needs to post a victory in a big state like Michigan to prove that he's still a contender. Conversely, a Biden breakthrough in a state that resisted Hillary Clinton in both the primary and general elections would make a powerful statement.Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden set for Michigan showdownMarch 7, 202001:49A Detroit Free Press poll on Monday put Biden up by a whopping 24 points, although Sanders' loyalists are quick to note that pre-primary polling also put Hillary Clinton ahead in 2016.Of more concern for Sanders is his support among white voters without a college degree — a big chunk of Michigan's Democratic electorate. In '16, he won these voters by 15 points in Michigan, key to his overall victory. But in contests so far this year, Sanders hasn't been doing as well with non-college whites. Last Tuesday in Minnesota, for instance, he lost them by 12 points to Biden.Add in Sanders' continuing struggle to attract support from African Americans — about 20 percent of Michigan's primary electorate — and there are some worrying signs for him in what could amount to a must-win state.2. WashingtonDelegates: 89. Type of election: PrimaryThe single most important fact about this contest is that it is a primary, and not a caucus. It matters because Sanders tends to excel in caucus states, with their narrower voting universes, where the most committed activists hold disproportionate sway.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceWashington was a caucus state in 2016, and Sanders romped to a 73 percent to 27 percent win over Clinton, good for a sizable delegate haul. But the state Democratic Party decided to switch to a primary this year — and it looks like a big problem for Sanders.Consider what happened last Tuesday in Minnesota, another state that made the switch to a primary this year. In '16, Sanders rolled up 62 percent in Minnesota's caucuses, but facing a primary electorate this time around, he lost to Biden by 9 points. Notably, Washington also held a nonbinding presidential primary in '16, two months after its caucuses. In that primary, Sanders actually lost to Clinton by 5 points. It didn't count for any delegates, but that result is worth recalling now.Even if Sanders wins Washington's primary, his margin will likely be much narrower than his caucus rout four years ago. And that means that even in victory, his net delegate haul here will be severely reduced, something Sanders can ill afford now that he's playing catchup against Biden.3. MissouriDelegates: 68. Type of election: PrimaryJust two-tenths of a point separated Sanders from victory here in 2016, but now Missouri looms as a big question mark. In other contests so far, Sanders hasn't been performing as well as he did in '16 among blue collar and rural white voters, a significant component of the electorate. For that matter, Sanders also ran particularly well with white college graduates here in '16, a group that surged strongly to Biden on Super Tuesday.Sanders will need deep support from white voters in Missouri to make up for an expected lopsided loss with black voters, who should account for about 20 percent of the primary electorate. Sanders notched just over 30 percent of the black vote in Missouri in '16, better than his performance in Deep South states but still a major problem for him.In the last week, Biden has loaded up on endorsements from the state's political class. A solid Biden win here would go a long way toward making Tuesday a big night for him.4. North DakotaDelegates: 14. Type of election: Firehouse caucusWhat is a firehouse caucus? It's not a quite a primary, but it's pretty close.It's run by the state political party, not the state (which administers traditional primaries), and allows voters to show up at party-designated polling sites during an eight-hour window and cast ballots. The hours are shorter and there aren't nearly as many voting locations as in a primary, but otherwise the procedure is basically the same.What that adds up to is a headache for Sanders, since North Dakota has previously held caucuses, the type of contest best suited for Sanders. In 2016, he racked up a 38-point win over Clinton here. The new process should erode that advantage, though it's not clear to what degree.5. IdahoDelegates: 20. Type of election: PrimaryHere it is again: another state where Sanders dominated caucuses in 2016 that has switched to a primary this time around. Four years ago, Sanders earned nearly 80 percent in Idaho's caucuses. It's hard to see him getting close to that in a primary. Could he still win the state? It's anyone's guess, but if the contest is even close, no one will net a significant number of delegates out of this state.6. MississippiDelegates: 36. Type of election: PrimaryIt's a small state, but it may end up being more consequential than any other state  Tuesday night. The reason: Biden should run up the score here, massively. He's been crushing Sanders among black voters, and black voters should make up around 70 percent of Mississippi's Democratic primary electorate — the largest share of any state.In 2016, this state was an absolute disaster for Sanders, who lost it 83 percent to 16 percent to Clinton. Just last week, he was routed 63 percent to 16 percent in next-door Alabama. There's every reason to believe that Sanders is in for more of the same here Tuesday. And that would mean that Biden would take the vast majority of the state's delegates.In other words, it's possible that Sanders could narrowly win all the other states Tuesday and still have his net delegate gain from them erased by Biden's Mississippi landslide.",Why Sanders' uphill battle gets steeper as six states vote Tuesday,Mar 09 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/why-sanders-uphill-battle-gets-steeper-six-states-vote-tuesday-n1152586,nbc

"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden isn't the only presidential candidate whose allies believe the votes of Bernie Sanders' most dedicated supporters could hold the key to his November success. President Donald Trump and his supporters believe the same.In 2016, about 216,000 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin voters backed the Vermont senator in the spring and Trump in the fall, according to an analysis of exit polling — well over twice the president's total margin of victory in those states, which were critical to his electoral vote win in the face of a decisive popular vote loss.If Sanders ultimately falls short again this time around, Trump's allies hope history repeats itself with the senator's most disaffected supporters — but they won't be leaving that prospect to chance, with a targeted effort underway by groups who support Trump’s re-election to identify and target those voters.Often, the public-facing pitch comes straight from the top.""The last time we had a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters,"" Trump said during a Phoenix television interview last month when asked if he thinks he can win over some of Sanders' supporters if Sanders isn’t the Democratic nominee in November. ""I think if they take it away from him like they did the last time, I really believe you're going to have a very riotous time in the Democrat Party.""That was more than speculation. It's a backup battle plan for the demographic: If they can't win over disappointed Sanders voters, the president and his advisers believe they can at least convince many of them to stay home on Election Day or vote for a third-party candidate rather than support the Democratic nominee.Sanders voters in 2020 have indicated they are less likely than other voters to back the Democratic nominee should their candidate not win the nomination. In an NBC News exit poll taken on Super Tuesday, 15 percent of Sanders voters said they weren't committed to voting for the Democratic nominee, regardless of who it was, compared to 10 percent of Biden voters who said the same.Let our news meet your inbox.

""There's no question about that in my mind.""There are countless variables that will be at play in 2020 that could tip the scales from one candidate to another; it isn’t unheard of for primary voters to switch parties in the general election if their candidate isn’t the nominee. But in an election that even Trump’s allies believe will be determined by the thinnest of margins, every vote will count.Data analytics firm WPA Intelligence has been working on a computer model using demographic and consumer data to try to predict who these crossover voters are so they can be targeted by groups supporting Trump’s re-election, said Chris Willson, the firm's CEO.Nationwide, more than 1 in 10 people who voted for the Vermont senator in the 2016 primary against Hillary Clinton ended up supporting Trump in the general election, totaling more than 1.5 million votes, according to an analysis of exit polls by Tufts University political science professor Brian Schaffner, using data from the 50,000-person Cooperative Congressional Election Study.About 7 percent of people who said they are enthusiastic about or comfortable with Sanders this time around, according to a February NBC/WSJ poll, say they voted for Trump in the 2016 election.Trump’s advisers say they are optimistic they can hang on to a significant number of Sanders-Trump voters regardless of which candidate Democrats nominate by touting the president’s record on trade and immigration.And the backup to the backup, if Sanders were to be nominated: The 2016 voters Trump could lose to Sanders this time around, should he be the Democratic nominee, would be offset by winning over moderate voters turned off by Sanders' policies, said Republican strategists.“Bernie’s politics are too extreme for some suburban women who voted for Hillary in 2016,” said Republican pollster Frank Luntz. “But Bernie does win back some white male union support that went with Trump that year.”The demographics of the crossover voters from 2016 suggests the Trump campaign has a good shot at hanging on to at least some of them even in a head-to-head contest with Sanders. About half of that group identified themselves as independent or Republican. Overall, they had a more unfavorable opinion of President Barack Obama and leaned more conservatives on racial issues compared to other Sanders supporters, said Schaffner.“Sanders’ appeal to those groups was that he had this outsider appeal, he sort of ran as a populist and talked about issues that in some ways addressed some of the same people Trump was trying to address, but in a different way,” said Schaffner. “It’s all conjecture at this point, but I think if Bernie were the nominee he might have a chance at winning over some of this group, but probably not all of this group.”What happens to Sanders’ supporters this time around if he is not the nominee will have more to do with what Sanders himself does than any efforts by Trump or Biden, said Philippe Reines, a longtime Clinton adviser.While Sanders ultimately endorsed Clinton and held events for her, the Clinton campaign felt Sanders only showed lukewarm support and wasn’t as helpful as he could have been in getting the message out when and where they needed it.“Ninety percent of it is what Sanders does,” Reines said. “If Sanders doesn’t start out with a clear intent to his people that his goal is to vote for Biden, Biden can’t compensate for that.""",Sanders voters helped Trump win the White House.

"Bernie Sanders is stacking the rest of his chips on the same risky bet that may have just collapsed his odds of winning the Democratic presidential nomination.Sanders frames himself as the true progressive in the race and Joe Biden as too centrist for the Democratic primary electorate. On Friday, he contrasted their records on everything from trade policy to gay rights and abortion rights, emphasizing those differences enough to overshadow an underlying point that they would make Biden vulnerable to attacks from President Donald Trump.""As we enter the moment in this campaign where we come down to a two-person race, I think it is important for us to differentiate our records, and I intend to do that,"" Sanders said.But with each attack, Sanders may inadvertently be making the best case for Biden, who became the newly minted front-runner and prohibitive favorite in the span of four days in which he won South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary and most of the 14 states where voters went to the polls Tuesday.Sanders is right that Biden less represents the progressive id of Democratic primary voters. And in an election year in which their party has demonstrated that it is motivated in part by fear — with many liberal primary voters feeling they should suppress their own progressive impulses to defeat Trump — highlighting Biden's centrism could be a fatal strategic miscalculation on Sanders' part.Uphill climb for Sanders after Biden's Super Tuesday winsMarch 7, 202005:02In exit polling across 12 of the 14 Super Tuesday states, NBC News found that 63 percent of voters said they cared more about choosing a nominee who could beat Trump, while 34 percent said they preferred one who agreed with them on major issues.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceSanders also contends that he is electable, and polling suggests there's little difference between him and Biden in head-to-head matchups with Trump. He introduced his recounting of the contrasts between his record and Biden's Friday with the argument that Trump would exploit Biden's positions in a general election matchup.""These are issues that Trump will certainly be emphasizing in the campaign,"" Sanders said.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsBut in singling out policy matters such as federal funding for abortion rights, where Biden's past positions are more in line with Republican orthodoxy, Sanders demonstrated that contrasting his progressive credentials against Biden's is the turf he wants to fight on.The data, and Biden's willingness to cede the title of progressive champion to Sanders, suggest that's a perilous choice.Of the 63 percent who favored a nominee who could beat Trump, 37 percent said they voted for Biden and 24 percent said they voted for Sanders. At the time, several other candidates were still in the running or had exited the race so recently that they remained on the ballot. Of the 34 percent who wanted a nominee who shared their values, 42 percent favored Sanders and 25 percent went for Biden.Simple arithmetic yields this conclusion: Twenty-three percent of all voters cared most about beating Trump and chose Biden, while 14 percent cared most about a candidate sharing their views and picked Sanders. The Vermont senator actually scored a higher share among voters who wanted a candidate who could beat Trump — 15 percent — than those who preferred someone who agreed with them on the issues.Biden, keeping his focus firmly on the general election even when that hurt him in the first few states to vote, has shown little inclination to fight Sanders for the title of ""most progressive candidate."" That makes Sanders' decision to battle for territory he already owns all the more curious. But Sanders' critics have long contended that the only political math he understands is division.Biden appears to have attracted support from the departures of other candidates who found Sanders' platform too progressive and his style too aggressive, including Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg, all of whom endorsed Biden this week.The notion that Sanders is cementing a centrist reputation for Biden — which would help Biden compete with Trump for swing voters who also reject Sanders' brand of progressivism — is concerning enough to Republicans that they are moving quickly to combat it.Americans for Tax Reform, the group founded by Republican anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, sent out a press release Friday with the large-font headline ""Joe Biden is Not a 'Moderate.'"" The release included links to clips of Biden comments about repealing Trump tax cuts, raising capital gains taxes and eliminating the use of fossil fuels.That echoed the messaging of Trump's campaign ""war room"" online.Joe Biden is no moderate. He embraced Beto’s radical gun confiscation plan and pledged to make him his gun control czar.@TimMurtaugh: ""Beto O'Rourke is the one who wants to confiscate the guns of law-abiding citizens, and now he's Biden's gun guy."" pic.twitter.com/rWrc2PRbm2— Trump War Room - Text EMPOWER to 88022 (@TrumpWarRoom) March 4, 2020 Ultimately, the challenge for Sanders is to convince Democratic voters that Biden won't be able to draw an effective contrast against Trump in the general election by convincing them that Biden doesn't agree with them on the issues. He's trying to do that at a time when most Democratic primary voters care more about picking a nominee who can defeat Trump than one who shares their views.If Sanders is persuasive on the first part — showing that Biden is more centrist than the average Democratic primary voter — but not in making the case that defeating Trump requires nominating a candidate who is more in line with the party's progressive wing, he will have done Biden a major favor.So far, it appears he's done just that.",Why Sanders may be Biden's best surrogate,Mar 07 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/why-bernie-sanders-may-be-joe-biden-s-best-surrogate-n1151706,nbc
"WASHINGTON — As quickly as his pivotal political comeback in South Carolina resurrected Joe Biden’s presidential campaign and catapulted him to success on Super Tuesday, it also renewed an urgency for the Trump campaign to reload its attacks against the former vice president.For the better part of 2019, President Donald Trump’s allies treated Biden as the presumptive front-runner and spent considerable time and resources criticizing him. The president's own focus on Biden as a potential general election opponent was the focus of his impeachment in the House of Representatives (and later acquittal in the Senate) for attempting to pressure the Ukrainian president to launch, or at least announce, an investigation into unproven allegations against Biden and his son, Hunter.In recent weeks, as Biden's fortunes in the Democratic primary were dimming, the Trump team's focus shifted towards to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as he racked up victories or near-wins in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. ""Socialism"" and ""crazy Bernie"" references outnumbered ""sleepy Joe"" at his rallies and in GOP talking points.Trump turns his attacks on a resurgent Biden after Super TuesdayMarch 5, 202006:08Now, as the sometimes pundit-in-chief acknowledges, Biden has bounced back and the Trump re-election team is working to slow his momentum in the hopes of a drawn-out Democratic nomination fight. “He is just as terrible a candidate right now as he was a few days ago,” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said of Biden in a statement after Super Tuesday.Trump himself, however, predicted Biden would eventually prevail during a Fox News town hall on Thursday, coincidentally held in Biden’s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. The president said he was “all set” to take on Sanders before Biden’s impressive campaign revival, wagering that “Bernie would be tougher” as the nominee because of his fervent following.Despite the public bravado, senior campaign officials have long been concerned privately about a head-to-head matchup against Biden in the general election, specifically in key Rust Belt states.One of the main arguments the president has already deployed against Biden is to question his mental acuity and physical stamina, a similar playbook to the attack on Hillary Clinton’s health in 2016.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceThe president has repeatedly questioned Biden’s sharpness, telling raucous crowds he predicts the former vice president, if elected, would be “in a home” while his aides ran the country. The same kind of attack usually includes mockery of “gaffe-prone” Biden, which has been a theme following Biden’s occasional tendency to misspeak.“I don’t want to be too critical, but I’ve never seen anything like it, to be honest,” Trump told Sean Hannity in an interview on Fox News Wednesday night.It’s an argument echoed by his top surrogates, including his daughter-in-law Lara Trump. “Who would be running the country if this individual really is not showing he is functioning with all gears moving here? And I mean, I think it's fair to call that out and ask what is going on,” she said on Fox News Wednesday.The campaign also plans to use Democrats’ own words against Biden, questioning his acumen and astuteness. A slickly edited video released by the rapid response arm was re-circulated this week, which includes Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., then a candidate, saying last year: “There’s a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling.”For months, the campaign has claimed it has no preference for the Democratic candidate they will meet in the general election but aides have privately expressed a desire for facing Sanders, whom they believe would provide an easier and more extreme contrast as a self-proclaimed “democratic socialist.”Much like the rest of the Democratic field, senior Trump campaign officials did not see Biden’s swift resurgence coming. They had all but stopped their attacks on Biden and Ukraine once the impeachment trial came to an end.Now, as the three-time presidential hopeful's prospects rise again, the campaign is resuscitating discredited claims about Hunter Biden, with Trump committing to use them “all the time” and make it a “major issue” in the coming months.Republicans have also signaled they will ramp up an ongoing investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, the energy company whose board Hunter Biden served on while his father was vice president. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said this week he’d like to move quickly and possibly release an interim report in the coming weeks.Democrats dismiss the inquiry as purely political, arguing that GOP lawmakers are only reviving the investigation now that Biden has exceeded expectations in recent primary contests.“Donald has a history of awful strategic judgment when it comes to Joe Biden. For example, he is the only American president who has ever tried to force a foreign country to lie about the candidate he's too afraid to look in the eye,"" Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to NBC News.""Betting on these worn-out, feckless attacks would accomplish just one thing: giving us the perfect opportunity to tee up his worst liabilities. Panic often drives people to make poor decisions.""Joe Biden: President Trump ‘does not want to face me because I will beat him’March 5, 202006:49The Trump team's preference would be to see a contested Democratic convention, believing that the divisions would only benefit Trump. Even as that prospect becomes less likely with a shrinking Democratic field, the Trump campaign is seeking to capitalize on the divide between Sanders' more progressive supporters and the moderates backing Biden.As part of that effort to prod at the divisions, Trump and his allies have publicly questioned whether the Democratic Party has “rigged” the primary to damage Sanders and elevate a candidate like Biden, who is seen as more compatible with them. With efforts like that, the Trump campaign believes they can appeal to the “populist passion” of Sanders’ base, much like they know how to do with the president’s most ardent fans.The Democrat establishment came together and crushed Bernie Sanders, AGAIN! Even the fact that Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race was devastating to Bernie and allowed Sleepy Joe to unthinkably win Massachusetts. It was a perfect storm, with many good states remaining for Joe!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2020 The Trump team is also aiming at Biden on issues like trade deals supported by the longtime senator in the past, believing that trade policies supported by Biden and Obama will be beneficial to making a case that they were responsible for eliminating manufacturing jobs, especially in the Midwest.When the Democratic nomination battle does wind down — whether in weeks or months — the focus will shift to the general election battle, putting the president and his campaign events into the daily conversation again and providing even more opportunities for the campaign to make its case against the nominee.Through the primary season, Trump has shadowed Democrats as they held their primary contests, but for the first time in months, there are no major rallies on his campaign schedule in the coming weeks when Democrats vote in Idaho, North Dakota, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi and Washington state.",Trump's re-election team turns its focus back to Joe Biden,Mar 07 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-s-re-election-team-turns-its-focus-back-joe-n1151971,nbc

"The coronavirus pandemic could pose big problems for the two marquee political events before Election Day — the Democratic and Republican national conventions this summer.Party leaders are being forced to consider the possibility that the four-day gatherings may have to be dramatically scaled back or essentially cancelled, while the candidate nominating process and fundraising tens of millions of dollars for the events could be severely hampered, former convention officials told NBC News.The economic impact on the host cities — Milwaukee for the Democrats on July 13-16 and Charlotte for the Republicans on August 24-27 — could be devastating. While the economic benefit for both 2016 conventions fell short of some projections, the GOP's Cleveland effort generated $142 million while in Philadelphia, the Democratic event brought about $231 million.The conventions are still far enough down that both parties are still planning for them to start on time. But the unpredictability of the outbreak — New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said his city's major arenas may be closed for months — could leave organizers scrambling for alternatives in the not so distant future.And the 2020 race has already become a non-contact campaign — Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have switched into ""virtual"" campaign mode, forgoing large events and Sunday's Democratic debate will not have a live audience.The first issue to pop up for the national conventions has been the postponement of some state party conventions, the process by which certain state parties choose the delegates who will represent their states at the national conventions.Pressure grows for Democratic nominee to choose a female running mateMarch 11, 202005:08In an email to state party chairs on Thursday, DNC chairman Tom Perez said the committee's delegate selection team has been in contact with states that are contemplating changes to their delegate selection process in light of the coronavirus outbreak to ensure the candidate nominating process ""can continue without major interruptions.""But that's not the biggest worry on the horizon for organizers, who, should the crisis fail to pass by the summer, could be pressed with having to make major changes to their plans, such as shortening the four-day conventions, holding them with only delegates in attendance or even going as far to stage a virtual nominating process.The gatherings are large. The 2016 Republican National Convention pulled in about 44,400 visitors, according to a Cleveland State University study. Meanwhile, estimates for that year's Democratic National Convention were similar, with about 50,000 estimated to have attended.Past organizers said the biggest issue on the immediate horizon involves the vast fundraising of millions of dollars to stage the events.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service""A big part of what we did was raising money — this puts a lot of that in limbo,"" said Mike Dino, who served as CEO of the Denver host committee that helped organize the 2008 Democratic National Convention.""And if you still want to bring all the delegates together, but you don't want anybody else there, as we're seeing in a lot of our public venues at this point, you don't have the people to pay for that that usually pay for that — the corporations that want to attend to be a part of that, too,"" Dino continued.For the upcoming conventions, Democrats are slated to have 4,750 delegates present while Republicans will feature 2,550. Those totals do not include alternate delegates who would also be in attendance. Based on 2016 totals for both the Republicans and Democrats, there could be anywhere from 75 speakers to more than 250 delivering addresses at the nominating events.""Raising the money, to at least do what they had envisioned, is only going to get tougher at this point,"" he added, noting that the committees may even have to ask Congress for funding in the range of $10 million to $20 million for each convention. Congress already approved $100 million late last year in security funding for the conventions, but any new ask would be in addition to that and for non-security purposes.David Gilbert, president and CEO of the Cleveland host committee which helped organize the 2016 Republican National Convention, told NBC News that from a planning perspective ""something like this really is uncharted territory.""Even if the conventions go forward but have to be downsized, a major impact will be felt by the local economies in Milwaukee and Charlotte, which would be unlikely to see the anticipated return on their investments.""The communities go through what they do because of the significant return they get,"" Gilbert said. ""In terms of visitors, media exposure, influencers coming to their community — and they would lose every bit of it. I mean, my heart really goes out to Charlotte and to Milwaukee right now.""If the conventions are dramatically scaled back or essentially canceled, Gilbert estimated the loss to the cities would be well into the hundreds of millions of dollars.""A lot of the reasons these communities do it is also to have the eyes of the world on them,"" he added. ""It's such a rare opportunity. When, otherwise, would cities, particularly cities like a Cleveland or a Milwaukee or a Charlotte — that are great cities or mid-sized cities — have 15,000 credentialed media in their community, and the byline is from that place? That's a hard pill to swallow if that's going to be lost.""At this point, Democratic and Republican officials said they closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak but are focused on starting the conventions on time and holding them as long planned.""We're still looking at planning a safe convention for everybody four months from now,"" a senior official on the Democratic National Convention committee told NBC News, adding they are ""seriously monitoring"" the crisis.The outbreak, the official said, is being added to the ""regular contingency planning that's part of planning for any convention.""Democratic convention CEO Joe Solmonese said his team is ""in constant communication with the local, state, and federal officials responsible for protecting public health and security"" as the ""fluid"" situation develops.On the Republican side, Blair Ellis, the communications director for the GOP convention, said the organizers ""prioritize the health and safety of delegates, media, community members, and staff and have full faith and confidence in the administration's aggressive actions to address COVID-19.""""As we move forward with planning, we remain in close contact with local, state and federal officials and we will continue to closely monitor the situation and work with all stakeholders and health authorities to ensure every necessary precaution is taken into account,"" she continued.And what about the November election? If the outbreak doesn't abate, could it be postponed?A 2004 Congressional Research Service report concluded that Congress has a better claim than the president when it comes to delaying the general election in the wake of a ""sufficiently calamitous event."" At the time of the report, the concerns were in the context of a possible terror attack.""The power of Congress to protect the integrity of the presidential election, combined with its authority to set the time of election, would also seem to provide the Congress the power to postpone elections because of a national emergency,"" the report said.Congress, the report said, could vote to ""delegate"" that power to the president.","Un-conventional?

The Chicago event has been recast as a ""virtual town hall.""

The campaign also said all campaign offices will be closed to the public.The Trump campaign, on the other hand, hasn't unveiled any specific plans for virtual campaign events, although campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told NBC News that because the campaign is ""built on data and uses technology to its highest advantages,"" it is better positioned to ""virtually engage voters than any other campaign.”Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsThe campaign has in recent days canceled or postponed several events that Trump or surrogates had been scheduled to attend.

Washington state, where the candidates were running neck and neck, was still too close to call on Wednesday, but Sanders appeared to be underperforming in most states that voted Tuesday compared to the huge victories he scored in them in his unsuccessful campaign in 2016.Biden also expanded his already substantial lead in delegates.Here are five takeaways from a pivotal night in the 2020 election.1. Sanders' theory of the case fell short. Again.Sanders' prospects hinged on young progressives' turning out in droves to overwhelm their older moderate-leaning counterparts. That didn't happen on Super Tuesday, and it didn't happen on ""Super Tuesday II,"" either.The key dividing line in the primary season has been age, with millennials and Gen Z voters overwhelmingly backing Sanders, while older generations flock to Biden.Meanwhile, Biden's strategy never looked more correct — Twitter isn't real life, the young and online left isn't representative, and Democratic voters are ultimately more pragmatic than ideological. There hasn't been a progressive revolution for change; there has been a suburban revolution for normalcy.Voters under 30 dipped as a share of the electorate compared to 2016, including in Michigan and Missouri, two key victories for Biden, according to NBC News exit polls. In Livingston County in the Detroit area, one of the wealthiest counties in Michigan, turnout surged from over 17,000 in 2016 to more than 27,000 in 2020. Biden won it by 17 points.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service2. Women are propelling BidenWomen make up a considerable majority of the Democratic electorate, and they're proving to be a key ingredient to Biden's success. He carried them by 33 points in Missouri, by 23 points in Michigan, by 68 points in Mississippi and by 19 points in Washington state. Sanders did far better with men, even winning them in some states.The gender gap Tuesday comes days after Elizabeth Warren, who is aligned with Sanders on many policy issues, dropped out of the race and raised concerns about the ""online bullying and sort of organized nastiness"" among some of his supporters. Unlike more moderate candidates — Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar — who embraced Biden, Warren hasn't yet endorsed.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics3. Black voters are kingmakersThe candidate who has carried African American voters has won every Democratic presidential cycle since 1992, and that streak looks likely to continue in 2020.Biden's performance among black voters since South Carolina has been nothing short of dominant. They propelled him to a significant delegate lead last week and helped him expand it this week. On Tuesday, he won black voters by 38 points in Michigan, by 48 points in Missouri and by 76 points in Mississippi.One bright spot for Sanders? He continued to do well among Latino voters after they carried him to victories in states like Nevada and Colorado.4. Biden is talking like the nominee""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal. And together we'll defeat Donald Trump. We'll defeat him together,"" Biden said in Philadelphia.In rhetoric and demeanor Tuesday night, Biden seemed like the long-dominant front-runner of 2019 before his campaign took a nosedive in the early states. He evoked the need to unify the country to restore its soul. He warned that America's character was at stake and that four more years of President Donald Trump could permanently alter it.Democratic groups that had been neutral in the battle are ready to dive in. ""The math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for President and @prioritiesUSA is going to do everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November. I hope others will join us in the fight,"" said Guy Cecil, the chief of the party's largest super PAC.5. Team Sanders says he isn't leavingWhile Democratic elites are eager to put the primary behind them and shift focus to the general election, top Sanders aides indicated he isn't leaving in a hurry, as he's slated to debate Biden on Sunday in Phoenix.""The tougher the primary is for the Democratic nominee, the better, more battle-tested the nominee will be,"" Sanders aide David Sirota tweeted. ""Establishment demands for silence in the name of 'unity' — or for the end of a contested primary — don't serve the cause of defeating Trump. They weaken that cause.""Campaign spokeswoman Briahna Joy Gray added: ""I, for one, am extremely excited about this debate all the moderates are panicking about...America finally gets to see Biden defend his ideas, or lack there of, on Sunday.""",Key takeaways from election night — and they aren't good news for Sanders,Mar 11 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/key-takeaways-election-night-they-aren-t-good-news-sanders-n1155196,nbc

"WASHINGTON — The progressive advocacy group Stand Up America is putting pressure on the last two major Democratic candidates, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, to call for eliminating the 60-vote threshold to pass legislation in the Senate.Ahead of the Democratic debate Sunday in Phoenix, the group plans to mobilize the 2 million members it boasts — via social media, email and a text message list of 400,000 — to press the moderators to ask the candidates about the filibuster.""We must end the filibuster if we want to get a progressive agenda through,"" Sean Eldridge, the founder and president of Stand Up America, said in an interview.

It comes after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a vocal supporter of eliminating the filibuster, ended her campaign after falling short in the early states and Super Tuesday.Feb. 19: We can't pass climate legislation because of 'corruption' and 'the filibuster,' Warren saysFeb. 20, 202001:07The push to nuke the filibuster is opposed by Biden, who was a senator for three decades, and Sanders, who has served in the chamber since 2007. It takes 50 votes in the Senate to eliminate the rule, and activists believe that would require an aggressive push from the presidential nominee.Eldridge said the goal is to push the nominee to endorse an end to the 60-vote rule.Under President Barack Obama, bills like the DREAM Act and near-universal background checks for gun buyers had majority support in the Senate but were thwarted by the filibuster. The former president lamented after he left office that the 60-vote rule made it ""almost impossible"" to govern.Other progressive groups, like Indivisible, have also made it a priority to get rid of the filibuster. They argue that while reducing the threshold to 51 votes would also enable Republicans to pass more conservative legislation, progressives would benefit more from it.""The best way to know that ending the filibuster would net-benefit the Democrats is that [Senate Republican leader] Mitch McConnell loves it,"" Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin said.",Progressive group pressures Sanders and Biden to call for ending filibuster,Mar 10 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/progressive-group-pressures-sanders-biden-call-ending-filibuster-n1153696,nbc

Yarbrough (@cookcountyclerk) March 17, 2020 Polling places are also taking their own precautions in an effort to keep people at least 6 feet apart, the distance recommended by health professionals to avoid the spread of the coronavirus.Disruptions have already been reported in each state, with some locations closing or changing and poll workers dropping out because of coronavirus concerns.Delaying primaries due to coronavirusMarch 15, 202011:49In Arizona, Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, cut almost 80 polling places due to a lack of sufficient cleaning supplies and to ensure that those sites that remain open have enough poll workers, the county’s board of supervisors announced.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceFlorida Secretary of State Laurel Lee tweeted that the state’s Department of Health “has assured healthy Floridians it’s safe to work the polls for & vote in Tuesday’s election.”Lee reminded voters they can designate another person to pick up their vote-by-mail ballot on Tuesday for them — a provision that is meant to be used in case of emergency. After voters cast their ballots, they or their designee can return it before polls close to a designated secure drop box.Illinois announced Monday that its in-person primary would proceed as scheduled, but Marisel Hernandez, chair of Chicago’s board of elections, said at a news conference Sunday that some areas were struggling to muster enough poll workers. More than 160 locations in Chicago have notified the city’s board of elections they didn’t want to participate. The state has seen record numbers of early voting, with nearly 140,000 voting by mail and over 16,000 early voters.Last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidance for preventing the spread of the coronavirus at physical polling locations. The recommendations include encouraging mail-in or drive-up voting, urging poll workers to stay home if they are feeling ill and to regularly disinfect voting machine surfaces and tools like pens for marking ballots. Voting machine makers have also issued guidance so that disinfectant chemicals don’t damage equipment or ballots.One state, Ohio, has postponed in-person voting until June 2 after the director of the state Department of Health ordered polls closed as a health emergency hours before they were set to open. Until then, voters can vote by mail.Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said in a statement that the state’s primaries would go on.“We have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future, and elections do not end on election day,” Hobbs said. “There are thousands of workers in communities across the state that must continue the job of counting the ballots in the days following the election.”Arizona and Florida, with their higher proportion of retirees, present an extra concern because the elderly are more susceptible to the coronavirus.Ohio Gov. DeWine recommends postponing in-person primary votingMarch 16, 202003:26Offsetting some of the concerns, both states use hand-marked paper ballots for most voters, meaning they will not need to use electronic touchscreens, dials or buttons. Electronic ballot-marking devices are available for those with accessibility needs.Concerns about glitches with voting machines or process issues, which have frustrated a handful of locations this primary voting season, aren’t as much of a concern in the three states voting Tuesday, said Eddie Perez, an election administration analyst with the Open Source Election Technology Institute. NBC News has collaborated with the OSET Institute since 2016 to monitor U.S. election-technology and voting issues.But the states are also taking extra steps to highlight different methods of casting ballots for voters to limit risks.Arizonans can vote by mail or drop off vote-by-mail ballots at designated locations before polls close Tuesday night, Hobbs said. Some counties also offer curbside voting and drive-up ballot drop-offs.Nearly 70 percent of voters in the state have already received a ballot by mail.The potential for longer lines because judges or volunteers cancel proceedings or because locations take on more voters could be offset by the expected decline in turnout as voters avoid public places, said Susan Greenhalgh, an election integrity advocate.Voters could also be surprised by location changes, which could stem from a lack of volunteers or the need to move polling locations from places with more at-risk voters, such as senior living facilities. Voters are encouraged to check with their local or state election officials to confirm their polling locations.",Primary states voting Tuesday take steps to limit coronavirus risks,Mar 17 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/primary-states-voting-tuesday-take-steps-limit-coronavirus-risks-n1161636,nbc

"WASHINGTON — Democrats in three states will hold primaries Tuesday in the first big day of voting since the coronavirus upended vast swaths of American life and was declared a national emergency.It is uncharted territory for Arizona, Florida and Illinois, which collectively award 441 delegates to the Democratic convention, more than one-fifth of what’s needed to clinch the nomination. Joe Biden leads Bernie Sanders by about 150 delegates, according to the latest NBC News count.Here are five things to watch for on Tuesday.Coronavirus havocThe virus caused Ohio to postpone its primary at the last minute. In-person voter turnout may take a hit in the remaining states after the Trump administration recommended Monday that Americans avoid public gatherings of more than 10 people to limit spread of the disease.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceWith the nation on edge, many are wondering whether polling places will be fully staffed and whether those who seek to vote will be able to do so. Some continue to wonder whether states will grant extensions or accommodations for people to vote later — and if so, how.Will there be more primaries?States that are expected to vote in the upcoming weeks will be watching how the primaries go Tuesday as they decide whether to move forward with their contests or delay them. That includes delegate-rich contests like New York and Pennsylvania, which are currently set to vote on April 28. If things go smoothly in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, that might nudge them to stay the course. But if there's chaos, expect more delays and postponements and some states to consider switching to vote-by-mail operations.Will Sanders win anywhere?If the polls are any indication, Biden is positioned to expand his delegate lead. He leads Sanders by 38 points in Florida, according to a Univision survey, and by 17 points in Arizona according to a NBC/Marist poll. Sanders lost all three states in the 2016 primary. If he wants to revive his fortunes this time, he needs to win states that he lost last time.Sanders spokesman Mike Casca said Tuesday morning that the campaign is not doing its traditional get-out-the-vote outreach in the three primary states today. The senator tweeted out guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying that “going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and we respect whichever choice voters make.”Will Biden expand his base?Two groups that Biden has been performing poorly with are voters under 45 and Latinos, who have embraced Sanders in big numbers. The former vice president has sought to unify the party as he edges closer to presumptive nominee status, including with new policy planks to allow people to discharge student debt in bankruptcy and allow for free tuition at public colleges and universities for those with family incomes under $125,000.Aside from Florida Hispanics, who are already expected to strongly support Biden, Tuesday's voting will indicate whether he's making inroads with under-45s and other Latinos.The Arizona bellwetherA traditionally red state that's turning purple, Arizona is seen by forecasters as a potential tipping point  in the general election. Hillary Clinton came within 3.5 points of victory in 2016, and Democrats won a Senate race in 2018 to replace Republican Sen. John McCain.Voting patterns in the primary Tuesday may provide a glimpse into the zeitgeist, and offer clues about whether the state is ready to go blue in a presidential election for just the second time in the last 70 years.","5 things to watch as Arizona, Florida and Illinois vote",Mar 17 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/5-things-watch-florida-illinois-arizona-vote-during-coronavirus-mayhem-n1161726,nbc

The candidates clashed over issues ranging from bankruptcy policy and same-sex marriage to health care and immigration and highlighted their differing visions for the country.Here are five key takeaways from the evening.Share this -2d ago / 2:55 AM UTCWatch Biden, Sanders debate coronavirus, more in 2 minutesMarch 16, 202002:23Share this -Lauren Egan2d ago / 2:54 AM UTCTrump campaign attacks Biden, Sanders for ‘plagiarizing’ his coronavirus planPresident Donald Trump's re-election campaign attacked Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders for their debate performance, arguing that neither candidate provided a sufficient response to the coronavirus pandemic.“Unable to articulate a coronavirus plan, both Bernie and Biden offered little more than plagiarizing President Trump’s response, which will now be the model for all future pandemics,” said Kayleigh McEnany, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign.Trump has been heavily criticized for his bungled reaction to the virus. He insisted for weeks that the virus was under control and misled the public about the severity of the situation. Biden and Sanders have both delivered speeches outlining how they would have responded to the outbreak from day one.“It doesn’t matter which of these two is the Democrat nominee, either one would reverse the hottest economy in modern history and the great gains we have made under President Trump,” said McEnany.Share this -Mike Memoli and Marianna Sotomayor2d ago / 2:54 AM UTCWhy Biden made his running mate commitmentJoe Biden’s commitment in Sunday’s debate to name a female running mate tonight was not an accident or ad lib: The former vice president entered the debate looking for an opportunity to make that commitment explicit as he seeks to reinforce the perception in the minds of Democrats that he is very close to being, if not is already, the presumptive nominee, a senior campaign official told NBC News.Biden has often been asked in town hall-style events about his vice presidential pick. In answering that question, he has given variations on wanting or hoping to choose a woman running mate — but never gave such a clear-cut commitment until now.Biden has enjoyed getting that question on the trail in part because it has allowed him to pivot to discussing, often at considerable length, what made his working relationship  with President Barack Obama so effective. He often says historians considered their relationship one of the best working relationships between a president and vice president in history, and adds that the reason they worked so well together is because Obama had complete trust in him and their views were “simpatico,” to use one of his favorite words.Among the current or former officials Biden has either explicitly or implicitly included in his list of potential VP picks are Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Deputy Attorney Gen. Sally Yates, who recently endorsed Biden, former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, and New Hampshire Democratic Sens.

Skip the handshake. No audience. An unusual debate, thanks to coronavirus.If you deliver an applause line and there's no one around to clap, did it really land?That was the question at Sunday night's debate on CNN between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden when, because of fears of the coronavirus, there was no live audience to boo! or woo! when, say, the former vice president pledged to name a woman as his running mate.The septuagenarian candidates started with an elbow bump in lieu of a handshake, and their podiums (highly sanitized, CNN assured ahead of time) were as far apart on the stage (also highly sanitized) as the candidates were on the issues. It was also almost certainly the first presidential debate in history to include the phrases ""I'm using a lot of soap"" (Sanders) and ""I wash my hands God knows how many times a day"" (Biden).But the real innovation was what was missing.

I will not be cutting, but they will. Be careful!— Donald J.

The candidates clashed over issues ranging from bankruptcy policy and same-sex marriage to health care and immigration and highlighted their differing visions for the country.Here are five key takeaways from the evening.Share this - 2d ago / 2:55 AM UTCWatch Biden, Sanders debate coronavirus, more in 2 minutesMarch 16, 202002:23Share this - Lauren Egan2d ago / 2:54 AM UTCTrump campaign attacks Biden, Sanders for ‘plagiarizing’ his coronavirus planPresident Donald Trump's re-election campaign attacked Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders for their debate performance, arguing that neither candidate provided a sufficient response to the coronavirus pandemic.“Unable to articulate a coronavirus plan, both Bernie and Biden offered little more than plagiarizing President Trump’s response, which will now be the model for all future pandemics,” said Kayleigh McEnany, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign.Trump has been heavily criticized for his bungled reaction to the virus. He insisted for weeks that the virus was under control and misled the public about the severity of the situation. Biden and Sanders have both delivered speeches outlining how they would have responded to the outbreak from day one.“It doesn’t matter which of these two is the Democrat nominee, either one would reverse the hottest economy in modern history and the great gains we have made under President Trump,” said McEnany.Share this - Mike Memoli and Marianna Sotomayor2d ago / 2:54 AM UTCWhy Biden made his running mate commitmentJoe Biden’s commitment in Sunday’s debate to name a female running mate tonight was not an accident or ad lib: The former vice president entered the debate looking for an opportunity to make that commitment explicit as he seeks to reinforce the perception in the minds of Democrats that he is very close to being, if not is already, the presumptive nominee, a senior campaign official told NBC News.Biden has often been asked in town hall-style events about his vice presidential pick. In answering that question, he has given variations on wanting or hoping to choose a woman running mate — but never gave such a clear-cut commitment until now.Biden has enjoyed getting that question on the trail in part because it has allowed him to pivot to discussing, often at considerable length, what made his working relationship  with President Barack Obama so effective. He often says historians considered their relationship one of the best working relationships between a president and vice president in history, and adds that the reason they worked so well together is because Obama had complete trust in him and their views were “simpatico,” to use one of his favorite words.Among the current or former officials Biden has either explicitly or implicitly included in his list of potential VP picks are Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Deputy Attorney Gen. Sally Yates, who recently endorsed Biden, former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, and New Hampshire Democratic Sens.

"WASHINGTON — Bernie Sanders says the coronavirus pandemic highlights the need for the populist progressive political revolution he's been promoting for five years. Democrats aren't buying it.The vast majority of them trust front-runner Joe Biden to handle a crisis more than they trust Sanders, according to NBC News polls in a series of states that held presidential primaries Tuesday. In Florida, 71 percent of voters picked Biden on that question, while 64 percent did in Illinois and 63 percent did in Arizona.Biden's big wins in all three states meant he ended the night having expanded his controlling delegate lead.The question now for progressives is whether it's their message or their messenger, Sanders, that Democrats are rejecting as the centrist Biden moves ever closer to winning the party's nomination and President Donald Trump pushes a coronavirus stimulus package that features a populist plan to send thousand-dollar checks to Americans.""If we need an avatar for the progressive movement in this crisis moment, it should be Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders is not the ideal pick right now,"" Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said of the senator from Massachusetts who dropped out of the presidential campaign nearly two weeks ago. ""She's a one-person think tank pumping out ideas hourly.""Sanders' continued presence in the race ""incentivizes Biden to work with progressives"" and is ""a source of leverage,"" Green said. But he said Warren, who has proposed a $750 billion stimulus and a variety of specific policy ideas within that framework, demonstrated her own influence recently when Biden adopted her bankruptcy plan.Let our news meet your inbox.

Congress, the White House and the Federal Reserve are pumping trillions of dollars into stimulating and stabilizing the economy. On the political left, there is concern that the flow of money could exacerbate systemic inequalities and hope that it could reduce them.But as the polling and voting Tuesday demonstrated, Sanders' arguments didn't take hold with most Democratic primary voters — a set that is typically more progressive than the group of Democrats who show up to vote in general elections.Sanders calls for $2,000 payment for every American householdMarch 18, 202002:58Sanders said the vulnerabilities revealed by the coronavirus crisis exist for the poor and the working class all the time and should be addressed permanently, not just on an emergency basis.""Last year, at least 30,000 people died in America because they didn't get health care when they should, because we don't have universal coverage,"" he said. ""I think that's a crisis. One out of 5 people in America cannot afford the prescription drugs they need. They suffer. Some die. I consider that a crisis. Bottom line is we need a simple system ... and that is if you are an American, you get the health care you need, end of discussion.""Biden dismissed Sanders as a broken record in pushing a single-payer universal health care insurance plan called ""Medicare for All.""""Look, this is a national crisis — I don't want to get this into a back and forth in terms of our politics here,"" Biden said. ""This idea that this is his only answer is a mistaken notion, but regardless of whether my plan was in place or his, this is a crisis. ... This is like a war, and in a war you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people. ... It has nothing to do with Bernie's Medicare for All.""Sanders was ineffective enough that he came back for a second pass Tuesday in a livestreamed speech on his website as election returns were being tabulated.He called for Medicare to pay all medical bills during the crisis — regardless of whether they were related to the virus — emergency payments of $2,000 per month for every household, a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, unemployment compensation of a full salary of up to $75,000 for anyone who loses a job and a variety of other measures.He urged Americans not to turn to ""fear and panic"" but to remember people who are hurting during the crisis.Sanders chose not to deliver public remarks on the results of Tuesday's primaries as Biden extended his lead in the race for pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Calls for Sanders to exit the race are sure to continue to get louder from some corners of the Democratic Party.But it may be that the best way to end his campaign without damaging Biden is a slow and quiet march toward non-competitiveness. If Sanders' most ardent supporters come to realize that he just can't beat Biden, perhaps they won't angrily reject the Democratic nominee come November.The question would remain for progressives: Is Sanders the best voice for their movement?",Why did Sanders' coronavirus pitch flop?,Mar 18 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/sanders-coronavirus-pitch-flopped-was-it-message-or-messenger-n1162421,nbc

"WASHINGTON — Anti-abortion rights Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski was ousted on Tuesday night by progressive challenger Marie Newman in a high-profile primary in Illinois, giving liberals a glimmer of hope in what otherwise has been a dispiriting election year for them.Lipinski had successfully fought back numerous challenges on his left flank, including one from Newman in 2018. But he finally succumbed Tuesday when the Associated Press called the rematch for Newman, who garnered 47 percent of the vote to Lipinski's 45 percent, with two lesser-known candidates splitting the rest.Lipinski, who in 2005 inherited his Chicago-area seat from his father, longtime former Rep. Bill Lipinski, has drawn the ire of a wide range of progressive groups for his votes and policy statements on abortion, health care and other issues.Let our news meet your inbox.

"The nation's response to the coronavirus outbreak dominated much of the discussion in the 11th Democratic debate on Sunday night — the first time that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders went head to head on stage in the 2020 election cycle.Also a first: Biden vowing to name a woman as his running mate if he wins the nomination.The former vice president and Vermont independent senator squared off in dramatically different surroundings than initially planned, Washington instead of Phoenix, and in CNN's studio instead of a 5,000-seat theater with a live audience — a venue change prompted by coronavirus fears as the nation goes into lockdown over the pandemic.Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination following a string of state primary victories since winning in South Carolina last month.

"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden doubled his delegate lead over Bernie Sanders in Tuesday's primaries, giving him a nearly insurmountable advantage after sweeping Florida, Illinois and Arizona, according to NBC News projections.The former vice president now has 315 more delegates than the senator from Vermont — 1,132 to Sanders' 817 — after having started the night with an edge of 154.Biden has passed the halfway mark and is well on his way to the 1,991 delegates he needs to win a majority of all delegates and capture the Democratic presidential nomination.Sanders did not address the results Tuesday night.

In 2016, Sanders got blown out in Florida, but he was at least able to win nine counties and a third of the delegates.While results were still coming in, Biden is on track for a similarly strong win in Illinois, where Sanders is currently winning just one county — home to the University of Illinois — and although Arizona is closer, Biden will still extract more delegates from the state.The former vice president's growing delegate lead makes a comeback by Sanders increasingly unlikely as the number of delegate-rich states on the calendar dwindles from this point on.Because Democrats award delegates in proportion to each candidate's vote share, Sanders would likely need to win coming states by very lopsided margins to catch up to Biden.Meanwhile, six future contests have so far been delayed by the coronavirus outbreak, including the next two that had been set for this month, Georgia and Puerto Rico.The means that after a jampacked Democratic presidential calendar with election nights every week for almost two months, there is no vote on the books in any states until April 4, when Hawaii, Alaska and Wyoming will weigh in.Those states are expected to be friendlier territory for Sanders but don't offer many delegates.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump. They also rolled out new Spanish-language ads in Florida, Arizona and Illinois discussing Biden’s records on guns, healthcare and the need for leadership to prevent future global panic like the one caused by coronavirus.Unite the Country, the Super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy, will also not be on the airwaves or on digital in the coming weeks as they focus on expanding their group with sights set on the general election, Steve Schale, a top strategist for the group, told NBC News. After projected losses in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries on Tuesday night, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that Sanders ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign"" but that ""In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""Through March 10, before the campaign was completely upended by coronavirus, the Sanders campaign had significantly outspent the Biden campaign on the television and radio airwaves—$42.2 million to $14.6 million respectively. —Mike Memoli contributed. Share this -Ben Popken, Kevin Collier and Shamar Walters3h ago / 5:03 PM UTCChicago's voting struggles illustrate the challenges of coronavirusChicago voters were turned away for hours at dozens of polling locations that opened without voting machines, adequate cleaning supplies or enough poll workers — acutely illustrating the strain of voting under the threat of coronavirus exposure and mandates for social distancing and disinfecting surfaces. The delays were driven by a shortage of poll workers and the need to move polling equipment to new locations, Noah Praetz, a former director of elections at Cook County, told NBC News, adding that ""probably 60 percent of necessary poll workers” handled things. After 200 polling locations were changed, about 50 precincts didn’t have enough supplies to open, James P. Allen, a spokesman for the city's elections board, told reporters. Locations struggled to find enough workers and went through a large number of replacement judges, he said. By Monday, the number of resignations from judges had risen to “a torrent, a tsunami of calls,” Chicago Board of Elections Chair Marisel Hernandez said.At the end of the day, turnout was slightly over 30 percent in the city in what were “extremely challenging conditions,“ the city’s elections board reported — a steep drop from over 50 percent turnout in 2016 and only a few percentage points above the city’s record-low presidential primary turnout in 2012.Efforts to push alternate means to in-person voting like early voting and voting by mail appeared successful Tuesday, with nearly 600,000 early votes cast and nearly 300,000 ballots sent by mail across the state, compared to about 423,000 early votes and 162,000 mail-in ballots in the 2016 primary, according to the Illinois State Board of Elections.Share this -4h ago / 3:36 PM UTCBiden sweeps Sanders in 3 states on one of the strangest primary days in recent historyMarch 18, 202005:08Share this -Alex Seitz-Wald5h ago / 3:19 PM UTCLongtime anti-abortion rights Democrat Rep.

In Florida, 71 percent of voters picked Biden on that question, while 64 percent did in Illinois and 63 percent did in Arizona.The question now for progressives is whether it's their message or their messenger, Sanders, that Democrats are rejecting as the centrist Biden moves ever closer to winning the party's nomination and President Donald Trump pushes a coronavirus stimulus package that features a populist plan to send thousand-dollar checks to Americans.Read the analysis here.Share this -Chuck Todd, Mark Murray  and Carrie Dann7h ago / 1:24 PM UTCFIRST READ: After Tuesday's losses, Sanders faces more questions about his campaign's futureUnder normal circumstances, there would be enormous pressure for Bernie Sanders to suspend his presidential campaign and unite — now that he trails Joe Biden by 315 pledged delegates, and that he continues to underperform from his 2016 campaign.But these aren’t normal circumstances.With more than 5,700 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, with at least 100 deaths, and with states (including Ohio yesterday) postponing their primaries until May or June, the interest isn’t party unity.It’s the country’s health.Get First Read.Share this -Shaquille Brewster and Rebecca Shabad7h ago / 1:21 PM UTCSanders to 'assess' campaignSen.

"WASHINGTON — Underdog Bernie Sanders came to fight, and front-runner Joe Biden promised a woman vice presidential candidate.The Democratic debate Sunday began as a genteel conversation over how to address the coronavirus and descended into a testy battle over records and who has the courage to do the right thing. The candidates clashed over issues from bankruptcy policy and same-sex marriage to health care and immigration, highlighting their differing visions for the country.The debate was hosted by CNN and Univision in the nation's capital with no live audience and 6 feet between the candidates' podiums. There was no handshake as the two men instead elbow-bumped to practice social distancing as the coronavirus ravages the U.S. and shuts down much of American public life.Here are five key takeaways from the evening.Biden promises a female running mateFor the first time, Biden committed Sunday to selecting a woman to be his running mate if he's the Democratic nominee, adding that he wants his Cabinet to look like the diverse country.""I would pick a woman to be my vice president,"" he said.Sanders said he was inclined to pick a woman but stopped short of an ironclad promise, saying it's important that his running mate is progressive. ""In all likelihood, I will,"" he said.Biden commits to picking woman as his vice presidentMarch 16, 202000:30Coronavirus clash captures the contrastThe opening 30 minutes, about how to address the coronavirus outbreak, captured the two candidates' messages well.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceBiden said Americans ""are looking for results, not a revolution,"" and need immediate action to mitigate the crisis. Sanders said the virus underscored how fundamentally broken the country's health care and economic systems are, arguing that universal health care and far-reaching policies are needed to mitigate income inequality. Biden pointedly said he'd call on the military to help address the crisis, while Sanders said the use of the National Guard might be appropriate.Biden followed a familiar playbook — accept Sanders' concerns but resist his prescriptions. He said that his rival was right about the broken health care system but that single payer was not the solution; he said that economic inequality was a real issue but that the imminent crisis required a targeted solution in the form of ""a major, major, major bailout package"" that rewards individuals, not corporations.Biden was also eager to defuse the tension as he courts Sanders' supporters, saying at one point, ""I don't want to get this into a back and forth in terms of our politics.""

He also knocked Biden for supporting efforts that would have cut Social Security, such as the Bowles-Simpson commission and balanced budget amendments.""You're an honest guy. Why don't you just tell them the truth here?"" Sanders said in a feisty clash full of interruptions and cries of ""Bernie!"" and ""Joe!""""We did not cut it,"" Biden said.""I know, because people like me helped stop it,"" Sanders retorted.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsSanders said Biden lacked the courage to take difficult stances when they were unpopular. Biden said Sanders had previously voted against background checks for gun sales and to grant immunity to firearm manufacturers (two positions the senator from Vermont has since disavowed).""He's making it hard for me now — I was trying to give him credit for some things,"" Biden quipped, saying that when it comes to addressing climate change, ""we disagree on the detail of how we do it. But we don't disagree on the principle.""Sanders evokes ObamaIt was a role reversal: When Biden tore into Sanders for opposing the 2007 immigration bill that would have granted undocumented people a pathway to citizenship, Sanders name-checked President Barack Obama in reference to the so-called Dorgan amendment, which gutted the guest-worker program and ultimately derailed the measure in the Senate.""Y'know who voted with me on that one, Joe? Barack Obama,"" Sanders said.He was correct that Obama, then in the Senate, voted for the amendment, but he neglected to mention what happened next: Obama voted ""yes"" to advance the legislation to a final vote, while Sanders voted ""no"" and joined the coalition that killed it.Team Trump was watching BidenThe Trump campaign kept an eagle eye on Biden during the debate in the hope of amassing an opposition research file on its likely general election opponent. It has paid special attention to his verbal stumbles in recent public events, and it delighted Sunday in pointing out mid-debate that the former vice president, who overcame a speech impediment as a young man, got tongue-tied early on and called the H1N1 virus the ""N1H1"" virus.An aide to President Donald Trump also highlighted Biden's suggestion that he'd limit deportations to people who have committed felonies, a sign that the president may try to weaponize the issue in the fall.",5 takeaways from the Democratic debate,Mar 16 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/5-takeaways-democratic-debate-joe-biden-promises-woman-vp-n1160001,nbc

"Joe Biden defeated Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, NBC News projected Tuesday, opening up a nearly insurmountable delegate lead.In Ohio, polls were ordered closed as a public health measure after a judge declined the governor's request to postpone the election. But contests in the other three states proceeded as scheduled Tuesday despite widespread fears over the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic.The outbreak, which has sickened more than 5,000 people in the U.S., is thrusting the Democratic primary into uncertainty, with some states postponing their elections and the candidates forgoing rallies for virtual events.Highlights from the March 17 Democratic primaries:Key takeaways from the night: Biden marches toward the nomination.President Donald Trump officially became the Republican presumptive nominee.Here's what states are doing to limit coronavirus risks.Live BlogSEE  NEW POSTSMarianna Sotomayor and Gary Grumbach 17h ago / 4:22 PM UTCBiden, Sanders campaigns ramping down ad spending amid coronavirus spreadWASHINGTON – With the coronavirus outbreak prompting several states to postpone their primary elections, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump. They also rolled out new Spanish-language ads in Florida, Arizona and Illinois discussing Biden’s records on guns, healthcare and the need for leadership to prevent future global panic like the one caused by coronavirus.Unite the Country, the Super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy, will also not be on the airwaves or on digital in the coming weeks as they focus on expanding their group with sights set on the general election, Steve Schale, a top strategist for the group, told NBC News. After projected losses in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries on Tuesday night, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that Sanders ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign"" but that ""In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""Through March 10, before the campaign was completely upended by coronavirus, the Sanders campaign had significantly outspent the Biden campaign on the television and radio airwaves—$42.2 million to $14.6 million respectively. —Mike Memoli contributed. Share this -Ben Popken, Kevin Collier and Shamar Walters16h ago / 5:03 PM UTCChicago's voting struggles illustrate the challenges of coronavirusChicago voters were turned away for hours at dozens of polling locations that opened without voting machines, adequate cleaning supplies or enough poll workers — acutely illustrating the strain of voting under the threat of coronavirus exposure and mandates for social distancing and disinfecting surfaces. The delays were driven by a shortage of poll workers and the need to move polling equipment to new locations, Noah Praetz, a former director of elections at Cook County, told NBC News, adding that ""probably 60 percent of necessary poll workers” handled things. After 200 polling locations were changed, about 50 precincts didn’t have enough supplies to open, James P. Allen, a spokesman for the city's elections board, told reporters. Locations struggled to find enough workers and went through a large number of replacement judges, he said. By Monday, the number of resignations from judges had risen to “a torrent, a tsunami of calls,” Chicago Board of Elections Chair Marisel Hernandez said.At the end of the day, turnout was slightly over 30 percent in the city in what were “extremely challenging conditions,“ the city’s elections board reported — a steep drop from over 50 percent turnout in 2016 and only a few percentage points above the city’s record-low presidential primary turnout in 2012.Efforts to push alternate means to in-person voting like early voting and voting by mail appeared successful Tuesday, with nearly 600,000 early votes cast and nearly 300,000 ballots sent by mail across the state, compared to about 423,000 early votes and 162,000 mail-in ballots in the 2016 primary, according to the Illinois State Board of Elections.Share this -17h ago / 3:36 PM UTCBiden sweeps Sanders in 3 states on one of the strangest primary days in recent historyMarch 18, 202005:08Share this -Alex Seitz-Wald18h ago / 3:19 PM UTCLongtime anti-abortion rights Democrat Rep.

Allen, a spokesman for the city's elections board, told reporters. Locations struggled to find enough workers and went through a large number of replacement judges, he said. By Monday, the number of resignations from judges had risen to “a torrent, a tsunami of calls,” Chicago Board of Elections Chair Marisel Hernandez said.At the end of the day, turnout was slightly over 30 percent in the city in what were “extremely challenging conditions,“ the city’s elections board reported — a steep drop from over 50 percent turnout in 2016 and only a few percentage points above the city’s record-low presidential primary turnout in 2012.Efforts to push alternate means to in-person voting like early voting and voting by mail appeared successful Tuesday, with nearly 600,000 early votes cast and nearly 300,000 ballots sent by mail across the state, compared to about 423,000 early votes and 162,000 mail-in ballots in the 2016 primary, according to the Illinois State Board of Elections.Share this - 17h ago / 3:36 PM UTCBiden sweeps Sanders in 3 states on one of the strangest primary days in recent historyMarch 18, 202005:08Share this - Alex Seitz-Wald18h ago / 3:19 PM UTCLongtime anti-abortion rights Democrat Rep.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump.

Allen, a spokesman for the city's elections board, told reporters. Locations struggled to find enough workers and went through a large number of replacement judges, he said. By Monday, the number of resignations from judges had risen to “a torrent, a tsunami of calls,” Chicago Board of Elections Chair Marisel Hernandez said.At the end of the day, turnout was slightly over 30 percent in the city in what were “extremely challenging conditions,“ the city’s elections board reported — a steep drop from over 50 percent turnout in 2016 and only a few percentage points above the city’s record-low presidential primary turnout in 2012.Efforts to push alternate means to in-person voting like early voting and voting by mail appeared successful Tuesday, with nearly 600,000 early votes cast and nearly 300,000 ballots sent by mail across the state, compared to about 423,000 early votes and 162,000 mail-in ballots in the 2016 primary, according to the Illinois State Board of Elections.Share this -20h ago / 3:36 PM UTCBiden sweeps Sanders in 3 states on one of the strangest primary days in recent historyMarch 18, 202005:08Share this -Alex Seitz-Wald21h ago / 3:19 PM UTCLongtime anti-abortion rights Democrat Rep.

One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump. They also rolled out new Spanish-language ads in Florida, Arizona and Illinois discussing Biden’s records on guns, healthcare and the need for leadership to prevent future global panic like the one caused by coronavirus.Unite the Country, the Super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy, will also not be on the airwaves or on digital in the coming weeks as they focus on expanding their group with sights set on the general election, Steve Schale, a top strategist for the group, told NBC News. After projected losses in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries on Tuesday night, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that Sanders ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign"" but that ""In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""Through March 10, before the campaign was completely upended by coronavirus, the Sanders campaign had significantly outspent the Biden campaign on the television and radio airwaves—$42.2 million to $14.6 million respectively. —Mike Memoli contributed. Share this - Ben Popken, Kevin Collier and Shamar Walters20h ago / 5:03 PM UTCChicago's voting struggles illustrate the challenges of coronavirusChicago voters were turned away for hours at dozens of polling locations that opened without voting machines, adequate cleaning supplies or enough poll workers — acutely illustrating the strain of voting under the threat of coronavirus exposure and mandates for social distancing and disinfecting surfaces. The delays were driven by a shortage of poll workers and the need to move polling equipment to new locations, Noah Praetz, a former director of elections at Cook County, told NBC News, adding that ""probably 60 percent of necessary poll workers” handled things. After 200 polling locations were changed, about 50 precincts didn’t have enough supplies to open, James P. Allen, a spokesman for the city's elections board, told reporters. Locations struggled to find enough workers and went through a large number of replacement judges, he said. By Monday, the number of resignations from judges had risen to “a torrent, a tsunami of calls,” Chicago Board of Elections Chair Marisel Hernandez said.At the end of the day, turnout was slightly over 30 percent in the city in what were “extremely challenging conditions,“ the city’s elections board reported — a steep drop from over 50 percent turnout in 2016 and only a few percentage points above the city’s record-low presidential primary turnout in 2012.Efforts to push alternate means to in-person voting like early voting and voting by mail appeared successful Tuesday, with nearly 600,000 early votes cast and nearly 300,000 ballots sent by mail across the state, compared to about 423,000 early votes and 162,000 mail-in ballots in the 2016 primary, according to the Illinois State Board of Elections.Share this - 21h ago / 3:36 PM UTCBiden sweeps Sanders in 3 states on one of the strangest primary days in recent historyMarch 18, 202005:08Share this - Alex Seitz-Wald22h ago / 3:19 PM UTCLongtime anti-abortion rights Democrat Rep.

"The mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, last August that left 22 dead was ""the worst carnage wrought by domestic extremists"" last year, according to a report released Wednesday that found an increase in the number of white nationalist groups in the United States for the second straight year.The report by Southern Poverty Law Center reported, which tracks white nationalism, white supremacy and hate groups, identified 155 white nationalist groups in the U.S. last year, up from 148 in 2018 and a 55 percent increase since 2017.Authorities say the gunman in the Aug. 3 attack in El Paso told police that his target was ""Mexicans"" and that he posted a manifesto before the attack that included anti-Latino and anti-immigrant rhetoric.

"Black Americans donated nearly $41 million last year to Democratic presidential candidates, with Bernie Sanders topping the list, according to a new report.The total amount donated was nearly 13 percent of what all candidates collected through an online donor platform handling most donations made to Democrats.The study, conducted by Plus Three, a minority-owned technology and fundraising firm, points to an electorate giving to presidential candidates at a level almost equal to their proportion of the American population and shows that those donations don't necessarily correlate with how those same donors have voted in the primary season.Described as a first of its kind tally of black political contributions, the report shines a light on a party and presidential candidates dependent on black voters, open to their donations but deficient in diversity when it comes to influencing campaign strategy, policy priorities or spending decisions.The disparity in black donations, and in overall fundraising, between Sanders and Biden was highlighted in Sunday night's presidential debate, when Sanders at least twice drew attention to an outside group spending large sums to run attack ads against him and in support of Biden. Biden, in turn, insisted that he, the front-runner for the nomination, really has not raised that much.Plus Three researchers examined more than 1.94 million donations from black donors and found that the average amount given to presidential candidates was $21.03. Latinos contributed almost $23.7 million to Democratic presidential candidates last year, often in small-dollar amounts averaging $15.75, according to an earlier Plus Three analysis.The newreport — commissioned by the Collective PAC, an organization working to boost the number of black officeholders — examined more than 13 million donor records from Actblue, an online donations platform that, in recent election cycles, collected about 95 percent of all donations made to Democratic candidates.

This method is similar to the way that advertisers target customers, campaigns target voters and regulators have attempted to monitor fairness in lending.When it comes to presidential candidate fundraising, Sanders — whose campaign looks to be in trouble after sweeping loses in Tuesday's primaries — has proven to be the most effective of all the Democratic candidates, raising $132.56 million from all donors on ActBlue by the end of 2019.

Proaño, Plus Three CEO and co-founder, who conducted the study, said. ""Biden will begin to do better now that he is the front-runner and his fundraising numbers should increase accordingly. However, Biden still has a major fundraising problem because he does not have the team or the email list needed to capitalize on this sudden success.""In 2019, Sanders raised 14.77 percent of his donations from black donors on ActBlue. Biden collected 13.29 percent of his donations from black donors using the platform.""At the presidential level those not immediately in love with a candidate will take a wait-and-see approach, especially in 2019 when there were 20-plus candidates,"" said Marvin King, an associate professor of political science at Mississippi State University, who researches political donations and their impact.""The same happened really in 2008. The polling with black voters and the donations from black donors shot up for Obama after Iowa,"" King said. ""They were like, we will get on your train but show me something first.""Black candidates often experience fundraising difficulties due to vast differences in the average income between white and black households, King said.Case in point: Mississippi. There, 40 percent of all residents and about 66 percent of all Democratic voters are black. Black candidates have seen some success at the local level but no black elected official has held a statewide office since 1890. In 2019, Republicans controlled the Mississippi House, state Senate and governor's offices, both U.S. Senate seats and all but one of the state's four seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.That is one reason that Quentin James helped found the Collective PAC in 2016. James, the group's president, wanted to find a way to pool resources and elect black, progressive candidates, including those running in red states.""Cory and Kamala said that it was money that was the biggest problem for their campaigns,"" James said. ""We commissioned this study because we wanted to see where is black money going in this cycle and also continue to evaluate how it is being used.""In the 2018 election cycle, the more than 200,000 black donors on Collective PAC's contact list funneled $7.5 million into campaigns and elected 55 candidates across the country.The study's findings call into question the investments that political candidates and parties routinely make in pursuit of black voters, James said. Together, black and Latino donors contributed about $100 million to Democratic candidates up and down the ticket.Studies released by the political organization Power Pac Plus found that in 2012 and 2016, the Democratic Party's three major election arms spent 98 percent of their campaign dollars with white-owned companies.""People of color are giving substantially despite the systematic challenges around wealth and well being in this country,"" James said. ""We are still not seeing or hearing enough from the candidates and their campaigns from a policy perspective or a spending and investing perspective.""Campaigns continue to invest large amounts in television and other ads, which also funnel money into almost all white-owned firms. And they tend to spend comparatively little with the get-out-the-vote operations and other types of political businesses owned by black and Latino consultants with proven expertise, said Proaño, who has worked on four Democratic presidential campaigns.That might have closed the gap in a recent spate of narrow races, he said, . He pointed to several races, including in 2018, when Stacey Abrams, a Democrat, lost the Georgia governor's race by 1.4 points (some, Including Abrams, insist voter suppression was a significant factor); and then-Rep. Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat, lost a Senate race in Texas by 2.6 points.What campaigns continue to do as they fundraise, James said, is think in terms of a short and fairly static list of black billionaires and business owners.""The immediate thing, to this day is, let's call Oprah and Tyler,"" he said, referring to Tyler Perry, the movie mogul, ""not the grassroots person who can give $5 a month.

"LONDON — The already rocky relationship between the United States and China has taken a turbulent turn, with Beijing moving to expel American journalists from the country.After almost two years of on-off trade talks, tariffs, counter-tariffs and several disputes centered around national security concerns in the technology sector, the latest escalation comes as the coronavirus pandemic creates a fresh impasse between the world’s two largest economies.So at a moment when the world faces a threat that does not respect national boundaries or cultural differences, the free passage of crucial data and understanding seems to have become the latest casualty of the pandemic.On Wednesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the decision to force an estimated 13 reporters from The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and The New York Times to leave China within a week or so was a ""proportionate response"" to previous U.S. government action placing limits on Chinese state-controlled news media organizations.""China didn't start it. China is not responsible for it either,"" said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Geng Shuang at a briefing Wednesday.Wuhan doctors advise, warn Western colleagues over COVID-19March 16, 202002:43But The Washington Post’s executive editor, Marty Baron, told NBC News that the decision was “particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis.”Expelling reporters will limit the flow of “clear and reliable information” and “only aggravates the situation,” Baron said shortly after Beijing’s expulsions were announced on Tuesday.His counterpart at The New York Times, Dean Baquet, agreed with that assessment, telling NBC News that the move was “especially irresponsible at a time when the world needs the free and open flow of credible information about the coronavirus pandemic.”Baquet urged both the U.S. and Chinese governments to resolve the dispute, because the health of the global population depends on impartial reporting inside both countries, which are fighting the same virus.Academic observers in Beijing and Washington said this kind of tit-for-tat action has become part of an increasingly common pattern in recent years, as it grows ever more difficult to paper over the gaping structural fault lines in the Sino-American relationship.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakZha Daojiong, a professor of international politics at Peking University, said recent behavior by both sides was ""a manifestation of a deeper problem, rather than just a response to the virus.”The expulsions follow three years in which collaboration between the U.S. and China — including in the field of health and pandemic prevention — has more or less ground to a halt.“All we have left is the political grievance, or diplomacy grievance impulse to score points,” he said. “And that’s very sad.”Senior officials in Beijing, including a top diplomat, recently joined a chorus of Chinese voices that have sought, without evidence, to publicly blame the U.S. for the coronavirus outbreak, which was first recognized in China and has killed thousands of its citizens before expanding on a devastatingly global scale.Chinese Foreign Ministry new spokesman Zhao Lijian gestures as he speaks during a daily briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Beijing.Andy Wong / AP fileLet our news meet your inbox.

State Department spokesman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had strongly objected to Chinese efforts to pass the blame for COVID-19 onto the U.S. during a call with China’s director of the Office of Foreign Affairs, Yang Jiechi.Pompeo had said that now was not the time to spread “disinformation and outlandish rumours” as countries around the world are working together to fight the pandemic, Ortagus saidBut such Chinese claims of a U.S. role in the virus’ spread did not arise in a vacuum, and instead came amid a barrage of public statements from senior White House officials, including President Donald Trump as well as Pompeo, that have emphasized the outbreak’s ostensibly Chinese origins, despite World Health Organization requests to avoid such stigmatizations.Trump, whose administration has been widely criticized for its handling of the epidemic response, has referred to the “Chinese virus” in several tweets, including at least three on Wednesday alone.I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the “borders” from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2020 And Pompeo, who used the phrase “Wuhan coronavirus” several times during the early days of the outbreak, has blamed Chinese obfuscation for a delay in global awareness of the virus.Pompeo softened his tone at a briefing Tuesday, saying “now is not the time for recrimination.”He also called the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s decision to revoke the press credentials of the reporters from The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal “unfortunate.”Beijing’s move was not comparable to measures the Trump administration had taken last month, when several Chinese news agencies were officially designated as foreign missions, he added.It was not “apples for apples,” Pompeo said, because the Chinese personnel in question “were not media that were acting here freely.”Instead, he said, they were “part of Chinese propaganda outlets.”Solution ‘not in sight’“Fundamentally the big problem on both sides is that you now have leadership which no longer considers having good bilateral relationships as a highest priority,” said Victor Shih, a professor of politics at the University of California, San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy.He said the lack of willingness to improve those ties has been behind more intensive U.S. investigations into alleged Chinese espionage, sanctions on the Chinese technology giant Huawei and the extensive trade tariffs.“Previous administrations should have pursued these issues,” he said. “But didn’t because of a strong desire to maintain cooperation.”After the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s, Chinese and American health experts worked together closely, sharing data, public surveillance and laboratory results, while publishing joint papers on vaccines, monitoring techniques and best practices.“China’s own capacity increased by a huge margin,” Peking University’s Zha said. “It benefitted from the collaboration with the Americans.”However, during the recent outbreak in Hubei province and the city of Wuhan, the World Health Organization was not granted immediate access to the region, and scholars point out that U.S. health authorities also faced similar obstructions.“Our CDC doesn’t get much cooperation from China,” says David Lampton, a research scholar and fellow at the Asia Pacific Research Center at Stanford University. “Partly because China is worried that we will use that information to embarrass them.”Watch China’s state TV report on President Xi visiting Wuhan – the coronavirus epicenterMarch 10, 202000:44Potentially embarrassing information could include the fact that the Chinese doctors who were among the first to raise the alarm about the new coronavirus were silenced, and in some cases punished, after speaking out.Lampton said both countries should look to rebuild trust in areas like health care, where cooperation has previously proven fruitful, though he acknowledges this will be challenging in the current circumstances.“We’ve moved from a relationship in which we’re trying to reassure each other, to one in which we’re trying to deter each other,” he added.Chinese academics share this pessimism about the deterioration in relations, but diverge on the causes of it.Professor Shi Yinhong, who heads up the Center of American Studies at Beijing’s Renmin University of China and acts as an advisor to the Chinese cabinet — known as the State Council — puts it down to geopolitical rivalry, ideological antagonism and domestic political requirements on both sides.“Possible solution is not in sight,” he told NBC News in an email.Victor Gao, who earned two postgraduate degrees at Yale and was the official interpreter for Deng Xiaoping, the first Chinese leader to visit the United States, assigns the blame exclusively to the Trump administration.“U.S. threats of ‘disengagement’ from China and its constant labeling of China as an adversary or an enemy have eroded the fundamental goodwill for normal relations between China and the United States,” said Gao, now a vice president at the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank.",As pandemic worsens so do U.S.-China relations,Mar 18 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/coronavirus-pandemic-worsens-so-do-u-s-china-relations-n1162856,nbc

NBC’s Gary Grumbach covers Sanders’ comments last night, which didn’t mention the contests at all: “Not once during Sanders’ remarks tonight did Sanders mention today’s primaries, or anything to do with voting today.” Rather, he noted emergency-related health care cost coverage and Universal Basic Income strategies he would support for Americans during the pandemic. “Under the proposal that I am working on, everyone who loses a job must qualify for unemployment compensation and 100 percent of their prior salary, with a cap of $75,000 a year,” Sanders said. “In addition, those who depend on tips — waiters and waitresses and others, gig workers, domestic workers, freelancers and independent contractors — must also qualify for unemployment insurance to make up for the income that they lose during this crisis.”Biden, meanwhile, spent his primary night speech (which under normal circumstances would be a celebratory night) focusing on his message of steady leadership during a crisis and reaching out to Sanders’ supporters, NBC’s Marianna Sotomayor reports: “Biden said that while he and Sanders ‘disagree on tactics,’ they ‘share a common vision’ on issues like health care, income inequality and climate change. ‘Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. Together they've shifted the fundamental conversation in this country,’ Biden said. He then directly addressed the young people Sanders has inspired, telling them, ‘I hear you. I know what's at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign and my goal is a candidate for president is to unify this party.’”Talking policy with BenjyWith primary voting postponed in some states over coronavirus fears, speculation is turning towards what happens if there’s still health concerns in November, NBC’s Benjy Sarlin writes. Could an election be postponed? Can states switch to vote by mail? Are there other moves they might take?First off: No, the president of the United States cannot unilaterally postpone or call off a general election date. Congress sets the date, meaning any agreement to postpone an election would need bipartisan support in both chambers.But there are possible ways states and even Congress could prevent lines and crowds that health officials are now warning are a threat to spread the virus.The most obvious option is likely vote-by-mail. Four states — Colorado, Washington, Hawaii, and Oregon — already conduct elections entirely by mail. Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have no-excuse absentee ballots, which allow voters to request and send a vote. Already in the last few days, officials in some primary states like Arizona and Illinois — which have no-excuse absentee ballots — were urging voters to make use of them if possible ahead to prevent crowds on Primary Day.In theory, Congress could require all states to prepare for a large scale vote by mail and provide them funding to do so.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. introduced legislation this week that would trigger a vote-by-mail requirement in all states if at least 25 percent of them declared a state of emergency over COVID-19. It would then provide $500 million to help them stand up their new voting systems.The Lid: You gotta have faithDon’t miss the pod from yesterday, when we took a look at how declining faith in institutions is affecting the response to the coronavirus.ICYMI: News clips you shouldn’t missOne vote on coronavirus relief has been delayed by Sen.

"WASHINGTON — Trump administration officials warned Senate Republicans on Tuesday that the coronavirus outbreak in the United States could cause the unemployment rate to reach 20 percent, according to two sources familiar with the discussion.The warning came during a closed-door lunch on Capitol Hill in which Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin presented a White House stimulus plan that could cost at least $1 trillion. The prediction was first reported by Bloomberg News.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics, however, said that it was difficult to measure unemployment because there was little statistical data on the extent or the nature of joblessness across the country.Earlier this week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a stark warning.""We have the historical playbook, and this, if you want to know what this whole thing is going to play out as, one part the Great Recession we went through a few years ago, one part the Great Depression, one part the 1918 flu epidemic,"" he said in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" saying those are three models to use in considering how to manage the outbreak.The U.S. coronavirus outbreak that has intensified in recent days has prompted companies to lay off workers as health officials at the federal, state and local levels tell people to practice social distancing — not congregate in large groups and to work from home if possible — in order to help flatten the curve of its spread.Mnuchin said at the White House coronavirus task force briefing and at the Capitol on Tuesday that the administration is interested in giving a major boost to the economy with Congress’ help with a massive stimulus package.

"WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump imposes sweeping entry restrictions in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus — and considers still more — he's relying on an agency to help implement them that has been hollowed out at the top ranks in a revolving door of leadership, potentially hampering his administration's response to the crisis.It has been nearly a year since the Department of Homeland Security has had a Senate-confirmed leader. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, the fourth person to lead the agency in three years, has been on the job less than six months.In addition, 65 percent of top jobs in the department are vacant or filled by acting appointees, more than in any other federal agency, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group that advocates for more effective government. Among the vacancies are the No. 2 official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the department's top lawyer and the head of the country's immigration system.That has led to a cascade of other unfilled jobs, a vacuum of leadership causing major decisions to be deferred and a drop in morale at the agency that was born out of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to coordinate the government's response to threats, said people close to DHS. After a chaotic rollout over the weekend of restrictions on many travelers from Europe — where those returning to the U.S. were held for hours in cramped conditions — there are new concerns that the agency isn't prepared to manage what's to come.""You have the vacancies, the musical chairs with positions throughout the organization and policies that come down without a lot of forethought putting added stress on a workforce that already has an extremely crucial job to protect the homeland,"" said David Lapan, who was a spokesman for DHS during Trump's first year in office. ""So at what point do we break them?""To Lapan, the chaotic scenes at airports over the weekend were a reminder of what happened when, in the early days of his presidency, Trump abruptly announced travel restrictions on passengers coming from predominately Muslim countries without giving DHS time to prepare.""You are asking the folks on the front lines to implement a policy that they have not yet been fully informed on or trained on, so of course you are going to have confusion,"" Lapan said. ""You have these issues because, again, it seems like it was implemented too quickly to allow the workforce to be able to properly implement it.""Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakLet our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceDHS' leadership has been in flux since a purge last April, encouraged by Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller, that included Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who was forced out in part because she pushed back against Trump's policy to separate children from their families at the Mexico border.She was replaced by Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, who was put in as acting secretary but was never formally nominated for the position. McAleenan left in October and was replaced the following month by Wolf, who was Nielsen's chief of staff and had been confirmed by the Senate for a different job at DHS. Like McAleenan, Wolf hasn't been nominated to fill the job on a permanent basis.Also in doubt is who at DHS is overseeing the nation's immigration system as restrictions are placed on who can come into the country amid the spread of the coronavirus. A federal district court ruled this month that Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli, a member of Trump's coronavirus task force, was unlawfully appointed to the job under the federal vacancies act. Cuccinelli, who hasn't been confirmed by the Senate for any job, is now referred to on the DHS website as a senior official performing the duties of the director.While many of the jobs are filled by temporary appointees to carry out the day-to-day tasks, some — such as the role of deputy director of FEMA — have no one in the job and are listed as vacant. In other cases, officials are performing two jobs at once, as in the DHS Office of Strategy, Policy and Plans, where the jobs of undersecretary and deputy under secretary are being filled by the same person.""It is like the substitute teacher,"" said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service. ""We have all had them, they might be wonderful educators, but they get no respect from the classroom, and they themselves don't see their job as taking on the long-term problems or the tough ones. That is why people should be concerned about not having long-term leadership.""A spokesperson for DHS called the suggestion that the vacancies have affected the department's response ""absolutely absurd"": ""DHS's leaders have been at the forefront in helping contain the COVID-19 crisis. Thanks to President Trump's leadership, DHS has been able to respond wherever and whenever needed. We look forward to the Senate confirming our appointees.""There are no nominees from the White House for the jobs of homeland security secretary, deputy secretary, general counsel, under secretary for management, deputy administrator for FEMA, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection or director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, according to data compiled by the Partnership for Public Service.That turnover at the top likely has had a trickle-down effect on staffing throughout the department, with top officials having their own entourages of aides who come and go with them, Stier said. In addition, when an official is in a temporary or acting role, it can make it more difficult to fill open positions, because those applying don't know whether the person hiring them will ultimately be their boss.Download the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreakAdding to the strain is the heavy focus over the last three years on immigration at the southern border, taking attention from other areas the agency is responsible for, like preventing terrorists from entering the country at other points of entry, cyberterrorism and disaster response, Lapan said.Now, as the focus shifts to responding to the coronavirus, an agency already stretched thin is just three months away from the start of hurricane season in the Atlantic, he said.While Homeland Security has more key vacancies than any other government agency, it's not the only department involved in the coronavirus response to have suffered staffing issues under the Trump administration. At Health and Human Services, 28 percent of key posts aren't filled, according to the Partnership for Public Service. At the Defense Department, 34 percent are vacant.Trump downsized the White House national security staff to eliminate jobs addressing global pandemics and fired Tom Bossert, whose job as homeland security adviser on the National Security Council included coordinating the responses to those crises. Bossert wasn't replaced.Last year, Rear Adm. Tim Ziemer, the NSC's senior director for global health security and biodefense, left the council and wasn't replaced. Neither was Dr. Luciana Borio, the NSC's director for medical and biodefense preparedness, who left in May 2018.""You can't respond well to a pandemic without preparation,"" Stier said. ""You really actually have to do a lot of work ahead of time.""",DHS faces coronavirus with scores of vacancies and a leadership vacuum,Mar 18 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/dhs-faces-coronavirus-scores-vacancies-leadership-vacuum-n1160946,nbc

"WASHINGTON — As the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. worsens, Congress and the White House are eyeing a third stimulus package to address the economic effects of the pandemic.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin prepared an aid package that he told reporters could amount to at least $1 trillion and presented it Tuesday to Senate Republicans during their weekly closed-door lunch on Capitol Hill.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., spoke to reporters after the lunch and wasn't ready to identify the cost of the third bill yet.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump. They also rolled out new Spanish-language ads in Florida, Arizona and Illinois discussing Biden’s records on guns, healthcare and the need for leadership to prevent future global panic like the one caused by coronavirus.Unite the Country, the Super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy, will also not be on the airwaves or on digital in the coming weeks as they focus on expanding their group with sights set on the general election, Steve Schale, a top strategist for the group, told NBC News. After projected losses in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries on Tuesday night, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that Sanders ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign"" but that ""In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""Through March 10, before the campaign was completely upended by coronavirus, the Sanders campaign had significantly outspent the Biden campaign on the television and radio airwaves—$42.2 million to $14.6 million respectively. —Mike Memoli contributed. Share this -Ben Popken, Kevin Collier and Shamar Walters21h ago / 5:03 PM UTCChicago's voting struggles illustrate the challenges of coronavirusChicago voters were turned away for hours at dozens of polling locations that opened without voting machines, adequate cleaning supplies or enough poll workers — acutely illustrating the strain of voting under the threat of coronavirus exposure and mandates for social distancing and disinfecting surfaces. The delays were driven by a shortage of poll workers and the need to move polling equipment to new locations, Noah Praetz, a former director of elections at Cook County, told NBC News, adding that ""probably 60 percent of necessary poll workers” handled things. After 200 polling locations were changed, about 50 precincts didn’t have enough supplies to open, James P. Allen, a spokesman for the city's elections board, told reporters. Locations struggled to find enough workers and went through a large number of replacement judges, he said. By Monday, the number of resignations from judges had risen to “a torrent, a tsunami of calls,” Chicago Board of Elections Chair Marisel Hernandez said.At the end of the day, turnout was slightly over 30 percent in the city in what were “extremely challenging conditions,“ the city’s elections board reported — a steep drop from over 50 percent turnout in 2016 and only a few percentage points above the city’s record-low presidential primary turnout in 2012.Efforts to push alternate means to in-person voting like early voting and voting by mail appeared successful Tuesday, with nearly 600,000 early votes cast and nearly 300,000 ballots sent by mail across the state, compared to about 423,000 early votes and 162,000 mail-in ballots in the 2016 primary, according to the Illinois State Board of Elections.Share this -22h ago / 3:36 PM UTCBiden sweeps Sanders in 3 states on one of the strangest primary days in recent historyMarch 18, 202005:08Share this -Alex Seitz-Wald23h ago / 3:19 PM UTCLongtime anti-abortion rights Democrat Rep.

One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump. They also rolled out new Spanish-language ads in Florida, Arizona and Illinois discussing Biden’s records on guns, healthcare and the need for leadership to prevent future global panic like the one caused by coronavirus.Unite the Country, the Super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy, will also not be on the airwaves or on digital in the coming weeks as they focus on expanding their group with sights set on the general election, Steve Schale, a top strategist for the group, told NBC News. After projected losses in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries on Tuesday night, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that Sanders ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign"" but that ""In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""Through March 10, before the campaign was completely upended by coronavirus, the Sanders campaign had significantly outspent the Biden campaign on the television and radio airwaves—$42.2 million to $14.6 million respectively. —Mike Memoli contributed. Share this - Ben Popken, Kevin Collier and Shamar Walters21h ago / 5:03 PM UTCChicago's voting struggles illustrate the challenges of coronavirusChicago voters were turned away for hours at dozens of polling locations that opened without voting machines, adequate cleaning supplies or enough poll workers — acutely illustrating the strain of voting under the threat of coronavirus exposure and mandates for social distancing and disinfecting surfaces. The delays were driven by a shortage of poll workers and the need to move polling equipment to new locations, Noah Praetz, a former director of elections at Cook County, told NBC News, adding that ""probably 60 percent of necessary poll workers” handled things. After 200 polling locations were changed, about 50 precincts didn’t have enough supplies to open, James P. Allen, a spokesman for the city's elections board, told reporters. Locations struggled to find enough workers and went through a large number of replacement judges, he said. By Monday, the number of resignations from judges had risen to “a torrent, a tsunami of calls,” Chicago Board of Elections Chair Marisel Hernandez said.At the end of the day, turnout was slightly over 30 percent in the city in what were “extremely challenging conditions,“ the city’s elections board reported — a steep drop from over 50 percent turnout in 2016 and only a few percentage points above the city’s record-low presidential primary turnout in 2012.Efforts to push alternate means to in-person voting like early voting and voting by mail appeared successful Tuesday, with nearly 600,000 early votes cast and nearly 300,000 ballots sent by mail across the state, compared to about 423,000 early votes and 162,000 mail-in ballots in the 2016 primary, according to the Illinois State Board of Elections.Share this - 22h ago / 3:36 PM UTCBiden sweeps Sanders in 3 states on one of the strangest primary days in recent historyMarch 18, 202005:08Share this - Alex Seitz-Wald23h ago / 3:19 PM UTCLongtime anti-abortion rights Democrat Rep.

"Asked by reporters Tuesday if he would be shutting the land borders to the U.S. because of coronavirus, President Donald Trump said he did not want to shut them, but was ""discussing"" the issue with Mexico and Canada.A senior administration official told NBC News the administration has already explored the possibility of new restrictions on the southern U.S. border, because of fears that once the virus hits Central American countries like Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, citizens of those countries will begin to travel to the U.S. border in large numbers to try to access the U.S. healthcare system.One option under consideration, said the official, is invoking 42 USC 265, a portion of the federal legal code that says the U.S. surgeon general “shall have the power to prohibit, in whole or in part, the introduction of persons and property from such countries or places as he shall designate in order to avert such danger, and for such period of time as he may deem necessary for such purpose.”The restrictions would apply to both the northern and southern borders, said the senior official, and the statute has never been used before.The policy under discussion would empower Border Patrol officers to apprehend migrants between ports of entry and return them to Mexico without processing, according to an administration official. The goal is to minimize the health risks to Border Patrol officers, as well as other immigrants that are being held in detention centers.The Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceA decision on the new policy is expected within the next 48 hours, said the official. The official stressed the proposal would not affect legal commercial trade and would not apply to anyone with a work permit.If families with coronavirus were to come across the border, a former senior DHS official who did not want to be named said the current facilities are not designed to accommodate them. “Border Patrol stations are super confined spaces and are designed for adult males,” said the former official.Cruise ship at center of coronavirus scare sparks anger after docking at Mexican resortFeb. 27, 202001:00NBC News has previously reported on poor health-care conditions for immigrants in Border Patrol facilities along the southern border. In 2019, multiple children in detention died from flu-like symptoms.Currently, U.S. Border Patrol agents or CBP officers who encounter immigrants exhibiting flu-like symptoms are directed to refer the immigrants to “the CDC or local health officials for enhanced health screening,” according to a CBP spokesperson.“Additionally,"" said the spokesperson, ""all persons in U.S. Border Patrol custody who meet the CDC’s COVID-19 travel history and enhanced screening guidelines are being referred to CDC for additional screening.”A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security referred all questions about the possibility of shutting down the border to the White House.The former senior DHS official told NBC News that another option might be to shut down all pedestrian and car traffic across the southern border, but leave the border open to cargo.A remaining question would be how a border closure would impact the “Remain in Mexico” policy that requires Mexican cooperation to allow those who are seeking asylum into the United States to wait in Mexico until the date of their asylum proceedings. That policy has been repeatedly challenged in federal court.Six days ago the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to continue the policy while the court decides whether or not to hear an appeal of a lower court ruling that declared the program illegal.The latest updates from Mexico’s health minister show the country has 82 confirmed cases of coronavirus and no fatalities.","Trump admin has discussed partially shutting southern U.S. border, says official",Mar 17 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-administration-has-discussed-shutting-southern-u-s-border-says-n1162106,nbc

"It's abundantly clear that governors and mayors, not the federal government, have the broadest quarantine and isolation authority. That's because the constitution leaves that kind of police power in the hands of the states.Longstanding federal laws, and rules put in place at the end of the Obama administration, give the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention authority to quarantine people to stop disease outbreaks. The beefed-up rules were imposed after the experience of the outbreaks of Ebola and MERS six years ago.Broadly speaking, the CDC has the power to detain people suspected of having a communicable disease, without getting approval from state and local officials.

It's not at all certain how that would apply to large groups of people. Under the law, there is no explicit statutory authority for a blanket federal interstate quarantine, only for the isolation of individual people deemed infected.Hard choices, careful strategy necessary to save lives, preserve economyMarch 18, 202007:34Professor Michael Ulrich, an expert on public health law at Boston University, says any effort to apply that authority on a large scale would lead to claims that the government was exceeding its power. ""You have to be able to justify that some group is a credible threat to others, and that's an easier thing to do on an individual level."" He knows of no federal effort to do so for a large group.If someone in the group sued, the government would have to demonstrate why people in an entire region were a threat to carry the disease across state lines. ""That's a really hard thing to prove,"" Ulrich says. Even so, he said, a federal court might be reluctant to second-guess public health authorities and would instead defer to such an order in the face of a national crisis.During the Ebola crisis, a nurse who returned to the U.S. after treating Ebola victims in West Africa successfully challenged a quarantine in court, arguing it was not medically and scientifically necessary.

"WASHINGTON — Congressional Democrats and former intelligence officials have expressed skepticism about the Justice Department's decision to drop a criminal prosecution of Russian companies accused of interfering with the 2016 U.S. election, while a lawyer for the defendants says the case never should have been brought.Citing ""a risk of exposure of law enforcement's tools and techniques,"" the Justice Department on Monday moved to dismiss the prosecution — on the eve of trial — of two Russian firms linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a St. Petersburg businessman known as ""Putin's chef."" The case by former special counsel Robert Mueller accused the firms of sponsoring a vast campaign of social manipulation designed to sow chaos and boost then-Republican candidate Donald Trump.The indictment, based in part on declassified intelligence information, detailed the activities of an internet troll farm called the Internet Research Agency, where Russians sitting in a St. Petersburg office building impersonated Americans on social media.The charges against 13 individual Russians named in the indictment will stand, Justice Department officials said, although none of them are in custody.NYT Report: Russia is interfering in the 2020 election, Putin still favors TrumpFeb. 20, 202001:49Federal prosecutors said the decision to drop the case was based in part on an undisclosed ""change in the balance of the government's proof due to a classification determination,"" according to a nine-page filing bolstered by more documents that are sealed and therefore hidden from the public.Eric Dubelier, the former federal prosecutor who represented defendant Concord Management, alleged that the government dropped the prosecution simply because it feared it would lose the case.""The idea that it had to protect classified information simply isn't convincing,"" he told NBC News. ""The government told the judge at the outset of this case that it could be prosecuted with no classified evidence whatsoever. I think the prosecutors were simply convinced at the time they filed this case that no one would show up to defend it.""Marc Raimondi, a spokesman for the Justice Department's National Security Division, said Concord Management ""was making a mockery of our legal system and had no intention of providing the materials the court asked for. They have sought to weaponize the discovery process.""DOJ attorneys involved in the case, he said, reached the decision by evaluating ""the risk versus the reward. Who are you going to hold accountable? They have nobody except an outside attorney. So what are you getting in return for all of this information that we're providing that details how we conduct investigations into foreign interference?""Raimondi also noted that the entire case was not dismissed.

""DOJ does this all the time with CIA info. There's a process for this. Something smells...""""This is highly irregular,"" said Barbara McQuade, a former federal prosecutor. ""These decisions are made before indictment.""The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, California's Adam Schiff, said the DOJ’s decision to drop the case “is impossible to evaluate without examining what the DOJ would be forced to disclose in discovery. … If important sources and methods are truly implicated, that would be the right decision.“At the same time, the President’s Twitter-gloating over the dismissal and Attorney General Barr’s sublimation of the Department to Trump’s narrow political interests raises the usual questions of what is really motivating this change of course.”In their filing, prosecutors accused Concord of using the legal process to expose, for the benefit of the Russian government, how the United States combats foreign election interference. Meanwhile, they said, Concord failed to comply with subpoenas and Prigozhin himself refused to show up in court.""There is a substantial federal interest in defending American democratic institutions, exposing those who endeavor to criminally interfere with them, and holding them accountable, which is why this prosecution was properly commenced in the first place,"" prosecutors wrote. ""In light of the defendant's conduct, however, its ephemeral presence and immunity to just punishment, the risk of exposure of law enforcement's tools and techniques, and the post-indictment change in the proof available at trial, the balance of equities has shifted. It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country's national security to continue this prosecution.""Dubelier, the lawyer for the Russian defendants, said, ""No matter what the government says in its court filing, the fact is they lost and we won. This case was nothing more than a political statement from the beginning.""Dubelier said the Mueller team ""grossly overstated"" the amount of money that was spent by the Russian entity and the number of social media influence ads that were actually purchased.The total amount of the ads in U.S. dollars that would have to be reported under federal rules, he said, was no more than $2500.""The prosecution lacked evidence to prove that the defendants knew what they were doing violated complex U.S. election laws,"" he said. The ads were purchased using a Russian name, a Russian Internet address, and paid for in rubles.""Facebook knew all of that and did nothing about it,"" he said. Facebook has since banned the purchase of political ads by foreigners targeting an American audience.Dubelier rejected the notion that the Russians carried out an unusually aggressive social media campaign to influence the U.S. election. ""It was nothing different than what the United States has done in every foreign election since World War II,"" he said.The U.S. intelligence community, Congressional intelligence committees and many private researchers disagree. A Senate report on Russian election interference devotes more than 45 pages to the activities of the Internet Research Agency, documenting a significant impact on the 2016 presidential election.Facebook itself said Russian propaganda, much of it from the IRA, reached as many as 126 million people.

Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2. He directed the state elections board to come up with a plan to conduct a June primary ""in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process."" But Hogan added that while the election board told him it couldn't shift the entire state to vote-by-mail in time for the April primary to go on as scheduled, he felt it was ""imperative that the people of the seventh congressional district have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress."" That's why he decided to keep that district's primary on schedule. Maryland's 7th Congressional District has been vacant since Cummings died on Oct. 17, 2019. The state held a special primary for the seat on Feb. 5, with former Democrat Rep. Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik, a member of the Baltimore County Republican Central Committee, moving onto the special general election. Share this -Pete Williams, Dan Gallo and Mike Memoli2d ago / 1:45 PM UTCBiden under Secret Service protection againWILMINGTON, Del. — After a nearly three year hiatus, Joe Biden is once again a protectee of the United States Secret Service.A protective detail began its assignment with the former vice president and Democratic front-runner this week, multiple law enforcement officials told NBC News, even as Biden is expected to remain off the campaign trail amid the coronavirus crisis. The Biden campaign's formal request for Secret Service protection was submitted last week to senior congressional officials, who by law consult with the secretary of Homeland Security to consider if candidates should receive security from the elite law enforcement agency.Anti-dairy industry protestors are pulled from the stage as Democratic U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at his Super Tuesday night rally in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 3, 2020.Kyle Grillot / ReutersSince kicking off his campaign last April, Biden has had minimal security on the campaign trail — one private security guard often supplemented by local law enforcement from jurisdictions where he campaigned. The lighter security footprint allowed Biden to engage in the type of one-on-one, retail-oriented campaigning he preferred, especially in the early-voting states where voters place a premium on it.Campaign officials have long been concerned about his safety given his high profile as a former vice president and the highly partisan environment. A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course.

Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders. In recent weeks Biden has earned 11 endorsements from former 2020 Democratic candidates, but Warren has notably sat out on backing the two final contenders in the primary race.While Biden said supporting Warren’s plan is one area for finding common ground with the Vermont senator, Sanders has often attacked Biden for his support for the 2005 bankruptcy bill. He often brought it up as a consequential stain in Biden’s Senate record alongside his support of the Iraq War and trade deals.“The fact of the matter is I'm not beholding to the banks. I supported the bankruptcy bill because I believed taking a very bad bill was going to pass overwhelmingly and make it better made sense,” Biden said in a July 2019 speech where he defended controversial parts of his record that had come under attack by his opponents.The Biden campaign told NBC News that Biden, who recently reviewed Warren’s plan, will likely speak more about why he supports her proposals at Sunday’s Democratic debate.Share this -Marianna Sotomayor5d ago / 4:22 PM UTCBiden's first virtual event encounters technological glitchesWASHINGTON — The virtual campaign is proving a bit complicated, after a Friday event for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign encountered some technological glitches. Biden is the first Democratic candidate to hold a virtual town hall due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 and public events. The attempt to broadcast the first of two scheduled “virtual events” in the next several days involved a garbled-voiced Biden and ended roughly four minutes after the Facebook Live video began streaming in Illinois.The former vice president acknowledged the issues while ending the livestream.“Well, I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections, but there is a lot more to say and I’ve probably already said too much,” Biden said. But the appetite for these events appears to be there — the short event garnered more than 5,000 viewers. On Saturday morning, the campaign released a link to a full, updated video without the technical glitches.Much of the event focused on Biden explaining how he'd work to respond and recover the country from pandemics. He also tried to downplay the need for panic and outlined ways in which everyone can take precautions to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while still connecting to people.“Campaign events are no exception that’s why we’re connecting virtually today.

Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden speak before a Democratic presidential primary debate in Charleston, S.C., on Feb. 25, 2020.Matt Rourke / AP fileThe gap in their support has continued to widen as the former vice president racks up primary victories. Following Biden's near-30 percentage point margin win in South Carolina on Feb. 29, most of his former primary opponents have endorsed him.In the last week and a half alone, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, and Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kamala Harris of California, and Cory Booker of New Jersey have all rallied for Biden. Mike Bloomberg and John Delaney have also put their support behind him.Other influential politicians who have jumped on board include Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton ally who previously served as Chair of the Democratic National Committee and the governor of Virginia. The only former competitor backing Sanders after his definitive victory in the Nevada caucuses is author Marianne Williamson. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., dropped out of the race last week but she has yet to endorse Biden or Sanders.Those backing Biden and Sanders also vary drastically in their ideologies and policy positions.Since the South Carolina primary, Democratic Reps. Abigail Spanberger, Elissa Slotkin, and Andy Kim — moderates who all flipped their seats from red to blue in the 2018 midterms — have endorsed Biden. Kim is one of several House members who previously endorsed Buttigieg and then transferred his support to Biden after the former South Bend mayor suspended his campaign.While just one member of Congress — Rep. Mark Takano of California — has decided to throw his support behind Sanders since his strong performance in Nevada lifted him into temporary front-runner status, those who backed the Independent Vermont senator prior to the caucuses come from the bluest of districts. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for example, are ardent Sanders campaigners.From the start of his candidacy, Sanders has failed to win over any governors. Five governors in contrast, have issued formal endorsements for Biden, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer whose state is voting today. Share this -Load More Posts Ben Kamisar and Kyle Stewart2d ago / 4:53 PM UTCWhile Maryland delays primary, special election to replace Cummings will stay as mail-in onlyWASHINGTON — As Maryland delays most primary elections from late April to early June in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the state will not push back the special election aimed at replacing the late Rep. Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2. He directed the state elections board to come up with a plan to conduct a June primary ""in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process."" But Hogan added that while the election board told him it couldn't shift the entire state to vote-by-mail in time for the April primary to go on as scheduled, he felt it was ""imperative that the people of the seventh congressional district have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress."" That's why he decided to keep that district's primary on schedule. Maryland's 7th Congressional District has been vacant since Cummings died on Oct. 17, 2019. The state held a special primary for the seat on Feb. 5, with former Democrat Rep. Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik, a member of the Baltimore County Republican Central Committee, moving onto the special general election. Share this - Pete Williams, Dan Gallo and Mike Memoli2d ago / 1:45 PM UTCBiden under Secret Service protection againWILMINGTON, Del. — After a nearly three year hiatus, Joe Biden is once again a protectee of the United States Secret Service.A protective detail began its assignment with the former vice president and Democratic front-runner this week, multiple law enforcement officials told NBC News, even as Biden is expected to remain off the campaign trail amid the coronavirus crisis. The Biden campaign's formal request for Secret Service protection was submitted last week to senior congressional officials, who by law consult with the secretary of Homeland Security to consider if candidates should receive security from the elite law enforcement agency.Anti-dairy industry protestors are pulled from the stage as Democratic U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at his Super Tuesday night rally in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 3, 2020.Kyle Grillot / ReutersSince kicking off his campaign last April, Biden has had minimal security on the campaign trail — one private security guard often supplemented by local law enforcement from jurisdictions where he campaigned. The lighter security footprint allowed Biden to engage in the type of one-on-one, retail-oriented campaigning he preferred, especially in the early-voting states where voters place a premium on it.Campaign officials have long been concerned about his safety given his high profile as a former vice president and the highly partisan environment. A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course. He first became a protectee of the agency in August 2008 when Barack Obama chose him as his vice presidential running mate.

The lighter security footprint allowed Biden to engage in the type of one-on-one, retail-oriented campaigning he preferred, especially in the early-voting states where voters place a premium on it.Campaign officials have long been concerned about his safety given his high profile as a former vice president and the highly partisan environment. A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course. He first became a protectee of the agency in August 2008 when Barack Obama chose him as his vice presidential running mate. He and his family had a security detail throughout his eight years as vice president, and Biden for several additional months after he left office in 2017. Share this -Ben Kamisar3d ago / 3:08 PM UTCIllinois governor backs Biden for presidentWASHINGTON — Illinois Democratic Gov.

Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders. In recent weeks Biden has earned 11 endorsements from former 2020 Democratic candidates, but Warren has notably sat out on backing the two final contenders in the primary race.While Biden said supporting Warren’s plan is one area for finding common ground with the Vermont senator, Sanders has often attacked Biden for his support for the 2005 bankruptcy bill. He often brought it up as a consequential stain in Biden’s Senate record alongside his support of the Iraq War and trade deals.“The fact of the matter is I'm not beholding to the banks. I supported the bankruptcy bill because I believed taking a very bad bill was going to pass overwhelmingly and make it better made sense,” Biden said in a July 2019 speech where he defended controversial parts of his record that had come under attack by his opponents.The Biden campaign told NBC News that Biden, who recently reviewed Warren’s plan, will likely speak more about why he supports her proposals at Sunday’s Democratic debate.Share this -Marianna Sotomayor5d ago / 4:22 PM UTCBiden's first virtual event encounters technological glitchesWASHINGTON — The virtual campaign is proving a bit complicated, after a Friday event for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign encountered some technological glitches. Biden is the first Democratic candidate to hold a virtual town hall due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 and public events. The attempt to broadcast the first of two scheduled “virtual events” in the next several days involved a garbled-voiced Biden and ended roughly four minutes after the Facebook Live video began streaming in Illinois.The former vice president acknowledged the issues while ending the livestream.“Well, I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections, but there is a lot more to say and I’ve probably already said too much,” Biden said. But the appetite for these events appears to be there — the short event garnered more than 5,000 viewers. On Saturday morning, the campaign released a link to a full, updated video without the technical glitches.Much of the event focused on Biden explaining how he'd work to respond and recover the country from pandemics. He also tried to downplay the need for panic and outlined ways in which everyone can take precautions to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while still connecting to people.“Campaign events are no exception that’s why we’re connecting virtually today.

Gabby Giffords, a high profile figure in the state and a leading voice on gun control. Joe Biden, right, hugs former Rep. Gabby Giffords during a gun safety forum on Oct. 2, 2019, in Las Vegas.John Locher / AP fileGiffords, who represented a Tucson-area district from 2005-2012, became a nationally recognized gun control activist after she was shot and critically wounded in a mass shooting in Arizona in 2011.  Her endorsement comes ahead of next week's Arizona primary between Biden and Bernie Sanders, whose strength among Latino voters could prove significant in the state. Sanders won 53 percent of Latino voters in Nevada’s caucuses on February 22 and 41 percent in Texas on Super Tuesday. Arizona votes on March 17, along with Florida, Illinois and Ohio.“Joe Biden leads with his heart. He has the compassion and toughness to lead on gun safety. I’ve witnessed him comfort the survivors of gun violence, and I’ve seen him fight for solutions to gun violence — and win. This is the leadership we need in the White House. Joe Biden is the choice for a true gun safety president,” Giffords said in a statement provided to NBC News.""Congresswoman Gabby Giffords is an American hero who embodies the courage and tenacity we need to take on and defeat the gun lobby,"" Biden said in a statement to NBC News. ""I have been proud to work alongside Gabby in the fight to end gun violence and am honored to have her support today.""The endorsement could undergird Biden’s momentum coming off his strong showings in the March 10 primaries.  Giffords’ husband, Mark Kelly, is expected to be the Democratic challenger to Arizona Republican Sen. Martha McSally in one of the highest-profile Senate contests this year.Sanders has come under criticism from Biden and gun control activists for some of his past votes on gun measures, particularly a law that shields gun manufacturers from liability.  As a presidential candidate, Sanders has emphasized his support for universal background checks and his D- minus rating from the NRA.  Giffords and Biden have worked together in the past on gun safety measures, including in the aftermath of the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut where 20 first graders and six educators were killed. Two years later, they sat together off the Senate floor watching as a bill Giffords had fought for to expand background checks failed by five votes.Share this - Liz Brown-Kaiser9d ago / 6:41 PM UTCBiden leads Sanders by dozens of endorsements after big winsWASHINGTON — Since his big win in the South Carolina primary less than two weeks ago, Joe Biden has earned more than 50 endorsements from Democratic governors and members of Congress.That’s compared with just one endorsement for Bernie Sanders since the Vermont senator’s win in the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 22.Overall, Biden has a total of more than 100 endorsements from major Democratic politicians, while Sanders has about ten.Sen. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden speak before a Democratic presidential primary debate in Charleston, S.C., on Feb. 25, 2020.Matt Rourke / AP fileThe gap in their support has continued to widen as the former vice president racks up primary victories. Following Biden's near-30 percentage point margin win in South Carolina on Feb. 29, most of his former primary opponents have endorsed him.In the last week and a half alone, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, and Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kamala Harris of California, and Cory Booker of New Jersey have all rallied for Biden. Mike Bloomberg and John Delaney have also put their support behind him.Other influential politicians who have jumped on board include Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton ally who previously served as Chair of the Democratic National Committee and the governor of Virginia. The only former competitor backing Sanders after his definitive victory in the Nevada caucuses is author Marianne Williamson. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., dropped out of the race last week but she has yet to endorse Biden or Sanders.Those backing Biden and Sanders also vary drastically in their ideologies and policy positions.Since the South Carolina primary, Democratic Reps. Abigail Spanberger, Elissa Slotkin, and Andy Kim — moderates who all flipped their seats from red to blue in the 2018 midterms — have endorsed Biden. Kim is one of several House members who previously endorsed Buttigieg and then transferred his support to Biden after the former South Bend mayor suspended his campaign.While just one member of Congress — Rep. Mark Takano of California — has decided to throw his support behind Sanders since his strong performance in Nevada lifted him into temporary front-runner status, those who backed the Independent Vermont senator prior to the caucuses come from the bluest of districts. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for example, are ardent Sanders campaigners.From the start of his candidacy, Sanders has failed to win over any governors. Five governors in contrast, have issued formal endorsements for Biden, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer whose state is voting today. Share this - Ben Kamisar and Melissa Holzberg9d ago / 4:57 PM UTCSanders and Biden scrap on the airwaves in Tuesday's statesWASHINGTON — It may not be super, but as the Democratic race hits the latest round of contests today, Joe Biden is looking to replicate his strong showing on last week's Super Tuesday and widen his delegate lead over Bernie Sanders. The Sanders campaign is outspending Biden on the TV and radio airwaves across the six states that hold their nominating contests today — $2.9 million to Biden's almost $2.2 million, according to Advertising Analytics. But Biden's effort has been boosted by spending from his allied super PAC, Unite the Country. Both campaigns are spending the most in Michigan — Sanders and Biden have spent about $1.2 million each, with Unite the Country spending another almost $400,000.  The Biden campaign and his super PAC have also run ads in Missouri and Mississippi, but neither have spent a cent on TV or radio ads in Washington, Idaho and North Dakota.The Sanders campaign, by comparison, has gone up on the airwaves in all six states voting Tuesday. Sanders' top ad across these states, according to Advertising Analytics data, is one that attacks Biden on social security by using audio from a speech in 1995 where he called for a spending freeze across the government. His campaign has spent more than $644,000 to air the ad in states holding votes on Tuesday. The Biden campaign has bristled at those attacks, and has spent almost $200,000 in those states on ads that criticize Sanders for going negative and argue Biden has said he'd expand Medicare and Social Security. Biden's top ads in the states voting Tuesday are different versions of the same spot, which feature former President Obama's praise of Biden as ""an extraordinary man with an extraordinary career in public service."" And Unite Our Country has spent $376,000 in these states on a spot that quotes Biden talking about his campaign, and includes some brief swipes at Sanders (Biden is quoted int he ad saying he wants to ""build on ObamaCare"" instead of scrapping it, and ""Democrats want a nominee who is a Democrat""). Share this -",Biden under Secret Service protection again,,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1161431,nbc
"WASHINGTON — It’s likely — if not certain — that today’s Democratic presidential primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois will be the last ones for the next two months.And it’s unclear what, exactly, is going to happen today in Ohio, where the state’s governor said he wouldn’t open the state’s polling places, defying a judge who declined to postpone the state’s primary.It all freezes into place a Democratic nominating contest — with uncertainty about when it all begins again.And that raises questions about the state of Bernie Sanders’ campaign (given that Joe Biden’s lead is going to grow after tonight’s contests), about the Democratic convention in July (will the health landscape improve by then?), and about whether states and the federal government can institute a vote-by-mail system for November.Already, Georgia (originally set for March 24), Louisiana (April 4) and Kentucky (May 19) have postponed their primaries to later dates, as other upcoming states are almost guaranteed to follow.Here is the state of the Democratic race heading into tonight’s contests: Joe Biden leads Bernie Sanders by 152 pledged delegates, according to NBC News’ count.That’s with about half of all delegates now awarded, and it will be about 60 percent done after tonight (and depending on what happens in Ohio).Biden has won 871 pledged delegates, or 50 percent of all pledged delegates allocated so far.Sanders has won 719, or 42 percent.To reach the magic number of 1,991 pledged delegates, Biden will need to win 50 percent of the remaining unallocated pledged delegates.Sanders will need to win 56 percent.Those numbers will change after tonight – most likely helping Joe Biden and hurting Bernie Sanders.And then we’re going to have to wait.Tweet of the dayAs ordered by @OHdeptofhealth Director @DrAmyActon and in consultation with @GovMikeDeWine, Ohio’s primary has been postponed.Here’s the action I took to make sure your voice is heard. https://t.co/FwEp95O1OJ pic.twitter.com/Z9yfPuSJTY— Frank LaRose (@FrankLaRose) March 17, 2020 Why President Trump’s tone changed on the coronavirusPresident Trump’s tone certainly changed when it comes to the coronavirus.“This is a bad one, this is a very bad one.

But that would still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and in health systems “overwhelmed many times over,” they said.”2020 Vision: Everything you need to know about the March 17 primariesFour states hold their Democratic presidential primaries today, and here’s a breakdown of what you need to know about each contest — by final poll closing time.7:30 p.m. ET: Ohio (136 pledged delegates at stake – unaffiliated and GOP voters can request a Democratic ballot).

Newman, a progressive, narrowly lost to the antiabortion-rights incumbent two years ago.Dispatches from NBC’s campaign embedsOn the eve of Primary Day, Bernie Sanders admitted that his campaign isn’t panning out quite the way he planned, per NBC’s Gary Grumbach. “We are winning the generational battle. Now, for whatever reason, and I plead guilty to this, maybe it's some of my own doings or lack of doings, we're doing poorly with older people that's just, simply a fact,” he said during his virtual rally on Monday. “I gotta work on that,” Sanders admitted.But the campaign’s national co-chair Nina Turner said they are not going to relent: “We are not relenting, we are pressing on towards the high prize which is justice, economic justice, political justice, social justice, and environmental justice,” she said. “We are going to continue to fight, to turn this thing around and, baby, we can do it because there is no force greater on this Earth than a conscious minded people on the move.”Grumbach, along with NBC’s Marianna Sotomayor and Amanda Golden wrote more about what this campaign will continue to look like without in-person campaign events, and perhaps with postponed voting here.Data Download: The number of the day is … 21,36121,361.That’s Joe Biden’s margin of victory over Bernie Sanders in Washington state — in the actual number of votes — with 99 percent in.On Monday, a week after the contest took place on March 10, NBC News projected Biden the apparent winner in Washington, with Biden at 575,291 votes (38 percent) and Sanders at 553,930 (36 percent).With Biden’s victory in Washington, that means he won five out of the six Democratic contests last week — with his sole defeat in North Dakota.The Lid: Worried sickDon’t miss the pod from yesterday, when we looked at the partisan divides in how Americans are viewing the coronavirus crisis.ICYMI: News clips you shouldn’t missThe president finally pivoted to talking about the gravity of the coronavirus situation.

"MIAMI — In the months leading to the presidential primaries Tuesday in Florida and Arizona, the names Fidel Castro and Joe Arpaio have become part of the mix for Latino voters as they choose between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.But the escalating coronavirus pandemic has made the issues surrounding the late Cuban communist leader and the ex-sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, secondary to whether to venture to the polls at all.Florida and Arizona, as well as Illinois are going forward with their primaries despite the national emergency over the outbreak; Ohio's governor called for the primaries to be postponed. State and county officials have said they are taking precautions such as cleaning polling stations and closing voting locations with vulnerable populations, such as nursing and retirement homes.Latinos make up 20.5 percent of eligible voters in Florida and 23.6 percent in Arizona, according to the Pew Research Center.In Florida, fierce opposition to communism and socialism has contributed to many Latinos rejecting Sanders' ""political revolution,"" while in Arizona, what critics view as racist policing and anti-immigrant tactics by Arpaio has mobilized a generation of Latinos who want more than a decade of Republican policies reversed.Dem candidates debate amid coronavirus outbreakMarch 16, 202007:26Biden is the clear leader in the nomination race, and polls don’t offer much hope for Sanders' chances of turning things around, especially in Florida.The primaries provide a chance to see whether Sanders can still grab large chunks of the Latino electorate in Arizona and possibly Illinois as he did in Nevada, California and Texas. Biden meanwhile must show he is becoming the preferred candidate of Latinos of all ages, not just older Latinos as he has been in other primaries.In Illinois and Ohio, Latinos are 11.6 percent and 2.7 percent of the electorate. Illinois, however has almost as many voting-eligible Latinos — 1.1 million, mostly in the Chicago area — as Arizona, where there are an estimated 1.2 million.RelatedNewsNewsLatino groups to Florida: Voting materials for Spanish speakers 'is the law'In Tucson, Arizona, Jacky Vazquez, 19, was trying to decide last week who would get her vote. She said she was leaning toward Sanders, but was doing her own research because ""no one tells me what my views are."" She had only been contacted by the campaign of Mike Bloomberg, who has dropped out and endorsed Biden.""I'm really focused on immigration ... and that is something that decides who I vote for, and I manage my family's business and anything that is for small-business owners, that's what decides my vote,"" she said.She gets her ballot by mail and planned to walk it to her precinct on Tuesday. ""I know people are worried about the virus but dropping off my ballot is going to take me a few minutes, a small action that is important for me and my community,"" she said. She added she's following other measures to keep her and her family healthy.Sanders 'should have known better'In a poll for Telemundo by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy, 48 percent of Florida Latinos surveyed said they’d vote for Biden and 37 percent for Sanders, while 12 percent remained undecided.Before this primary, Sanders angered the large voting bloc of Cuban Americans — about half of whom voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the 2016 election. In a recent ""60 Minutes"" interview, Sanders said that the reason many Cubans didn't challenge Castro and help the U.S. overthrow him is because ""he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed society.""Sanders' praise for the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua in the 1980s, his refusal to call Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro a dictator and his characterization of Evo Morales’ exit from the Bolivian presidency as a ""coup"" has also been criticized by some Florida Latinos whose families fled leftist-authoritarian Latin American countries.Outraged Democrats in the state, whose constituents are known to split votes between parties, quickly repudiated the comments, hoping to distance themselves as they seek their own re-elections amid GOP hammering of all Democrats as ""socialists.""Eduardo Siman, 37, said his family left El Salvador after the country's bitter civil war, whose leftist insurgency would not have been funded ""if it weren't for Castro."" Originally a Pete Buttigieg supporter, Siman cast an ballot for Biden, saying the former vice president “carries all the values of a centrist platform.”The Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceJoe Biden speaks about the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic at an event in Wilmington, Del. on March 12, 2020.Carlos Barria / ReutersSenior Biden campaign adviser Cristobal Alex told NBC News that the former vice president has a better record with Latinos than Sanders. ""We as a campaign need to be sure we are sharing that message,"" Alex said, criticizing Sanders' record not just on foreign policy but ""his vote against immigration reform or position on gun manufacturers.""But some Florida voters say they support the Vermont senator's message.Carmen Plasencia, 40, a Cuban American from Tampa, told NBC News that Sanders “should have known better” than to make the comments about Castro and should be “more connected to the trauma and the pain that people from Cuba have faced.”But Plasencia, a single mother who works as a massage therapist and yoga instructor, said she remains supportive of Sanders because “he is for the people.” Unlike her grandfather, who worked as a landscaper and could buy a home, she said she doesn't have that opportunity.In Sunday night's debate, Sanders was asked why Cuban American voters in Florida would support him in light of the praise of the politics of a dictator ""who jailed, tortured and killed thousands of Cubans."" Sanders said he “opposed authoritarianism everywhere.”“We condemn authoritarianism whether it’s in China, Russia, Cuba, anyplace else. But to simply say that nothing ever done by any of those administrations had a positive impact on their people would, I think, be incorrect,” Sanders said.Florida's growing Puerto Rican voteThe state has had an influx of Puerto Ricans during the past 10 years after the island's economy collapsed and especially after the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017. (As U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans who move to the mainland can register to vote in state and national elections.)Stephanie Ramirez, 26, a Port St. Lucie resident who was born in Puerto Rico, said that her salary as a credentialing analyst disqualifies her for the Affordable Care Act, yet private health insurance is too expensive.Although Sanders’ values on health care and education appeal to her, she said she doesn’t think they’re realistic.“Health care is important, and it pulls me toward Biden,” Ramirez said.Sanders' senior adviser Chuck Rocha said that in Illinois, the campaign has focused on reminding Puerto Ricans that the U.S. government has bailed out Wall Street, but has been unwilling to bail out the island as it grapples with its $70 billion debt.Courting Arizona's mobilized LatinosArizona's Latinos are more likely to be Mexican American, and they have felt directly targeted by Trump and state-elected Republicans, said Tucson Mayor Regina Romero, the first Latina and woman elected to the office.""The immigration issue, the in-your-face racist remarks have been clearly very directed to Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants,"" said Romero, who originally endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren but is not endorsing anyone else before the primary.Arizona officials and Latino advocates say many of the state's Latinos have felt the sting of Arpaio's policing and SB1070 —the 10-year-old immigration law that allows police to racially profile Hispanics to check their citizenship and immigration status. Add to that the state's ban on Mexican American studies and the state's constitutional amendment declaring English its official language.Grecia Lima, the Tucson-based national political director for Community Change Action, said the state's increased Democratic mobilization, which she called a transformation, ""is the product of young people and their commitment to their communities.""It is young Latinos who have been most enthusiastic about Sanders' campaign and turned out for him strongly in other states. The NBC News Super Tuesday exit poll showed Sanders won voters ages 17-29 48 percent to 17 percent over Biden.In the debate Sanders warned Biden that, if he is the nominee, to beat Trump in the general election ""you're going to have to bring Latinos ... who have the agenda that we need, but also don't vote in the numbers that we need."" He said he doubted Biden's campaign ""can generate that energy and excitement and that voter turnout.""But Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who originally endorsed Sen. Kamala Harris and now has endorsed Biden, said Biden and former President Barack Obama have a history with the state's Latinos.""They are the ones that came in and protected the Latino community against Sheriff Arpaio and sued the state over SB1070 and then passed DACA,"" Gallego said, referring to the Obama program that shielded younger immigrants from deportation and that Trump is attempting to end.DNC Chairman Tom Perez was serving as Obama's civil rights division chief when he led civil rights investigations of Arpaio and sued the state over SB1070, winning elimination of some of its harshest provisions.Although in the debate Biden failed to directly answer why he isn't getting as much of the Latino vote as Sanders, he championed quality education for the increasingly Latino public school population.""The idea that any American thinks it doesn't pay for us to significantly invest in their future is absolutely a bizarre notion, because if we do not invest, everything that the very wealthy are concerned about and the xenophobes are concerned about will, in fact, get worse, not better,"" Biden said.A supporter wears a shirt that says ""Tio Bernie"" during a rally for Sen.

And so to so directly dismiss the value, the honor, the loyalty and sacrifices, not only for me, but for any service member in this country, it can't go unchecked.”As Gabbard made national headlines by suing Clinton and voting “present” on the impeachment of President Donald Trump, she leaned into local retail politics, particularly in New Hampshire, where she held more than 100 town halls and business visits.She stayed active on the trail by posting her workouts on Instagram, surfing in winter weather and snowboarding with supporters.“They appreciate being able to meet a presidential candidate out and having some fun, and going where people are hanging out, rather than just the usual traditional political haunts,” Gabbard said on the slopes in New Hampshire.Gabbard recently started a podcast featuring voters she met on the campaign trail. She announced in the fall that she would not seek reelection to a fifth term in the House of Representatives, but rather would focus on her presidential aspirations.The last female candidate to exit the primary, Gabbard left the race with just two delegates.","Tulsi Gabbard ends presidential run, endorses Biden",Mar 19 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/tulsi-gabbard-ends-presidential-run-endorses-biden-n1163851,nbc
"The nation's response to the coronavirus outbreak dominated much of the discussion in the 11th Democratic debate on Sunday night — the first time that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders went head to head on stage in the 2020 election cycle.Also a first: Biden vowing to name a woman as his running mate if he wins the nomination.The former vice president and Vermont independent senator squared off in dramatically different surroundings than initially planned, Washington instead of Phoenix, and in CNN's studio instead of a 5,000-seat theater with a live audience — a venue change prompted by coronavirus fears as the nation goes into lockdown over the pandemic.Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination following a string of state primary victories since winning in South Carolina last month.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are turning their attention to the latest emergency spending bill as the economic impact of the coronavirus intensifies, racing to reach a deal on what could be the largest stimulus package in American history.At the basis of the negotiation is President Donald Trump’s request for $500 billion in direct payouts to Americans.But much about the bill is still unknown. It is unclear who would qualify for the money, if there will be an income cap, how they would get the money, and how much money would be sent, among other questions.Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Thursday that the White House wanted to send $1,000 to adults and $500 per child, but did not elaborate on any potential restrictions, such as income caps. Mnuchin told Fox Business he hoped a first round of payments would go out within the next three weeks if Congress approves a plan quickly, with the possibility of a second round of payments if the crisis is still ongoing in six weeks.But it remained unclear whether lawmakers would support Mnuchin's proposal.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he wanted to reach a consensus on the bill among his Republican colleagues before opening up negotiations with Democrats.Some Republicans, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have expressed skepticism over direct cash payments and suggested that more resources ought to be directed at helping small businesses meet payroll.Other Senate Republicans, including Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rick Scott of Florida, have taken issue with the White House's proposal to include industry bailouts for airlines and other stressed sectors.Let our news meet your inbox.

Susan Collins of Maine and Marco Rubio of Florida announced Wednesday they were working on a proposal to give more aid to small businesses.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has proposed giving $2,000 to every adult and $1,000 per child until the coronavirus crisis ends.McConnell's decision to keep Democrats out of the initial round of discussions frustrated some lawmakers, who pointed out that previous coronavirus spending bills had included direct negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Mnuchin.Still, it hasn't kept Democrats from opening up their own dialogue with the White House. Both Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have spoken with Mnuchin multiple times in the past few days about the third coronavirus bill.McConnell expressed optimism Wednesday that his party could reach a consensus quickly. ""Republicans hope, shortly, to have a consolidated position along with the administration and we intend to sit down with our Democratic colleagues, see what we can agree to,"" he said.The majority leader, who has stressed the need to act quickly, could unveil his starting-point proposal as early as Thursday. But even then, Democrats would need to come to an agreement and the bill would need to be put into legislative language.Senators said they expected to work through the weekend and hoped to hold a vote the following week.On Wednesday, McConnell advised members to stay close.“Just how long it will take to get through these steps is unclear, but as everyone knows we are moving rapidly because the situation demands it,” he said on the Senate floor Wednesday after the chamber passed the second coronavirus spending bill.Hanging over Congress' head is the revelation that two members had been infected with the coronavirus, adding to the need to act quickly as more and more lawmakers could be forced to stay home.Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, announced Wednesday they had tested positive, forcing some lawmakers who had been in close contact with them to self-quarantine.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., announced Thursday morning that the House would not return to session until they are ready to vote on the emergency bill.",Negotiations heat up on $1 trillion coronavirus bill,Mar 19 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/negotiations-heat-1-trillion-coronavirus-bill-would-include-cash-payments-n1163826,nbc
"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden doubled his delegate lead over Bernie Sanders in Tuesday's primaries, giving him a nearly insurmountable advantage after sweeping Florida, Illinois and Arizona, according to NBC News projections.The former vice president now has 315 more delegates than the senator from Vermont — 1,132 to Sanders' 817 — after having started the night with an edge of 154.Biden has passed the halfway mark and is well on his way to the 1,991 delegates he needs to win a majority of all delegates and capture the Democratic presidential nomination.Sanders did not address the results Tuesday night.

In 2016, Sanders got blown out in Florida, but he was at least able to win nine counties and a third of the delegates.While results were still coming in, Biden is on track for a similarly strong win in Illinois, where Sanders is currently winning just one county — home to the University of Illinois — and although Arizona is closer, Biden will still extract more delegates from the state.The former vice president's growing delegate lead makes a comeback by Sanders increasingly unlikely as the number of delegate-rich states on the calendar dwindles from this point on.Because Democrats award delegates in proportion to each candidate's vote share, Sanders would likely need to win coming states by very lopsided margins to catch up to Biden.Meanwhile, six future contests have so far been delayed by the coronavirus outbreak, including the next two that had been set for this month, Georgia and Puerto Rico.The means that after a jampacked Democratic presidential calendar with election nights every week for almost two months, there is no vote on the books in any states until April 4, when Hawaii, Alaska and Wyoming will weigh in.Those states are expected to be friendlier territory for Sanders but don't offer many delegates.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump. They also rolled out new Spanish-language ads in Florida, Arizona and Illinois discussing Biden’s records on guns, healthcare and the need for leadership to prevent future global panic like the one caused by coronavirus.Unite the Country, the Super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy, will also not be on the airwaves or on digital in the coming weeks as they focus on expanding their group with sights set on the general election, Steve Schale, a top strategist for the group, told NBC News. After projected losses in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries on Tuesday night, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that Sanders ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign"" but that ""In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""Through March 10, before the campaign was completely upended by coronavirus, the Sanders campaign had significantly outspent the Biden campaign on the television and radio airwaves—$42.2 million to $14.6 million respectively. —Mike Memoli contributed. Share this -Ben Popken, Kevin Collier and Shamar Walters23h ago / 5:03 PM UTCChicago's voting struggles illustrate the challenges of coronavirusChicago voters were turned away for hours at dozens of polling locations that opened without voting machines, adequate cleaning supplies or enough poll workers — acutely illustrating the strain of voting under the threat of coronavirus exposure and mandates for social distancing and disinfecting surfaces. The delays were driven by a shortage of poll workers and the need to move polling equipment to new locations, Noah Praetz, a former director of elections at Cook County, told NBC News, adding that ""probably 60 percent of necessary poll workers” handled things. After 200 polling locations were changed, about 50 precincts didn’t have enough supplies to open, James P. Allen, a spokesman for the city's elections board, told reporters. Locations struggled to find enough workers and went through a large number of replacement judges, he said. By Monday, the number of resignations from judges had risen to “a torrent, a tsunami of calls,” Chicago Board of Elections Chair Marisel Hernandez said.At the end of the day, turnout was slightly over 30 percent in the city in what were “extremely challenging conditions,“ the city’s elections board reported — a steep drop from over 50 percent turnout in 2016 and only a few percentage points above the city’s record-low presidential primary turnout in 2012.Efforts to push alternate means to in-person voting like early voting and voting by mail appeared successful Tuesday, with nearly 600,000 early votes cast and nearly 300,000 ballots sent by mail across the state, compared to about 423,000 early votes and 162,000 mail-in ballots in the 2016 primary, according to the Illinois State Board of Elections.Share this -1d ago / 3:36 PM UTCBiden sweeps Sanders in 3 states on one of the strangest primary days in recent historyMarch 18, 202005:08Share this -Alex Seitz-Wald1d ago / 3:19 PM UTCLongtime anti-abortion rights Democrat Rep.

In Florida, 71 percent of voters picked Biden on that question, while 64 percent did in Illinois and 63 percent did in Arizona.The question now for progressives is whether it's their message or their messenger, Sanders, that Democrats are rejecting as the centrist Biden moves ever closer to winning the party's nomination and President Donald Trump pushes a coronavirus stimulus package that features a populist plan to send thousand-dollar checks to Americans.Read the analysis here.Share this -Chuck Todd, Mark Murray  and Carrie Dann1d ago / 1:24 PM UTCFIRST READ: After Tuesday's losses, Sanders faces more questions about his campaign's futureUnder normal circumstances, there would be enormous pressure for Bernie Sanders to suspend his presidential campaign and unite — now that he trails Joe Biden by 315 pledged delegates, and that he continues to underperform from his 2016 campaign.But these aren’t normal circumstances.With more than 5,700 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, with at least 100 deaths, and with states (including Ohio yesterday) postponing their primaries until May or June, the interest isn’t party unity.It’s the country’s health.Get First Read.Share this -Shaquille Brewster and Rebecca Shabad1d ago / 1:21 PM UTCSanders to 'assess' campaignSen.

Allen, a spokesman for the city's elections board, told reporters. Locations struggled to find enough workers and went through a large number of replacement judges, he said. By Monday, the number of resignations from judges had risen to “a torrent, a tsunami of calls,” Chicago Board of Elections Chair Marisel Hernandez said.At the end of the day, turnout was slightly over 30 percent in the city in what were “extremely challenging conditions,“ the city’s elections board reported — a steep drop from over 50 percent turnout in 2016 and only a few percentage points above the city’s record-low presidential primary turnout in 2012.Efforts to push alternate means to in-person voting like early voting and voting by mail appeared successful Tuesday, with nearly 600,000 early votes cast and nearly 300,000 ballots sent by mail across the state, compared to about 423,000 early votes and 162,000 mail-in ballots in the 2016 primary, according to the Illinois State Board of Elections.Share this - 1d ago / 3:36 PM UTCBiden sweeps Sanders in 3 states on one of the strangest primary days in recent historyMarch 18, 202005:08Share this - Alex Seitz-Wald1d ago / 3:19 PM UTCLongtime anti-abortion rights Democrat Rep.

Do not spread misinformation from politicized news stories.” Chris Pack, the NRCC’s communications director, told NBC that the campaign arm sent additional guidance to non-incumbent candidates.

Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2.

The lighter security footprint allowed Biden to engage in the type of one-on-one, retail-oriented campaigning he preferred, especially in the early-voting states where voters place a premium on it.Campaign officials have long been concerned about his safety given his high profile as a former vice president and the highly partisan environment. A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course. He first became a protectee of the agency in August 2008 when Barack Obama chose him as his vice presidential running mate. He and his family had a security detail throughout his eight years as vice president, and Biden for several additional months after he left office in 2017. Share this -Ben Kamisar3d ago / 3:08 PM UTCIllinois governor backs Biden for presidentWASHINGTON — Illinois Democratic Gov.

Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders. In recent weeks Biden has earned 11 endorsements from former 2020 Democratic candidates, but Warren has notably sat out on backing the two final contenders in the primary race.While Biden said supporting Warren’s plan is one area for finding common ground with the Vermont senator, Sanders has often attacked Biden for his support for the 2005 bankruptcy bill. He often brought it up as a consequential stain in Biden’s Senate record alongside his support of the Iraq War and trade deals.“The fact of the matter is I'm not beholding to the banks. I supported the bankruptcy bill because I believed taking a very bad bill was going to pass overwhelmingly and make it better made sense,” Biden said in a July 2019 speech where he defended controversial parts of his record that had come under attack by his opponents.The Biden campaign told NBC News that Biden, who recently reviewed Warren’s plan, will likely speak more about why he supports her proposals at Sunday’s Democratic debate.Share this -Marianna Sotomayor5d ago / 4:22 PM UTCBiden's first virtual event encounters technological glitchesWASHINGTON — The virtual campaign is proving a bit complicated, after a Friday event for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign encountered some technological glitches. Biden is the first Democratic candidate to hold a virtual town hall due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 and public events. The attempt to broadcast the first of two scheduled “virtual events” in the next several days involved a garbled-voiced Biden and ended roughly four minutes after the Facebook Live video began streaming in Illinois.The former vice president acknowledged the issues while ending the livestream.“Well, I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections, but there is a lot more to say and I’ve probably already said too much,” Biden said. But the appetite for these events appears to be there — the short event garnered more than 5,000 viewers. On Saturday morning, the campaign released a link to a full, updated video without the technical glitches.Much of the event focused on Biden explaining how he'd work to respond and recover the country from pandemics. He also tried to downplay the need for panic and outlined ways in which everyone can take precautions to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while still connecting to people.“Campaign events are no exception that’s why we’re connecting virtually today.

Tom Emmer, R-Minn., sent Republican House members a memo that ran through some suggested “best practices” on issues like fundraising, public events and communications. Lally Doerrer, right, and Katharine Hildebrand watch Joe Biden during his Illinois virtual town hall in Chicago on March 13, 2020.Charles Rex Arbogast / APSome of that guidance mimics what the DCCC told their members — the NRCC suggests limiting grassroots events, shifting field work to phone canvassing and launching tele-town halls. On fundraising, Emmer cautioned that candidates should continue to fundraise but “be sensitive that your donors may have suffered financial losses during this pandemic” and ask their donors how they are holding up in light of the crisis. Emmer specifically asked members to reconsider “snarky” comments and be sure not to spread misinformation. “At times like this you need to ask yourself if your press release or snarky comment are in poor taste,” Emmer wrote. “If you share information on the coronavirus, do it from trusted sources like the Center for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services. Do not spread misinformation from politicized news stories.” Chris Pack, the NRCC’s communications director, told NBC that the campaign arm sent additional guidance to non-incumbent candidates. Emmer left his member with this: “Do not get complacent.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump. They also rolled out new Spanish-language ads in Florida, Arizona and Illinois discussing Biden’s records on guns, healthcare and the need for leadership to prevent future global panic like the one caused by coronavirus.Unite the Country, the Super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy, will also not be on the airwaves or on digital in the coming weeks as they focus on expanding their group with sights set on the general election, Steve Schale, a top strategist for the group, told NBC News. After projected losses in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries on Tuesday night, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that Sanders ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign"" but that ""In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""Through March 10, before the campaign was completely upended by coronavirus, the Sanders campaign had significantly outspent the Biden campaign on the television and radio airwaves—$42.2 million to $14.6 million respectively. —Mike Memoli contributed. Share this - Ben Kamisar and Kyle Stewart2d ago / 4:53 PM UTCWhile Maryland delays primary, special election to replace Cummings will stay as mail-in onlyWASHINGTON — As Maryland delays most primary elections from late April to early June in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the state will not push back the special election aimed at replacing the late Rep. Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2. He directed the state elections board to come up with a plan to conduct a June primary ""in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process."" But Hogan added that while the election board told him it couldn't shift the entire state to vote-by-mail in time for the April primary to go on as scheduled, he felt it was ""imperative that the people of the seventh congressional district have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress."" That's why he decided to keep that district's primary on schedule. Maryland's 7th Congressional District has been vacant since Cummings died on Oct. 17, 2019. The state held a special primary for the seat on Feb. 5, with former Democrat Rep. Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik, a member of the Baltimore County Republican Central Committee, moving onto the special general election. Share this - Pete Williams, Dan Gallo and Mike Memoli2d ago / 1:45 PM UTCBiden under Secret Service protection againWILMINGTON, Del. — After a nearly three year hiatus, Joe Biden is once again a protectee of the United States Secret Service.A protective detail began its assignment with the former vice president and Democratic front-runner this week, multiple law enforcement officials told NBC News, even as Biden is expected to remain off the campaign trail amid the coronavirus crisis. The Biden campaign's formal request for Secret Service protection was submitted last week to senior congressional officials, who by law consult with the secretary of Homeland Security to consider if candidates should receive security from the elite law enforcement agency.Anti-dairy industry protestors are pulled from the stage as Democratic U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at his Super Tuesday night rally in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 3, 2020.Kyle Grillot / ReutersSince kicking off his campaign last April, Biden has had minimal security on the campaign trail — one private security guard often supplemented by local law enforcement from jurisdictions where he campaigned. The lighter security footprint allowed Biden to engage in the type of one-on-one, retail-oriented campaigning he preferred, especially in the early-voting states where voters place a premium on it.Campaign officials have long been concerned about his safety given his high profile as a former vice president and the highly partisan environment. A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course. He first became a protectee of the agency in August 2008 when Barack Obama chose him as his vice presidential running mate. He and his family had a security detail throughout his eight years as vice president, and Biden for several additional months after he left office in 2017. Share this - Ben Kamisar3d ago / 3:08 PM UTCIllinois governor backs Biden for presidentWASHINGTON — Illinois Democratic Gov.

Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders. In recent weeks Biden has earned 11 endorsements from former 2020 Democratic candidates, but Warren has notably sat out on backing the two final contenders in the primary race.While Biden said supporting Warren’s plan is one area for finding common ground with the Vermont senator, Sanders has often attacked Biden for his support for the 2005 bankruptcy bill. He often brought it up as a consequential stain in Biden’s Senate record alongside his support of the Iraq War and trade deals.“The fact of the matter is I'm not beholding to the banks. I supported the bankruptcy bill because I believed taking a very bad bill was going to pass overwhelmingly and make it better made sense,” Biden said in a July 2019 speech where he defended controversial parts of his record that had come under attack by his opponents.The Biden campaign told NBC News that Biden, who recently reviewed Warren’s plan, will likely speak more about why he supports her proposals at Sunday’s Democratic debate.Share this - Marianna Sotomayor5d ago / 4:22 PM UTCBiden's first virtual event encounters technological glitchesWASHINGTON — The virtual campaign is proving a bit complicated, after a Friday event for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign encountered some technological glitches. Biden is the first Democratic candidate to hold a virtual town hall due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 and public events. The attempt to broadcast the first of two scheduled “virtual events” in the next several days involved a garbled-voiced Biden and ended roughly four minutes after the Facebook Live video began streaming in Illinois.The former vice president acknowledged the issues while ending the livestream.“Well, I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections, but there is a lot more to say and I’ve probably already said too much,” Biden said. But the appetite for these events appears to be there — the short event garnered more than 5,000 viewers. On Saturday morning, the campaign released a link to a full, updated video without the technical glitches.Much of the event focused on Biden explaining how he'd work to respond and recover the country from pandemics. He also tried to downplay the need for panic and outlined ways in which everyone can take precautions to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while still connecting to people.“Campaign events are no exception that’s why we’re connecting virtually today.

"WASHINGTON — U.S. hospitals and medical professionals are asking for $100 billion in direct financial assistance from Congress to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, with some hospitals already running short of supplies for both patients and health care workers in virus hot spots like Seattle.In its initial legislative package, Congress appropriated funding to assist hospitals with more bed space and medical supplies, but it did not create a direct pipeline to address urgently needed supplies and equipment such as masks, ventilators and personal protective equipment for front-line health care workers.After a second spending bill without direct payments was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Wednesday, the American Hospital Association cautioned congressional leaders in a statement that “more needs to be urgently done.” That package expands sick leave and makes testing for the coronavirus more widely available.On Thursday, the association dramatically expanded its earlier request from $1 billion to $100 billion for direct funding for hospitals, the group told NBC News.In a joint letter to congressional leaders, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association write: “Based on the initial costs in the states with growing COVID-19 community spread, Congress should allocate $100 billion to front line health care personnel and providers, including physicians, nurses, hospitals and health systems, and direct the federal agencies to begin to infuse funds immediately so that they can afford to take the necessary steps to fight the battle against this unseen enemy.”Medical professional calls for bold steps to fix resource shortageMarch 19, 202012:37House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Thursday also called on Trump to immediately activate the 1950 Defense Production Act, which allows him to direct American manufacturers to produce urgently needed supplies. After saying in a Wednesday press conference that he would use the powers, the president later said in a tweet that he will only “invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future.”Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceThe hospital association says Trump needs to invoke his powers quickly in order to speed production and distribution of the supplies they need to treat patients and keep health care workers safe. The new legislation would then allow hospitals to purchase whatever new products are created by American manufacturers.The federal government has traditionally funneled money to hospitals through various agencies and state entities, a process that takes too long and doesn’t guarantee hospitals are getting what they need, the association said, particularly in rural hospitals.Even after receiving two supply shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile, some hospitals in Washington state are already running low on supplies, putting health care workers at risk and forcing hospitals to make difficult decisions, including one rural hospital that’s already closed down primary care services to conserve supplies, Washington State Hospital Association spokeswoman Beth Zborowski said.“We’re getting to a real dire position here with some hospitals having only a few days' worth of masks on hand,” she said.It’s unclear how funds designated for hospital readiness from the initial congressional package will get distributed to hospitals most in need, Zborowski added. Some of the money runs through a Department of Health and Human Services emergency fund, and it’s unclear what mechanism HHS will use to disburse it and who will get it, for instance.On March 16, a joint letter from the same groups asked for $1 billion to ensure that “hospitals, health systems, physicians and nurses are viable and directly supported for preparedness and response.”Congress and the Trump administration, in their public remarks, have appeared to focus more on the need for a broader stimulus proposal than what medical professionals say is the immediate challenge of personal protective equipment shortages and ventilator production. Hospital officials say they believe their message is being heard on Capitol Hill, yet there are no promises on funding levels or timing.The White House is proposing a $1 trillion economic package to combat the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, $250 billion of which would be used for direct payments to Americans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has outlined three broad buckets, including helping small businesses, “Main Street” and the “health care system and medical professionals,” without offering specifics. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin has been negotiating directly with Pelosi.Josh Michaud, an associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said there’s a disconnect between what Congress is prioritizing and what hospitals are saying they need to combat the pandemic. “We’re already starting to see concerns that certain hospitals will be running out in the next couple days. The efforts so far to address this have been slow,” he said. Kaiser is a nonpartisan nonprofit health policy group.The Washington state rural hospital that cut off primary care services has one box of masks left, Zborowski said.The bottleneck is due to hospitals not getting as much as they normally ordered from suppliers because of a worldwide shortage. Further, almost all of the hospitals in the Seattle area are canceling elective surgeries that bring in revenue that keeps hospitals financially sound, she said.On Wednesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wheeled in a ventilator to a news conference to make his point: “We need ventilators,” he said. “This is a national need.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are turning their attention to the latest emergency spending bill as the economic impact of the coronavirus intensifies, racing to reach a deal on what could be the largest stimulus package in American history.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that Republicans were finalizing their stimulus proposal that would include a number of economic relief measures for small businesses, industries and Americans, and said that Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, was working to finalize how President Donald Trump’s request for $500 billion in direct payouts to Americans would be structured.“These are not ordinary policies, this is no ordinary time,” McConnell said.But much about the bill is still unknown. It is unclear who would qualify for the money, if there will be an income cap, how they would get the money, and how much money would be sent, among other questions.Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Thursday that the White House wanted to send $1,000 to adults and $500 per child, but did not elaborate on any potential restrictions, such as income caps. Mnuchin told Fox Business he hoped a first round of payments would go out within the next three weeks if Congress approves a plan quickly, with the possibility of a second round of payments if the crisis is still ongoing in six weeks.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that Democratic support would be contingent on greater levels of aid than the White House had already suggested, paired with other economic relief efforts for workers.“That [amount suggested by the White House] might help families cover rent, groceries for a month, but then what?"" Schumer said Thursday. “If we are going to do it, it's got to be bigger, more generous and more frequent than what I’ve heard.""McConnell said he wanted to reach a consensus on the bill among his Republican colleagues before opening up negotiations with Democrats.Some Republicans, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have expressed skepticism over direct cash payments and suggested that more resources ought to be directed at helping small businesses meet payroll.Let our news meet your inbox.

Susan Collins of Maine and Marco Rubio of Florida announced Wednesday they were working on a proposal to give more aid to small businesses.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has proposed giving $2,000 to every adult and $1,000 per child until the coronavirus crisis ends.McConnell's decision to keep Democrats out of the initial round of discussions frustrated some lawmakers, who pointed out that previous coronavirus spending bills had included direct negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Mnuchin.Still, it hasn't kept Democrats from opening up their own dialogue with the White House. Both Pelosi and Schumer have spoken with Mnuchin multiple times in the past few days about the third coronavirus bill.“We are ready and eager to look at what Republicans have put together, and work with them. But we believe whatever proposal emerges — and it will be bipartisan — it must be a 'workers first' proposal,” Schumer said Thursday.McConnell expressed optimism Wednesday that his party could reach a consensus quickly. ""Republicans hope, shortly, to have a consolidated position along with the administration and we intend to sit down with our Democratic colleagues, see what we can agree to,"" he said.The majority leader, who has stressed the need to act quickly, could unveil his starting-point proposal as early as Thursday. But even then, Democrats would need to come to an agreement and the bill would need to be put into legislative language.Senators said they expected to work through the weekend and hoped to hold a vote the following week.On Wednesday, McConnell advised members to stay close.“Just how long it will take to get through these steps is unclear, but as everyone knows we are moving rapidly because the situation demands it,” he said on the Senate floor Wednesday after the chamber passed the second coronavirus spending bill.Hanging over Congress' head is the revelation that two members had been infected with the coronavirus, adding to the need to act quickly as more and more lawmakers could be forced to stay home.Reps.

Tom Emmer, R-Minn., sent Republican House members a memo that ran through some suggested “best practices” on issues like fundraising, public events and communications. Lally Doerrer, right, and Katharine Hildebrand watch Joe Biden during his Illinois virtual town hall in Chicago on March 13, 2020.Charles Rex Arbogast / APSome of that guidance mimics what the DCCC told their members — the NRCC suggests limiting grassroots events, shifting field work to phone canvassing and launching tele-town halls. On fundraising, Emmer cautioned that candidates should continue to fundraise but “be sensitive that your donors may have suffered financial losses during this pandemic” and ask their donors how they are holding up in light of the crisis. Emmer specifically asked members to reconsider “snarky” comments and be sure not to spread misinformation. “At times like this you need to ask yourself if your press release or snarky comment are in poor taste,” Emmer wrote. “If you share information on the coronavirus, do it from trusted sources like the Center for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services. Do not spread misinformation from politicized news stories.” Chris Pack, the NRCC’s communications director, told NBC that the campaign arm sent additional guidance to non-incumbent candidates. Emmer left his member with this: “Do not get complacent. Use common sense, but put the health of yourself, your campaign staff and volunteers, and constituents at the forefront of every decision,” he wrote. Share this -Marianna Sotomayor and Gary Grumbach 1d ago / 4:22 PM UTCBiden, Sanders campaigns ramping down ad spending amid coronavirus spreadWASHINGTON – With the coronavirus outbreak prompting several states to postpone their primary elections, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Independent Sen.

Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2. He directed the state elections board to come up with a plan to conduct a June primary ""in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process."" But Hogan added that while the election board told him it couldn't shift the entire state to vote-by-mail in time for the April primary to go on as scheduled, he felt it was ""imperative that the people of the seventh congressional district have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress.""

Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy.

Tom Emmer, R-Minn., sent Republican House members a memo that ran through some suggested “best practices” on issues like fundraising, public events and communications. Lally Doerrer, right, and Katharine Hildebrand watch Joe Biden during his Illinois virtual town hall in Chicago on March 13, 2020.Charles Rex Arbogast / APSome of that guidance mimics what the DCCC told their members — the NRCC suggests limiting grassroots events, shifting field work to phone canvassing and launching tele-town halls. On fundraising, Emmer cautioned that candidates should continue to fundraise but “be sensitive that your donors may have suffered financial losses during this pandemic” and ask their donors how they are holding up in light of the crisis. Emmer specifically asked members to reconsider “snarky” comments and be sure not to spread misinformation. “At times like this you need to ask yourself if your press release or snarky comment are in poor taste,” Emmer wrote. “If you share information on the coronavirus, do it from trusted sources like the Center for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services. Do not spread misinformation from politicized news stories.” Chris Pack, the NRCC’s communications director, told NBC that the campaign arm sent additional guidance to non-incumbent candidates.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump. They also rolled out new Spanish-language ads in Florida, Arizona and Illinois discussing Biden’s records on guns, healthcare and the need for leadership to prevent future global panic like the one caused by coronavirus.Unite the Country, the Super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy, will also not be on the airwaves or on digital in the coming weeks as they focus on expanding their group with sights set on the general election, Steve Schale, a top strategist for the group, told NBC News. After projected losses in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries on Tuesday night, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that Sanders ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign"" but that ""In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""Through March 10, before the campaign was completely upended by coronavirus, the Sanders campaign had significantly outspent the Biden campaign on the television and radio airwaves—$42.2 million to $14.6 million respectively. —Mike Memoli contributed. Share this - Ben Kamisar and Kyle Stewart2d ago / 4:53 PM UTCWhile Maryland delays primary, special election to replace Cummings will stay as mail-in onlyWASHINGTON — As Maryland delays most primary elections from late April to early June in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the state will not push back the special election aimed at replacing the late Rep.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are turning their attention to the latest emergency spending bill as the economic impact of the coronavirus intensifies, racing to reach a deal on what could be the largest stimulus package in American history.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is expected to unveil the Republican stimulus proposal later Thursday that includes a number of economic relief measures for small businesses, industries and direct cash payments for some Americans.During a closed-door lunch meeting with Republican senators Thursday, there was some opposition from Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to President Donald Trump’s request for $500 billion to be used for direct payouts. It is unlikely that Graham alone could stall the negotiations, as multiple Republican senators appeared comfortable with a proposal for cash payments capped at a certain income level.McConnell: 'Congress has an enormous role to play' in coronavirus responseMarch 18, 202002:03Graham appeared to come around, however, later tweeting that he was ""willing to pay 75 percent of people's income up to $80,000 to get us through.""“These are not ordinary policies, this is no ordinary time,” McConnell said, speaking on the Senate floor Thursday.McConnell is expected to open up negotiations with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., later Thursday.But much about the bill is still unknown. It is unclear who would qualify for direct payments, what the dollar amount might be and how Americans would receive the money, among other unanswered questions.Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Thursday that the White House wanted to send $1,000 to adults and $500 per child, but did not elaborate on any potential restrictions, such as income caps. Mnuchin told Fox Business he hoped a first round of payments would go out within the next three weeks if Congress approves a plan quickly, with the possibility of a second round of payments if the crisis is still ongoing in six weeks.Schumer said that Democratic support would be contingent on greater levels of aid than the White House had already suggested, paired with other economic relief efforts for workers.“That [amount suggested by the White House] might help families cover rent, groceries for a month, but then what?"" Schumer said Thursday. “If we are going to do it, it's got to be bigger, more generous and more frequent than what I’ve heard.""Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceMcConnell said he wanted to reach a consensus on the bill among his Republican colleagues before negotiating with Democrats.Some Republicans, such as Graham, have expressed skepticism over direct cash payments and suggested that more resources ought to be directed at helping small businesses meet payroll.Other Senate Republicans, including Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rick Scott of Florida, have taken issue with the White House's proposal to include industry bailouts for airlines and other stressed sectors.""If you’re coming to me and asking for just a bunch of taxpayer money, just give it to us, I’m not going to be for that,"" Hawley said Wednesday.Top Obama & Clinton economist: U.S. is in a 'great worker recession'March 19, 202001:49Some lawmakers have floated their own proposals, jockeying to have their priorities reflected in the final plan.Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Marco Rubio of Florida announced Wednesday they were working on a proposal to give more aid to small businesses.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has proposed giving $2,000 to every adult and $1,000 per child until the coronavirus crisis ends.McConnell's decision to keep Democrats out of the initial round of discussions frustrated some lawmakers, who pointed out that previous coronavirus spending bills had included direct negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Mnuchin.Still, it hasn't kept Democrats from opening up their own dialogue with the White House. Both Pelosi and Schumer have spoken with Mnuchin multiple times in the past few days about the third coronavirus bill.“We are ready and eager to look at what Republicans have put together, and work with them. But we believe whatever proposal emerges — and it will be bipartisan — it must be a 'workers first' proposal,” Schumer said Thursday.McConnell expressed optimism Wednesday that his party could reach a consensus quickly. ""Republicans hope, shortly, to have a consolidated position along with the administration and we intend to sit down with our Democratic colleagues, see what we can agree to,"" he said.The majority leader, who has stressed the need to act quickly, could unveil his starting-point proposal as early as Thursday. But even then, Democrats would need to come to an agreement and the bill would need to be put into legislative language.Senators said they expected to work through the weekend and hoped to hold a vote the following week.On Wednesday, McConnell advised members to stay close.“Just how long it will take to get through these steps is unclear, but as everyone knows we are moving rapidly because the situation demands it,” he said on the Senate floor Wednesday after the chamber passed the second coronavirus spending bill.Hanging over Congress' head is the revelation that two members had been infected with the coronavirus, adding to the need to act quickly as more and more lawmakers could be forced to stay home.Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, announced Wednesday they had tested positive, forcing some lawmakers who had been in close contact with them to self-quarantine.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., announced Thursday morning that the House would not return to session until they are ready to vote on the emergency bill.",Negotiations heat up on $1 trillion coronavirus bill,Mar 19 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/negotiations-heat-1-trillion-coronavirus-bill-would-include-cash-payments-n1163826,nbc

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump. They also rolled out new Spanish-language ads in Florida, Arizona and Illinois discussing Biden’s records on guns, healthcare and the need for leadership to prevent future global panic like the one caused by coronavirus.Unite the Country, the Super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy, will also not be on the airwaves or on digital in the coming weeks as they focus on expanding their group with sights set on the general election, Steve Schale, a top strategist for the group, told NBC News. After projected losses in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries on Tuesday night, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that Sanders ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign"" but that ""In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""Through March 10, before the campaign was completely upended by coronavirus, the Sanders campaign had significantly outspent the Biden campaign on the television and radio airwaves—$42.2 million to $14.6 million respectively. —Mike Memoli contributed. Share this -Ben Kamisar and Kyle Stewart2d ago / 4:53 PM UTCWhile Maryland delays primary, special election to replace Cummings will stay as mail-in onlyWASHINGTON — As Maryland delays most primary elections from late April to early June in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the state will not push back the special election aimed at replacing the late Rep. Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2. He directed the state elections board to come up with a plan to conduct a June primary ""in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process."" But Hogan added that while the election board told him it couldn't shift the entire state to vote-by-mail in time for the April primary to go on as scheduled, he felt it was ""imperative that the people of the seventh congressional district have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress."" That's why he decided to keep that district's primary on schedule. Maryland's 7th Congressional District has been vacant since Cummings died on Oct. 17, 2019. The state held a special primary for the seat on Feb. 5, with former Democrat Rep.

The lighter security footprint allowed Biden to engage in the type of one-on-one, retail-oriented campaigning he preferred, especially in the early-voting states where voters place a premium on it.Campaign officials have long been concerned about his safety given his high profile as a former vice president and the highly partisan environment. A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course. He first became a protectee of the agency in August 2008 when Barack Obama chose him as his vice presidential running mate. He and his family had a security detail throughout his eight years as vice president, and Biden for several additional months after he left office in 2017. Share this -Ben Kamisar3d ago / 3:08 PM UTCIllinois governor backs Biden for presidentWASHINGTON — Illinois Democratic Gov.

Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders. In recent weeks Biden has earned 11 endorsements from former 2020 Democratic candidates, but Warren has notably sat out on backing the two final contenders in the primary race.While Biden said supporting Warren’s plan is one area for finding common ground with the Vermont senator, Sanders has often attacked Biden for his support for the 2005 bankruptcy bill. He often brought it up as a consequential stain in Biden’s Senate record alongside his support of the Iraq War and trade deals.“The fact of the matter is I'm not beholding to the banks. I supported the bankruptcy bill because I believed taking a very bad bill was going to pass overwhelmingly and make it better made sense,” Biden said in a July 2019 speech where he defended controversial parts of his record that had come under attack by his opponents.The Biden campaign told NBC News that Biden, who recently reviewed Warren’s plan, will likely speak more about why he supports her proposals at Sunday’s Democratic debate.Share this -Marianna Sotomayor5d ago / 4:22 PM UTCBiden's first virtual event encounters technological glitchesWASHINGTON — The virtual campaign is proving a bit complicated, after a Friday event for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign encountered some technological glitches. Biden is the first Democratic candidate to hold a virtual town hall due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 and public events. The attempt to broadcast the first of two scheduled “virtual events” in the next several days involved a garbled-voiced Biden and ended roughly four minutes after the Facebook Live video began streaming in Illinois.The former vice president acknowledged the issues while ending the livestream.“Well, I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections, but there is a lot more to say and I’ve probably already said too much,” Biden said. But the appetite for these events appears to be there — the short event garnered more than 5,000 viewers. On Saturday morning, the campaign released a link to a full, updated video without the technical glitches.Much of the event focused on Biden explaining how he'd work to respond and recover the country from pandemics. He also tried to downplay the need for panic and outlined ways in which everyone can take precautions to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while still connecting to people.“Campaign events are no exception that’s why we’re connecting virtually today.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump. They also rolled out new Spanish-language ads in Florida, Arizona and Illinois discussing Biden’s records on guns, healthcare and the need for leadership to prevent future global panic like the one caused by coronavirus.Unite the Country, the Super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy, will also not be on the airwaves or on digital in the coming weeks as they focus on expanding their group with sights set on the general election, Steve Schale, a top strategist for the group, told NBC News. After projected losses in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries on Tuesday night, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that Sanders ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign"" but that ""In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""Through March 10, before the campaign was completely upended by coronavirus, the Sanders campaign had significantly outspent the Biden campaign on the television and radio airwaves—$42.2 million to $14.6 million respectively. —Mike Memoli contributed. Share this - Ben Kamisar and Kyle Stewart2d ago / 4:53 PM UTCWhile Maryland delays primary, special election to replace Cummings will stay as mail-in onlyWASHINGTON — As Maryland delays most primary elections from late April to early June in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the state will not push back the special election aimed at replacing the late Rep. Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2. He directed the state elections board to come up with a plan to conduct a June primary ""in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process."" But Hogan added that while the election board told him it couldn't shift the entire state to vote-by-mail in time for the April primary to go on as scheduled, he felt it was ""imperative that the people of the seventh congressional district have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress."" That's why he decided to keep that district's primary on schedule. Maryland's 7th Congressional District has been vacant since Cummings died on Oct. 17, 2019. The state held a special primary for the seat on Feb. 5, with former Democrat Rep. Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik, a member of the Baltimore County Republican Central Committee, moving onto the special general election. Share this - Pete Williams, Dan Gallo and Mike Memoli2d ago / 1:45 PM UTCBiden under Secret Service protection againWILMINGTON, Del. — After a nearly three year hiatus, Joe Biden is once again a protectee of the United States Secret Service.A protective detail began its assignment with the former vice president and Democratic front-runner this week, multiple law enforcement officials told NBC News, even as Biden is expected to remain off the campaign trail amid the coronavirus crisis. The Biden campaign's formal request for Secret Service protection was submitted last week to senior congressional officials, who by law consult with the secretary of Homeland Security to consider if candidates should receive security from the elite law enforcement agency.Anti-dairy industry protestors are pulled from the stage as Democratic U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at his Super Tuesday night rally in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 3, 2020.Kyle Grillot / ReutersSince kicking off his campaign last April, Biden has had minimal security on the campaign trail — one private security guard often supplemented by local law enforcement from jurisdictions where he campaigned. The lighter security footprint allowed Biden to engage in the type of one-on-one, retail-oriented campaigning he preferred, especially in the early-voting states where voters place a premium on it.Campaign officials have long been concerned about his safety given his high profile as a former vice president and the highly partisan environment. A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course. He first became a protectee of the agency in August 2008 when Barack Obama chose him as his vice presidential running mate. He and his family had a security detail throughout his eight years as vice president, and Biden for several additional months after he left office in 2017. Share this - Ben Kamisar3d ago / 3:08 PM UTCIllinois governor backs Biden for presidentWASHINGTON — Illinois Democratic Gov.

Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders. In recent weeks Biden has earned 11 endorsements from former 2020 Democratic candidates, but Warren has notably sat out on backing the two final contenders in the primary race.While Biden said supporting Warren’s plan is one area for finding common ground with the Vermont senator, Sanders has often attacked Biden for his support for the 2005 bankruptcy bill. He often brought it up as a consequential stain in Biden’s Senate record alongside his support of the Iraq War and trade deals.“The fact of the matter is I'm not beholding to the banks. I supported the bankruptcy bill because I believed taking a very bad bill was going to pass overwhelmingly and make it better made sense,” Biden said in a July 2019 speech where he defended controversial parts of his record that had come under attack by his opponents.The Biden campaign told NBC News that Biden, who recently reviewed Warren’s plan, will likely speak more about why he supports her proposals at Sunday’s Democratic debate.Share this - Marianna Sotomayor5d ago / 4:22 PM UTCBiden's first virtual event encounters technological glitchesWASHINGTON — The virtual campaign is proving a bit complicated, after a Friday event for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign encountered some technological glitches. Biden is the first Democratic candidate to hold a virtual town hall due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 and public events. The attempt to broadcast the first of two scheduled “virtual events” in the next several days involved a garbled-voiced Biden and ended roughly four minutes after the Facebook Live video began streaming in Illinois.The former vice president acknowledged the issues while ending the livestream.“Well, I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections, but there is a lot more to say and I’ve probably already said too much,” Biden said. But the appetite for these events appears to be there — the short event garnered more than 5,000 viewers. On Saturday morning, the campaign released a link to a full, updated video without the technical glitches.Much of the event focused on Biden explaining how he'd work to respond and recover the country from pandemics. He also tried to downplay the need for panic and outlined ways in which everyone can take precautions to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while still connecting to people.“Campaign events are no exception that’s why we’re connecting virtually today.

Tom Emmer, R-Minn., sent Republican House members a memo that ran through some suggested “best practices” on issues like fundraising, public events and communications. Lally Doerrer, right, and Katharine Hildebrand watch Joe Biden during his Illinois virtual town hall in Chicago on March 13, 2020.Charles Rex Arbogast / APSome of that guidance mimics what the DCCC told their members — the NRCC suggests limiting grassroots events, shifting field work to phone canvassing and launching tele-town halls. On fundraising, Emmer cautioned that candidates should continue to fundraise but “be sensitive that your donors may have suffered financial losses during this pandemic” and ask their donors how they are holding up in light of the crisis. Emmer specifically asked members to reconsider “snarky” comments and be sure not to spread misinformation. “At times like this you need to ask yourself if your press release or snarky comment are in poor taste,” Emmer wrote. “If you share information on the coronavirus, do it from trusted sources like the Center for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services. Do not spread misinformation from politicized news stories.” Chris Pack, the NRCC’s communications director, told NBC that the campaign arm sent additional guidance to non-incumbent candidates. Emmer left his member with this: “Do not get complacent.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump. They also rolled out new Spanish-language ads in Florida, Arizona and Illinois discussing Biden’s records on guns, healthcare and the need for leadership to prevent future global panic like the one caused by coronavirus.Unite the Country, the Super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy, will also not be on the airwaves or on digital in the coming weeks as they focus on expanding their group with sights set on the general election, Steve Schale, a top strategist for the group, told NBC News. After projected losses in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries on Tuesday night, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that Sanders ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign"" but that ""In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""Through March 10, before the campaign was completely upended by coronavirus, the Sanders campaign had significantly outspent the Biden campaign on the television and radio airwaves—$42.2 million to $14.6 million respectively. —Mike Memoli contributed. Share this -Ben Kamisar and Kyle Stewart3d ago / 4:53 PM UTCWhile Maryland delays primary, special election to replace Cummings will stay as mail-in onlyWASHINGTON — As Maryland delays most primary elections from late April to early June in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the state will not push back the special election aimed at replacing the late Rep. Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2.

A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course. He first became a protectee of the agency in August 2008 when Barack Obama chose him as his vice presidential running mate.

Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders. In recent weeks Biden has earned 11 endorsements from former 2020 Democratic candidates, but Warren has notably sat out on backing the two final contenders in the primary race.While Biden said supporting Warren’s plan is one area for finding common ground with the Vermont senator, Sanders has often attacked Biden for his support for the 2005 bankruptcy bill.

Do not spread misinformation from politicized news stories.” Chris Pack, the NRCC’s communications director, told NBC that the campaign arm sent additional guidance to non-incumbent candidates.

Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2. He directed the state elections board to come up with a plan to conduct a June primary ""in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process."" But Hogan added that while the election board told him it couldn't shift the entire state to vote-by-mail in time for the April primary to go on as scheduled, he felt it was ""imperative that the people of the seventh congressional district have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress."" That's why he decided to keep that district's primary on schedule. Maryland's 7th Congressional District has been vacant since Cummings died on Oct. 17, 2019.

The lighter security footprint allowed Biden to engage in the type of one-on-one, retail-oriented campaigning he preferred, especially in the early-voting states where voters place a premium on it.Campaign officials have long been concerned about his safety given his high profile as a former vice president and the highly partisan environment. A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course. He first became a protectee of the agency in August 2008 when Barack Obama chose him as his vice presidential running mate. He and his family had a security detail throughout his eight years as vice president, and Biden for several additional months after he left office in 2017. Share this - Ben Kamisar4d ago / 3:08 PM UTCIllinois governor backs Biden for presidentWASHINGTON — Illinois Democratic Gov.

Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump. They also rolled out new Spanish-language ads in Florida, Arizona and Illinois discussing Biden’s records on guns, healthcare and the need for leadership to prevent future global panic like the one caused by coronavirus.Unite the Country, the Super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy, will also not be on the airwaves or on digital in the coming weeks as they focus on expanding their group with sights set on the general election, Steve Schale, a top strategist for the group, told NBC News. After projected losses in the Florida, Illinois and Arizona primaries on Tuesday night, Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement that Sanders ""is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign"" but that ""In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""Through March 10, before the campaign was completely upended by coronavirus, the Sanders campaign had significantly outspent the Biden campaign on the television and radio airwaves—$42.2 million to $14.6 million respectively. —Mike Memoli contributed. Share this - Ben Popken, Kevin Collier and Shamar Walters2d ago / 5:03 PM UTCChicago's voting struggles illustrate the challenges of coronavirusChicago voters were turned away for hours at dozens of polling locations that opened without voting machines, adequate cleaning supplies or enough poll workers — acutely illustrating the strain of voting under the threat of coronavirus exposure and mandates for social distancing and disinfecting surfaces. The delays were driven by a shortage of poll workers and the need to move polling equipment to new locations, Noah Praetz, a former director of elections at Cook County, told NBC News, adding that ""probably 60 percent of necessary poll workers” handled things. After 200 polling locations were changed, about 50 precincts didn’t have enough supplies to open, James P. Allen, a spokesman for the city's elections board, told reporters. Locations struggled to find enough workers and went through a large number of replacement judges, he said. By Monday, the number of resignations from judges had risen to “a torrent, a tsunami of calls,” Chicago Board of Elections Chair Marisel Hernandez said.At the end of the day, turnout was slightly over 30 percent in the city in what were “extremely challenging conditions,“ the city’s elections board reported — a steep drop from over 50 percent turnout in 2016 and only a few percentage points above the city’s record-low presidential primary turnout in 2012.Efforts to push alternate means to in-person voting like early voting and voting by mail appeared successful Tuesday, with nearly 600,000 early votes cast and nearly 300,000 ballots sent by mail across the state, compared to about 423,000 early votes and 162,000 mail-in ballots in the 2016 primary, according to the Illinois State Board of Elections.Share this - 2d ago / 3:36 PM UTCBiden sweeps Sanders in 3 states on one of the strangest primary days in recent historyMarch 18, 202005:08Share this - Alex Seitz-Wald2d ago / 3:19 PM UTCLongtime anti-abortion rights Democrat Rep.

Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2. He directed the state elections board to come up with a plan to conduct a June primary ""in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process."" But Hogan added that while the election board told him it couldn't shift the entire state to vote-by-mail in time for the April primary to go on as scheduled, he felt it was ""imperative that the people of the seventh congressional district have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress."" That's why he decided to keep that district's primary on schedule. Maryland's 7th Congressional District has been vacant since Cummings died on Oct. 17, 2019. The state held a special primary for the seat on Feb. 5, with former Democrat Rep. Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik, a member of the Baltimore County Republican Central Committee, moving onto the special general election. Share this -Pete Williams, Dan Gallo and Mike Memoli3d ago / 1:45 PM UTCBiden under Secret Service protection againWILMINGTON, Del. — After a nearly three year hiatus, Joe Biden is once again a protectee of the United States Secret Service.A protective detail began its assignment with the former vice president and Democratic front-runner this week, multiple law enforcement officials told NBC News, even as Biden is expected to remain off the campaign trail amid the coronavirus crisis. The Biden campaign's formal request for Secret Service protection was submitted last week to senior congressional officials, who by law consult with the secretary of Homeland Security to consider if candidates should receive security from the elite law enforcement agency.Anti-dairy industry protestors are pulled from the stage as Democratic U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at his Super Tuesday night rally in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 3, 2020.Kyle Grillot / ReutersSince kicking off his campaign last April, Biden has had minimal security on the campaign trail — one private security guard often supplemented by local law enforcement from jurisdictions where he campaigned. The lighter security footprint allowed Biden to engage in the type of one-on-one, retail-oriented campaigning he preferred, especially in the early-voting states where voters place a premium on it.Campaign officials have long been concerned about his safety given his high profile as a former vice president and the highly partisan environment. A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course. He first became a protectee of the agency in August 2008 when Barack Obama chose him as his vice presidential running mate. He and his family had a security detail throughout his eight years as vice president, and Biden for several additional months after he left office in 2017. Share this -Ben Kamisar4d ago / 3:08 PM UTCIllinois governor backs Biden for presidentWASHINGTON — Illinois Democratic Gov.

Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders. In recent weeks Biden has earned 11 endorsements from former 2020 Democratic candidates, but Warren has notably sat out on backing the two final contenders in the primary race.While Biden said supporting Warren’s plan is one area for finding common ground with the Vermont senator, Sanders has often attacked Biden for his support for the 2005 bankruptcy bill. He often brought it up as a consequential stain in Biden’s Senate record alongside his support of the Iraq War and trade deals.“The fact of the matter is I'm not beholding to the banks. I supported the bankruptcy bill because I believed taking a very bad bill was going to pass overwhelmingly and make it better made sense,” Biden said in a July 2019 speech where he defended controversial parts of his record that had come under attack by his opponents.The Biden campaign told NBC News that Biden, who recently reviewed Warren’s plan, will likely speak more about why he supports her proposals at Sunday’s Democratic debate.Share this -Marianna Sotomayor6d ago / 4:22 PM UTCBiden's first virtual event encounters technological glitchesWASHINGTON — The virtual campaign is proving a bit complicated, after a Friday event for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign encountered some technological glitches. Biden is the first Democratic candidate to hold a virtual town hall due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 and public events. The attempt to broadcast the first of two scheduled “virtual events” in the next several days involved a garbled-voiced Biden and ended roughly four minutes after the Facebook Live video began streaming in Illinois.The former vice president acknowledged the issues while ending the livestream.“Well, I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections, but there is a lot more to say and I’ve probably already said too much,” Biden said. But the appetite for these events appears to be there — the short event garnered more than 5,000 viewers. On Saturday morning, the campaign released a link to a full, updated video without the technical glitches.Much of the event focused on Biden explaining how he'd work to respond and recover the country from pandemics. He also tried to downplay the need for panic and outlined ways in which everyone can take precautions to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while still connecting to people.“Campaign events are no exception that’s why we’re connecting virtually today.

Sanders won 53 percent of Latino voters in Nevada’s caucuses on February 22 and 41 percent in Texas on Super Tuesday. Arizona votes on March 17, along with Florida, Illinois and Ohio.“Joe Biden leads with his heart. He has the compassion and toughness to lead on gun safety. I’ve witnessed him comfort the survivors of gun violence, and I’ve seen him fight for solutions to gun violence — and win. This is the leadership we need in the White House. Joe Biden is the choice for a true gun safety president,” Giffords said in a statement provided to NBC News.""Congresswoman Gabby Giffords is an American hero who embodies the courage and tenacity we need to take on and defeat the gun lobby,"" Biden said in a statement to NBC News. ""I have been proud to work alongside Gabby in the fight to end gun violence and am honored to have her support today.""The endorsement could undergird Biden’s momentum coming off his strong showings in the March 10 primaries.  Giffords’ husband, Mark Kelly, is expected to be the Democratic challenger to Arizona Republican Sen. Martha McSally in one of the highest-profile Senate contests this year.Sanders has come under criticism from Biden and gun control activists for some of his past votes on gun measures, particularly a law that shields gun manufacturers from liability.  As a presidential candidate, Sanders has emphasized his support for universal background checks and his D- minus rating from the NRA.  Giffords and Biden have worked together in the past on gun safety measures, including in the aftermath of the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut where 20 first graders and six educators were killed.

Following Biden's near-30 percentage point margin win in South Carolina on Feb. 29, most of his former primary opponents have endorsed him.In the last week and a half alone, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, and Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kamala Harris of California, and Cory Booker of New Jersey have all rallied for Biden. Mike Bloomberg and John Delaney have also put their support behind him.Other influential politicians who have jumped on board include Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton ally who previously served as Chair of the Democratic National Committee and the governor of Virginia. The only former competitor backing Sanders after his definitive victory in the Nevada caucuses is author Marianne Williamson. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., dropped out of the race last week but she has yet to endorse Biden or Sanders.Those backing Biden and Sanders also vary drastically in their ideologies and policy positions.Since the South Carolina primary, Democratic Reps. Abigail Spanberger, Elissa Slotkin, and Andy Kim — moderates who all flipped their seats from red to blue in the 2018 midterms — have endorsed Biden. Kim is one of several House members who previously endorsed Buttigieg and then transferred his support to Biden after the former South Bend mayor suspended his campaign.While just one member of Congress — Rep. Mark Takano of California — has decided to throw his support behind Sanders since his strong performance in Nevada lifted him into temporary front-runner status, those who backed the Independent Vermont senator prior to the caucuses come from the bluest of districts. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for example, are ardent Sanders campaigners.From the start of his candidacy, Sanders has failed to win over any governors.

He directed the state elections board to come up with a plan to conduct a June primary ""in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process."" But Hogan added that while the election board told him it couldn't shift the entire state to vote-by-mail in time for the April primary to go on as scheduled, he felt it was ""imperative that the people of the seventh congressional district have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress."" That's why he decided to keep that district's primary on schedule. Maryland's 7th Congressional District has been vacant since Cummings died on Oct. 17, 2019. The state held a special primary for the seat on Feb. 5, with former Democrat Rep.

Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden speak before a Democratic presidential primary debate in Charleston, S.C., on Feb. 25, 2020.Matt Rourke / AP fileThe gap in their support has continued to widen as the former vice president racks up primary victories. Following Biden's near-30 percentage point margin win in South Carolina on Feb. 29, most of his former primary opponents have endorsed him.In the last week and a half alone, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, and Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kamala Harris of California, and Cory Booker of New Jersey have all rallied for Biden. Mike Bloomberg and John Delaney have also put their support behind him.Other influential politicians who have jumped on board include Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton ally who previously served as Chair of the Democratic National Committee and the governor of Virginia. The only former competitor backing Sanders after his definitive victory in the Nevada caucuses is author Marianne Williamson. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., dropped out of the race last week but she has yet to endorse Biden or Sanders.Those backing Biden and Sanders also vary drastically in their ideologies and policy positions.Since the South Carolina primary, Democratic Reps. Abigail Spanberger, Elissa Slotkin, and Andy Kim — moderates who all flipped their seats from red to blue in the 2018 midterms — have endorsed Biden. Kim is one of several House members who previously endorsed Buttigieg and then transferred his support to Biden after the former South Bend mayor suspended his campaign.While just one member of Congress — Rep. Mark Takano of California — has decided to throw his support behind Sanders since his strong performance in Nevada lifted him into temporary front-runner status, those who backed the Independent Vermont senator prior to the caucuses come from the bluest of districts. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for example, are ardent Sanders campaigners.From the start of his candidacy, Sanders has failed to win over any governors. Five governors in contrast, have issued formal endorsements for Biden, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer whose state is voting today. Share this -","While Maryland delays primary, special election to replace Cummings will stay as mail-in only",,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1161756,nbc

Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden speak before a Democratic presidential primary debate in Charleston, S.C., on Feb. 25, 2020.Matt Rourke / AP fileThe gap in their support has continued to widen as the former vice president racks up primary victories. Following Biden's near-30 percentage point margin win in South Carolina on Feb. 29, most of his former primary opponents have endorsed him.In the last week and a half alone, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, and Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kamala Harris of California, and Cory Booker of New Jersey have all rallied for Biden. Mike Bloomberg and John Delaney have also put their support behind him.Other influential politicians who have jumped on board include Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton ally who previously served as Chair of the Democratic National Committee and the governor of Virginia. The only former competitor backing Sanders after his definitive victory in the Nevada caucuses is author Marianne Williamson. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., dropped out of the race last week but she has yet to endorse Biden or Sanders.Those backing Biden and Sanders also vary drastically in their ideologies and policy positions.Since the South Carolina primary, Democratic Reps. Abigail Spanberger, Elissa Slotkin, and Andy Kim — moderates who all flipped their seats from red to blue in the 2018 midterms — have endorsed Biden. Kim is one of several House members who previously endorsed Buttigieg and then transferred his support to Biden after the former South Bend mayor suspended his campaign.While just one member of Congress — Rep. Mark Takano of California — has decided to throw his support behind Sanders since his strong performance in Nevada lifted him into temporary front-runner status, those who backed the Independent Vermont senator prior to the caucuses come from the bluest of districts. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for example, are ardent Sanders campaigners.From the start of his candidacy, Sanders has failed to win over any governors. Five governors in contrast, have issued formal endorsements for Biden, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer whose state is voting today. Share this -Ben Kamisar and Melissa Holzberg10d ago / 4:57 PM UTCSanders and Biden scrap on the airwaves in Tuesday's statesWASHINGTON — It may not be super, but as the Democratic race hits the latest round of contests today, Joe Biden is looking to replicate his strong showing on last week's Super Tuesday and widen his delegate lead over Bernie Sanders. The Sanders campaign is outspending Biden on the TV and radio airwaves across the six states that hold their nominating contests today — $2.9 million to Biden's almost $2.2 million, according to Advertising Analytics.

His campaign has spent more than $644,000 to air the ad in states holding votes on Tuesday. The Biden campaign has bristled at those attacks, and has spent almost $200,000 in those states on ads that criticize Sanders for going negative and argue Biden has said he'd expand Medicare and Social Security. Biden's top ads in the states voting Tuesday are different versions of the same spot, which feature former President Obama's praise of Biden as ""an extraordinary man with an extraordinary career in public service."" And Unite Our Country has spent $376,000 in these states on a spot that quotes Biden talking about his campaign, and includes some brief swipes at Sanders (Biden is quoted int he ad saying he wants to ""build on ObamaCare"" instead of scrapping it, and ""Democrats want a nominee who is a Democrat""). Share this -Load More Posts Pete Williams, Dan Gallo and Mike Memoli3d ago / 1:45 PM UTCBiden under Secret Service protection againWILMINGTON, Del. — After a nearly three year hiatus, Joe Biden is once again a protectee of the United States Secret Service.A protective detail began its assignment with the former vice president and Democratic front-runner this week, multiple law enforcement officials told NBC News, even as Biden is expected to remain off the campaign trail amid the coronavirus crisis. The Biden campaign's formal request for Secret Service protection was submitted last week to senior congressional officials, who by law consult with the secretary of Homeland Security to consider if candidates should receive security from the elite law enforcement agency.Anti-dairy industry protestors are pulled from the stage as Democratic U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at his Super Tuesday night rally in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 3, 2020.Kyle Grillot / ReutersSince kicking off his campaign last April, Biden has had minimal security on the campaign trail — one private security guard often supplemented by local law enforcement from jurisdictions where he campaigned.

Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders. In recent weeks Biden has earned 11 endorsements from former 2020 Democratic candidates, but Warren has notably sat out on backing the two final contenders in the primary race.While Biden said supporting Warren’s plan is one area for finding common ground with the Vermont senator, Sanders has often attacked Biden for his support for the 2005 bankruptcy bill. He often brought it up as a consequential stain in Biden’s Senate record alongside his support of the Iraq War and trade deals.“The fact of the matter is I'm not beholding to the banks. I supported the bankruptcy bill because I believed taking a very bad bill was going to pass overwhelmingly and make it better made sense,” Biden said in a July 2019 speech where he defended controversial parts of his record that had come under attack by his opponents.The Biden campaign told NBC News that Biden, who recently reviewed Warren’s plan, will likely speak more about why he supports her proposals at Sunday’s Democratic debate.Share this - Marianna Sotomayor6d ago / 4:22 PM UTCBiden's first virtual event encounters technological glitchesWASHINGTON — The virtual campaign is proving a bit complicated, after a Friday event for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign encountered some technological glitches. Biden is the first Democratic candidate to hold a virtual town hall due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 and public events. The attempt to broadcast the first of two scheduled “virtual events” in the next several days involved a garbled-voiced Biden and ended roughly four minutes after the Facebook Live video began streaming in Illinois.The former vice president acknowledged the issues while ending the livestream.“Well, I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections, but there is a lot more to say and I’ve probably already said too much,” Biden said. But the appetite for these events appears to be there — the short event garnered more than 5,000 viewers. On Saturday morning, the campaign released a link to a full, updated video without the technical glitches.Much of the event focused on Biden explaining how he'd work to respond and recover the country from pandemics. He also tried to downplay the need for panic and outlined ways in which everyone can take precautions to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while still connecting to people.“Campaign events are no exception that’s why we’re connecting virtually today.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump.

Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders. In recent weeks Biden has earned 11 endorsements from former 2020 Democratic candidates, but Warren has notably sat out on backing the two final contenders in the primary race.While Biden said supporting Warren’s plan is one area for finding common ground with the Vermont senator, Sanders has often attacked Biden for his support for the 2005 bankruptcy bill. He often brought it up as a consequential stain in Biden’s Senate record alongside his support of the Iraq War and trade deals.“The fact of the matter is I'm not beholding to the banks. I supported the bankruptcy bill because I believed taking a very bad bill was going to pass overwhelmingly and make it better made sense,” Biden said in a July 2019 speech where he defended controversial parts of his record that had come under attack by his opponents.The Biden campaign told NBC News that Biden, who recently reviewed Warren’s plan, will likely speak more about why he supports her proposals at Sunday’s Democratic debate.Share this -Marianna Sotomayor6d ago / 4:22 PM UTCBiden's first virtual event encounters technological glitchesWASHINGTON — The virtual campaign is proving a bit complicated, after a Friday event for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign encountered some technological glitches. Biden is the first Democratic candidate to hold a virtual town hall due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 and public events. The attempt to broadcast the first of two scheduled “virtual events” in the next several days involved a garbled-voiced Biden and ended roughly four minutes after the Facebook Live video began streaming in Illinois.The former vice president acknowledged the issues while ending the livestream.“Well, I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections, but there is a lot more to say and I’ve probably already said too much,” Biden said. But the appetite for these events appears to be there — the short event garnered more than 5,000 viewers. On Saturday morning, the campaign released a link to a full, updated video without the technical glitches.Much of the event focused on Biden explaining how he'd work to respond and recover the country from pandemics. He also tried to downplay the need for panic and outlined ways in which everyone can take precautions to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while still connecting to people.“Campaign events are no exception that’s why we’re connecting virtually today.

Tom Emmer, R-Minn., sent Republican House members a memo that ran through some suggested “best practices” on issues like fundraising, public events and communications. Lally Doerrer, right, and Katharine Hildebrand watch Joe Biden during his Illinois virtual town hall in Chicago on March 13, 2020.Charles Rex Arbogast / APSome of that guidance mimics what the DCCC told their members — the NRCC suggests limiting grassroots events, shifting field work to phone canvassing and launching tele-town halls. On fundraising, Emmer cautioned that candidates should continue to fundraise but “be sensitive that your donors may have suffered financial losses during this pandemic” and ask their donors how they are holding up in light of the crisis. Emmer specifically asked members to reconsider “snarky” comments and be sure not to spread misinformation. “At times like this you need to ask yourself if your press release or snarky comment are in poor taste,” Emmer wrote. “If you share information on the coronavirus, do it from trusted sources like the Center for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services. Do not spread misinformation from politicized news stories.” Chris Pack, the NRCC’s communications director, told NBC that the campaign arm sent additional guidance to non-incumbent candidates.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change. One area where investments could be made is in digital ads now that most people are turning to video websites like YouTube and Hulu while they work from home.Biden ads featured in states from Michigan to Georgia featured President Barack Obama thanking Biden for his commitment to “Service” and Biden’s call for Democrats to unite in an ad called “Always” to defeat President Donald Trump.

Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2. He directed the state elections board to come up with a plan to conduct a June primary ""in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process."" But Hogan added that while the election board told him it couldn't shift the entire state to vote-by-mail in time for the April primary to go on as scheduled, he felt it was ""imperative that the people of the seventh congressional district have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress."" That's why he decided to keep that district's primary on schedule. Maryland's 7th Congressional District has been vacant since Cummings died on Oct. 17, 2019. The state held a special primary for the seat on Feb. 5, with former Democrat Rep. Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik, a member of the Baltimore County Republican Central Committee, moving onto the special general election. Share this - Pete Williams, Dan Gallo and Mike Memoli3d ago / 1:45 PM UTCBiden under Secret Service protection againWILMINGTON, Del. — After a nearly three year hiatus, Joe Biden is once again a protectee of the United States Secret Service.A protective detail began its assignment with the former vice president and Democratic front-runner this week, multiple law enforcement officials told NBC News, even as Biden is expected to remain off the campaign trail amid the coronavirus crisis. The Biden campaign's formal request for Secret Service protection was submitted last week to senior congressional officials, who by law consult with the secretary of Homeland Security to consider if candidates should receive security from the elite law enforcement agency.Anti-dairy industry protestors are pulled from the stage as Democratic U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at his Super Tuesday night rally in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 3, 2020.Kyle Grillot / ReutersSince kicking off his campaign last April, Biden has had minimal security on the campaign trail — one private security guard often supplemented by local law enforcement from jurisdictions where he campaigned. The lighter security footprint allowed Biden to engage in the type of one-on-one, retail-oriented campaigning he preferred, especially in the early-voting states where voters place a premium on it.Campaign officials have long been concerned about his safety given his high profile as a former vice president and the highly partisan environment. A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course. He first became a protectee of the agency in August 2008 when Barack Obama chose him as his vice presidential running mate. He and his family had a security detail throughout his eight years as vice president, and Biden for several additional months after he left office in 2017. Share this - Ben Kamisar4d ago / 3:08 PM UTCIllinois governor backs Biden for presidentWASHINGTON — Illinois Democratic Gov.

Bernie Sanders are slowing their ad spending to a virtual halt. A Biden campaign spokesman told NBC News there is “no plan right now” to go up with TV or radio ads, largely because their ad strategy focuses on creating ads based on the issues voters in that upcoming primary state find to be most important. Facebook's ad-tracker shows the campaign is still running digital ads on the platform, however. That same tracker shows that Sanders isn't currently running any Facebook ads. And data from Advertising Analytics shows that the Sanders campaign is dark on traditional media too (television and radio). As the Biden campaign continues to iron out the best ways to campaign in this unprecedented time for presidential politics, the spokesman caveated that their current plan for remaining silent on the airwaves could change.

Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2. He directed the state elections board to come up with a plan to conduct a June primary ""in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process."" But Hogan added that while the election board told him it couldn't shift the entire state to vote-by-mail in time for the April primary to go on as scheduled, he felt it was ""imperative that the people of the seventh congressional district have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress."" That's why he decided to keep that district's primary on schedule. Maryland's 7th Congressional District has been vacant since Cummings died on Oct. 17, 2019. The state held a special primary for the seat on Feb. 5, with former Democrat Rep. Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik, a member of the Baltimore County Republican Central Committee, moving onto the special general election. Share this -Pete Williams, Dan Gallo and Mike Memoli3d ago / 1:45 PM UTCBiden under Secret Service protection againWILMINGTON, Del. — After a nearly three year hiatus, Joe Biden is once again a protectee of the United States Secret Service.A protective detail began its assignment with the former vice president and Democratic front-runner this week, multiple law enforcement officials told NBC News, even as Biden is expected to remain off the campaign trail amid the coronavirus crisis. The Biden campaign's formal request for Secret Service protection was submitted last week to senior congressional officials, who by law consult with the secretary of Homeland Security to consider if candidates should receive security from the elite law enforcement agency.Anti-dairy industry protestors are pulled from the stage as Democratic U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at his Super Tuesday night rally in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 3, 2020.Kyle Grillot / ReutersSince kicking off his campaign last April, Biden has had minimal security on the campaign trail — one private security guard often supplemented by local law enforcement from jurisdictions where he campaigned. The lighter security footprint allowed Biden to engage in the type of one-on-one, retail-oriented campaigning he preferred, especially in the early-voting states where voters place a premium on it.Campaign officials have long been concerned about his safety given his high profile as a former vice president and the highly partisan environment. A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course. He first became a protectee of the agency in August 2008 when Barack Obama chose him as his vice presidential running mate. He and his family had a security detail throughout his eight years as vice president, and Biden for several additional months after he left office in 2017. Share this -Ben Kamisar4d ago / 3:08 PM UTCIllinois governor backs Biden for presidentWASHINGTON — Illinois Democratic Gov.

The endorsement also comes as governors across the country are scrambling to respond to the coronavirus outbreak and spread.""As our nation faces some of the biggest challenges of our time, I know Vice President Joe Biden is the right candidate to beat Donald Trump and lead us into a new era.

I trust Joe to lead with his head and heart, to do what's right, and to get things done for the American people.” During Pritzker's successful 2018 bid for governor, Biden praised the billionaire businessman-turned politician during a campaign swing through Illinois. Biden had already received an endorsement from Penny Pritzker, JB's sister who served in the Obama administration as the commerce secretary. Biden already has the endorsement of both Illinois Democratic senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, as well as a handful of other prominent Illinois politicians including Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and eight Democratic members of Congress from the state. —Marianna Sotomayor contributedShare this -Marianna Sotomayor, Ali Vitali and Deepa Shivaram5d ago / 11:08 AM UTCBiden touts support of Warren's bankruptcy reform plan as a bridge to progressivesWASHINGTON — Joe Biden surprised audiences when he announced his support for Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders. In recent weeks Biden has earned 11 endorsements from former 2020 Democratic candidates, but Warren has notably sat out on backing the two final contenders in the primary race.While Biden said supporting Warren’s plan is one area for finding common ground with the Vermont senator, Sanders has often attacked Biden for his support for the 2005 bankruptcy bill. He often brought it up as a consequential stain in Biden’s Senate record alongside his support of the Iraq War and trade deals.“The fact of the matter is I'm not beholding to the banks. I supported the bankruptcy bill because I believed taking a very bad bill was going to pass overwhelmingly and make it better made sense,” Biden said in a July 2019 speech where he defended controversial parts of his record that had come under attack by his opponents.The Biden campaign told NBC News that Biden, who recently reviewed Warren’s plan, will likely speak more about why he supports her proposals at Sunday’s Democratic debate.Share this -Marianna Sotomayor6d ago / 4:22 PM UTCBiden's first virtual event encounters technological glitchesWASHINGTON — The virtual campaign is proving a bit complicated, after a Friday event for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign encountered some technological glitches. Biden is the first Democratic candidate to hold a virtual town hall due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 and public events. The attempt to broadcast the first of two scheduled “virtual events” in the next several days involved a garbled-voiced Biden and ended roughly four minutes after the Facebook Live video began streaming in Illinois.The former vice president acknowledged the issues while ending the livestream.“Well, I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections, but there is a lot more to say and I’ve probably already said too much,” Biden said. But the appetite for these events appears to be there — the short event garnered more than 5,000 viewers. On Saturday morning, the campaign released a link to a full, updated video without the technical glitches.Much of the event focused on Biden explaining how he'd work to respond and recover the country from pandemics. He also tried to downplay the need for panic and outlined ways in which everyone can take precautions to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while still connecting to people.“Campaign events are no exception that’s why we’re connecting virtually today.

Her and Biden in contrast, have spoken “a number of times” during the campaign.Bass also told PBS that Biden’s vice presidency reveals a “historic connection with African Americans,” and that Sanders “does not have a historic connection like that.” She continued to criticize Sanders, saying that if she were to run for president, she would work “years in advance on building ties and building relationships — not just with African Americans — with all communities.”  Share this -Melissa Holzberg8d ago / 6:19 PM UTCSanders will 'wholeheartedly' support Biden if he's the nominee, adviser saysWASHINGTON — Senior adviser to Vermont Sen.

Gabby Giffords during a gun safety forum on Oct. 2, 2019, in Las Vegas.John Locher / AP fileGiffords, who represented a Tucson-area district from 2005-2012, became a nationally recognized gun control activist after she was shot and critically wounded in a mass shooting in Arizona in 2011.  Her endorsement comes ahead of next week's Arizona primary between Biden and Bernie Sanders, whose strength among Latino voters could prove significant in the state. Sanders won 53 percent of Latino voters in Nevada’s caucuses on February 22 and 41 percent in Texas on Super Tuesday. Arizona votes on March 17, along with Florida, Illinois and Ohio.“Joe Biden leads with his heart. He has the compassion and toughness to lead on gun safety. I’ve witnessed him comfort the survivors of gun violence, and I’ve seen him fight for solutions to gun violence — and win. This is the leadership we need in the White House. Joe Biden is the choice for a true gun safety president,” Giffords said in a statement provided to NBC News.""Congresswoman Gabby Giffords is an American hero who embodies the courage and tenacity we need to take on and defeat the gun lobby,"" Biden said in a statement to NBC News. ""I have been proud to work alongside Gabby in the fight to end gun violence and am honored to have her support today.""The endorsement could undergird Biden’s momentum coming off his strong showings in the March 10 primaries.  Giffords’ husband, Mark Kelly, is expected to be the Democratic challenger to Arizona Republican Sen. Martha McSally in one of the highest-profile Senate contests this year.Sanders has come under criticism from Biden and gun control activists for some of his past votes on gun measures, particularly a law that shields gun manufacturers from liability.  As a presidential candidate, Sanders has emphasized his support for universal background checks and his D- minus rating from the NRA.  Giffords and Biden have worked together in the past on gun safety measures, including in the aftermath of the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut where 20 first graders and six educators were killed. Two years later, they sat together off the Senate floor watching as a bill Giffords had fought for to expand background checks failed by five votes.Share this -Liz Brown-Kaiser10d ago / 6:41 PM UTCBiden leads Sanders by dozens of endorsements after big winsWASHINGTON — Since his big win in the South Carolina primary less than two weeks ago, Joe Biden has earned more than 50 endorsements from Democratic governors and members of Congress.That’s compared with just one endorsement for Bernie Sanders since the Vermont senator’s win in the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 22.Overall, Biden has a total of more than 100 endorsements from major Democratic politicians, while Sanders has about ten.Sen.

Following Biden's near-30 percentage point margin win in South Carolina on Feb. 29, most of his former primary opponents have endorsed him.In the last week and a half alone, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, and Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kamala Harris of California, and Cory Booker of New Jersey have all rallied for Biden. Mike Bloomberg and John Delaney have also put their support behind him.Other influential politicians who have jumped on board include Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton ally who previously served as Chair of the Democratic National Committee and the governor of Virginia. The only former competitor backing Sanders after his definitive victory in the Nevada caucuses is author Marianne Williamson. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., dropped out of the race last week but she has yet to endorse Biden or Sanders.Those backing Biden and Sanders also vary drastically in their ideologies and policy positions.Since the South Carolina primary, Democratic Reps. Abigail Spanberger, Elissa Slotkin, and Andy Kim — moderates who all flipped their seats from red to blue in the 2018 midterms — have endorsed Biden. Kim is one of several House members who previously endorsed Buttigieg and then transferred his support to Biden after the former South Bend mayor suspended his campaign.While just one member of Congress — Rep. Mark Takano of California — has decided to throw his support behind Sanders since his strong performance in Nevada lifted him into temporary front-runner status, those who backed the Independent Vermont senator prior to the caucuses come from the bluest of districts. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for example, are ardent Sanders campaigners.From the start of his candidacy, Sanders has failed to win over any governors.

Elijah Cummings.Instead, that election will go on as scheduled, but all voters will cast their ballot by mail. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan made the announcement Tuesday as part of the larger decision to shift the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2. He directed the state elections board to come up with a plan to conduct a June primary ""in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process."" But Hogan added that while the election board told him it couldn't shift the entire state to vote-by-mail in time for the April primary to go on as scheduled, he felt it was ""imperative that the people of the seventh congressional district have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress."" That's why he decided to keep that district's primary on schedule. Maryland's 7th Congressional District has been vacant since Cummings died on Oct. 17, 2019. The state held a special primary for the seat on Feb. 5, with former Democrat Rep.

Her and Biden in contrast, have spoken “a number of times” during the campaign.Bass also told PBS that Biden’s vice presidency reveals a “historic connection with African Americans,” and that Sanders “does not have a historic connection like that.” She continued to criticize Sanders, saying that if she were to run for president, she would work “years in advance on building ties and building relationships — not just with African Americans — with all communities.”  Share this -Melissa Holzberg8d ago / 6:19 PM UTCSanders will 'wholeheartedly' support Biden if he's the nominee, adviser saysWASHINGTON — Senior adviser to Vermont Sen.

Sanders won 53 percent of Latino voters in Nevada’s caucuses on February 22 and 41 percent in Texas on Super Tuesday. Arizona votes on March 17, along with Florida, Illinois and Ohio.“Joe Biden leads with his heart. He has the compassion and toughness to lead on gun safety. I’ve witnessed him comfort the survivors of gun violence, and I’ve seen him fight for solutions to gun violence — and win.

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kamala Harris of California, and Cory Booker of New Jersey have all rallied for Biden. Mike Bloomberg and John Delaney have also put their support behind him.Other influential politicians who have jumped on board include Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton ally who previously served as Chair of the Democratic National Committee and the governor of Virginia. The only former competitor backing Sanders after his definitive victory in the Nevada caucuses is author Marianne Williamson. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., dropped out of the race last week but she has yet to endorse Biden or Sanders.Those backing Biden and Sanders also vary drastically in their ideologies and policy positions.Since the South Carolina primary, Democratic Reps. Abigail Spanberger, Elissa Slotkin, and Andy Kim — moderates who all flipped their seats from red to blue in the 2018 midterms — have endorsed Biden. Kim is one of several House members who previously endorsed Buttigieg and then transferred his support to Biden after the former South Bend mayor suspended his campaign.While just one member of Congress — Rep. Mark Takano of California — has decided to throw his support behind Sanders since his strong performance in Nevada lifted him into temporary front-runner status, those who backed the Independent Vermont senator prior to the caucuses come from the bluest of districts. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for example, are ardent Sanders campaigners.From the start of his candidacy, Sanders has failed to win over any governors.

But Biden's effort has been boosted by spending from his allied super PAC, Unite the Country. Both campaigns are spending the most in Michigan — Sanders and Biden have spent about $1.2 million each, with Unite the Country spending another almost $400,000.  The Biden campaign and his super PAC have also run ads in Missouri and Mississippi, but neither have spent a cent on TV or radio ads in Washington, Idaho and North Dakota.The Sanders campaign, by comparison, has gone up on the airwaves in all six states voting Tuesday. Sanders' top ad across these states, according to Advertising Analytics data, is one that attacks Biden on social security by using audio from a speech in 1995 where he called for a spending freeze across the government. His campaign has spent more than $644,000 to air the ad in states holding votes on Tuesday. The Biden campaign has bristled at those attacks, and has spent almost $200,000 in those states on ads that criticize Sanders for going negative and argue Biden has said he'd expand Medicare and Social Security. Biden's top ads in the states voting Tuesday are different versions of the same spot, which feature former President Obama's praise of Biden as ""an extraordinary man with an extraordinary career in public service."" And Unite Our Country has spent $376,000 in these states on a spot that quotes Biden talking about his campaign, and includes some brief swipes at Sanders (Biden is quoted int he ad saying he wants to ""build on ObamaCare"" instead of scrapping it, and ""Democrats want a nominee who is a Democrat""). Share this -Load More Posts Pete Williams, Dan Gallo and Mike Memoli3d ago / 1:45 PM UTCBiden under Secret Service protection againWILMINGTON, Del. — After a nearly three year hiatus, Joe Biden is once again a protectee of the United States Secret Service.A protective detail began its assignment with the former vice president and Democratic front-runner this week, multiple law enforcement officials told NBC News, even as Biden is expected to remain off the campaign trail amid the coronavirus crisis. The Biden campaign's formal request for Secret Service protection was submitted last week to senior congressional officials, who by law consult with the secretary of Homeland Security to consider if candidates should receive security from the elite law enforcement agency.Anti-dairy industry protestors are pulled from the stage as Democratic U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at his Super Tuesday night rally in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 3, 2020.Kyle Grillot / ReutersSince kicking off his campaign last April, Biden has had minimal security on the campaign trail — one private security guard often supplemented by local law enforcement from jurisdictions where he campaigned. The lighter security footprint allowed Biden to engage in the type of one-on-one, retail-oriented campaigning he preferred, especially in the early-voting states where voters place a premium on it.Campaign officials have long been concerned about his safety given his high profile as a former vice president and the highly partisan environment. A high-profile incident in California this month, when a pair of dairy protestors stormed the stage as Biden celebrated a string of victories on Super Tuesday, pushed congressional Democrats publicly and Biden’s campaign privately to seek more rigorous protection.Biden is not a stranger to Secret Service protection, of course. He first became a protectee of the agency in August 2008 when Barack Obama chose him as his vice presidential running mate. He and his family had a security detail throughout his eight years as vice president, and Biden for several additional months after he left office in 2017. Share this - Ben Kamisar4d ago / 3:08 PM UTCIllinois governor backs Biden for presidentWASHINGTON — Illinois Democratic Gov.

Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan during a virtual town hall, an issue both famously sparred over in public 15 years ago. In his first virtual appearance before voters since cancelling public events to mitigate coronavirus concerns, the former vice president told a questioner from Illinois that one of the ways he would win over Bernie Sanders supporters is by coming to agreement on “a whole range of things” they’re both passionate about reforming, including bankruptcy.Elizabeth Warren speaks as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders listen at the seventh Democratic 2020 presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Jan. 14, 2020.Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file“For example, one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on — I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal,” he said during the Friday evening livestream. “Allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy. Provides for a whole range of other issues that allows us in fact impact on how people are dealing with their circumstances.”Biden’s full throttled backing of the proposal is a notable shift from the position he held while serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced Warren, then a Harvard professor, in a hearing to debate the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCA). Warren laid out her case against why the bill that Biden supported was unfair because it made it harder for people to file for bankruptcy. The bill was ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush.Warren outlined how she would undo parts of BAPCA in a Medium article posted in January when both were seeking the presidential nomination. While Warren campaign allies did not respond to questions about Biden’s newfound support for her plan, former staff members took to social media to encourage any candidate adopt her plan.“Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it — everyone,” Warren’s former social media director wrote in a tweet.Elizabeth Warren did the homework, now *please* copy it—everyone! https://t.co/bNmGaCxKq1— Anastasia Golovashkina (@golovashkina) March 14, 2020  The timing of Biden’s endorsement comes as the former vice president is trying to unite all Democrats, including the most progressive wings of the party, as he faces off with Sanders. In recent weeks Biden has earned 11 endorsements from former 2020 Democratic candidates, but Warren has notably sat out on backing the two final contenders in the primary race.While Biden said supporting Warren’s plan is one area for finding common ground with the Vermont senator, Sanders has often attacked Biden for his support for the 2005 bankruptcy bill.

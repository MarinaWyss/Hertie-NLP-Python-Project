"President Donald Trump on Friday announced a new series of measures to combat the coronavirus and treat those who are affected, while pushing back on criticism that his administration was unprepared to confront the pandemic.Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Trump declared a national emergency that could free up $50 billion to help fight the pandemic and said that he was empowering the secretary of Health and Human Services to waive certain laws and regulations to ensure the virus can be contained and patients treated.""To unleash the full power of the federal government … I am officially declaring a national emergency,"" Trump said.""Two very big words,"" he added.Trump said the action would ""open up access"" to up to $50 billion ""for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.""Flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top federal officials and corporate executives from companies such as Walmart, Trump said that the ability to waive certain laws and regulations would allow for easier admission to nursing homes and end limits on the length of hospital stays and the number of beds available.Trump: We are in 'very strong shape' to provide necessary coronavirus testsMarch 13, 202002:35He announced that 1.4 million new tests for the coronavirus would be available next week and that 5 million would be available within the next month — although he added that ""I doubt we'll need that"" quantity. He also said there were plans to allow ""drive-thru"" virus tests.In an unusual and lengthy news conference, a parade of business leaders took turns speaking after Trump — before the president and other federal officials made additional key announcements related to the administration’s coronavirus response.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakTrump shook hands with several of those business leaders as he introduced them at the lectern — a breach of best practices recommended by public health experts across the United States.After the corporate leaders spoke, Trump and other officials finally announced additional measures to confront the pandemic, which included the waiving of interest on federal student loans and the purchase of “large quantities” of oil for the U.S. strategic oil reserve. Officials also said they would be offering guidance to suspend all visitations to nursing homes, with exceptions being made only for end-of-life situations.Nevertheless, the stock market — which had in recent days fallen 20 percent from its latest high, delving formally to bear territory — reacted favorably to the announcement.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose steadily as Trump spoke and closed for the day up nearly 2,000 points, or 9.4 percent.Trump, seen in photographs to have been in close proximity with people who have since tested positive for the coronavirus, also suggested Friday he would “most likely” get tested for the disease.Let our news meet your inbox.

Plans for the emergency declaration were first reported by Bloomberg News.Under the Stafford Act, an ""infectious disease emergency declaration"" by the president would allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide disaster relief funding to state and local governments, as well as federal assistance to support the coronavirus response. The law allows the agency to circumvent legal barriers to more quickly distribute such aid.Emergency declarations are most often used in the event of natural disasters, but can also be applied to disease outbreaks.The president had tweeted earlier about the Friday press conference amid the rapid spread of the virus and as the White House has scrambled to craft a strategy to shift Trump's response to the outbreak, which had been focused on downplaying the threat and accusing the media of creating undue concern.Trump has come under increasing fire in recent weeks over his response to the outbreak while his administration weathered criticism for the lack of coronavirus testing being done compared with other countries.Asked Friday at his press conference by NBC News’ Kristen Welker whether he should take responsibility for the failure to disseminate larger quantities of tests earlier, Trump declined.""I don't take responsibility at all,” he said.Trump also responded testily to a question from another reporter about a decision made by the administration in 2018 to disband the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense — a unit sometimes referred to as the White House pandemic office.Trump called the question “nasty” and replied, “I didn’t do it.”“You say we did that, I don't know anything about it,” Trump said.In addition to having insisted for weeks that he had the outbreak under control, Trump has also propagated personal beliefs about the coronavirus that contradict those of veteran health officials and experts.As panic began to set in over the outbreak, Trump tried to quell the fears of Americans across the country by giving a speech from the Oval Office on Wednesday night. He announced that he would ban many foreign travelers from Europe for the next 30 days and offered a series of economic relief actions to help workers and companies deal with the outbreak. But his speech was met with swift pushback after he misstated several aspects of the policy and failed to propose any new action to combat the outbreak domestically.Health officials in recent days have sounded the alarm, warning the public that the outbreak is likely to get worse. Many major public events, including all NBA, NHL, MLB and Major League Soccer preseason games and Broadway shows, have been canceled this week, and Thursday saw the Dow's worst day since the 1987 crash.Wall Street, however, rallied Friday, bouncing firmly back after lawmakers and the White House appeared close to finalizing an economic relief package to address the coronavirus pandemic.",Trump declares national emergency to combat coronavirus,Mar 13 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-hold-friday-afternoon-press-conference-coronavirus-n1157981,nbc
"With the coronavirus pandemic wreaking havoc on stock markets, sports leagues and everyday life, it comes as no surprise that the presidential race isn't being spared.Enter: the virtual campaign.Say goodbye to big rallies with long lines, smaller meet-and-greets, volunteers knocking on your door. All you'll need now to ""attend"" your favorite candidate's event is an internet-connected device — please do so in your pajamas if you like.""We're in a moment where I think the requirement of having your face out there for campaigns has perhaps faded a little,"" said Rick Wilson, a former GOP consultant.Faced with the very real and rapidly growing fear about the spread of the coronavirus, the remaining candidates — Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders — are doing everything they can to keep their supporters excited without doing so in the large venues that public health experts say is where the virus can be easily spread.Biden, Sanders cancel rallies amid coronavirus concernsMarch 10, 202000:52Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, announced this week that his campaign had changed all of its scheduled coming campaign events to be ""virtual"" with no large crowds attending.That included a previously scheduled event Friday in Chicago and a previously scheduled appearance Monday in Miami. The Chicago event has been recast as a ""virtual town hall."" (Biden also canceled a campaign event that had been scheduled for Thursday in Tampa, Florida, out of concern for public health and replaced it with a speech on the coronavirus epidemic, which he delivered from his hometown, Wilmington, Delaware, and was broadcast online.)Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakWhat exactly those coming virtual campaign events will look like isn't clear, but experts said they're very likely to closely resemble a Biden event on Tuesday.

Campaigns are essentially reaching voters on their computers, tablets and mobile phones as much as they are via school gymnasiums,"" Ferguson added. ""So these changes are just supercharging a phenomenon that had already been happening.""The shift may also help candidates maintain control of their messages and of the events — which can often be disrupted by protesters.In addition, the Biden campaign said Thursday that all employees at the Philadelphia campaign headquarters and in all field offices across the U.S. will work from home starting Saturday. The campaign also said all campaign offices will be closed to the public.The Trump campaign, on the other hand, hasn't unveiled any specific plans for virtual campaign events, although campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told NBC News that because the campaign is ""built on data and uses technology to its highest advantages,"" it is better positioned to ""virtually engage voters than any other campaign.”Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsThe campaign has in recent days canceled or postponed several events that Trump or surrogates had been scheduled to attend. The White House also said a California fundraiser that first lady Melania Trump had been scheduled to attend next Wednesday had been canceled, and the campaign canceled a ""Women for Trump"" bus tour that was supposed to have taken place this week in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as a ""Catholics for Trump"" event that was to have taken place in Milwaukee next Thursday.Murtaugh said the Trump campaign was letting staffers work from home.And Trump Victory, the joint operation between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, said Thursday night that it will shift to ""virtual events"" for volunteer-oriented gatherings.The Sanders campaign, for its part, said Thursday that it would no longer hold ""large events or door-to-door canvasses, instead moving to digital formats and outreach wherever possible.""Mike Casca, the campaign's communications director, added that the campaign had asked all staff to work from home.Sanders has already delivered two speeches — one Wednesday about staying in the presidential race and one Thursday about the coronavirus — that had no audiences.Wilson, the GOP consultant, said it may offer a preview of the future of campaigning.""There are so many tools now to propagate a livestream, so many tools that give you the capacity to watch on your device, to watch your candidate streaming on your tablet, on your phone,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden is winning the delegate race over Bernie Sanders. Now comes the hard part — winning over Sanders' supporters.""Bernie brothers,"" as Biden himself called them at a fundraiser last week, are known for their loyalty to the senator from Vermont and their defections in 2016 to Donald Trump and third-party candidates may have contributed to Hillary Clinton's loss.At the end of their long, bitter primary, Clinton put the onus on Sanders to bring his backers into the fold. To avoid a repeat of four years ago, Biden will likely have to be more proactive and not count on Sanders to do the work unifying the party for him — even if that means the former vice president will have to turn the other cheek to ongoing attacks and rein in his own supporters' desire to gloat or to speed Sanders' exit.Sanders: Our campaign 'won the ideological debate' despite Biden's delegate leadMarch 11, 202004:29Jennifer Palmieri, who was Clinton's communications director four years ago, said Biden needs to give Sanders' campaign space, pay homage to the movement it built, and recognize that attempts to strong-arm the candidate or his supporters will most likely backfire.""You can't force Bernie Sanders supporters to do anything. Even Bernie Sanders can't force Bernie Sanders supporters to do anything,"" she said. ""Letting Sanders determine what's best for his people is probably ultimately what's best for Biden, so long as Sanders supporters are not echoing Trump's arguments.""""Outside pressure, forcing Sanders out of the race, is, I think, a big mistake,"" she added. ""Either Bernie Sanders is going to want to help the Democratic nominee or not. I believe that he does, so then you've got to give that campaign the room to do this the best way they can.""Bernie Sanders vows to stay in race after Joe Biden solidifies delegate leadMarch 11, 202001:30Biden got off on the right foot, she said, by extending the olive branch in a speech after his victories on Tuesday.""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless passion,"" Biden said. ""We share a common goal, and together we'll defeat Donald Trump.""Sanders plans to stay in the race through at least Sunday's debate, the first one-on-one with Biden, when it will become clear how aggressively Sanders plans to go after his rival.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceStill, in a sign of how difficult this will be, some Sanders allies chafed at that sentiment, saying it's too soon to talk about the Vermont senator dropping out since voters in more than half the states have not yet voted.""It's premature and getting off on the wrong foot to stand there and welcome Bernie supporters before Bernie has made a decision about whether to proceed or not,"" said Jonathan Tasini, a progressive activist and former Sanders surrogate. ""I really thought it was tone deaf and actually probably hurt as the first outreach to Bernie Sanders supporters.""Tasini said Biden will need to go beyond rhetoric, adding, ""The price of unity has to be extracting some very specific concessions on big issues that speak to what Bernie supporters want.""But some Biden supporters say Sanders is no position to make any demands. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn went so far as to call on the Democratic National Committee to ""shut this primary down"" and cancel future debates.But that attitude led to walkouts of Sanders supporters at the 2016 convention and thousands of Sanders supporters staying home or voting for Trump.And even if Biden ends up easily winning the party's nomination, it will be because of his perceived ability to beat Trump more than his policy agenda or anything else.""Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,"" Biden said Monday at an event with Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both former rivals for the nomination who have endorsed Biden. ""There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.""Biden is still missing a key pillar of the vaunted Obama coalition that Sanders won — young people — and Sanders also beat him among Latinos in the West.Young voters are a large and growing share of the electorate and are more likely to be progressive than previous generations, but are also more likely to not affiliate themselves with either party, making winning them over ""the 'Manhattan Project' both for the Biden campaign and the party,"" as former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said on MSNBC Wednesday.In Michigan, for instance, a state Biden otherwise won handily, the former vice president lost 3 out of 4 voters aged 18-29. And he lost 30- to 44-year-olds, 54 percent to 42 percent.Four years ago, after it became clear Sanders had no path to winning the Democratic nomination, his campaign shifted its focus to influencing the Democratic Party platform and rules.Working into the wee hours in a hotel ballroom in Orlando, Florida, Sanders and Clinton officials hammered out compromises on everything from the minimum wage to abortion.In the end, Sanders ended up getting almost everything he wanted, which means the low-hanging fruit has already been picked and Biden may need to make concessions on bigger, thornier issues.""We need a vision for this country and for our party. And if it's not 'Medicare for All,' what is it? If it's not a Green New Deal, what is it?"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters on Wednesday. ""There are real electorates that Biden has lost, and I think it's important for the sake of unity that we get real commitments on issues.""Sanders seemed to open the first round of negotiations in public during his remarks Wednesday when he notably refrained from directly criticizing Biden and instead ticked through a litany of policy questions that he intends to ask Biden about at Sunday's debate, including student debt, mass incarceration and immigration.""On Sunday, I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend, Joe Biden. And let me be very frank as to the questions that I will be asking Joe,"" Sanders said.Mainstream Democrats are sure to worry that anything that extends the primary will only end up hurting Biden and helping Trump. And Sanders allies acknowledge there are some members of his coalition that will never come along with Biden, no matter how many progressive activists the ex-VP breaks bread with between now and November.But Ana Maria Archila, the co-executive director of the progressive group Center for Popular Democracy, which backed Sanders, said Biden's electability can only be enhanced by systematically courting progressives.""I don't see how the party is going to be able to defeat a movement candidate — because Donald Trump is a movement candidate — without a movement candidate,"" Archila said. ""So Joe Biden is going to have to do the work.""",Biden's delicate dance to win over the 'Bernie Brothers',Mar 11 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-s-delicate-dance-win-over-bernie-brothers-n1155931,nbc
"The only way to beat President Donald Trump in November is for Democrats to be self-critical about what went wrong in 2016 and fix those mistakes. We failed to connect enough with the working-class voters who should be the backbone of our party. We didn’t get enough young people and voters of color out to the polls. And we underestimated the power of an energized political movement — both on the left and the right.Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and not former Vice President Joe Biden, is the antidote to each of those problems in 2020 — but political pundits have all but declared the Democratic primary over and the latter the winner.RelatedOpinionOpinionBernie Sanders in 2020 is having a rock star moment (literally)That, despite the fact that there are still millions of ballots to be cast and more than 2,300 delegates to be awarded as of Wednesday morning. But they are foolish to dismiss my friend Bernie so easily. Remember this time last year? CNN had him sixth in its rankings of Democratic contenders, and they weren’t alone in counting him out of the top tier. Still, he’s once again proven conventional wisdom wrong and is still very close in the delegate count with Biden — much as he was at this point in 2016.Want more articles like this?

It’s not real voters, but the establishment political class and pundits who worry they’ll lose their privileges and influence. It’s James Carville saying he's ""scared to death"" of Bernie and longtime members of Congress gossiping to CNN about his lack of institutional support.Here’s the truth: Most of those people don’t understand how politics work anymore.RelatedOpinionOpinionHow a socialist candidate can win the U.S. presidential election in 2020Today’s voters don’t care about newspaper endorsements or whom the party leaders most want to work with. They care about who will help them afford health care or take on climate change and they vote accordingly. So let’s listen to the people — the young and the Latino voters Bernie has inspired , the polls that show him beating Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the general election and the 56 of 60 national polls going back more than a year that show Bernie winning the general election. If you’re pragmatic about winning, vote for Bernie.We also hear people say stuff like, “I want someone who gets things done,” because, for the past four years, the media has ignored decades of Bernie’s record. They’ve branded him as a stubborn, uncompromising outsider who puts ideology ahead of results. It’s an easy caricature — and it’s dead wrong.RelatedOpinionOpinionMillennials support socialism because they want to make America great — but for everyoneIn Burlington, Vermont, when he was elected mayor, he led a renaissance by working with people across the political spectrum and was voted one of the best mayors in America by U.S. News and World Report in 1987. And for 30 years in Congress, he’s been a reasonable, respected member . He reached across the aisle to work with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs, and singlehandedly got $11 billion added to the Affordable Care Act for community health clinics in poor areas.Bernie’s values will never change — and that’s a great thing. But he has shown over and over again he’s not naive about how government works. He’s gotten truly meaningful things done.RelatedOpinionOpinionWe want to hear what you THINK. Please submit a letter to the editor.Finally, and most confusingly, we've heard people say, “I want someone with heart and empathy.” I understand the perception that Bernie can sometimes be a curmudgeon and I can’t lie — he’s guilty as charged. But there is also a deep warmth and humanity to both Bernie and his campaign. He connects with real people because he is real.Watch his town halls and see for yourself how people who interact with him react with him. Really watch the next Bernie rally, including the speakers before him. There is a feeling of love in his campaign — a moral argument beyond policy that is unique in our politics. There is a beauty to how he speaks about the power of fighting for someone you don’t know. His campaign has tapped into a humanity in each of us, and that really matters.And one more key point for a lot of Democrats reading: For decades, progressives in our party have come along for the ride when the party nominated a moderate. We worked our butts off for nominees who didn’t fully align with our own vision for the party and the country, because we knew that moderate Democrats were far better than Republican alternatives. Now it’s time for moderates to return the favor.Bernie, not Biden, is the answer to the many of the mistakes we made as a party in 2016. He can reach the working class, inspire young voters and lead a powerful movement to take back the White House. It’s not too late to vote for him to be our party's nominee; this is not remotely over yet.

"It's not Super Tuesday, but there are six more Democratic contests coming up Tuesday. Joe Biden comes to them with a lead over Bernie Sanders in the overall delegate count, thanks to his victories in 10 states last week.Now, Biden has an opportunity to build on his advantage, while Sanders is desperately seeking to put some headline-grabbing wins on the board. Here's my look at the state of play in Tuesday's battlegrounds:1. MichiganDelegates: 125. Type of election: PrimaryThe most symbolically important contest of the day. Sanders won here in 2016 and is pushing hard for a repeat performance.On the heels of a disastrous Super Tuesday, he badly needs to post a victory in a big state like Michigan to prove that he's still a contender. Conversely, a Biden breakthrough in a state that resisted Hillary Clinton in both the primary and general elections would make a powerful statement.Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden set for Michigan showdownMarch 7, 202001:49A Detroit Free Press poll on Monday put Biden up by a whopping 24 points, although Sanders' loyalists are quick to note that pre-primary polling also put Hillary Clinton ahead in 2016.Of more concern for Sanders is his support among white voters without a college degree — a big chunk of Michigan's Democratic electorate. In '16, he won these voters by 15 points in Michigan, key to his overall victory. But in contests so far this year, Sanders hasn't been doing as well with non-college whites. Last Tuesday in Minnesota, for instance, he lost them by 12 points to Biden.Add in Sanders' continuing struggle to attract support from African Americans — about 20 percent of Michigan's primary electorate — and there are some worrying signs for him in what could amount to a must-win state.2. WashingtonDelegates: 89. Type of election: PrimaryThe single most important fact about this contest is that it is a primary, and not a caucus. It matters because Sanders tends to excel in caucus states, with their narrower voting universes, where the most committed activists hold disproportionate sway.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceWashington was a caucus state in 2016, and Sanders romped to a 73 percent to 27 percent win over Clinton, good for a sizable delegate haul. But the state Democratic Party decided to switch to a primary this year — and it looks like a big problem for Sanders.Consider what happened last Tuesday in Minnesota, another state that made the switch to a primary this year. In '16, Sanders rolled up 62 percent in Minnesota's caucuses, but facing a primary electorate this time around, he lost to Biden by 9 points. Notably, Washington also held a nonbinding presidential primary in '16, two months after its caucuses. In that primary, Sanders actually lost to Clinton by 5 points. It didn't count for any delegates, but that result is worth recalling now.Even if Sanders wins Washington's primary, his margin will likely be much narrower than his caucus rout four years ago. And that means that even in victory, his net delegate haul here will be severely reduced, something Sanders can ill afford now that he's playing catchup against Biden.3. MissouriDelegates: 68. Type of election: PrimaryJust two-tenths of a point separated Sanders from victory here in 2016, but now Missouri looms as a big question mark. In other contests so far, Sanders hasn't been performing as well as he did in '16 among blue collar and rural white voters, a significant component of the electorate. For that matter, Sanders also ran particularly well with white college graduates here in '16, a group that surged strongly to Biden on Super Tuesday.Sanders will need deep support from white voters in Missouri to make up for an expected lopsided loss with black voters, who should account for about 20 percent of the primary electorate. Sanders notched just over 30 percent of the black vote in Missouri in '16, better than his performance in Deep South states but still a major problem for him.In the last week, Biden has loaded up on endorsements from the state's political class. A solid Biden win here would go a long way toward making Tuesday a big night for him.4. North DakotaDelegates: 14. Type of election: Firehouse caucusWhat is a firehouse caucus? It's not a quite a primary, but it's pretty close.It's run by the state political party, not the state (which administers traditional primaries), and allows voters to show up at party-designated polling sites during an eight-hour window and cast ballots. The hours are shorter and there aren't nearly as many voting locations as in a primary, but otherwise the procedure is basically the same.What that adds up to is a headache for Sanders, since North Dakota has previously held caucuses, the type of contest best suited for Sanders. In 2016, he racked up a 38-point win over Clinton here. The new process should erode that advantage, though it's not clear to what degree.5. IdahoDelegates: 20. Type of election: PrimaryHere it is again: another state where Sanders dominated caucuses in 2016 that has switched to a primary this time around. Four years ago, Sanders earned nearly 80 percent in Idaho's caucuses. It's hard to see him getting close to that in a primary. Could he still win the state? It's anyone's guess, but if the contest is even close, no one will net a significant number of delegates out of this state.6. MississippiDelegates: 36. Type of election: PrimaryIt's a small state, but it may end up being more consequential than any other state  Tuesday night. The reason: Biden should run up the score here, massively. He's been crushing Sanders among black voters, and black voters should make up around 70 percent of Mississippi's Democratic primary electorate — the largest share of any state.In 2016, this state was an absolute disaster for Sanders, who lost it 83 percent to 16 percent to Clinton. Just last week, he was routed 63 percent to 16 percent in next-door Alabama. There's every reason to believe that Sanders is in for more of the same here Tuesday. And that would mean that Biden would take the vast majority of the state's delegates.In other words, it's possible that Sanders could narrowly win all the other states Tuesday and still have his net delegate gain from them erased by Biden's Mississippi landslide.",It gets a whole lot harder for Sanders today.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump told lawmakers he wants a payroll tax cut that would last at least through the election to give consumer spending a jolt as the coronavirus threatens to cripple economic growth.The president told Republicans at a closed-door lunch Tuesday that he wants the payroll tax rate to drop to zero through the end of the year, according to a White House and a Senate official.Another White House official added that different timelines were discussed. Trump is currently backing only those that would stretch through at least November or December, with some talk of expanding the cuts beyond 2020. The official argued that anything shorter would be bad politically and make less economic sense, with the impact of the coronavirus likely to stretch through the summer.Trump has made the growing economy, record stock market numbers and low unemployment a keystone of his re-election pitch, sometimes telling crowds that they have no choice but to vote for him or else their retirement savings will be at risk. Under the president's timeline, he would ensure that the tax is zeroed out throughout his re-election campaign.Trump also repeated to senators his comments from Monday expressing a desire for federal assistance to provide paid sick leave, loans for small businesses and tax relief for specific industries, according to White House aides and senators who attended the lunch.Help for the oil industry was also discussed, senators said. The White House is considering federal assistance for the shale oil industry, which has been hit hard by the oil price collapse this week, a White House official said. But the official cautioned that the situation is still fluid and that any aid would not be on the level of an industry bailout.Let our news meet your inbox.

""I think we do need more information, more detail.

"WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor will not participate next month when the court hears one of two cases that could change a key element of the system America uses to elect its president — the Electoral College.The court disclosed Tuesday that Sotomayor took herself off a case from Colorado involving a challenge to a state law directing how presidential electors must cast their votes because of a personal friendship with one of the challengers. That friend, Polly Baca, was one of three electors who argue that they ought to be able to vote for the candidate of their choice instead of the person who won the popular vote in the state — what's known as a ""faithless elector.""In a letter to the lawyers in the case, the Supreme Court's clerk, Scott Harris, said Sotomayor concluded that ""her impartiality might reasonably be questioned due to her friendship with respondent Polly Baca.""

The two cases will be argued April 28 and were originally to be considered in a single one-hour argument. On Tuesday, the court separated the cases and set an hour of argument for each case.Sotomayor's recusal is unlikely to make any practical difference. Even if the justices turned out to be divided 5-4 in the Colorado case, her absence would result in a 4-4 tie, meaning the outcome would have no legal significance; her participation in the other case would count, however, and it would be the controlling decision.More than half the states have laws requiring electors to obey the results of the popular state vote and cast their ballots accordingly. When an elector refuses to follow the results of a state's popular vote, the state usually simply throws the ballot away.The cases before the Supreme Court involve faithless electors during the 2016 presidential election. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated Colorado's law requiring conformance with the popular vote. But faced with a similar challenge, Washington's Supreme Court upheld that state's similar law.The nation's highest court ruled in 1952 that states do not violate the Constitution when they require electors to pledge that they will abide by the popular vote.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump turned insulting big-name rivals and celebrities into a form of modern political art. His top Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, has refined it into a post-modern name-calling style exhibited in limited fashion to voters who confront him with cheap shots.""Don't be such a horse's ass,"" Biden scolded a worker at an auto plant in Detroit on Tuesday as Michigan voters went to the polls.The worker had falsely asserted that Biden wants to ""end our Second Amendment right"" to own guns. Biden, the author of a decadelong 1994 ban on certain semi-automatic weapons, has proposed new gun control measures but not a repeal of the Second Amendment — which as president he would have no formal role in adopting.But the heated exchange, in which Biden threatened to slap the man and said he was ""full of s---,"" was just the latest example of a tough-talk tactic the former vice president has deployed repeatedly to push back on critics on the campaign trail. While allies of Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders say the aggressive approach will backfire politically, many Democrats and some anti-Trump Republicans like the unusually muscular response.They see a candidate who has risen in the polls and in early state primaries by demonstrating his resilience to Democratic voters and one who is telegraphing to the broader electorate that he's ready to go toe-to-toe with the bombastic Trump if he wins his party's nomination.""Kind of amazing that anybody thinks this video makes Biden look anything other than terrific,"" David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush who supports Biden, wrote on Twitter. ""He shushes the aide who wants to lead him away — and then engages a hostile critic face to face, fact to fact.

He challenged the man to take an IQ test and to do push-ups with him.At times, though, Biden's penchant for snapping back has been less clearly directed at someone attacking him with false information.In New Hampshire last month, Biden called a woman a ""lying, dog-faced pony soldier"" after she asked whether he could win the nomination following his poor performance in the Iowa caucuses and then told him she had caucused before. His campaign played down the line, which comes from a John Wayne movie, as a joke.Trump's campaign and the conservative media echo chamber jumped on Biden on Tuesday, repeating the false claim that Biden is trying to repeal the Second Amendment and expressing outrage at his use of profanity.Trump himself has repeatedly used profanity on the campaign trail and in office. He called Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a fellow Republican, a ""p----"" in 2016, he has branded various Democratic politicians with nicknames that are ethnically insensitive or made fun of their intelligence or physical features, and he often mocks or suggests that violence might be done to protesters at his rallies.But it wasn't just the Trump campaign that said it found Biden's interaction with the Michigan worker uncouth. Faiz Shakir, who manages Sanders' campaign, tweeted out video of the moment. The first time, he subtweeted the Republican National Committee's rapid response director before deleting that version and retweeted another version.Conservatives were split on whether to suggest Biden had an angry moment or whether he was being dishonest with the voter.Mark Levin, the conservative radio host, said Biden ""loses it again,"" while Dana Loesch, a former spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, said Biden had admitted ""the exact thing about gun confiscation that the worker questioning him described,"" adding that ""Biden called the worker a liar, blamed Trump and cussed at him in response.""But in the interview Loesch promoted, Biden said he was going after assault weapons specifically and explained why he believes that the Second Amendment does not prevent the government from enacting laws that restrict the ownership of certain firearms — like currently banned machine guns — as he told the worker in Detroit.Ultimately, voters will decide whether they think Biden's right to hit back when he thinks he's being unfairly attacked — whether it's by Trump or a guy with a hard hat.

"The six states voting in the primaries and caucuses Tuesday are bracing for a strong turnout after some voters in California and Texas waited hours in long lines to cast their ballots.Election officials and experts are hoping that with less new technology, more paper-based methods and early and absentee voting options, the states — Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Washington, and North Dakota — are expected to have fewer bottlenecks. But other changes may delay reporting of the results.“We do not anticipate unusually long lines in the March 10 states, primarily due to variables such as voting methods, state sizes and the absence of major process changes such as the introduction of Vote Centers,” Eddie Perez, an election administration analyst with the OSET Institute, said in an email.NBC News has collaborated with the OSET Institute since 2016 to monitor U.S. election technology and voting issues.Voters and local administrators have hit roadblocks with newer machines and polling technology that can sometimes result in unanticipated problems — such as the Iowa app that was confusing for precinct chairs to use and encountered a coding issue that caused it to crash and be abandoned on caucus night.In some states this primary season, new technology or processes were implemented in locations that also saw long lines or administrative errors, highlighting the challenges of instituting cutting-edge election systems and processes and the need for election infrastructure resilience and contingency planning.The states voting Tuesday, however, should not encounter such problems, election integrity experts say. All states except Mississippi will be using some form of hand-marked paper ballots.In Michigan, the state with the most delegates up for grabs Tuesday, more than 800,000 ballots have already been cast under the state’s policy that allows anybody to cast an absentee ballot.

Alabama cited its new e-poll books as cutting down on check-in times. Minnesota reported an increase in voter participation of more than 175 percent over its 2016 caucuses.But a handful of counties had issues that will require closer review. Harris County, Texas, which uses voting machines from Hart InterCivic, opened an investigation after a vote was registered as cast after polls closed and a pollworker reported security seals missing on one device the next morning. This same location, Texas State University, also experienced lines in excess of 6 hours on Super Tuesday.Scrutiny was higher on jurisdictions using new equipment. ES&S, the dominant U.S. voting system maker, said that as of November, it has delivered nearly 35,000 new ExpressVote and ExpressVote XL universal voting machines, and over 7,500 ballot scanners and tabulation machines to more than 150 jurisdictions.Biden and Sanders vie for delegates in 6 states, with Michigan the prizeMarch 10, 202001:56The new machines have been heavily marketed across the county for their ease of use for voters and security and accuracy for administrators. ES&S said many new customers were delighted with the new equipment and experienced no issues. But NBC News found some isolated cases of reported problems.“Our call center was active, but typical and on par with previous elections as election officials familiarize themselves and voters with newer secure technologies,” Katina Granger, an ES&S spokesperson, said in an email.One Texas county that used new ES&S equipment is taking extra steps to review the results. A Dallas County judge ordered a recount of paper ballots from 44 new ES&S machines after thumb drives containing the ballots weren't included in final results.One South Carolina county, Richland, replaced its election director and is looking for answers after malfunctions, frozen screens and printer jams affected at least 10 new ExpressVote machines during its Feb. 29 primary voting and forced poll workers to break security seals to fix printers.Election board members said humidity and back-end administration issues may have played a factor, but the number of errors were excessive for the state’s brand new $51 million equipment, said Duncan Buell, a board of elections member and a computer scientist who has researched voting system issues.“That sort of failure of scanner should happen so rarely. It should be once in an entire county, not one in every four,” Buell said. “This should be a big issue.

"A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that House Democrats are entitled to get materials gathered by a grand jury during former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of the Trump campaign and Russian election meddling in 2016.By a 2-1 vote, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the House Judiciary Committee can receive the materials, along with an unredacted version of the Mueller report, even though such materials are normally shielded by federal rules that protect the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.The ruling, which can be appealed to the full D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court, is a major victory for the power of Congress to demand investigative materials over an issue that has long divided federal courts. But it is likely to have little immediate effect.No ‘credibility’: Trump losing 2020 battle to hide secret parts of Mueller reportMarch 6, 202006:08The appeals court said the House ""has repeatedly stated that if the grand jury materials reveal new evidence of impeachable offenses, the committee may recommend new articles of impeachment."" But there is little interest in another around of impeachment hearings in the House or another impeachment trial in the Senate.After the Senate acquitted President Donald Trump, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, said, ""There's not much appetite for revving up the engines of impeachment, because the Senate is behaving like a bunch of religious cultists. Next thing you know, they'll be selling flowers at the airport.""Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceUnder federal law, materials gathered by a grand jury must remain secret, with only a few exceptions. One of them is ""preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding."" The court upheld an October 2019 ruling by a federal judge which concluded that a Senate impeachment trial is a judicial proceeding, not a legislative one.Tuesday's ruling said the Constitution's framers understood impeachment to be an exercise of judicial power. It said that as long ago as 1811, the courts were providing grand jury materials during congressional investigations.The Justice Department objected to the release of the Mueller materials, but a key holding of the appeals court was that the courts, not the executive branch, control access to grand jury materials.""Grand jury records do not become executive branch documents simply because they are housed with the Department of Justice,"" the decision said.Whatever the government's interests may be in upholding general grand jury secrecy, they ""do not outweigh the committee's compelling need for disclosure,"" it said.In her dissent, Judge Neomi Rao, who was appointed by Trump, said the House might have had a need for the documents last fall, but she questioned whether that was still true with the impeachment process now over.""A reasonable observer might wonder why we are deciding this case at this time,"" Rao said. ""Why is this controversy not moot?""The issue of congressional access to grand jury materials has long been debated. In 1974, after a federal grand jury in Washington finished an investigation of the Watergate scandal, it prepared a special report on its findings and recommended that it be forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee, which had begun impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon.U.S. District Court Judge John Sirica ruled that while a grand jury's proceedings are secret, he had the authority to release the material to the House. His decision said that the normal reason for keeping grand jury proceedings secret — such as preventing the escape of someone who might be indicted or insulating the grand jury from outside influence — no longer applied once the grand jury's work was done.Subsequent rulings have said the judicial proceedings exception to grand jury secrecy was not the central holding of Sirica's ruling, but Tuesday's appeals court decision makes it clear that the rule applies to an impeachment proceeding.A Justice Department spokesman said the administration was studying the ruling and had no immediate comment on whether it would appeal. But an appeal by the government seems likely, in part because of the consequences of the decision on future legal battles between Congress and the White House.","House Democrats can get secret Mueller information, appeals court rules",Mar 10 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-democrats-can-get-secret-mueller-information-appeals-court-rules-n1154631,nbc
"DETROIT — Former Vice President Joe Biden told a factory worker he was “full of s---” at a campaign event here after the man claimed the Democratic presidential candidate was going to take away his guns.The heated altercation happened during a meet-and-greet with workers at a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant ahead of Michigan's crucial primary. While supporters were waiting in line, Biden was immediately confronted by a worker who claimed he would try to do away with his Second Amendment right after seeing videos of him and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, talking gun control.“You’re full of s---,” Biden said. “I did not.”Beto O'Rourke: I see three reasons to support BidenMarch 3, 202007:45O’Rourke, who endorsed Biden last week, dropped out of the 2020 Democratic field in November.

In December, Biden called an Iowa voter a ""damn liar"" and challenged him to a pushup contest after the man questioned his age, as well as his son's business dealings in Ukraine.At a pre-planned event in Ohio on Tuesday to reiterate his commitment to passing gun control legislation, Biden reacted to the confrontation in Detroit.

"WASHINGTON — Super Tuesday resurrected Joe Biden’s campaign and powered him into a delegate lead. Super Tuesday II must revive Bernie Sanders or the nomination could slip away from him again.A new CNN poll shows Biden leading Sanders by a margin of 52 percent to 36 percent in a two-person race. The biggest dividing line is age — voters under 45 said they prefer Sanders by nearly 2-to-1, while voters 45 or older picked Biden by more than 4-to-1.That generational gap looms over another big day of voting Tuesday, with Democratic voters in Michigan, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington set to deliver their verdict on who should be the party’s nominee to take on President Donald Trump. It’s also the last day for Democrats living abroad to participate in the primary.Here are five things to watch on Super Tuesday II.1. Will Sanders see a turnout revolution?Sanders has said his path to the presidency involves young and irregular voters turning out in big numbers to outnumber establishment-friendly Democrats. So far, the opposite has happened. There hasn’t been a progressive revolution for change; there has been a suburban revolution for normalcy.Consider the results from Virginia last week. Compared to 2016, the Democratic primary turnout surged in upscale suburban areas like Loudoun County from 36,149 to 71,632, and in Fairfax County from 139,818 to 244,664. Biden lapped Sanders in both counties.Meanwhile, voters younger than 30, who overwhelmingly voted for the Vermont senator, shrunk as a share of the Virginia primary electorate from 16 percent in 2016 to 13 percent in 2020.Sanders desperately needs that trend to change.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceHow Bernie Sanders can stay competitive with wins in Michigan, WashingtonMarch 9, 202004:272. Michigan, Michigan, MichiganIn 2016, Michigan delivered Sanders a stunning come-from-behind victory that revived his campaign and gave him staying power in his battle with Hillary Clinton. If he is to mount a comeback this year, it would have to begin in Michigan.It’s the most delegate-rich contest on the map Tuesday. And as a key battleground state, Sanders must show strength to close Biden’s perceived “electability” advantage nationwide, which soared to 40 points in the new CNN poll. That’s not sustainable if he wants to win over a base that is desperate to defeat President Donald Trump.A Detroit Free Press poll showed the former vice president leading Sanders by 24 points, while a Monmouth survey had him ahead by 15 points. Sanders beat the polls last cycle, and he has placed a big bet on the state this time, with a packed campaign schedule over the weekend and a focus on trade in the industrial Midwestern hub.“I still have PTSD from 2016. We certainly thought we were going to win Michigan by 10 points and we lost by a point and a half,” former Clinton campaign aide Adrienne Elrod said on MSNBC. “So you never know what’s going to happen in a state like Michigan.”3. Margins matter more than victoriesThe contest is no longer about winning states, but rather about delegate math. Delegates are awarded proportionally based on margins, so big victories matter more than narrow ones. Sanders needs to notch big victories to cut into Biden's delegate lead.Apart from Michigan, Sanders handily won North Dakota, Idaho and Washington state in 2016. He lost Missouri by a wafer-thin margin. In theory, Sanders could narrowly win those five states and still fall behind in delegates if he gets walloped again in Mississippi.In 2016, 7 in 10 Mississippi primary voters were black, and Biden showed his dominance among African American Southerners last week. He paid a visit to Mississippi over the weekend to rally voters after Sanders canceled a planned speech there Friday to spend more time in Michigan.4. Where will Warren supporters go?Super Tuesday results indicated Biden was the main beneficiary of former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s supporters after they dropped out and endorsed him. Since then, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has also dropped out, but she has not endorsed either Biden or Sanders — and it’s unclear where her voters will go.Biden has a chance to win older and college-educated white women in her base, while Sanders may add to his base of young liberals who were torn between the two progressives who aligned on policy.A Morning Consult poll taken last week found that among Warren supporters, 43 percent prefer Sanders as their second choice while 36 percent choose Biden.5. Will caucus-to-primary switches hurt Sanders?Sanders has proven stronger in caucuses — which tend to be low-turnout affairs that draw the most enthusiastic voters — than primaries. It boosted him to a big victory in the Nevada caucuses. But he lost Minnesota, which switched to a primary system after caucuses in 2016 that Sanders won handily.Washington and Idaho have also switched from caucuses to primaries. Can Sanders carry those states? Having fallen behind in delegates, he can ill-afford to lose places he won last time.",5 things to watch on Super Tuesday II,Mar 10 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/5-things-watch-super-tuesday-ii-sanders-revolution-faces-reckoning-n1153581,nbc
"WASHINGTON — Four years ago, Bernie Sanders shocked the political world and defied the public polling by winning the Michigan primary — even though he was unable to change the overall delegate math.But here are three reasons why Sanders winning Michigan tonight on this Above-Average Tuesday (with a total of 365 pledges delegates up for grabs) would be an even bigger surprise than it was in 2016.One, Joe Biden’s bounce after winning South Carolina and most of the Super Tuesday states has been enormous. A national CNN poll released Monday found Biden leading Sanders by 16 points (after Sanders was ahead by 3 points in January). And a national Quinnipiac poll had Biden ahead by 19 points (after Sanders led in February).Biden and Sanders vie for delegates in 6 states, with Michigan the prizeMarch 10, 202001:56If you’re leading nationally by double digits, chances are you’re ahead in Michigan, too.Two, the coronavirus story that’s been dominating the news has probably helped Biden more than Sanders. That same CNN poll shows that Democratic voters — by a 42-point margin — believe Biden would better handle a major crisis than Sanders would.And three, Sanders has been underperforming among white working-class voters in the north. “Overall, Mr. Biden defeated Mr. Sanders by 10 points, 38 percent to 28 percent, in counties across Maine, Minnesota and Massachusetts where white voters made up at least 80 percent of the electorate and where college graduates represented less than 40 percent of the electorate,” the New York Times’ Nate Cohn writes.That seems to suggest that part of Sanders’ success in 2016 was because he was running against Hillary Clinton.Outside of Michigan, Sanders might even have a bigger problem tonight: Idaho and Washington state have replaced their caucuses with primaries.And to show you how that could change the delegate math, Sanders won 72 percent in Washington’s caucuses four years ago. But when the state party held a primary that same year — which didn’t count for the delegates sent to the convention — Clinton actually edged Sanders in that contest (when a lot more voters were participating).Two weeks ago, Joe Biden was making his final stand in South Carolina, and it worked for him — better than anyone could have imagined.Today, Sanders is making his own final stand in Michigan.But he’s making it on much more unfavorable turf.Data Download: The number of the day is … 77Seventy-seven.That’s Joe Biden’s delegate lead over Bernie Sanders heading into tonight’s contests.Biden has been allocated 652 delegates, according to the NBC News Decision Desk, while Sanders has 575.That doesn’t include 143 delegates that have NOT been allocated from contests that have already taken place.Of those 143, 63 are from California, while 80 are from other Super Tuesday States.California: 63Utah: 20Colorado: 16North Carolina: 9Massachusetts: 9Tennessee: 8Texas: 5Maine: 4Alabama: 3Oklahoma: 2Virginia: 2Arkansas: 1Minnesota: 1Trump’s looking at stimulus measures to boost the economy“President Donald Trump said Monday that he is looking at a possible payroll tax cut, along with other measures, to help American workers and boost the economy, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak,” per NBC News.Let our news meet your inbox.

"WASHINGTON — Two weeks ago, Bernie Sanders was the Democratic presidential front-runner, the U.S. economy was humming and President Donald Trump had reason to be optimistic about his re-election prospects.Then the first American died from the coronavirus. The campaign as we knew it would soon be over.The pandemic subsumed businesses and sports leagues, hammered the travel industry and caused some analysts to project an economic downturn, if not a global recession. Democrats who rated the coronavirus as important to their vote picked former Vice President Joe Biden by wide margins in primary contests, padding his victory margins and handing him a commanding delegate lead.The president and his two main rivals canceled rallies, allowed or directed staff to work from home and began shifting their events to online gatherings. Democrats moved their Sunday debate from Phoenix to Washington and eliminated the live audience, while Louisiana became the first state to postpone its primaries due to the virus. American public life was grinding to a halt.In the nation’s capital, Trump struggled to contain the fallout, initially downplaying the magnitude of the crisis and offering mixed messages that went against guidance from public health officials.The coronavirus outbreak has challenged Trump as he has never been challenged before. The scorched-earth playbook that has gotten the former reality TV star out of trouble in the past is failing on a complex problem that requires technocratic competence and expertise. A president who has confounded his critics with an apparent invincibility in one crisis after another now sees the virus attacking his two biggest assets heading into re-election — a growing economy and the approval of older Americans, whose lives are disproportionately threatened.Let our news meet your inbox.

He underperforms his rivals on the question of who would better handle a crisis: American voters picked Joe Biden over Trump by 16 points, and Sanders over Trump by 6 points, a Quinnipiac poll said.This week, the president delivered an Oval Office address that misstated his own policy of restricting travel from Europe, which panicked Americans abroad and further tanked the markets. On Friday, one day after the worst stock market crash since 1987, he declared a national emergency in order to unlock resources to help states and localities address the pandemic. He denied responsibility for the slow rate of coronavirus testing.""No, I don’t take responsibility at all,"" he told reporters at a White House press conference, blaming the ""set of circumstances"" he inherited, flanked by administration officials and corporate executives enlisted to help mitigate the crisis. Hours later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a deal with the administration on a bill to protect Americans with two weeks of paid sick leave, three months of family and medical leave, enhanced unemployment benefits and a boost in Medicaid and nutrition funding.Before Trump came around to declaring an emergency, he latched onto the rosiest forecasts and sought to blame his predecessor, attack the press and accuse Democrats of perpetuating a “hoax” to bring down his presidency. Meanwhile, the death toll has gradually risen, testing remains scarce compared to other developed countries and the president’s response has fueled criticism that he’s more worried about his political health than the pubic's.“The administration’s failure on testing is colossal, and it’s a failure of planning, leadership and execution,” Biden said in remarks on the crisis Thursday. “We must know the true extent of this outbreak so we can map it, trace it and contain it. Nor should we hide the true number of infections in hope of protecting political interest or the stock market.”Biden’s speech came one day after the president’s Oval Office address, offering Americans a visual comparison of how their two most likely options this fall would act in a crisis. Voters in recent general elections have not necessarily been drawn to the candidate with the most governing experience — Hillary Clinton, John McCain and John Kerry all lost — but a pandemic could change that.Sanders said Friday the virus “has radically changed our campaign,” by preventing him from hosting big rallies and relegating his staff to work from home. He touted his signature issue of “Medicare for All” and argued that a national insurance plan would make the U.S. better equipped to combat public health threats like the coronavirus.“We need fundamental changes to our economy, we need fundamental changes to our health care system,” he told reporters in Burlington, Vermont. “I would hope that this crisis should be a moment in which people ask fundamental questions about the dysfunctionality of our current health care system.”At his press conference Friday, Trump sought to look ahead to the light at the end of the tunnel.""This will pass,"" he said.

"New York state opened its first drive-thru coronavirus test site Friday in New Rochelle, the city that Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said has the biggest cluster of coronavirus cases in the country.With 158 cases in Westchester County, many of them in New Rochelle, the city has become a hot spot not just for the outbreak but also for unique ways to track and minimize the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, Cuomo implemented a ""containment zone"" around a one-mile radius of the city as an emergency measure to limit movement in the area and shut down schools, houses of worship and other gathering places.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakThe drive-thru test site is capable of testing up to 200 people a day at the moment and will eventually be able to test 500 a day, Cuomo said.

People with underlying conditions or those who are elderly are considered more vulnerable populations and will get appointments first.""You want to find the positive cases because you want to be able to isolate those positive cases.""""You want to find the positive cases because you want to be able to isolate those positive cases, and then find out who that person may have been in touch with so you can get them the assistance they need,"" Cuomo said at a press conference Friday.

"WASHINGTON — Many of the nation's mayors and governors are ordering schools, courthouses and even large public gatherings shut down, but where do they get the power to do that?Every state in the United States — and virtually every country in the world — has laws conferring this legal authority. They're some of the oldest on the books, stemming from the plagues of past centuries that devastated Europe and were reworked again after the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic and the more recent Ebola outbreak.""There's no question that states have very broad powers to do rather extraordinary things in public health emergencies,"" professor Wendy Parmet, an expert on public health law at Northeastern University, says.President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency Friday, but that largely would provide more assistance to state and local governments and would not enlarge federal power to restrict public gatherings or travel. It provides the same kind of aid that is made available in response to national disasters like hurricanes.Trump plans to declare national emergency over coronavirusMarch 13, 202001:50The federal government has long had authority to prevent people who could be carrying disease from entering the country.

It's the same provision Trump invoked in the past, with varying degrees of success, to limit travel from mostly Muslim countries and to restrict immigration at the southern border.Chief Justice John Roberts referred to this power two years ago when the court upheld a modified version of Trump's Middle Eastern travel ban. If the opponents were right about the limits of the law, ""the president would not be able to suspend entry from a particular country in the event of an epidemic in that country or even if the United States were on the brink of war with that country.""Separately, federal public health laws give the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the authority to detain and examine anyone arriving in the U.S. suspected of carrying a communicable disease. The federal government could even limit travel from one state to another by people deemed a public health risk, though the practical limitations of actually doing it make that largely theoretical.Professor George Annas, a public health law expert at Boston University, said, ""I don't think you're going to see any restriction on interstate travel in the United States.""Most of the restrictions popping up now in response to the coronavirus pandemic are local ones. All states and the District of Columbia have laws, as part of their general police powers, authorizing quarantine, which is a restriction on people who may have been exposed to see if they become sick, and isolation, which is intended to stop people known to be sick from spreading a disease.While these laws vary widely, most give governors or public health officials authority to limit public interactions in emergencies.Washington state's law, for example, says the governor ""after proclaiming a state of emergency ... may issue an order prohibiting ... any number of persons, as designated by the governor, from assembling or gathering on the public streets, parks, or other open areas of this state, either public or private.""That includes banning such nongovernment gatherings such as sporting events or concerts. The ability of private businesses to successfully challenge these restrictions is very limited, assuming the state and local authorities follow the rules and don't act irrationally or with intent to illegally discriminate.""If somebody were to challenge something like (New York) Gov. Andrew Cuomo's containment order or the one shutting down Broadway, I think it would be very hard in this climate to prevail in court,"" Parmet said. ""Things may change depending on how long this goes on, but courts have traditionally been extremely deferential to public health emergency powers.""Some states restrict how local officials can close public gathering places, and places like movie theaters can be closed without further authority from a legislature, Annas says. ""In general, as long as you have the support of the public, the power is nearly unlimited.""President Bill Clinton used that authority in 2000 to help New York and New Jersey deal with an outbreak of the West Nile virus, allowing them to conduct spraying against mosquitoes that spread the disease.

Are we listening? Are we getting all the information we need to?” he said. He didn't say whether he would sign or veto any of the bills.Utah barred abortion after 18 weeks last year, becoming one of several states to adopt strict bans.

"WASHINGTON — This has been a week that has changed the trajectory of the 2020 election, as well as the trajectory for the entire nation.The disruption from the spread of the coronavirus — and the political reaction to it — is certainly the biggest part of that change.An economic recession now seems almost inevitable.Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders got to contrast their leadership abilities with President Trump’s.And as for Trump, the coronavirus plays into all of his weaknesses — blaming others, misstating facts, not leading by example and an inability to unite the country — and few of his strengths.But the coronavirus isn’t the only thing that changed the 2020 race this week.Joe Biden has taken absolute command of the race for the Democratic nomination, and the next two weeks of contests look even better for him.And when it comes to the 2020 race for the Senate, Democrats convinced Montana Gov.

"CHICAGO — Chicago mom Rya Smith has no doubts about backing the top prosecutor in the nation's second-biggest county for another term, even while acknowledging the office fumbled a criminal case against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's involvement in the Smollett case has dominated much of the attention in her reelection campaign, but Smith contends the focus instead should be on her record exonerating the innocent, tossing minor marijuana convictions and as the first black woman in the job.“She’s done a great many things, especially for minorities,” Smith said. “The Jussie Smollett case was a pebble in the giant boulder of her career. That shouldn’t discredit her for one little mistake. She isn’t getting a fair shake.”Jussie Smollett due in court for his first appearance on new chargesFeb. 24, 202000:29Foxx is counting on more voters like Smith as she seeks a second term against three Democratic primary challengers who've seized on the Smollett case and a fractured relationship with police. In what's likely the most expensive race of its kind, they've called it a bungled prosecution that benefited a politically-connected person and undermined public trust.The controversial decision to dismiss charges against Smollett, who's accused of fabricating a racist, anti-gay attack, has haunted Foxx, something that's increasingly frustrated her. She declined an Associated Press interview but recently called the Smollett focus “B.S.""Defeating Foxx will be tough with her establishment backing, union support and super PACs targeting her opponents. But challengers — including Navy veteran Bill Conway, whose first run for office is being fueled by his billionaire father — believe they've found an opening for Tuesday.“She just kept not telling the truth to the public,” said Conway, 41, a former assistant state's attorney.He's aired television ads since November, with far more money combined than all candidates — including two Republicans. About $10.5 million of the roughly $11.5 million he’s raised, comes from William Conway, co-founder of Carlyle Group, a Washington D.C.-based investment firm. Foxx, 47, has raised nearly $3.5 million.Foxx acknowledged missteps. She recused herself from the Smollett case, but questions linger about whether she acted improperly for speaking to a Smollett relative and aide to former first lady Michelle Obama before the charges were dismissed. A special prosecutor reinstated the charges last month, which Foxx blasted as political.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service“That we are continuing to talk about this in a city that continues to deal with gun violence, in a city that is continuing to reckon with police accountability,” Foxx told the Chicago Sun-Times. “That somehow this case has been elevated to one of the greatest criminal injustices in our time feels disingenuous.”There’s wide agreement she's made reforms.Foxx's office was the first to dismiss low-level marijuana convictions as part of Illinois’ law legalizing recreational marijuana. She personally handed over roughly 1,000 petitions to a judge.She ramped up a Conviction Integrity Unit with prosecutors vacating convictions of roughly 100 people linked to a former Chicago police sergeant’s scheme to shake down poor and black public housing residents.Josh Tepfer of the Exoneration Project at the University of Chicago Law School called Foxx’s office “the most transparent” he’s worked with, noting she apologized to victims even though they were convicted before her tenure.“She speaks to the unfair treatment of people of color in ways that are very unique,” he said.That resonates with Tanya Watkins, who runs Soul in Action, a PAC that focuses on black candidates. Nearly one quarter of Cook County's 5.1 million residents are black.Watkins believes Foxx hasn't received fair treatment because of race. The other candidates are white.“She has no margin for error,” Watkins said. “The things I’ve heard said about this black woman have reminded me how much more difficult it is to be a black woman in the public arena.”Defense attorneys note the easing up on charges for lower-level crimes and alternative punishments. Some also praise her cash bail reforms. Her office has allowed the release of detainees held on nonviolent charges who can't afford bonds up to $1,000.But others aren’t so complimentary.Foxx has a rocky relationship with police, who dislike her reforms, including for nonviolent crimes like shoplifting. Things worsened when the Smollett charges were dropped. The tensions hit a peak in April with dueling protests outside her office involving the police union.“There’s this attitude among law enforcement that this is a ‘catch and release’ system,” said Kulmeet Galhotra, who's retired as the head of the Cook County Public Defender’s Homicide Task Force.The sentiment is echoed by challenger former Chicago Alderman Bob Fioretti, 67. He and former federal prosecutor Donna More, 62, who’s also running, say the office needs to be more independent.Some defense attorneys are also critical of her office for inconsistencies, saying the policies aren't applied evenly.Still, the Smollett case does resonate with some.Chicagoan Demetrius Williams, 35, voted for Foxx before but thinks Smollett got off easy and will support Conway.“I believe he has enough money to take on Kim Foxx,” said Williams, 35. “I’m not going to say that I’m so Conway crazy. I’ll take a chance.

"WASHINGTON — An unexpected crisis has sent the stock market into free fall, Congress is divided on how to respond, and experts across the political spectrum are demanding unprecedented action to stave off catastrophe.It’s a situation that’s all too familiar for Jason Furman, who advised President Barack Obama’s campaign during the 2008 financial crisis and went on to serve as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.Now a professor at Harvard University, Furman has been pushing Congress to go big with a rescue package that includes sending one-time checks of $1,000 for every American adult and $500 for every child to help cope with the fallout from the coronavirus.NBC News talked to Furman about what to expect from the ongoing situation and how the federal government might prevent a worst-case scenario when it comes to the economy. Here's what he had to say in the interview, edited for length and clarity:NBC News: A lot of Americans are seeing the stock market plummet this week and trying to figure out what it means, beyond just the immediate health crisis. How worried should they be?Furman: I think the economic side is very serious, potentially more serious than the financial crisis.In the financial crisis, millions of people lost their jobs, but most people kept their jobs, and many people maintained their consumption. In this case, everyone is cutting their spending and lots of people, even if they don’t lose their jobs, will lose time at work, hours, tips, potentially a large blow to their income.NBC News: Some are making the opposite argument, including the president. The financial crisis occurred because the underpinning of the economy was bad, they say, but this is a temporary situation and eventually things will go back to normal.Furman: If the virus goes away in two months, I wouldn't be that worried. My expectation based on the medical professionals is that it is not realistic to expect it to go away in two months, and that if it did, it could come back even more virulently again in the flu season next year.The problem with the economic side is that if it lasts more than a few months, it then takes on its own momentum. If you look across the United States and across other countries, the unemployment rate can go up very quickly, but it can’t come back down very quickly. It never has. A business whose balance sheet is in tatters after nine months without revenues might go bankrupt, it might go out of business, or it won’t be in position to hire people back immediately even if demand returns.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceNBC News: You have proposed a one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult and $500 to every child in the country. Why do you think that’s the best approach? In part, because I exhausted all other alternatives. You should spend as much as you can on health, on testing, on hospital infrastructure. You should spend as much as you can in a targeted way on things like unemployment insurance, nutritional assistance, paid leave, and help for states.Once you've gone through all of that, you’ve maxed out on health and maxed out on targeted assistance, you have two problems: One is millions, or tens of millions, of households are going to be hurting from lower incomes, lost jobs, or time off work. Second, just from a macroeconomic perspective, the amount of stimulus you want for the economy under that scenario is still smaller than what you need. The only way to reach everyone you need and get to the size you need is with some broad-based tax transfer.NBC News: What level of spending do you think we need to avert the worst consequences?Furman: A week ago, I called for $350 billion. Today, I would say $700 billion.NBC News: The president hasn’t put out details, but he’s said his preferred approach is a payroll tax cut. What do you make of that idea? Furman: I don't think a payroll tax cut is a terrible idea. I think it's an imperfect idea, but I think it’s moving in some respects in the right direction. The problems it has is it gives a lot more money to high income than to middle income, it gives nothing to people who aren't getting a paycheck, and in the current circumstances it dribbles out slowly.NBC News: Democrats in Congress want to boost federal aid to states to help pay for Medicaid while Republicans are skeptical of the idea. You’ve argued this is an essential part of any rescue package. Why? Furman: In a normal recession, state revenues go down a lot and that can lead them to cut back. That is going to happen. In addition, state spending is going to go up a lot to take all the public health measures and treatment measures we’re going to need to do right now.We need to make sure states can afford public health, that they can afford to treat people, and from a macroeconomic perspective, aren’t cutting back spending in some areas to meet their balanced budget requirement.NBC News: You say that any bill should renew automatically if the economy continues to suffer. A number of Democrats have said they’re worried the next Democratic president could take office in a crisis and find Republicans suddenly very concerned with deficits and unwilling to fund more help. Furman: You can obviate that concern, and I strongly think you should, by passing something today and including with it triggers that continue based on economic circumstances. So, you can write people checks this year and if the unemployment rate is above 5.5 percent, they get the checks next year, or raise the Medicaid match rate, then make a formula that links it to the unemployment rate by state.I've been a longtime fan of automatic stabilizers. In the current political environment it's especially important, because it’s always hard for Congress to pass anything.NBC News: What do you think of the White House’s economic response so far and is there anything more they can do at the executive level? Furman: The White House response has been pathetic, inconsistent, at times too small, and sometimes flailing in different directions. I've been really disappointed. As recently as Friday of last week, their top economic advisers were talking about how very little needed to be done, just little targeted measures. They keep floating a payroll tax cut, but they haven’t proposed it.My experience also is Congress has a lot of great people, but even on legislation at a time like this, really the administration needs to take a big lead.

Many major public events, including all NBA, NHL, MLS and MLB preseason games and Broadway shows, have been canceled this week, and Thursday saw the Dow's worst day since the 1987 crash.As panic began to set in, Trump tried to quell the fears of Americans across the country by giving a speech from the Oval Office on Wednesday night. He announced that he would ban many foreign travelers from Europe for the next 30 days and offered a series of economic relief actions to help workers and companies deal with the outbreak. But his speech was met with swift pushback after he misstated several aspects of the policy and failed to propose any new action to combat the outbreak domestically.Meanwhile, voters have seemed to express a growing sense of trust in Biden's ability to handle a crisis — even before Biden made his latest moves.An NBC News exit poll on Super Tuesday found that Biden was the candidate of choice of nearly half of those who rated the outbreak as an important factor, above Sanders.

"LONDON — President Donald Trump's ban on most travel from 26 European countries caused uproar on the continent early Thursday, with E.U. leaders blasting Trump's decision and saying they were not consulted, as chaos and confusion erupted at several major airports.European Union leaders issued a rare joint statement condemning Trump's move, saying it was taken ""unilaterally and without consultation."" They also condemned attacks he made on them during an address Wednesday night, when he accused the E.U. of spreading the virus in the U.S. by not imposing sufficient travel restrictions on China and elsewhere.""The coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent, and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,"" said a joint statement from Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the presidents of the European Commission and the European Council respectively.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak""The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,"" they added. ""The European Union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the virus.""Meanwhile, Americans and foreigners scrambled to work out what it meant for their plans to travel to the U.S. Others questioned the logic of Trump's move and whether it would actually help the effort to slow the spread of the contagion.Trump announces travel restrictions from Europe over coronavirusMarch 12, 202000:59The president announced late Wednesday that he was banning travel to the U.S. for any foreign nationals who had traveled to one of more than two dozen European countries within the past 14 days.Trump explicitly called it a ""foreign virus"" and said ""a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.""The U.S. had more than 1,600 confirmed cases as of Thursday, including 41 deaths, with the Trump administration coming under enormous criticism for the lack of coronavirus testing that's being done compared with certain other countries.The travel ban goes into effect Friday at midnight, and the restrictions apply only to foreign nationals, not U.S. citizens, green card holders or the families of U.S. citizens.However, during the president's initial address to the nation, the distinctions were less clear, with Trump saying the U.S. would ""be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.""Let our news meet your inbox.

As such, both countries were exempt from Trump's travel ban.That has led some to question whether it would be possible to get past the restrictions simply by connecting in London or Dublin. The statement released by Trump did not answer that point.Furthermore, both the U.K. and Ireland had more cases, 459 and 43 as of Wednesday respectively, than many countries that were included within the ban. Slovakia, for example, had 10 confirmed cases, and Poland had 41.A study published last week in Science Magazine, a peer-reviewed academic journal, found that travel restrictions ""will have modest effects"" and that other domestic measures to prevent the spread would ""provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the epidemic.""That was echoed by the U.K.'s finance minister, Rishi Sunak, early Thursday.Following the travel ban @realDonaldTrump announced, we will assess the situation today.

Ireland and the U.K. are exempt, although it is not clear why because the virus is also present in Britain.The travel ban does not apply to European trade or goods, though Trump suggested that that was the case during his prime-time address.

"The Supreme Court said Wednesday that the Trump administration can continue its practice of returning asylum-seekers to Mexico along the entire southern border while immigration authorities process their claims.In a brief, unsigned order, the court said enforcement can go on while the justices decide whether to hear an appeal of lower court rulings that declared the program illegal. Only Justice Sonia Sotomayor said she would have denied the permission.The policy, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, or ""Remain in Mexico,"" was launched in January 2019.

"WASHINGTON — Halfway through the primary contests, more Democratic voters have made it abundantly clear that they want Joe Biden’s restoration over Bernie Sanders’ revolution.That’s the message from last night’s decisive Biden victories in Mississippi (where he’s ahead 81 percent to 14.8 percent), Missouri (60 percent to 35 percent), Michigan (53 percent to 37 percent) and even Idaho (49 percent to 43 percent).NBC News’ Decision Desk says that Washington state is “too close to call” (where Sanders is ahead by 2,000 votes with 69 percent in), and NBC just projected Sanders the winner of North Dakota’s caucuses.Joe Biden ‘is consolidating the Democratic party,’ analyst saysMarch 11, 202002:36So in the 20 Democratic contests beginning with Super Tuesday last week, African Americans, older voters, moderates and voters who call themselves somewhat (but not very) liberal overwhelmingly broken for Biden — and many of those are the most reliable voting blocs for Democrats.That’s compared with younger voters, very liberals and Latinos who have sided with Sanders.In Mississippi, Missouri, Michigan and Washington state, strong majorities of Democratic voters – once again – said their top priority was a candidate who could beat President Trump, versus a candidate who agrees with them on most issues.“Our very democracy is at stake in this election,” Biden said last night from Philadelphia. “As I said from the moment I announced not far from here, that I believe we're in the battle for the soul of this nation. With Donald Trump as president, our core values, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America is truly at stake.”And with Biden now leading Sanders by 150 delegates per NBC’s latest count (double the 77-delegate edge he had going into last night’s contests), much of the party is already starting to coalesce around the former vice president.Guy Cecil, who heads the Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA, tweeted: “The math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for President and @prioritiesUSA is going to do everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November.”Another Dem group, American Bridge, did the same.It all raises important questions for Sanders: How does he go forward, especially with the upcoming contests later this month (Florida, Georgia) on even more unfriendly terrain for him?If he stays in the race, how does he campaign against Biden, especially with Trump waiting in the wings?And what message does he send to his young, progressive and Latino-heavy supporters – particularly since the Dem nominee is going to need them to win in November?Tweet of the dayRep. Clyburn on NPR just now: ""I think when the night is over, Joe Biden will be the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination...

But unlike those nights, he projected confidence—and at one point full acceptance—that he could be the party’s nominee. ‘This campaign is taking off, and I believe we're going to do well from this point on.’ Biden said. He also thanked Sanders for the race he has run thus far in remarks that sounded similar to ones delivered by past nominees whose opponents had conceded the race. ‘I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal, and together we'll defeat Donald, we'll defeat him together.’”But of course, Sanders has not conceded the party’s nomination. While he hasn’t addressed last night’s results, his press secretary tweeted that she is “excited” about this week’s Democratic debate and that America will get “to see Biden defend his ideas, or lack thereof, on Sunday.”The Lid: Primary colorsDon’t miss the pod from yesterday, when we looked at how Sanders’s 2016 success was largely built around his dominance in caucuses — and what the demise of those contests in favor of primaries has meant for his chances in 2020.ICYMI: New clips you shouldn’t missSahil Kapur has these key takeaways from last night’s primaries — and they’re not good news for Sanders.Gabby Giffords is backing Joe Biden just days before the Arizona primary.There won’t be a live audience at the Sunday debate amid coronavirus concerns.President Trump is proposing an elimination of the payroll tax through the end of the year (and through his reelection campaign).Trump Agenda: (Tele)work it outThe Trump administration is preparing to move hundreds of thousands of federal workers to telework amid the coronavirus scare.Sonia Sotomayor is recusing herself from a Supreme Court case involving the electoral college.There’s a new FISA deal.

"Joe Biden extended his delegate lead over Bernie Sanders in Tuesday night's primaries, according to NBC News projections.The former vice president now has a nearly 150-delegate lead over the Vermont senator after winning four of the six states that voted Tuesday, according to NBC News. Nationally, Biden has 837 delegates to Sanders' 689, as of 8 a.m. ET.Biden appears on track to win Mississippi and Missouri by lopsided margins, which will lead to big delegate hauls since Democrats award delegates in proportion to the margin by which candidates win in each state. He won Idaho by a narrower margin, NBC News projected early Wednesday.Biden has also won the biggest state on the map, Michigan, with 125 delegates at stake.

Biden has a wide lead in the few public polls that have been taken of those states, with a recent Florida Atlantic University poll showing Biden ahead 61 percent to 25 percent.A week later will come Georgia, the type of Southern state with a large black population where Biden has been especially strong this year. Sanders could hope for success in Puerto Rico later that week given his strength with Latinos.April 4th is the next best slate of states for Sanders, with contests in Alaska, Hawaii, Wyoming, all of which Sanders won in 2016.

"As results began coming in on Super Tuesday, some of the most vulnerable Democratic members of Congress breathed a sigh of relief: Joe Biden was surging.A week later, those sighs became a veritable exhalation: The former vice president won primaries in key states, including Michigan, to solidify his lead over Bernie Sanders in the all-important delegate chase.""I'm thrilled to have Joe Biden at the top of the ticket — I think he is exactly the type of candidate we need to overcome the divisiveness of the Trump administration,"" Rep. Harley Rouda of California told NBC News last week. “I think he's going to help a lot of down-tickets such as myself on the ballot.”Rouda, a first-term congressman, is part of the wave of Democratic candidates who turned traditionally red seats blue to help flip the House in the 2018 midterms. He and other ""Frontliners"" — what House Democrats' campaign arm is calling those members attempting to win tough re-election battles in 2020 — had been watching the party's early presidential nominating contests with keen interest and no small amount of anxiety.Bernie Sanders vows to stay in race after Joe Biden solidifies delegate leadMarch 11, 202001:30For those lawmakers fighting to stay in office in districts that have elected Republicans for decades, a Democratic socialist at the top of the party's ticket felt like it would be an in-kind donation for their opponents. Many held back on endorsing any candidate. And prior to Biden's surge, Sanders' presidential bid had already emerged as a trigger point in those re-election battles, with some facing attacks of ""socialism,"" despite their own moderate agendas.Strategists say it’s almost impossible for House candidates to distance themselves from the presidential nominees in a presidential election year, and Sanders’ promise of “revolution” makes that all the more difficult.“What these Frontliners are looking at is, they don’t want to spend every single day being consumed by having to answer for Sanders rhetoric or Sanders policy,” said Rodell Mollineau, a longtime Democratic strategist who is an adviser to Biden’s super PAC. “The more time — as a candidate — that you’re spending having to defend or deflect from any sort of national phenomenon is a day that you’re not talking about the issues that your constituents care about.”Democratic Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, who represents Texas' 7th District and has yet to endorse a primary presidential candidate, hardly aligns with Sanders on politics — her West Houston district is reliant on energy jobs and she openly opposes policy positions like his fracking ban. But after Republican Wesley Hunt won his party's primary on Super Tuesday, he released an attack ad telling voters that “a vote for Lizzie is a vote for Bernie.""Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceMollineau said that the distance between Sanders and Fletcher on policy hardly mattered. “If you’re explaining, you’re losing,” he said.Strategists and candidates said Biden — who endorsed and campaigned for many of the Frontliners in 2018 as a surrogate — fits into their political brands, too.“The way that many of these Frontliners won their elections was by not being hyper partisan, by communicating a message of working together to make the lives of constituents better,” he said.Earlier on, as Biden struggled and Sanders soared in the first voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, vulnerable down-ballot candidates offered endorsements sparingly: Some threw their support behind home-state candidates or Mike Bloomberg, who was competing against Biden and others for the moderate lane in a still-crowded field of candidates.Of the 42 at-risk Democrats in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Frontline program, none have endorsed Sanders. Nine endorsed Biden before voters went to the polls on Super Tuesday, but after his wins started pouring in, the endorsements started flowing: Biden picked up 11 more nods in less than two weeks.Rouda endorsed Biden after Super Tuesday's returns, as did Reps. Sean Casten of Illinois, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Andy Kim of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Haley Stevens of Michigan, and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida. After Biden's big wins in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan on March 10, more Frontliners joined the list, with Reps. Lucy McBath of Georgia, Max Rose of New York, and Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill, both of New Jersey, adding their names to his list of endorsements on Wednesday.Spanberger said Biden’s surge confirmed that voters still want the same thing they did when they sent her to Washington last year: “Forward movement,” not “complete upheaval.”Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, one of the handful of Frontliners who endorsed Biden in January prior to any ballots being cast, said voters wanted to know “what we were actually going to do — things that were achievable.”“I was raised by a single mother in Dallas,” he said, adding that “people like my mother don’t have time to wait for supermajorities"" in Congress, something moderates have argued would be necessary for there to be any hope of passing Sanders' agenda.The Sanders campaign argues they’re building an infrastructure that will boost down-ballot candidates by bringing new voters to the party while inspiring a political movement that will elect a new generation of Democrats, like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.The campaign also told NBC News they’re working to build relationships with down-ballot candidates, including those who aren’t likely to endorse Sanders.Rouda said he was never personally approached by Sanders' team, and Spanberger's and Allred's campaigns said the same.Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., who represents a reliably Democratic district and endorsed Sanders in January, argued that Democrats embraced establishment candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and still lost.“Too often people forget that the best way we win elections — people like Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin has made a career of this — is not fighting over a few people in the middle,” he said in interview, arguing that bringing new voters to the party was key to winning big.Pressed for proof — first-time voters favored Sanders but were a small share of Super Tuesday’s voters, according to NBC exit polls  — Pocan argued the nomination fight wasn’t over yet.“Joe Biden had one good week out of the last year, and everyone wants to think that the last week is the next year,” he said. “Just looking at Super Tuesday and deciding that is the end all, be all? It’s a huge mistake.”",Sanders had some vulnerable Democrats worried.

He underperforms his rivals on the question of who would better handle a crisis: American voters picked Joe Biden over Trump by 16 points, and Sanders over Trump by 6 points, a Quinnipiac poll said.This week, the president delivered an Oval Office address that misstated his own policy of restricting travel from Europe, which panicked Americans abroad and further tanked the markets. On Friday, one day after the worst stock market crash since 1987, he declared a national emergency in order to unlock resources to help states and localities address the pandemic. He denied responsibility for the slow rate of coronavirus testing.""No, I don’t take responsibility at all,"" he told reporters at a White House press conference, blaming the ""set of circumstances"" he inherited, flanked by administration officials and corporate executives enlisted to help mitigate the crisis. Hours later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a deal with the administration on a bill to protect Americans with two weeks of paid sick leave, three months of family and medical leave, enhanced unemployment benefits and a boost in Medicaid and nutrition funding.Before Trump came around to declaring an emergency, he latched onto the rosiest forecasts and sought to blame his predecessor, attack the press and accuse Democrats of perpetuating a “hoax” to bring down his presidency. Meanwhile, the death toll has gradually risen, testing remains scarce compared to other developed countries and the president’s response has fueled criticism that he’s more worried about his political health than the public's.“The administration’s failure on testing is colossal, and it’s a failure of planning, leadership and execution,” Biden said in remarks on the crisis Thursday. “We must know the true extent of this outbreak so we can map it, trace it and contain it. Nor should we hide the true number of infections in hope of protecting political interest or the stock market.”Biden’s speech came one day after the president’s Oval Office address, offering Americans a visual comparison of how their two most likely options this fall would act in a crisis. Voters in recent general elections have not necessarily been drawn to the candidate with the most governing experience — Hillary Clinton, John McCain and John Kerry all lost — but a pandemic could change that.Sanders said Friday the virus “has radically changed our campaign,” by preventing him from hosting big rallies and relegating his staff to work from home. He touted his signature issue of “Medicare for All” and argued that a national insurance plan would make the U.S. better equipped to combat public health threats like the coronavirus.“We need fundamental changes to our economy, we need fundamental changes to our health care system,” he told reporters in Burlington, Vermont. “I would hope that this crisis should be a moment in which people ask fundamental questions about the dysfunctionality of our current health care system.”At his press conference Friday, Trump sought to look ahead to the light at the end of the tunnel.""This will pass,"" he said.

He underperforms his rivals on the question of who would better handle a crisis: American voters picked Joe Biden over Trump by 16 points, and Sanders over Trump by 6 points, a Quinnipiac poll said.This week, the president delivered an Oval Office address that misstated his own policy of restricting travel from Europe, which panicked Americans abroad and further tanked the markets. On Friday, one day after the worst stock market crash since 1987, he declared a national emergency in order to unlock resources to help states and localities address the pandemic. He denied responsibility for the slow rate of coronavirus testing.""No, I don’t take responsibility at all,"" he told reporters at a White House press conference, blaming the ""set of circumstances"" he inherited, flanked by administration officials and corporate executives enlisted to help mitigate the crisis. Hours later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a deal with the administration on a bill to protect Americans with two weeks of paid sick leave, three months of family and medical leave, enhanced unemployment benefits and a boost in Medicaid and nutrition funding.Before Trump came around to declaring an emergency, he latched onto the rosiest forecasts and sought to blame his predecessor, attack the press and accuse Democrats of perpetuating a “hoax” to bring down his presidency. Meanwhile, the death toll has gradually risen, testing remains scarce compared to other developed countries and the president’s response has fueled criticism that he’s more worried about his political health than the public's.“The administration’s failure on testing is colossal, and it’s a failure of planning, leadership and execution,” Biden said in remarks on the crisis Thursday. “We must know the true extent of this outbreak so we can map it, trace it and contain it. Nor should we hide the true number of infections in hope of protecting political interest or the stock market.”Biden’s speech came one day after the president’s Oval Office address, offering Americans a visual comparison of how their two most likely options this fall would act in a crisis. Voters in recent general elections have not necessarily been drawn to the candidate with the most governing experience — Hillary Clinton, John McCain and John Kerry all lost — but a pandemic could change that.Sanders said Friday the virus “has radically changed our campaign,” by preventing him from hosting big rallies and relegating his staff to work from home. He touted his signature issue of “Medicare for All” and argued that a national insurance plan would make the U.S. better equipped to combat public health threats like the coronavirus.“We need fundamental changes to our economy, we need fundamental changes to our health care system,” he told reporters in Burlington, Vermont. “I would hope that this crisis should be a moment in which people ask fundamental questions about the dysfunctionality of our current health care system.”At his press conference Friday, Trump sought to look ahead to the light at the end of the tunnel.""This will pass,"" he said. ""This will pass through and we're going to be even stronger for it.'He — and the nation — can hope.","Coronavirus upends the 2020 race, tests Trump invincibility",Mar 14 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/virus-upends-2020-election-tests-trump-s-invincibility-n1158631,nbc
"WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives passed a sweeping bill early Saturday addressing the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak, aiming to soften the economic blow that many Americans are expected to feel as stores close, people stay home and stock markets plunge.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., hashed out the details of the plan's safety net benefits this week, disagreeing over how much paid time off should be extended to workers. Mnuchin and the White House had raised concerns that too much paid leave would hurt businesses already reeling from the financial effects of the outbreak, while Pelosi and the Democrats argued that a permanent paid leave program needed to be extended to all workers.President Donald Trump has said he supports the legislation, and the Senate is expected to pass it sometime next week.Here’s what is included:Free coronavirus testingThe bill calls for free testing for anyone whose doctor says a test is needed. Patients will not be responsible for any deductibles or copayments.The free testing extends to those on Medicaid or Medicare and provides a pathway for uninsured people to get free testing through federal coverage programs.Expanded family and medical leave — for someThe House bill expands the existing family and medical leave program.Under current law, employers are required to give up to 12 weeks of job protected medical leave (meaning you cannot be fired) but they are not required to provide any pay during that time.Let our news meet your inbox.

The benefits can be paid retroactively and will be available for those who had to leave work starting Jan. 19.But there's a catch: this benefit applies only to companies with fewer than 500 employees. Anyone employed by a company larger than that — which is more than half of all American workers — is ineligible.U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) arrives to deliver a statement on a coronavirus economic aid package ahead of a vote in the House of Representatives in Washington on FridayYURI GRIPAS / ReutersPaid emergency sick leave — (also) for someIn addition to the expansion of paid family leave, the bill also establishes a new paid sick leave program that calls for employers to immediately grant 14 days of paid sick leave that can be used by infected people, caretakers and parents whose children's schools have been closed.This benefit, too, is available only to people working at companies with fewer than 500 employees. Small businesses (defined as having 50 employees or less) will be reimbursed for providing the 14 days of additional paid sick leave.For employers who already provide paid sick leave, the additional leave made available under the House bill should still be provided, and employers are not allowed to make changes to their existing policies to avoid offering additional paid leave.Unemployment benefitsThe bill provides additional funds to states that experience a 10 percent increase in unemployment.States would be required to loosen eligibility requirements for unemployment, such as work search requirements or waiting periods.Food assistanceThe bill allocates an additional $500 million to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children, which provides access to food for low-income pregnant women and mothers, with young children, who have lost their jobs due to the outbreak.An additional $400 million will be granted to the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which would help food banks meet the increased demand they are likely to experience.The bill allows for states to provide families whose children receive free or reduced-price school meals with money to buy food in the event of school closures. The assistance will kick in after five consecutive days of canceled school.It also calls for emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program aid to families with children who receive free or reduced-price meals at school. The work requirements for SNAP will be temporarily suspended under the bill.For older Americans, the bill provides emergency funding for programs such as Home-Delivered Nutrition Services, which provides meals to senior centers and homes of older adults who live alone.Protections for health care workersMany health care workers could be at risk of being exposed to the coronavirus, especially as care facilities fill up with sick patients.The bill requires state and local hospitals and nursing facilities, some of which are not subject to certain federal regulations, to comply with additional safety and health plans.",What's in Congress' emergency coronavirus bill?

On Friday, the Department of Defense announced they were halting domestic travel for all service members, civilian employees and their families in an effort to combat the coronavirus.“We’re considering a broad range of measures,” Pence said when asked about the possibility of domestic travel restrictions.Trump had been repeatedly criticized for refusing to get tested for the virus after it was reported that he was in close contact with multiple people at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida who had tested positive for the coronavirus.Trump's announcement that he had gotten tested appears to be in contrast to a Friday memo from Sean P. Conley, physician to the president, stating that Trump did not need to be tested because the interactions he had with known patients were ""low risk.""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended testing for people who have had ""close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19"" or have experienced ""potential exposure through attendance at events or spending time in specific settings where COVID-19 cases have been reported.""When asked by reporters Saturday to explain the discrepancy between Trump's announcement and the White House physician's memo, Pence said he would ""speak immediately after this press conference with the White House physicians office,"" but did not provide a direct answer.Pence said that he and his wife did not have any symptoms, but were ""more than happy to be tested.”During his remarks Saturday, Trump said he had his temperature taken before entering into the press briefing room.“I had my temperature taken coming into the room,” Trump said. “We are all looking good,"" he said, later adding that his temperature was ""totally normal.""Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakPrior to the briefing, a member of the White House Physician’s Office took temperatures of every member of the press corps in attendance.“Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President,” said White House spokesperson Judd Deere.A member of the press was turned away from the press conference after registering a 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit temperature.The House of Representatives passed a coronavirus aid package early Saturday morning in a bipartisan vote that includes free testing, paid emergency leave and other resources intended to help stem the crisis and stabilize financial markets.

"Civil rights advocates are reminding Spanish-speaking voters living in 32 Florida counties that they have the right to access election materials and assistance in their native language before the state's primary on March 17.Florida's secretary of state as well as officials in Manatee County, Sarasota County and 30 other Florida counties are required to grant these services on Election Day. This follows a federal judge's ruling last year that determined the state was in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for not making bilingual voting materials and assistance available to the state's growing number of Spanish speakers — in particular, Puerto Rican voters who have moved from the island.Puerto Ricans are born with U.S. citizenship; once they move to the mainland they can register and vote in stateside elections. But many of those who were raised on the island speak primarily Spanish.RelatedNewsNewsJudge orders 32 Florida counties to comply with Voting Rights Act for Spanish speakersIt's estimated that over 50,000 Puerto Ricans moved to Florida after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico in September 2017.

"WASHINGTON — With President Donald Trump fading further into the background as a leader on coronavirus action, House Democrats and Trump lieutenants are battling to bolster the federal response.Separately for the most part, but with some collaboration, they are racing to shape legislative and executive policy solutions to a pandemic that has spread rapidly from the public health arena to infect the economic health of the nation. The officials — elected Democrats, Trump-administration Republicans and nonpartisan federal agency chiefs — are also seeking to deliver accurate and consistent information to the public about the importance of slowing down the virus, after weeks of Trump downplaying the risks.In doing so, they find themselves fighting the fierce partisan instincts of Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who vowed to crush a bill that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., spent much of her morning discussing with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the telephone.It all boils down to a monumental test of Washington's ability to confront a crisis when the president is unwilling to fully acknowledge its scale, and that could have serious consequences for the political fortunes of Trump and Republicans in Congress — not to mention a vice president who is widely believed to have presidential aspirations of his own.""The air is rapidly escaping Trump's re-election balloon,"" Dan Eberhart, a Trump supporter and major fundraiser for the Senate GOP, said in a text message to NBC News. ""The economic data that is going to show up in a month or so is going to be universally negative.""'Families have needs': Pelosi calls for passage of coronavirus relief billMarch 12, 202002:12There has been some ""irresponsible rhetoric,"" Vice President Mike Pence told the ""TODAY"" show's Savannah Guthrie on Thursday morning after she read him a tweet from Trump accusing Democrats of overhyping the threat of coronavirus.Though Pence went on to say Trump's top priority is public safety, the rebuke was an unusually harsh assessment from a vice president who less than two weeks ago was handed the brutal task of coordinating a government-wide response to a crisis his boss once dismissed as a hoax.Pence will no doubt be judged in part on how he walks the tightrope of trying to show loyalty to Trump while avoiding blame for anything the president does to make the situation worse — all while actually managing the sprawling federal effort to contain the intertwined threats to public health and the economy.Let our news meet your inbox.

""We need presidential leadership.""By Wednesday night, Biden had named a task force of advisers he said he would turn to for counsel on the matter.Trump, who devoted just the second Oval Office address of his presidency Wednesday night to the coronavirus response, has declined so far to declare a national emergency, which would effectively send billions of dollars to states. That appears to be related to his reluctance to stoke fears that could further damage the economy and his re-election chances.But denying reality has its own pitfalls. If the president starts to lose the trust of his own supporters, he could launch into a political tailspin.His tardy reaction to the threat allowed the risk of an uncontrolled outbreak to grow over the last two months. All across the country, public officials and businesses are canceling major gatherings, from NBA games to St. Patrick's Day parades.And stocks continued to take a beating Thursday morning, with trading halted at the New York Stock Exchange for the second time in a week — the first time that has happened in more than two decades.McConnell calls Democrats' coronavirus relief bill 'an ideological wish list'March 12, 202002:09On Capitol Hill, lawmakers announced that the Capitol complex would be closed to the public through the end of the month, and senators and House members attended separate bipartisan briefings featuring a panel of administration officials that mixed in health officials with loyal Trump appointees.That did little to ease the partisan divide at the leadership level, as Democrats complained they weren't getting good enough information and Republicans accused Democrats of trying to turn the situation into an opportunity to sneak favored policy items into law.McConnell berated Pelosi from the Senate floor over her draft of a second emergency bill to address the crisis, and he told Americans not to worry at all about the economic repercussions of the coronavirus.""The good news is that our nation’s economy remains strong,"" McConnell said. ""The president is continuing to take action himself. We just passed billions in urgent funding last week. And the Senate will continue to stand ready and willing to work toward further bicameral, bipartisan actions when the House Democrats decide to get serious.""McConnell, who has not prepared a similar comprehensive emergency bill, said his colleagues would try to pass ""smaller, noncontroversial pieces of legislation right away that would bolster particular aspects of the fight against coronavirus.""The House aid package would require agencies and private business to cover the costs of diagnostic testing for the illness — an idea Trump appeared to support in his Wednesday night remarks — and provide various types of financial aid to people affected by what has quickly become a pending economic crisis.McConnell blasted the proposal as a Democratic ""wish list"" that would put ""unfunded mandates"" on businesses and create a ""brand-new bureaucracy"" within the Social Security Administration, which would be responsible for overseeing an expansion of paid leave benefits for affected workers.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the latter provision would strain the ability of the Social Security Administration to process checks for the elderly — the population most at risk of dying from coronavirus. The agency's current administrative costs amount to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of its expenses, it completes more than 150 million online transactions per year, and in 2018 it reduced the number of pending actions at processing centers by 3.2 million.In short, it's one of the most efficient agencies in the federal government.Shortly after McConnell spoke, Mnuchin and Pelosi held their third call of the morning.""Language discussions"" regarding the House bill ""are continuing,"" Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill wrote on Twitter.",The twisted politics of Washington's coronavirus response,Mar 12 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/twisted-politics-washington-s-coronavirus-response-n1156856,nbc

It comes after an Indian Health Service patient in Charles Mix County, where the school and reservation are, tested positive Wednesday for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, health officials said.An Indian Health Service official said the person had traveled to a conference in the United States, and others who came into contact with the patient were being tested as well.""We'll have to start looking at relational ties to the individual and if there are any relatives in attendance in our school,"" Beheler said.Even in this sparsely populated prairie land of rolling hillsides and bluffs, the paralyzing effects of the global coronavirus outbreak have hit home.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakThe tribe on Friday approved a ""declaration of disaster,"" which means its offices will be closed this week for cleaning, while employees are banned from traveling to major cities and states affected by the virus, and the tribe's 9,000 members are being asked to stay away from public gatherings. For students at Marty Indian School, a plan to see the Minnesota Timberwolves play the Los Angeles Lakers this month was abandoned after the NBA announced it is suspending the rest of the season.""Demographically, we have a situation here that a lot of our kids live with elders and their grandparents, and so we have to take these precautionary measures,"" Beheler added.But leaders of Native American tribes across the country acknowledge that it's only a matter of time before they may be thrown into a similar situation as the Yankton Sioux, and have begun banning forms of travel and declaring a state of emergency.Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez, center, meets with other Navajo Nation officials to discuss the coronavirus crisis.Navajo NationMost pressing is the need for federal funding that can provide medical supplies and testing kits, said Jonathan Nez, the president of the Navajo Nation, the largest tribal reservation in the United States spanning the corners of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.""We're asking Congress to intervene to make sure that we get the funding we need,"" Nez said.This month, Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., the vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, led a bipartisan group of 27 senators to ask Vice President Mike Pence to ensure all tribal leaders and urban Indian health departments are not left out of the conversation to combat the coronavirus and are provided with the $40 million in funding for their efforts.The House of Representative's emergency relief package, which is awaiting Senate approval, allocates $64 million to the Indian Health Service to address the coronavirus' impact on the more than 2.5 million American Indian and Alaska Native population the agency services.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceThe amount, however, still falls short of the $94 million for emergency funding sought by the National Council of Urban Indian Health. But council spokeswoman Meredith Raimondi said it's still an improvement from when Urban Indian Organizations missed out in past emergency funding, such as for the Zika virus.""Our biggest concern right now is that there's not really a funding mechanism for the CDC to distribute funds to Indian country,"" Raimondi said, adding that she'd like to see an interagency agreement coordinate funding.""Because of bureaucracy, it can take a while,"" Raimondi said.The majority of Native Americans don't live on a reservation, she added, but many still get health care through Indian health programs.Udall said the Trump administration's ""insufficient response"" to COVID-19 could leave Native American communities to ""bear the worst costs of this public health crisis."" He told NBC News that his office is in contact with federal agencies to make sure funds are dispersed swiftly, there's a funding release timeline and that coronavirus testing is accessible in Indian country.On Wednesday, Udall introduced a bill that would allow tribes to apply directly to the CDC's public health emergency preparedness program, which provides states and some cities access to federal resources meant for getting them ready for public health emergencies. Tribes are currently ineligible.""Tribal communities face unique challenges in responding to public health threats, and we need to do everything we can to make sure that Native Americans don't get left behind,"" Udall said.House passes emergency coronavirus relief packageMarch 14, 202001:52The potential spread of the coronavirus on reservations is compounded by already existing disparities affecting the Native American population, including barriers to accessible health care, poor health, unemployment and generational poverty.In 2017, the chairman of the Yankton Sioux Tribe, Robert Flying Hawk, testified before the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs about how the closing of inpatient care at an Indian Health Service hospital and the shuttering of a 24-hour emergency room had created hardships for his community.A series of extreme weather events that devastated South Dakota last year and affected reservations, including the Yankton Sioux, exposed how difficult it was for tribes to get federal funding.The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, home to the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, was in a state of emergency a year ago because of the extreme flooding.On Tuesday, Oglala President Julian Bear Runner declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus. He said the tribe had still not received any testing kits from the federal government.""Who knows how long we will be walking with this disease and not be able to properly diagnose that, quarantine and treat those who have been affected,"" he told the Argus Leader. The tribe has also banned travel for tribal employees.As of Saturday, South Dakota reported one death related to the coronavirus: a man in his 60s with underlying health conditions.RelatedNewsNewsNative Americans, the census' most undercounted racial group, fight for an accurate 2020 tallyIn an email, Indian Health Services told NBC News that all of its facilities are capable of testing patients for COVID-19 at no cost. After the case in Charles Mix County, the agency added that it is ""working closely with [South Dakota] to identify anyone else in the community who has been in close contact with the patient and may need to be tested.""In eastern Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation had to temporarily close its casino last week after an employee contracted the coronavirus. Tribal officials said there were no known cases involving tribal residents.The Navajo Nation has also declared a state of emergency, although there were no confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the reservation as of Saturday. Some residents have been tested, but the testing was done through state health departments, not through Indian Health Service, which could reach more people.Nez said his COVID-19 Preparedness Team is monitoring the states and counties within the reservation and community health representatives have been going door to door to check on the elderly and other vulnerable people. At least 30 to 40 people have been tested, with drive-up testing also available in New Mexico.To get the word out to more people, tribal leaders announced the translation of COVID-19 into the Navajo language: Dikos Ntsaaígíí-Náhást'éíts'áadah.The Navajo Nation is susceptible to the spread of the virus as a popular tourist destination and the home of four casinos, Nez said. Arizona has tracked at least 12 coronavirus cases, while New Mexico has had at least 10.#embed-20200128-coronavirus-us-count iframe {width: 1px;min-width: 100%}The reservation dealt with its own outbreak in 1993 of the hantavirus, a severe pulmonary disease spread by rodents. The mortality rate for the Navajo was 44 percent, higher than the general population, according to a 2016 federal government report.""It's going to be a test,"" Navajo member Vernon Livingston, 38, said of the response to the latest outbreak.Livingston, who lives on the reservation near Window Rock, Arizona, said the news of the coronavirus has sent people panic-buying toilet paper and food at markets. While he applauds the community health representatives and tribal leaders with making sure residents understand the coronavirus, Facebook remains the common way for people to share what's going on.He worries about the stigma of dealing with illness and some people seeking the use of medicine men and local traditionalists with warding off a new disease that currently has no vaccine.""If people start getting sick, us Navajos will think of how we're going to fix it,"" he added. ""A lot of us Navajo men can be really stubborn about going to the hospital — we think, we'll stay home and fight it. But this is something different.""",Native American tribes brace for coronavirus: 'It's going to be a test',Mar 15 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/native-american-tribes-brace-coronavirus-it-s-going-be-test-n1156961,nbc

"The 11th Democratic debate is set for Sunday night, and the first one-on-one face off between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will look much different than was originally planned.Here's everything you need to know about the debate:What time is the debate?The two-hour debate is scheduled for 8 p.m. ET, in a different location than originally planned. It had been scheduled to take place in Phoenix — Arizona is one of four states that have a primary on Tuesday — but the venue was switched to Washington, D.C., after organizers decided to do away with the audience because of coronavirus concerns. The debate will be held at the studios of CNN, which is hosting the event with Univision.The location and lack of an audience aren't the only coronavirus-driven changes. One of the scheduled moderators, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, had to bow out because he'd been in proximity of somebody who'd been in direct contact with a person who tested positive for the virus. Ramos is symptom free, but staying away out of ""an abundance of caution,"" organizers said. Univision's news anchor, Ilia Calderón, will moderate in his place.Let our news meet your inbox.

Tulsi Gabbard still in the race. The Democratic National Committee said that to qualify for the stage, candidates need at least 20 percent of the delegates that have been allocated to date. That means no Gabbard, who's only claimed two delegates in her quest for the Democratic presidential nomination. As of Sunday, Biden had 860 and Sanders 706, according to NBC News' delegate counter.The rules for the debate have not yet been announced, but Sanders said in a speech this past week that he has several questions he'd like to ask Biden, including about healthcare costs, immigration and climate change. ""Joe, what are you going to do?"" Sanders said in his address, which came after what the Vermont senator acknowledged had been a ""tough night"" for him at the ballot box, including losing to Biden in Michigan and a slew of other states.With Sanders on the ropes, the debate comes before voting on Tuesday in Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Arizona. If Sanders doesn't do well and close the delegate gap with Biden, the end of his campaign could be approaching.Where to watch the debate?The debate will air live on CNN, CNN en Español, CNN International and Univision and stream live on CNN.com's homepage.NBCNews.com will cover the debate with a live-blog, stories and analysis.",Democratic debate between Biden and Sanders: Everything you need to know,Mar 15 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/democratic-debate-between-biden-sanders-everything-you-need-know-n1157416,nbc

I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for over-reacting.""The United States has surpassed 2,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, though the actual number of those infected could be much larger because testing isn't yet widespread. At least 60 people have died in the U.S. due to complications from the virus.Fauci said that the goal now is to ""blunt"" the curve of confirmed cases, keeping the number of those infected low enough so as to not overwhelm the U.S. hospital system.""If you let the curve get up there, then the entire society is going to be hit,"" he said.Let our news meet your inbox.

"WASHINGTON — The last time Democrats debated, Bernie Sanders had just won two consecutive states and Joe Biden’s campaign was on the brink of collapse. The two men will debate one-on-one Sunday in a transformed campaign landscape.The stage has shrunk from six to two candidates, Biden has taken a dominant lead in the race, and the coronavirus outbreak has ground much of American public life to a halt. Candidates have been forced to cancel their rallies and host online events instead, while Democrats moved Sunday's debate from Phoenix to CNN's Washington, D.C. studio to avoid cross-country travel.After crushing the field in South Carolina and two successive Tuesdays of victories across the country, Biden leads by about 150 delegates, which will be so difficult to erase that some party elites are already treating him as the presumptive nominee.Here are five things to watch at Sunday night's faceoff.1. Who wins the coronavirus clash?Americans are desperate to know when normal life will resume after the virus has shuttered schools, businesses and sports leagues, causing layoffs and sending stocks tumbling. Biden and Sanders won’t have good answers for them, but they’ll be looking to offer themselves as a foil to someone they call a reckless president who has catastrophically mishandled the pandemic.Watch for the two men to sell Americans on why they’d be best to deal with such an emergency.Biden has presented himself as a steady leader with the experience to handle a crisis. Sanders has said the outbreak underscores the need for universal health care, his signature policy issue, arguing that such a system would leave the U.S. better prepared to save lives.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceSo far, it’s advantage Biden: Democrats in Super Tuesday states who rated the coronavirus as important to their vote preferred the former vice president, according to NBC News exit polls.Biden and Sanders campaigns go virtual amidst coronavirus outbreakMarch 14, 202002:212. Will Biden make concessions to progressives?Biden has already begun speaking like the nominee and positioning himself as a uniter. He has cemented the support of moderate Democrats, but has a long way to go before winning the trust of many progressives, who view him as a milquetoast moderate who’s too wedded to the status quo to meaningfully improve the lives of struggling Americans.The former vice president made one notable concession Friday at a virtual town hall with Illinois voters: He endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan, which restores protections removed in a Biden-backed 2005 law and let young people discharge student debt in bankruptcy. It was a major reversal for Biden, and an outstretched hand to progressives.Keep an eye out for more possible olive branches.“He will make overtures to Bernie and to his supporters to show that there’s space for them on Team Biden,” a Biden aide told NBC News. “We are extremely aware of the need to unite the party.”3. Will Sanders be kind or scorch the earth?Biden-allied Democrats are desperate to end the primary and turn their attention to the faceoff with President Donald Trump. Many are nervous about a possible repeat of 2016, with a protracted primary battle that gets ugly and leaves the nominee wounded. Sanders has promised to steer clear of personal attacks and stick to debating the issues, and he made clear Wednesday he intends to challenge Biden in the debate on medical bankruptcies, climate change and billionaires trying to buy elections.The Vermont senator has dominated with primary voters under 45 years old, who have been outmatched at the ballot box by older Democrats but will be key for Biden in the fall. The senator senator has said that winning their support requires embracing their preferred policies.""I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,"" he said Wednesday. ""And you must speak to the issues of concern to them.”Sanders to Democratic establishment: You must win voters who represent the futureMarch 11, 202004:294. Will Trump keep 'defending' Sanders?Trump has sought to maximize chaos among Democrats by claiming — with no evidence — that the Democratic National Committee is conspiring to stop Sanders from claiming the nomination. It’s a repeat of his 2016 playbook, aimed at nudging Sanders supporters to stay home or vote for a third-party candidate in the fall and enable his re-election.As he coasts to renomination with no serious Republican competition, the president has developed a knack for playing pundit in the Democratic primary. Expect that to continue during Sunday’s debate — and watch to see how Sanders responds. So far, the senator has brushed back Trump’s attempts to manufacture Democratic unrest, and vowed to support the party's nominee this fall.5. How long will Sanders stay in?Sanders said last Sunday on ABC’s This Week he’s “not a masochist who wants to stay in the race that can't be won.” How does he define a winnable contest? The Vermont senator still has a mathematical possibility of becoming the nominee, but that outcome would require a precipitous Biden collapse and Sanders victories by wide margins in the remaining primaries. There’s no hint of that happening. Sanders may drop some clues in the debate about his potential exit strategy.",5 things to watch in the Biden-Sanders debate,Mar 15 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/5-things-watch-biden-sanders-debate-amid-coronavirus-crisis-n1159081,nbc
"WASHINGTON — With the Democratic nomination race now down to a one-on-one contest between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Democratic primary voters now back Biden — who was a distant second to Sanders just one month ago — by an overwhelming two-to-one margin, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.The survey found that 61 percent of Democratic voters support Biden, while just 32 back Sanders. Four percent choose Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who has not yet dropped out of the race despite failing to finish in the top three in any U.S. state primary or caucus to date.Biden’s surge of more than 45 percentage points in four weeks shows how quickly he became the consensus choice of Democratic voters as the field narrowed down to just two major candidates. The NBC News/WSJ poll in February, which was conducted before Biden’s decisive win in the South Carolina primary changed the trajectory of the race, found Sanders besting Biden 27 percent to 15 percent, while candidates who have since dropped out — former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar — split the remainder of the vote.Each of those candidates except Warren has since thrown their support behind Biden.Democratic voters are also significantly more likely than they were last month to say they are enthusiastic about Biden’s campaign. In February, just 13 percent said they were enthusiastic about him, while 43 percent said they were merely comfortable, and a combined 43 percent said they had reservations or were uncomfortable. Now, 37 percent say they’re enthusiastic about Biden, 37 percent say they are comfortable, and just 25 percent express reservations or discomfort.For Sanders, less has changed since February. This month, a combined 66 percent of Democratic voters say they are either enthusiastic (27 percent) or comfortable (39 percent) with him. Last month, it was a combined 65 percent.Let our news meet your inbox.

Among voters under 35, just a quarter chose Biden, while seven-in-ten pick Sanders.Biden leads Trump by 9 points in a one-to-one matchupAmong all registered voters, Biden leads President Trump outside the poll’s margin of error in a head-to-head contest. In a hypothetical one-on-one general election contest, 52 percent of all voters say they would choose Biden, while 43 percent say they would choose Trump.For Sanders, it’s 49 percent saying they would support the Vermont senator, while 45 percent back Trump.In the matchup between Biden and Trump, Biden has the backing of a majority of independents (59 percent), women (63 percent), and white voters with a college degree (53 percent). He is also the overwhelming choice of nonwhite voters, getting support from 70 percent of Latinos and 84 percent of black voters.Trump receives majority support from white voters (51 percent), men (53 percent), and white voters without a college degree (57 percent.)Among suburban voters, Biden gets 49 percent while Trump gets 45 percent.And among voters in 2016 swing states, Biden gets 50 percent, while Trump gets 42 percent.Still, Trump continues to enjoy the most fervent support from his backers. Among all voters, 27 percent say they’re enthusiastic about his candidacy, compared with 15 percent for Biden and 13 percent for Sanders.But nearly half of all voters — 48 percent — say they’re very uncomfortable with his run. That’s compared with 31 percent who say the same of Biden and 42 percent who say the same of Sanders.The NBC News/WSJ live-caller poll was conducted March 11-13, 2020.

"WASHINGTON — A majority of American voters say they’re worried that someone in their immediate family might catch the coronavirus, and six-in-10 believe the worst is yet to come for the outbreak inside the United States, a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds.In addition, more than 40 percent say their day-to-day lives will change as a result of the pandemic.But public attitudes about the coronavirus — including President Donald Trump’s handling of it — are starkly divided along partisan lines, with nearly nine-in-10 Republican voters having confidence in Trump dealing with the outbreak, compared with just a sliver of Democrats who agree.Indeed, 45 percent of all voters approve of Trump’s handling of the issue, which is almost identical to his overall job rating in the poll.“What’s clear is that we are at the beginning of the story of coronavirus in America, and Americans are beginning to understand what its impact could be,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his firm, Public Opinion Strategies.McInturff adds that the coronavirus — so far — has affected some states and cities disproportionately from other parts of the country.“It’s a very big country with a lot of different people,” he said.Only 30 percent of Republicans are likely to avoid gatherings during coronavirus pandemicMarch 15, 202002:03The NBC News/WSJ poll was conducted March 11-13, and it comes as there have now been 2,600 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, as well as 58 deaths from it in the country.In the poll, a whopping 99 percent of respondents say they’ve seen, heard or read about the spread of the coronavirus, including 89 percent who say they’ve heard “a lot” about the story — the highest percentage the NBC News/WSJ poll has registered for a major event going back to 2009.A combined 53 percent say they’re either “very” or “somewhat” worried that someone in their immediate family might catch the coronavirus, while a combined 47 percent say that they aren’t too worried or worried at all.Forty-one percent of voters believe their day-to-day lives will change in a major way in the future, versus a combined 56 percent — a majority — who say their lives will change only in a “small way” or won’t change at all.And 60 percent think that the worst is yet to come, while 31 percent say the coronavirus is not likely to be a major problem.But a glaring partisan divide exists within these numbers.Sixty-eight percent of Democratic voters are worried that an immediate family member might catch the coronavirus, compared with just 40 percent of Republicans who agree.Let our news meet your inbox.

"WASHINGTON — From music festivals to sporting events, the cancellations that have accompanied the spread of COVID-19 seem likely to give a shock to the economy — or at least important parts of it.While the anger of fans and devotees of events such as the NCAA Basketball Tournament or the SXSW Festivals has made headlines, the real-world economic impacts for communities around the country may be dramatic. And when you add up all the cancellations there are signs a major economic hit is coming, with the biggest hits falling on people who are likely not well-equipped to handle them.Start with some of the biggest headlines in the last few weeks, the major sporting events and festivals that have already been put on ice.The massive SXSW festival in Austin, Texas brought in about $355 million to the area in 2019 according to an analysis by the firm Greyhill Advisers. That’s a lot of empty hotel beds and meals not served this year.The Final Four for the NCAA was supposed to bring more than $100 million into Atlanta in early April. And those are just for the semifinal and championship games. Across the country, there were other cities that were going to host first and second-round games — Albany, Cleveland, Greensboro, Omaha, St. Louis, Sacramento, Spokane and Tampa. In Cleveland they estimated the city would derive $8 million from the event, so figure similar hits in those other cities.And in Detroit, the NCAA’s hockey equivalent, the Frozen Four, was estimated to bring in about $10 million to the area with a few small NCAA events, all of which are canceled.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceThe losses of those events, and countless others, are about more than performers or coaches and league officials not getting paid. There are a lot of ripple effects — fewer drinks being poured at bars, fewer cabs rides around townOne place the virus impacts are already clear is in air travel. No events mean no need for transportation to those events.A look at some a random selection of flights on Friday found some very low fares. Looking to go somewhere warm from New York? On Friday afternoon, roundtrip airfare from LaGuardia to Orlando from Saturday to Saturday was $157 on Delta. If you wanted to fly in two months, the roundtrip fare from May 9 to May 16 was only $97.There were similar fares for other routes. Chicago to Dallas (on American) and Denver to Los Angeles (on United or Delta) were also both $97 if you traveled roundtrip May 9 to May 16.Those are great deals if you’re looking to fly, but those are also deep cuts for airlines to take in their fares. Those numbers over a prolonged period of time are going to have serious impacts for airlines. Flight schedules have already been slashed to levels even lower than they were after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. That means fewer days of work for pilots, crews and mechanics. Unpaid leave is already being discussed.And then there are the hotels where people stay in those places. The numbers this week showed cancellations were already spiking, according to the site Knowland.In Asia, where the pandemic has been a story for much longer, the cancellation rate of hotel rooms over the next few months is 90 percent. In Europe the figure is just over 50 percent. And here, in the United States, the cancellation rate is about 40 percent — or it was as of March 11. That’s compared to a rate after July 1 of only about 20 percent.Those are steep drops and they likely mean fewer people needed to clean rooms or work in hotel kitchens or at front desks.When you add all those declines together and factor in a timetable no one yet truly knows, the economic picture — macro and micro — looks challenging to say the least. And remember, none of this adds in the impacts of the suspended NBA, NHL or Major League Baseball seasons. That will bring drops in revenues in neighborhood bars and restaurants every game day.Also missing here are all the impacts of workers telecommuting to their jobs. That means fewer work lunches and fewer cups of coffee being purchased. The workers at those establishments, in turn, have less to spend in their pockets.The point is these impacts can grow remarkably fast.And with all that in mind, remember this figure: $25,580. That’s the mean annual income for a worker in the Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations for 2018, according to the U.S. Census.There were a lot of eyes on the stock market this past week and a lot of complaints about 401(k) plans. But the numbers here show how far-reaching the coronavirus outbreak could be and how quickly the impacts could be felt — all in a year with a presidential race.The COVID-19 story is first and foremost about the health and well-being of Americans, but its impacts seem likely to extend into other areas long after the virus is eventually tamed.",Adding up all the coronavirus economic hits,Mar 15 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/adding-it-coronavirus-leave-deep-impact-economy-n1159356,nbc

"WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives passed a sweeping bill early Saturday addressing the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak, aiming to soften the economic blow that many Americans are expected to feel as stores close, people stay home and stock markets plunge.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., hashed out the details of the plan's safety net benefits this week, disagreeing over how much paid time off should be extended to workers. Mnuchin and the White House had raised concerns that too much paid leave would hurt businesses already reeling from the financial effects of the outbreak, while Pelosi and the Democrats argued that a permanent paid leave program needed to be extended to all workers.President Donald Trump has said he supports the legislation, and the Senate is expected to pass it sometime next week.Here’s what is included:Free coronavirus testingThe bill calls for free testing for anyone whose doctor says a test is needed. Patients will not be responsible for any deductibles or copayments.The free testing extends to those on Medicaid or Medicare and provides a pathway for uninsured people to get free testing through federal coverage programs.Expanded family and medical leave — for someThe House bill expands the existing family and medical leave program.Under current law, employers are required to give up to 12 weeks of job protected medical leave (meaning you cannot be fired) but they are not required to provide any pay during that time.The House bill, however, provides paid leave for workers if they have been diagnosed with the coronavirus or if they are caring for a family member who has it, or if they are caring for a child or another dependent due to a school or care facility closing.Let our news meet your inbox.

The benefits can be paid retroactively and will be available for those who had to leave work starting Jan. 19.But there's a catch: this benefit applies only to companies with fewer than 500 employees. Anyone employed by a company larger than that — which is more than half of all American workers — is ineligible.U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) arrives to deliver a statement on a coronavirus economic aid package ahead of a vote in the House of Representatives in Washington on FridayYURI GRIPAS / ReutersPaid emergency sick leave — (also) for someIn addition to the expansion of paid family leave, the bill also establishes a new paid sick leave program that calls for employers to immediately grant 14 days of paid sick leave that can be used by infected people, caretakers and parents whose children's schools have been closed.This benefit, too, is available only to people working at companies with fewer than 500 employees. Small businesses (defined as having 50 employees or less) will be reimbursed for providing the 14 days of additional paid sick leave.For employers who already provide paid sick leave, the additional leave made available under the House bill should still be provided, and employers are not allowed to make changes to their existing policies to avoid offering additional paid leave.Unemployment benefitsThe bill provides additional funds to states that experience a 10 percent increase in unemployment.States would be required to loosen eligibility requirements for unemployment, such as work search requirements or waiting periods.Food assistanceThe bill allocates an additional $500 million to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children, which provides access to food for low-income pregnant women and mothers, with young children, who have lost their jobs due to the outbreak.An additional $400 million will be granted to the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which would help food banks meet the increased demand they are likely to experience.The bill allows for states to provide families whose children receive free or reduced-price school meals with money to buy food in the event of school closures. The assistance will kick in after five consecutive days of canceled school.It also calls for emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program aid to families with children who receive free or reduced-price meals at school. The work requirements for SNAP will be temporarily suspended under the bill.For older Americans, the bill provides emergency funding for programs such as Home-Delivered Nutrition Services, which provides meals to senior centers and homes of older adults who live alone.Protections for health care workersMany health care workers could be at risk of being exposed to the coronavirus, especially as care facilities fill up with sick patients.The bill requires state and local hospitals and nursing facilities, some of which are not subject to certain federal regulations, to comply with additional safety and health plans.",What's in Congress' emergency coronavirus bill?

"WASHINGTON — The last time Democrats debated, Bernie Sanders had just won two consecutive states and Joe Biden’s campaign was on the brink of collapse. The two men will debate one-on-one Sunday in a transformed campaign landscape.The stage has shrunk from six to two candidates, Biden has taken a dominant lead in the race, and the coronavirus outbreak has ground much of American public life to a halt. Biden and Sanders have been forced to cancel their rallies and host online events instead, while the party moved Sunday's debate from Phoenix to CNN's Washington studio to avoid cross-country travel.After crushing the field in South Carolina and two successive Tuesdays of victories across the country, Biden leads by about 150 delegates, which will be so difficult to erase that some party elites are already treating him as the presumptive nominee.Here are five things to watch at Sunday night's faceoff.1. Who wins the coronavirus clash?Americans are desperate to know when normal life will resume after the virus has shuttered schools, businesses and sports leagues, causing layoffs and sending stocks tumbling. Biden and Sanders won’t have good answers for them, but they’ll be looking to offer themselves as a foil to a president who they say has catastrophically mishandled the pandemic.Watch for the two men to sell Americans on why they’d be best to deal with such an emergency.Biden has presented himself as a steady leader with the experience to handle a crisis. Sanders has said the outbreak underscores the need for universal health care, his signature policy issue, arguing that such a system would leave the U.S. better prepared to save lives.Let our news meet your inbox.

Will Biden make concessions to progressives?Biden has already begun speaking like the nominee and positioning himself as a uniter. He has cemented the support of moderate Democrats, but has a long way to go before winning the trust of many progressives, who view him as a milquetoast moderate who’s too wedded to the status quo to meaningfully improve the lives of struggling Americans.The former vice president made one notable concession Friday at a virtual town hall with Illinois voters: He endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan, which restores protections removed in a Biden-backed 2005 law that let young people discharge student debt in bankruptcy. It was a major reversal for Biden, and an outstretched hand to progressives.Keep an eye out for more possible olive branches.“He will make overtures to Bernie and to his supporters to show that there’s space for them on Team Biden,” a Biden aide told NBC News. “We are extremely aware of the need to unite the party.”3. Will Sanders be kind or scorch the earth?Biden-allied Democrats are desperate to end the primary and turn their attention to the faceoff with President Donald Trump. Many are nervous about a possible repeat of 2016, with a protracted primary battle that gets ugly and leaves the nominee wounded. Sanders has promised to steer clear of personal attacks and stick to debating the issues, and he made clear Wednesday he intends to challenge Biden in the debate on medical bankruptcies, climate change and billionaires trying to buy elections.The Vermont senator has dominated with primary voters under 45, who have been outmatched at the ballot box by older Democrats but will be key for Biden in the fall. Sanders has said that winning their support requires embracing their preferred policies.""I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,"" he said Wednesday. ""And you must speak to the issues of concern to them.”Sanders to Democratic establishment: You must win voters who represent the futureMarch 11, 202004:294. Will Trump keep 'defending' Sanders?Trump has sought to maximize chaos among Democrats by claiming — with no evidence — that the Democratic National Committee is conspiring to stop Sanders from claiming the nomination. It’s a repeat of his 2016 playbook, aimed at nudging Sanders supporters to stay home or vote for a third-party candidate in the fall and enable his re-election.As he coasts to renomination with no serious Republican competition, the president has developed a knack for playing pundit in the Democratic primary. Expect that to continue during Sunday’s debate — and watch to see how Sanders responds. So far, the senator has brushed back Trump’s attempts to manufacture Democratic unrest, and vowed to support the party's nominee this fall.5. How long will Sanders stay in?Sanders said last Sunday on ABC’s ""This Week"" that he’s “not a masochist who wants to stay in the race that can't be won.” How does he define a winnable contest? He still has a mathematical possibility of becoming the nominee, but that outcome would require a precipitous Biden collapse and Sanders victories by wide margins in the remaining primaries. There’s no hint of that happening. Sanders may drop some clues in the debate about his potential exit strategy.",Tonight marks the first one-on-one face off for Biden and Sanders.

"WASHINGTON — Bernie Sanders is running the wrong campaign at the wrong time, and that is the greatest gift he could give Joe Biden.In an election season in which most Democratic voters told candidates, party leaders and pollsters they cared only about beating President Donald Trump, Sanders focused first on smashing party pillars with a purist brand of progressive politics that demonized Democrats nearly as much as Republicans.He chose to divide a party desperate for unity, and he ended up with the smaller share. Now, the rest of the party has turned on him.On Tuesday night, voters soundly rejected Sanders in favor of Biden, who has leaned away from ideology and presented himself unremittingly as the singular answer to Trump. The immediate result was a wider lead for Biden in the race to accumulate delegates for the party's presidential nomination and calls from some Democratic insiders to bring the contest to an early close.""I think when the night is over, Joe Biden will be the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, and quite frankly, if the night ends the way it has begun, I think it is time for us to shut this primary down — it is time for us to cancel the rest of these debates,"" House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally, said Tuesday night on NPR.The two candidates are scheduled to face each other one-on-one on a debate stage for the first time Sunday in Arizona, a matchup that Sanders has been gearing up for as an opportunity to demonstrate that he is the better foil to Trump.But even as Biden has continued to consolidate support in whiplash fashion, the ghosts of a lost 2016 election are giving some observers reason to wonder whether it's wise to drop a hammer on Sanders.""Shutting this down prematurely would be the absolute worst thing the Democratic Party could do,"" Princeton historian Kevin M. Kruse said on Twitter. ""You can make the case that Sanders should drop out, but that's different than saying the party should come in and end this thing halfway through it. That would be bad for democracy and the Democrats alike.""Sanders: Our campaign 'won the ideological debate' despite Biden's delegate leadMarch 11, 202004:29In 2016, when Sanders ran a campaign similarly imbued with anti-establishment rhetoric, a notable percentage of his supporters refused to back the eventual nominee, Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump. To win a general election, Biden would likely need the vast majority of Sanders voters in his camp, and exit polls show that he has work to do to convince some of them to join up if he is the nominee.Let our news meet your inbox.

""We share a common goal, and together, we'll defeat Donald Trump; we'll defeat him together.”While Biden appeared ready to turn toward the general election, Sanders allies said they believe Sunday night's debate could be a turning point in the nomination contest. As of 8 a.m. ET Wednesday, as results in some areas were still being tabulated, Biden led Sanders in the delegate race 836 to 686 — still well short of the 1,991 delegates required to attain a majority at the party convention this summer.""With half of primary voters left to cast their vote, we can say one thing for certain: Voters deserve to see a one-on-one debate between the two front-runners of the Democratic Party,"" said Nomiki Konst, a Sanders ally. ""I believe the debate will highlight the clear differences between the two candidates...[and] show that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate who has the energy, ideas and movement to defeat Donald Trump.""It's little wonder why Biden's friends want the primary to end now. His performance on the campaign trail has been uneven.Less than two weeks ago, Biden looked hapless. He was winless in three primary contests, including Iowa and New Hampshire, where voters get the most face time with candidates. Democratic Party luminaries were worried about the possibility that the combination of a committed Sanders political base and a splintering of remaining voters among Biden and other candidates would allow Sanders to run away with the nomination.Then Biden won South Carolina, in large part on the strength of more than 60 percent of the state's black voters backing him. Three rivals quickly dropped out of the race, despite having publicly laid out plans to keep running. Two of them, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Pete Buttigieg rushed to Dallas to endorse Biden before last week's Super Tuesday contests in 14 states.They joined up to help Biden crush Sanders. It worked. Biden cruised through Super Tuesday, again drawing on the strength of big margins among black voters in Southern and East Coast states to rack up delegates. Surprising performances in other parts of the country helped Biden pad his edge.Ultimately, Sanders' plan to divide Democrats was effective. He just ended up on the wrong side of the split.At some level, that was probably inevitable. Even when he was winning — he finished first in the popular vote in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada — he wasn't capturing a majority. It would have been difficult in any scenario for Sanders to claim a majority of the delegates to the convention. Instead of risking an ugly floor fight in Milwaukee this summer, party leaders fell in line behind Biden.Now, Sanders needs a turnaround as abrupt as Biden's to make a comeback. After spending another campaign cycle bashing the ""establishment,"" alienating the party power-brokers who are now aligned behind Biden, that's a tall order.Biden's allies want to protect him from Sanders — and from Trump. The debate is a possible point of exposure for the former vice president.Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist who works with progressive candidates, said that's one good reason for her party not to prematurely end its primary.“We haven’t even seen him go one-on-one in a debate,” she said of Biden. “We once had a helluva field. We can’t have buyer’s remorse here.”In the NPR interview, Clyburn recalled that when Vice President George H.W. Bush's campaign attacked Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the Democratic nominee, in 1988 over a state prison furlough program, the issue had previously been raised by Al Gore, then a senator from Tennessee, in a Democratic primary debate.""People will say things,” Clyburn said, “that you cannot overcome.""For Sanders, the hope is that happens in time to reverse the course of the nomination fight.",Sanders divided Democrats and handed Biden the lion's share,Mar 11 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/sanders-divided-democrats-handed-biden-lion-s-share-n1155216,nbc

"WASHINGTON — No one needs to ""flatten the curve"" more than President Donald Trump, and he may have begun to bend the politics of coronavirus on Friday.Before Trump declared a national emergency, critics insisted, and some allies worried, that his response to the pandemic posed a greater threat to the health of the American public and the stability of the national economy than the disease itself.If the two-track crisis gets worse, his protestations that he's not to blame for a slow federal response — ""I don't take responsibility at all,"" he said — won't spare him the wrath of voters or the judgment of history. He will look like he shirked accountability after failing to see the threat as it gathered and then spread through society.But if Americans are able to slow the outbreak of coronavirus — to ""flatten the curve"" of infection, as epidemiologists say — if equity markets bounce back and the overall hit to the economy is contained, his Rose Garden news conference on Friday could amount to a turning point in which he finally signaled to the public that he would take the threat seriously enough to lead the fight against it.His relatively somber and focused remarks accompanied a bear hug of congressional Democrats that could help him stabilize his standing if all goes well from here on out. Graded on a curve, Friday was a good day for the president, according to longtime observers of Washington politics.""America only has one president at a time, and, whatever your partisan affiliation, you should want the one we have to be as efficient and successful as possible — especially in a crisis like this one,"" said Michael Steel, a former aide to then-Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceFor those watching the news conference on cable stations with stock-market tickers on the screen, it was obvious the president had done nothing to reverse a rally on Wall Street. It's hard to pin broad gains or losses on any single event, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped briefly during the president's remarks before gaining nearly 1,200 points while he continued through the closing bell.Trump's new attitude toward the coronavirus appeared to result from — or at least coincide with — a rare bipartisanship around the response from other officials in Washington.Little more than an hour after his declaration, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced that two days of intense negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over a second emergency spending bill on the coronavirus had produced a deal.""We are proud to have reached an agreement with the administration to resolve outstanding challenges, and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act,"" she said in a statement sent to the media. That came on the heels of a quick pivot from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the previous day, who went from attacking Pelosi's plan on the Senate floor to lauding her work with Mnuchin on Twitter in the span of a few hours. Trump was expected to sign off on the deal — though the ink wasn't quite dry yet.Likewise, Trump won praise from Democrats on Capitol Hill for declaring the national emergency, freeing up $50 billion in aid for states and granting extraordinary authorities to federal agencies to help the health care system respond to contingencies. As they worked with officials in his administration on emergency spending legislation, congressional Democrats had been troubled by the president's uneven public posture on a pandemic he often dismissed as ""low risk.""""We have a public health crisis in this country and the best way to help keep the American people safe and ensure their economic security is for the president to focus on fighting the spread of the coronavirus itself,"" Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement after Trump delivered an Oval Office address on the disease response Wednesday. ""Alarmingly, the president did not say how the administration will address the lack of coronavirus testing kits throughout the United States.""At the time, they called on him and Republican lawmakers to help them pass the legislation Pelosi negotiated with Mnuchin.But Trump's decision to give only his second-ever Oval Office address this week was taken by some observers, even amid his misstatements, as a strong signal that he wanted the public and investors to view him as taking the coronavirus threat very seriously.The slope of everything looked straight down, from historic market drops to suspended major league sports seasons and the availability of hand sanitizer.It's unlikely that Trump reversed all that by managing to complete a press conference without giving off the impression he's unconcerned about coronavirus.But right now, just flattening the curve a bit is a victory for him.",How Trump may have flattened the political curve of coronavirus,Mar 14 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/how-trump-may-have-flattened-political-curve-coronavirus-n1158616,nbc
"President Donald Trump on Friday announced a new series of measures to combat the coronavirus and treat those who are affected, while pushing back on criticism that his administration was unprepared to confront the pandemic.Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Trump declared a national emergency that could free up $50 billion to help fight the pandemic and said that he was empowering the secretary of Health and Human Services to waive certain laws and regulations to ensure the virus can be contained and patients treated.""To unleash the full power of the federal government … I am officially declaring a national emergency,"" Trump said.""Two very big words,"" he added.Trump said the action would ""open up access"" to up to $50 billion ""for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.""Flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top federal officials and corporate executives from companies such as Walmart, Trump said that the ability to waive certain laws and regulations would allow for easier admission to nursing homes and end limits on the length of hospital stays and the number of beds available.Trump: We are in 'very strong shape' to provide necessary coronavirus testsMarch 13, 202002:35He announced that 1.4 million new tests for the coronavirus would be available next week and that 5 million would be available within the next month — although he added that ""I doubt we'll need that"" quantity. He also said there were plans to allow ""drive-thru"" virus tests.In an unusual and lengthy news conference, a parade of business leaders took turns speaking after Trump — before the president and other federal officials made additional key announcements related to the administration’s coronavirus response.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakTrump shook hands with several of those business leaders as he introduced them at the lectern — a breach of best practices recommended by public health experts across the United States.After the corporate leaders spoke, Trump and other officials finally announced additional measures to confront the pandemic, which included the waiving of interest on federal student loans and the purchase of “large quantities” of oil for the U.S. strategic oil reserve. Officials also said they would be offering guidance to suspend all visitations to nursing homes, with exceptions being made only for end-of-life situations.Nevertheless, the stock market — which had in recent days fallen 20 percent from its latest high, delving formally to bear territory — reacted favorably to the announcement.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose steadily as Trump spoke and closed for the day up nearly 2,000 points, or 9.4 percent.Trump, seen in photographs to have been in close proximity with people who have since tested positive for the coronavirus, also suggested Friday he would “most likely” get tested for the disease.Let our news meet your inbox.

Plans for the emergency declaration were first reported by Bloomberg News.Under the Stafford Act, an ""infectious disease emergency declaration"" by the president would allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide disaster relief funding to state and local governments, as well as federal assistance to support the coronavirus response. The law allows the agency to circumvent legal barriers to more quickly distribute such aid.Emergency declarations are most often used in the event of natural disasters, but can also be applied to disease outbreaks.The president had tweeted earlier about the Friday press conference amid the rapid spread of the virus and as the White House has scrambled to craft a strategy to shift Trump's response to the outbreak, which had been focused on downplaying the threat and accusing the media of creating undue concern.Trump has come under increasing fire in recent weeks over his response to the outbreak while his administration weathered criticism for the lack of coronavirus testing being done compared with other countries.Asked Friday at his press conference by NBC News’ Kristen Welker whether he should take responsibility for the failure to disseminate larger quantities of tests earlier, Trump declined.""I don't take responsibility at all,” he said.Trump also responded testily to a question from another reporter about a decision made by the administration in 2018 to disband the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense — a unit sometimes referred to as the White House pandemic office.Trump called the question “nasty” and replied, “I didn’t do it.”“You say we did that, I don't know anything about it,” Trump said.In addition to having insisted for weeks that he had the outbreak under control, Trump has also propagated personal beliefs about the coronavirus that contradict those of veteran health officials and experts.As panic began to set in over the outbreak, Trump tried to quell the fears of Americans across the country by giving a speech from the Oval Office on Wednesday night. He announced that he would ban many foreign travelers from Europe for the next 30 days and offered a series of economic relief actions to help workers and companies deal with the outbreak. But his speech was met with swift pushback after he misstated several aspects of the policy and failed to propose any new action to combat the outbreak domestically.Health officials in recent days have sounded the alarm, warning the public that the outbreak is likely to get worse. Many major public events, including all NBA, NHL, MLB and Major League Soccer preseason games and Broadway shows, have been canceled this week, and Thursday saw the Dow's worst day since the 1987 crash.Wall Street, however, rallied Friday, bouncing firmly back after lawmakers and the White House appeared close to finalizing an economic relief package to address the coronavirus pandemic.",Trump declares national emergency to combat the coronavirus,Mar 13 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-hold-friday-afternoon-press-conference-coronavirus-n1157981,nbc

"WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump jetted back to Washington on Monday after a weekend of golfing and fundraising in Florida, an intervention was awaiting him at the White House.Administration officials, increasingly concerned about the messaging on and response to the coronavirus, had spent the weekend scrambling to craft a strategy to shift the president's response, which had been focused on downplaying the threat and accusing the media of creating undue concern, according to people involved in the effort.So, as Trump stepped off Marine One and walked straight to the West Wing just after 3 p.m. Monday, his top economic and health officials were waiting to make their case for why a more serious fiscal and public health response was urgently needed. Those at the meeting included economic adviser Larry Kudlow, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin.Shortly after the meeting wrapped, Trump appeared ready to start taking a stronger approach — at least compared to the one he had offered that morning, when he likened the coronavirus to the seasonal flu, tweeting of the flu that ""nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on.""He made an impromptu visit to the White House briefing room that evening, just the fifth time he has appeared behind the podium, telling reporters he was considering a payroll tax cut and promising ""dramatic"" and ""major"" economic steps.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakThose remarks Monday night marked the beginning of a notable, if uneven, shift in the president's tone as the scope of the crisis he was dealing with began to sink in, culminating just over 48 hours later in an Oval Office address warning the nation of a ""horrible infection.""Beyond the input of concerned advisers, a constellation of events over the past week — from tumbling stocks to the rising death toll and the World Health Organization's official declaration of a pandemic — played a role in prompting Trump to shift to a more somber tone, an administration official said.It resulted in presidential statements in stark contrast to remarks just two weeks earlier, when Trump had predicted that the United States would soon have zero cases of the illness, despite warnings from his own health officials that the virus' spread across the nation wasn't a matter of if but when.We apologize, this video has expired.Normal life comes to a halt for Americans in response to coronavirusMarch 13, 202002:08As Trump left Washington last Friday for his Mar-a-Lago resort, he stopped at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where he touted the administration's response and mused about not wanting to let passengers on a stranded cruise ship back in the U.S. because it would reflect poorly on the statistics.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service""I like the numbers being where they are. I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship,"" Trump told reporters.Over the weekend, he golfed with players from the Washington Nationals and raised $10 million in a series of fundraisers. During a dinner with the president of Brazil, Trump told reporters Saturday night that he wouldn't be canceling his crowded political rallies.On Sunday, while Trump was at his Palm Beach golf course, Pence was about an hour away meeting with cruise industry executives about the coronavirus threat.Back in Washington, aides had grown frustrated with Trump's consistent bids to downplay the severity of the outbreak. A person close to the White House said the president believed it helped him politically to keep projecting a positive picture, rather than leaving the messaging to public health officials.But Trump's week started with a jolt. Oil markets crashed overnight and stocks plunged so much at the start of trading Monday that it tripped a New York Stock Exchange circuit breaker aimed at preventing a broader panic by investors. Trump tried to put a positive spin on the events that morning, tweeting that tumbling oil prices would mean cheaper gas for consumers.The next day, he traveled to Capitol Hill, where Republican senators warned him about the negative impact the crash in oil prices would have on the U.S. oil industry and the risk to the nation's economy as a whole.The same day, even his own campaign advisers — who had previously downplayed the need to change his schedule — pressed Trump not to announce a planned rally in Florida because of fears of the virus' spread. The president initially pushed back on the request.But it came amid news of a cascade in new infections, with states taking swift action, such as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's move to send in the National Guard to try to contain an outbreak in a New York City suburb.The virus also began affecting Trump's inner circle. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who flew back from Florida to Washington with Trump on Monday, learned midflight that he had interacted with an infected patient and would need to self-quarantine immediately.By Wednesday morning, when WHO declared that the coronavirus was officially a pandemic, White House aides began discussing the possibility of an Oval Office address. Trump tweeted out that he would be speaking to the nation later that night.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakIn the runup to his prime-time speech, the White House rushed to put restrictions on travel from Europe in place — without informing European leaders, who were furious over being blindsided by the move. Trump said the affected countries hadn't been notified because ""we had to make a decision, and I didn't want to take time and — you know, it takes a long time to make the individual calls.""The hastily assembled speech was full of statements the administration had to correct and clarify soon after. Trump erroneously said trade would be affected by the travel restrictions. He also said all travel from Europe would be banned, even though the new restrictions apply only to foreign nationals who have traveled through some European countries. His claim that insurance copayments for coronavirus treatment would be waived was contradicted by health insurers themselves, who said the waiver would apply only to testing.The stumbles, people close to the White House acknowledged, detracted from the intended effect of the address: portraying Trump as a commander in chief steering the country through a crisis.On Thursday, Trump's Twitter account took on a much more serious tone, retweeting warnings from public health officials about how people could protect themselves, as both the White House and his campaign weighed allowing staffers to work from home. But as with many previous Trump tone shifts, his attempt at a more traditional presidential approach was inconsistent and impermanent.Meanwhile, one of the nation's top health officials was telling lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the federal response was falling short on a key front, with the nation failing to meet the necessary capacity for coronavirus testing. That didn't keep Trump from heaping praise on his own response Thursday.""Because of what I did and what the administration did with China, we have 32 deaths at this point. Other countries that are smaller countries have many, many deaths,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with the Irish prime minister.""Thirty-two is a lot. Thirty-two is too many,"" he said. ""But when you look at the kind of numbers that you're seeing coming out of other countries, it's pretty amazing when you think of it.""",Behind Trump's coronavirus shift,Mar 12 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/behind-trump-s-coronavirus-shift-n1157321,nbc
"WASHINGTON — Underdog Bernie Sanders came to fight, and front-runner Joe Biden promised a woman vice presidential candidate.The Democratic debate Sunday began as a genteel conversation over how to address the coronavirus and descended into a testy battle over records and who has the courage to do the right thing. The candidates clashed over issues from bankruptcy policy and same-sex marriage to health care and immigration, highlighting their differing visions for the country.The debate was hosted by CNN and Univision in the nation's capital with no live audience and 6 feet between the candidates' podiums. There was no handshake as the two men instead elbow-bumped to practice social distancing as the coronavirus ravages the U.S. and shuts down much of American public life.Here are five key takeaways from the evening.Biden promises a female running mateFor the first time, Biden committed Sunday to selecting a woman to be his running mate if he's the Democratic nominee, adding that he wants his Cabinet to look like the diverse country.""I would pick a woman to be my vice president,"" he said.Sanders said he was inclined to pick a woman but stopped short of an ironclad promise, saying it's important that his running mate is progressive.

Biden pointedly said he'd call on the military to help address the crisis, while Sanders said the use of the National Guard might be appropriate.Biden followed a familiar playbook — accept Sanders' concerns but resist his prescriptions. He said that his rival was right about the broken health care system but that single payer was not the solution; he said that economic inequality was a real issue but that the imminent crisis required a targeted solution in the form of ""a major, major, major bailout package"" that rewards individuals, not corporations.Biden was also eager to defuse the tension as he courts Sanders' supporters, saying at one point, ""I don't want to get this into a back and forth in terms of our politics."" The former vice president, who is trying to unite the party behind him, let it be known on several occasions when he agreed with Sanders.Sanders: Pandemic exposes 'incredible weakness' of health care systemMarch 16, 202001:30Sanders draws blood on Social SecurityThe most heated part of the debate came when Sanders tore into Biden for a litany of past positions — his stance on the 2005 bankruptcy law (which Biden has agreed to try to unwind), his vote to authorize the Iraq war, his support for the Defense of Marriage Act in the '90s. He also knocked Biden for supporting efforts that would have cut Social Security, such as the Bowles-Simpson commission and balanced budget amendments.""You're an honest guy. Why don't you just tell them the truth here?"" Sanders said in a feisty clash full of interruptions and cries of ""Bernie!"" and ""Joe!""""We did not cut it,"" Biden said.""I know, because people like me helped stop it,"" Sanders retorted.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsSanders said Biden lacked the courage to take difficult stances when they were unpopular. Biden said Sanders had previously voted against background checks for gun sales and to grant immunity to firearm manufacturers (two positions the senator from Vermont has since disavowed).""He's making it hard for me now — I was trying to give him credit for some things,"" Biden quipped, saying that when it comes to addressing climate change, ""we disagree on the detail of how we do it. But we don't disagree on the principle.""Sanders evokes ObamaIt was a role reversal: When Biden tore into Sanders for opposing the 2007 immigration bill that would have granted undocumented people a pathway to citizenship, Sanders name-checked President Barack Obama in reference to the so-called Dorgan amendment, which gutted the guest-worker program and ultimately derailed the measure in the Senate.""Y'know who voted with me on that one, Joe? Barack Obama,"" Sanders said.He was correct that Obama, then in the Senate, voted for the amendment, but he neglected to mention what happened next: Obama voted ""yes"" to advance the legislation to a final vote, while Sanders voted ""no"" and joined the coalition that killed it.Team Trump was watching BidenThe Trump campaign kept an eagle eye on Biden during the debate in the hope of amassing an opposition research file on its likely general election opponent. It has paid special attention to his verbal stumbles in recent public events, and it delighted Sunday in pointing out mid-debate that the former vice president, who overcame a speech impediment as a young man, got tongue-tied early on and called the H1N1 virus the ""N1H1"" virus.An aide to President Donald Trump also highlighted Biden's suggestion that he'd limit deportations to people who have committed felonies, a sign that the president may try to weaponize the issue in the fall.",5 takeaways from the Democratic debate,Mar 16 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/5-takeaways-democratic-debate-joe-biden-promises-woman-vp-n1160001,nbc

If you are in an area where there's clear community spread, you have to be much, much more intense about how you do that,” he said on “Meet the Press” yesterday.“I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting,” he also said on “Meet” yesterday, adding: “I think Americans should be prepared that they're going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing.”And here was Fauci on CNN: “I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and in bars.”Data Download: The number of the day is … 50 people or more50 people or more.Let our news meet your inbox.

We don't want to be getting in the habit of messing around with them,” Sanders began, before bringing up the precedent of the postponed New York primary after 9/11. “I would hope governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is, you just indicated, we don't want gatherings of more than 50 people,” Sanders said. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people – all that stuff. It does not make a lot of sense. I'm not sure that it does.”The Lid: Going the (social) distanceDon’t miss the pod from Friday, when we wondered how campaigning can go on in a world of social distancing.ICYMI: News clips you shouldn’t missSahil Kapur offers his takeaways from last night’s debate.Biden pledged to pick a female running mate, while Sanders said he’s likely to do the same.And the former vice president is shifting his stances on free college and bankruptcy in an effort to reach out to progressives.The Fed is slashing interest rates to zero.Andrew Gillum is entering rehab.Trump Agenda: In like FlynnTrump says he’s “strongly considering” pardoning Michael Flynn.The president’s superfans are starting to fracture over the virus.Governors like J.B.

"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Former Florida candidate for governor Andrew Gillum disclosed Sunday that he is entering a rehabilitation facility, saying he had fallen into a depression and alcohol abuse after losing his bid for the state’s highest post.The Democrat’s statement came days after Gillum was named in a South Florida police report Friday that said he was “inebriated” and initially unresponsive in a hotel room along with a male companion where authorities found baggies of suspected crystal methamphetamine.Gillum, the former Tallahassee mayor who ran for governor in 2018, was not charged with any crime. The Miami Beach police report said Gillum was allowed to leave the hotel for home after he was checked out medically.Gillum said in his statement Sunday night that he resolved to seek help after conversations with his family and deep reflection, calling the decision “a wake-up call for me.”“Since my race for governor ended, I fell into a depression that has led to alcohol abuse,” he said, pledging to work to “heal fully and show up in the world as a more complete person.”He said he would be stepping down from “all public facing roles” at this time.Let our news meet your inbox.

Police say Gillum and two other men were in the hotel room.“Mr. Gillum was unable to communicate due to his inebriated state,” the police report said.Police say one of the men came into the hotel room and found Gillum and Travis Dyson, 30, apparently under the influence of an “unknown substance.” Officials began chest compressions on Dyson and he was taken to a hospital, where authorities say he is in stable condition.Gillum had stable medical signs when authorities returned for a welfare check and was allowed to leave the hotel for home, according to the police report.Gillum was the first black nominee in a major political party to run for governor in Florida. He lost narrowly to Republican Ron DeSantis in the 2018 election.Since then, Gillum has mounted an effort to register Democratic voters in Florida and frequently appears on cable news channels as a political commentator.In 2019, the Florida Commission on Ethics found probable cause that Gillum violated state ethics laws when he accepted gifts during out-of-town excursions with lobbyists and vendors and failed to report them. This included tickets to a performance of the musical “Hamilton.” A settlement of $5,000 was agreed to in that case.",Ex-Florida gov. candidate Andrew Gillum to enter rehab for alcohol abuse,Mar 16 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/ex-florida-gov-candidate-andrew-gillum-enter-rehab-alcohol-abuse-n1160161,nbc
"The nation's response to the coronavirus outbreak dominated much of the discussion in the 11th Democratic debate on Sunday night — the first time that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders went head to head on stage in the 2020 election cycle.Also a first: Biden vowing to name a woman as his running mate if he wins the nomination.The former vice president and Vermont independent senator squared off in dramatically different surroundings than initially planned, Washington instead of Phoenix, and in CNN's studio instead of a 5,000-seat theater with a live audience — a venue change prompted by coronavirus fears as the nation goes into lockdown over the pandemic.Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination following a string of state primary victories since winning in South Carolina last month.

"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden's campaign rolled out two new policy positions that borrow from Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren ahead of Sunday's debate, both aimed at courting progressive voters as he marches to the Democratic nomination.The former vice president said Sunday he'll support a policy to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for students with family incomes under $125,000.The position is a significant shift in the direction of Sanders, the senator from Vermont who wrote a bill to the same effect in 2017 but has since called for free college to be universal regardless of household income. Biden's new stance mirrors a policy plank that Hillary Clinton announced in summer 2016 with the similar aim of reaching out to Sanders voters after she defeated him.Biden leads Sanders by 2-to-1 margin among Democratic primary votersMarch 15, 202001:43Let our news meet your inbox.

The reversal of his position on bankruptcy echoes his U-turn on some tough-on-crime positions that he successfully fought for in 1994 but which voters have since turned against.Biden's recent shifts track the direction of a Democratic electorate that has been embracing more progressive positions since the last time the former vice president was on the ballot in 2012, and they aim to show liberals and younger voters that he can be a vehicle to advance their causes.Sanders addressed his rival's new policy Sunday, saying in a statement that it is ""great that Joe Biden is now supporting a position that was in the Democratic platform four years ago."" He called on him to ""go much further"" by endorsing universal free college, canceling all student debt and taxing ""Wall Street speculation.""Sanders' prospects of winning the nomination have dimmed in the last two weeks. He has said in recent days that he will press Biden on numerous issues at the debate, including how to address the issues that liberal Democratic voters care about if he becomes president.""Joe Biden will make it clear to Senator Sanders' supporters that there's space for them and that we welcome their support,"" a senior Biden campaign adviser said, previewing the debate.

"WASHINGTON — The last time Democrats debated, Bernie Sanders had just won two consecutive states and Joe Biden’s campaign was on the brink of collapse. The two men will debate one-on-one Sunday in a transformed campaign landscape.The stage has shrunk from six to two candidates, Biden has taken a dominant lead in the race, and the coronavirus outbreak has ground much of American public life to a halt. Biden and Sanders have been forced to cancel their rallies and host online events instead, while the party moved Sunday's debate from Phoenix to CNN's Washington studio to avoid cross-country travel.After crushing the field in South Carolina and two successive Tuesdays of victories across the country, Biden leads by about 150 delegates, which will be so difficult to erase that some party elites are already treating him as the presumptive nominee.Here are five things to watch at Sunday night's faceoff.1. Who wins the coronavirus clash?Americans are desperate to know when normal life will resume after the virus has shuttered schools, businesses and sports leagues, causing layoffs and sending stocks tumbling. Biden and Sanders won’t have good answers for them, but they’ll be looking to offer themselves as a foil to a president who they say has catastrophically mishandled the pandemic.Watch for the two men to sell Americans on why they’d be best to deal with such an emergency.Biden has presented himself as a steady leader with the experience to handle a crisis. Sanders has said the outbreak underscores the need for universal health care, his signature policy issue, arguing that such a system would leave the U.S. better prepared to save lives.Let our news meet your inbox.

Will Biden make concessions to progressives?Biden has already begun speaking like the nominee and positioning himself as a uniter. He has cemented the support of moderate Democrats, but has a long way to go before winning the trust of many progressives, who view him as a milquetoast moderate who’s too wedded to the status quo to meaningfully improve the lives of struggling Americans.The former vice president made one notable concession Friday at a virtual town hall with Illinois voters: He endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan, which restores protections removed in a Biden-backed 2005 law that let young people discharge student debt in bankruptcy. It was a major reversal for Biden, and an outstretched hand to progressives.Keep an eye out for more possible olive branches.“He will make overtures to Bernie and to his supporters to show that there’s space for them on Team Biden,” a Biden aide told NBC News. “We are extremely aware of the need to unite the party.”3. Will Sanders be kind or scorch the earth?Biden-allied Democrats are desperate to end the primary and turn their attention to the faceoff with President Donald Trump. Many are nervous about a possible repeat of 2016, with a protracted primary battle that gets ugly and leaves the nominee wounded. Sanders has promised to steer clear of personal attacks and stick to debating the issues, and he made clear Wednesday he intends to challenge Biden in the debate on medical bankruptcies, climate change and billionaires trying to buy elections.The Vermont senator has dominated with primary voters under 45, who have been outmatched at the ballot box by older Democrats but will be key for Biden in the fall. Sanders has said that winning their support requires embracing their preferred policies.""I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,"" he said Wednesday. ""And you must speak to the issues of concern to them.”Sanders to Democratic establishment: You must win voters who represent the futureMarch 11, 202004:294. Will Trump keep 'defending' Sanders?Trump has sought to maximize chaos among Democrats by claiming — with no evidence — that the Democratic National Committee is conspiring to stop Sanders from claiming the nomination. It’s a repeat of his 2016 playbook, aimed at nudging Sanders supporters to stay home or vote for a third-party candidate in the fall and enable his re-election.As he coasts to renomination with no serious Republican competition, the president has developed a knack for playing pundit in the Democratic primary. Expect that to continue during Sunday’s debate — and watch to see how Sanders responds. So far, the senator has brushed back Trump’s attempts to manufacture Democratic unrest, and vowed to support the party's nominee this fall.5. How long will Sanders stay in?Sanders said last Sunday on ABC’s ""This Week"" that he’s “not a masochist who wants to stay in the race that can't be won.” How does he define a winnable contest? He still has a mathematical possibility of becoming the nominee, but that outcome would require a precipitous Biden collapse and Sanders victories by wide margins in the remaining primaries. There’s no hint of that happening. Sanders may drop some clues in the debate about his potential exit strategy.",5 things to watch in the Biden-Sanders debate,Mar 15 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/5-things-watch-biden-sanders-debate-amid-coronavirus-crisis-n1159081,nbc
"WASHINGTON — With the Democratic nomination race now down to a one-on-one contest between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Democratic primary voters now back Biden — who was a distant second to Sanders just one month ago — by an overwhelming 2-to-1 ratio, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.The survey found that 61 percent of Democratic voters support Biden, while just 32 percent back Sanders. Four percent choose Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who has not yet dropped out of the race despite failing to finish in the top three in any state primary or caucus.Biden's surge of more than 45 percentage points in four weeks shows how quickly he became the consensus choice of Democratic voters as the field narrowed to just two major candidates. The NBC News/WSJ poll in February, which was conducted before Biden's decisive win in the South Carolina primary changed the trajectory of the race, found Sanders besting Biden, 27 percent to 15 percent, while candidates who have since dropped out — former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — divided the rest of the vote.All of those candidates except Warren have since thrown their support behind Biden.Democratic voters are also significantly more likely than they were last month to say they are enthusiastic about Biden's campaign. In February, just 13 percent said they were enthusiastic about him, while 43 percent said they were merely comfortable, and a combined 43 percent said they had reservations or were uncomfortable. Now, 37 percent say they're enthusiastic about Biden, 37 percent say they are comfortable, and just 25 percent express reservations or discomfort.For Sanders, less has changed since February. This month, a combined 66 percent of Democratic voters say they are either enthusiastic (27 percent) or comfortable (39 percent) with him. Last month, it was a combined 65 percent.Let our news meet your inbox.

Among voters under 35, just a quarter chose Biden, while 7-in-10 pick Sanders.Biden leads Trump by 9 points in a one-to-one matchupAmong all registered voters, Biden leads President Donald Trump outside the poll's margin of error in a head-to-head contest. In a hypothetical one-on-one general election contest, 52 percent of all voters say they would choose Biden, while 43 percent say they would choose Trump.For Sanders, it's 49 percent saying they would support him, while 45 percent back Trump.In the matchup between Biden and Trump, Biden has the backing of a majority of independents (59 percent), women (63 percent) and white voters with college degrees (53 percent). He is also the overwhelming choice of nonwhite voters, getting support from 70 percent of Latinos and 84 percent of black voters.Trump receives majority support from white voters (51 percent), men (53 percent) and white voters without college degrees (57 percent).Among suburban voters, Biden gets 49 percent, while Trump gets 45 percent.And among voters in 2016 swing states, Biden gets 50 percent, while Trump gets 42 percent.Still, Trump continues to enjoy the most fervent support from his backers. Among all voters, 27 percent say they're enthusiastic about his candidacy, compared with 15 percent for Biden and 13 percent for Sanders.But nearly half of all voters — 48 percent — say they're very uncomfortable with his run. That's compared with 31 percent who say the same of Biden and 42 percent who say the same of Sanders.The NBC News/WSJ live-caller poll was conducted March 11-13, 2020. The poll surveyed 900 registered voters, including 438 Democratic primary voters. The margin of error for all voters is +/- 3.27 percentage points.

"The nation's response to the coronavirus outbreak dominated much of the discussion in the 11th Democratic debate on Sunday night — the first time that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders went head to head on stage in the 2020 election cycle.Also a first: Biden vowing to name a woman as his running mate if he wins the nomination.The former vice president and Vermont independent senator squared off in dramatically different surroundings than initially planned, Washington instead of Phoenix, and in CNN's studio instead of a 5,000-seat theater with a live audience — a venue change prompted by coronavirus fears as the nation goes into lockdown over the pandemic.Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination following a string of state primary victories since winning in South Carolina last month.

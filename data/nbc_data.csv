"President Donald Trump on Friday announced a new series of measures to combat the coronavirus and treat those who are affected, while pushing back on criticism that his administration was unprepared to confront the pandemic.Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Trump declared a national emergency that could free up $50 billion to help fight the pandemic and said that he was empowering the secretary of Health and Human Services to waive certain laws and regulations to ensure the virus can be contained and patients treated.""To unleash the full power of the federal government … I am officially declaring a national emergency,"" Trump said.""Two very big words,"" he added.Trump said the action would ""open up access"" to up to $50 billion ""for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.""Flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top federal officials and corporate executives from companies such as Walmart, Trump said that the ability to waive certain laws and regulations would allow for easier admission to nursing homes and end limits on the length of hospital stays and the number of beds available.Trump: We are in 'very strong shape' to provide necessary coronavirus testsMarch 13, 202002:35He announced that 1.4 million new tests for the coronavirus would be available next week and that 5 million would be available within the next month — although he added that ""I doubt we'll need that"" quantity. He also said there were plans to allow ""drive-thru"" virus tests.In an unusual and lengthy news conference, a parade of business leaders took turns speaking after Trump — before the president and other federal officials made additional key announcements related to the administration’s coronavirus response.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakTrump shook hands with several of those business leaders as he introduced them at the lectern — a breach of best practices recommended by public health experts across the United States.After the corporate leaders spoke, Trump and other officials finally announced additional measures to confront the pandemic, which included the waiving of interest on federal student loans and the purchase of “large quantities” of oil for the U.S. strategic oil reserve. Officials also said they would be offering guidance to suspend all visitations to nursing homes, with exceptions being made only for end-of-life situations.Nevertheless, the stock market — which had in recent days fallen 20 percent from its latest high, delving formally to bear territory — reacted favorably to the announcement.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose steadily as Trump spoke and closed for the day up nearly 2,000 points, or 9.4 percent.Trump, seen in photographs to have been in close proximity with people who have since tested positive for the coronavirus, also suggested Friday he would “most likely” get tested for the disease.Let our news meet your inbox.

Plans for the emergency declaration were first reported by Bloomberg News.Under the Stafford Act, an ""infectious disease emergency declaration"" by the president would allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide disaster relief funding to state and local governments, as well as federal assistance to support the coronavirus response. The law allows the agency to circumvent legal barriers to more quickly distribute such aid.Emergency declarations are most often used in the event of natural disasters, but can also be applied to disease outbreaks.The president had tweeted earlier about the Friday press conference amid the rapid spread of the virus and as the White House has scrambled to craft a strategy to shift Trump's response to the outbreak, which had been focused on downplaying the threat and accusing the media of creating undue concern.Trump has come under increasing fire in recent weeks over his response to the outbreak while his administration weathered criticism for the lack of coronavirus testing being done compared with other countries.Asked Friday at his press conference by NBC News’ Kristen Welker whether he should take responsibility for the failure to disseminate larger quantities of tests earlier, Trump declined.""I don't take responsibility at all,” he said.Trump also responded testily to a question from another reporter about a decision made by the administration in 2018 to disband the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense — a unit sometimes referred to as the White House pandemic office.Trump called the question “nasty” and replied, “I didn’t do it.”“You say we did that, I don't know anything about it,” Trump said.In addition to having insisted for weeks that he had the outbreak under control, Trump has also propagated personal beliefs about the coronavirus that contradict those of veteran health officials and experts.As panic began to set in over the outbreak, Trump tried to quell the fears of Americans across the country by giving a speech from the Oval Office on Wednesday night. He announced that he would ban many foreign travelers from Europe for the next 30 days and offered a series of economic relief actions to help workers and companies deal with the outbreak. But his speech was met with swift pushback after he misstated several aspects of the policy and failed to propose any new action to combat the outbreak domestically.Health officials in recent days have sounded the alarm, warning the public that the outbreak is likely to get worse. Many major public events, including all NBA, NHL, MLB and Major League Soccer preseason games and Broadway shows, have been canceled this week, and Thursday saw the Dow's worst day since the 1987 crash.Wall Street, however, rallied Friday, bouncing firmly back after lawmakers and the White House appeared close to finalizing an economic relief package to address the coronavirus pandemic.",Trump declares national emergency to combat coronavirus,Mar 13 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-hold-friday-afternoon-press-conference-coronavirus-n1157981,nbc
"With the coronavirus pandemic wreaking havoc on stock markets, sports leagues and everyday life, it comes as no surprise that the presidential race isn't being spared.Enter: the virtual campaign.Say goodbye to big rallies with long lines, smaller meet-and-greets, volunteers knocking on your door. All you'll need now to ""attend"" your favorite candidate's event is an internet-connected device — please do so in your pajamas if you like.""We're in a moment where I think the requirement of having your face out there for campaigns has perhaps faded a little,"" said Rick Wilson, a former GOP consultant.Faced with the very real and rapidly growing fear about the spread of the coronavirus, the remaining candidates — Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders — are doing everything they can to keep their supporters excited without doing so in the large venues that public health experts say is where the virus can be easily spread.Biden, Sanders cancel rallies amid coronavirus concernsMarch 10, 202000:52Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, announced this week that his campaign had changed all of its scheduled coming campaign events to be ""virtual"" with no large crowds attending.That included a previously scheduled event Friday in Chicago and a previously scheduled appearance Monday in Miami. The Chicago event has been recast as a ""virtual town hall."" (Biden also canceled a campaign event that had been scheduled for Thursday in Tampa, Florida, out of concern for public health and replaced it with a speech on the coronavirus epidemic, which he delivered from his hometown, Wilmington, Delaware, and was broadcast online.)Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakWhat exactly those coming virtual campaign events will look like isn't clear, but experts said they're very likely to closely resemble a Biden event on Tuesday.

Campaigns are essentially reaching voters on their computers, tablets and mobile phones as much as they are via school gymnasiums,"" Ferguson added. ""So these changes are just supercharging a phenomenon that had already been happening.""The shift may also help candidates maintain control of their messages and of the events — which can often be disrupted by protesters.In addition, the Biden campaign said Thursday that all employees at the Philadelphia campaign headquarters and in all field offices across the U.S. will work from home starting Saturday. The campaign also said all campaign offices will be closed to the public.The Trump campaign, on the other hand, hasn't unveiled any specific plans for virtual campaign events, although campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told NBC News that because the campaign is ""built on data and uses technology to its highest advantages,"" it is better positioned to ""virtually engage voters than any other campaign.”Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsThe campaign has in recent days canceled or postponed several events that Trump or surrogates had been scheduled to attend. The White House also said a California fundraiser that first lady Melania Trump had been scheduled to attend next Wednesday had been canceled, and the campaign canceled a ""Women for Trump"" bus tour that was supposed to have taken place this week in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as a ""Catholics for Trump"" event that was to have taken place in Milwaukee next Thursday.Murtaugh said the Trump campaign was letting staffers work from home.And Trump Victory, the joint operation between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, said Thursday night that it will shift to ""virtual events"" for volunteer-oriented gatherings.The Sanders campaign, for its part, said Thursday that it would no longer hold ""large events or door-to-door canvasses, instead moving to digital formats and outreach wherever possible.""Mike Casca, the campaign's communications director, added that the campaign had asked all staff to work from home.Sanders has already delivered two speeches — one Wednesday about staying in the presidential race and one Thursday about the coronavirus — that had no audiences.Wilson, the GOP consultant, said it may offer a preview of the future of campaigning.""There are so many tools now to propagate a livestream, so many tools that give you the capacity to watch on your device, to watch your candidate streaming on your tablet, on your phone,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden is winning the delegate race over Bernie Sanders. Now comes the hard part — winning over Sanders' supporters.""Bernie brothers,"" as Biden himself called them at a fundraiser last week, are known for their loyalty to the senator from Vermont and their defections in 2016 to Donald Trump and third-party candidates may have contributed to Hillary Clinton's loss.At the end of their long, bitter primary, Clinton put the onus on Sanders to bring his backers into the fold. To avoid a repeat of four years ago, Biden will likely have to be more proactive and not count on Sanders to do the work unifying the party for him — even if that means the former vice president will have to turn the other cheek to ongoing attacks and rein in his own supporters' desire to gloat or to speed Sanders' exit.Sanders: Our campaign 'won the ideological debate' despite Biden's delegate leadMarch 11, 202004:29Jennifer Palmieri, who was Clinton's communications director four years ago, said Biden needs to give Sanders' campaign space, pay homage to the movement it built, and recognize that attempts to strong-arm the candidate or his supporters will most likely backfire.""You can't force Bernie Sanders supporters to do anything. Even Bernie Sanders can't force Bernie Sanders supporters to do anything,"" she said. ""Letting Sanders determine what's best for his people is probably ultimately what's best for Biden, so long as Sanders supporters are not echoing Trump's arguments.""""Outside pressure, forcing Sanders out of the race, is, I think, a big mistake,"" she added. ""Either Bernie Sanders is going to want to help the Democratic nominee or not. I believe that he does, so then you've got to give that campaign the room to do this the best way they can.""Bernie Sanders vows to stay in race after Joe Biden solidifies delegate leadMarch 11, 202001:30Biden got off on the right foot, she said, by extending the olive branch in a speech after his victories on Tuesday.""I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless passion,"" Biden said. ""We share a common goal, and together we'll defeat Donald Trump.""Sanders plans to stay in the race through at least Sunday's debate, the first one-on-one with Biden, when it will become clear how aggressively Sanders plans to go after his rival.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceStill, in a sign of how difficult this will be, some Sanders allies chafed at that sentiment, saying it's too soon to talk about the Vermont senator dropping out since voters in more than half the states have not yet voted.""It's premature and getting off on the wrong foot to stand there and welcome Bernie supporters before Bernie has made a decision about whether to proceed or not,"" said Jonathan Tasini, a progressive activist and former Sanders surrogate. ""I really thought it was tone deaf and actually probably hurt as the first outreach to Bernie Sanders supporters.""Tasini said Biden will need to go beyond rhetoric, adding, ""The price of unity has to be extracting some very specific concessions on big issues that speak to what Bernie supporters want.""But some Biden supporters say Sanders is no position to make any demands. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn went so far as to call on the Democratic National Committee to ""shut this primary down"" and cancel future debates.But that attitude led to walkouts of Sanders supporters at the 2016 convention and thousands of Sanders supporters staying home or voting for Trump.And even if Biden ends up easily winning the party's nomination, it will be because of his perceived ability to beat Trump more than his policy agenda or anything else.""Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,"" Biden said Monday at an event with Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both former rivals for the nomination who have endorsed Biden. ""There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.""Biden is still missing a key pillar of the vaunted Obama coalition that Sanders won — young people — and Sanders also beat him among Latinos in the West.Young voters are a large and growing share of the electorate and are more likely to be progressive than previous generations, but are also more likely to not affiliate themselves with either party, making winning them over ""the 'Manhattan Project' both for the Biden campaign and the party,"" as former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said on MSNBC Wednesday.In Michigan, for instance, a state Biden otherwise won handily, the former vice president lost 3 out of 4 voters aged 18-29. And he lost 30- to 44-year-olds, 54 percent to 42 percent.Four years ago, after it became clear Sanders had no path to winning the Democratic nomination, his campaign shifted its focus to influencing the Democratic Party platform and rules.Working into the wee hours in a hotel ballroom in Orlando, Florida, Sanders and Clinton officials hammered out compromises on everything from the minimum wage to abortion.In the end, Sanders ended up getting almost everything he wanted, which means the low-hanging fruit has already been picked and Biden may need to make concessions on bigger, thornier issues.""We need a vision for this country and for our party. And if it's not 'Medicare for All,' what is it? If it's not a Green New Deal, what is it?"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters on Wednesday. ""There are real electorates that Biden has lost, and I think it's important for the sake of unity that we get real commitments on issues.""Sanders seemed to open the first round of negotiations in public during his remarks Wednesday when he notably refrained from directly criticizing Biden and instead ticked through a litany of policy questions that he intends to ask Biden about at Sunday's debate, including student debt, mass incarceration and immigration.""On Sunday, I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend, Joe Biden. And let me be very frank as to the questions that I will be asking Joe,"" Sanders said.Mainstream Democrats are sure to worry that anything that extends the primary will only end up hurting Biden and helping Trump. And Sanders allies acknowledge there are some members of his coalition that will never come along with Biden, no matter how many progressive activists the ex-VP breaks bread with between now and November.But Ana Maria Archila, the co-executive director of the progressive group Center for Popular Democracy, which backed Sanders, said Biden's electability can only be enhanced by systematically courting progressives.""I don't see how the party is going to be able to defeat a movement candidate — because Donald Trump is a movement candidate — without a movement candidate,"" Archila said. ""So Joe Biden is going to have to do the work.""",Biden's delicate dance to win over the 'Bernie Brothers',Mar 11 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-s-delicate-dance-win-over-bernie-brothers-n1155931,nbc
"The only way to beat President Donald Trump in November is for Democrats to be self-critical about what went wrong in 2016 and fix those mistakes. We failed to connect enough with the working-class voters who should be the backbone of our party. We didn’t get enough young people and voters of color out to the polls. And we underestimated the power of an energized political movement — both on the left and the right.Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and not former Vice President Joe Biden, is the antidote to each of those problems in 2020 — but political pundits have all but declared the Democratic primary over and the latter the winner.RelatedOpinionOpinionBernie Sanders in 2020 is having a rock star moment (literally)That, despite the fact that there are still millions of ballots to be cast and more than 2,300 delegates to be awarded as of Wednesday morning. But they are foolish to dismiss my friend Bernie so easily. Remember this time last year? CNN had him sixth in its rankings of Democratic contenders, and they weren’t alone in counting him out of the top tier. Still, he’s once again proven conventional wisdom wrong and is still very close in the delegate count with Biden — much as he was at this point in 2016.Want more articles like this?

It’s not real voters, but the establishment political class and pundits who worry they’ll lose their privileges and influence. It’s James Carville saying he's ""scared to death"" of Bernie and longtime members of Congress gossiping to CNN about his lack of institutional support.Here’s the truth: Most of those people don’t understand how politics work anymore.RelatedOpinionOpinionHow a socialist candidate can win the U.S. presidential election in 2020Today’s voters don’t care about newspaper endorsements or whom the party leaders most want to work with. They care about who will help them afford health care or take on climate change and they vote accordingly. So let’s listen to the people — the young and the Latino voters Bernie has inspired , the polls that show him beating Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the general election and the 56 of 60 national polls going back more than a year that show Bernie winning the general election. If you’re pragmatic about winning, vote for Bernie.We also hear people say stuff like, “I want someone who gets things done,” because, for the past four years, the media has ignored decades of Bernie’s record. They’ve branded him as a stubborn, uncompromising outsider who puts ideology ahead of results. It’s an easy caricature — and it’s dead wrong.RelatedOpinionOpinionMillennials support socialism because they want to make America great — but for everyoneIn Burlington, Vermont, when he was elected mayor, he led a renaissance by working with people across the political spectrum and was voted one of the best mayors in America by U.S. News and World Report in 1987. And for 30 years in Congress, he’s been a reasonable, respected member . He reached across the aisle to work with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs, and singlehandedly got $11 billion added to the Affordable Care Act for community health clinics in poor areas.Bernie’s values will never change — and that’s a great thing. But he has shown over and over again he’s not naive about how government works. He’s gotten truly meaningful things done.RelatedOpinionOpinionWe want to hear what you THINK. Please submit a letter to the editor.Finally, and most confusingly, we've heard people say, “I want someone with heart and empathy.” I understand the perception that Bernie can sometimes be a curmudgeon and I can’t lie — he’s guilty as charged. But there is also a deep warmth and humanity to both Bernie and his campaign. He connects with real people because he is real.Watch his town halls and see for yourself how people who interact with him react with him. Really watch the next Bernie rally, including the speakers before him. There is a feeling of love in his campaign — a moral argument beyond policy that is unique in our politics. There is a beauty to how he speaks about the power of fighting for someone you don’t know. His campaign has tapped into a humanity in each of us, and that really matters.And one more key point for a lot of Democrats reading: For decades, progressives in our party have come along for the ride when the party nominated a moderate. We worked our butts off for nominees who didn’t fully align with our own vision for the party and the country, because we knew that moderate Democrats were far better than Republican alternatives. Now it’s time for moderates to return the favor.Bernie, not Biden, is the answer to the many of the mistakes we made as a party in 2016. He can reach the working class, inspire young voters and lead a powerful movement to take back the White House. It’s not too late to vote for him to be our party's nominee; this is not remotely over yet.

"It's not Super Tuesday, but there are six more Democratic contests coming up Tuesday. Joe Biden comes to them with a lead over Bernie Sanders in the overall delegate count, thanks to his victories in 10 states last week.Now, Biden has an opportunity to build on his advantage, while Sanders is desperately seeking to put some headline-grabbing wins on the board. Here's my look at the state of play in Tuesday's battlegrounds:1. MichiganDelegates: 125. Type of election: PrimaryThe most symbolically important contest of the day. Sanders won here in 2016 and is pushing hard for a repeat performance.On the heels of a disastrous Super Tuesday, he badly needs to post a victory in a big state like Michigan to prove that he's still a contender. Conversely, a Biden breakthrough in a state that resisted Hillary Clinton in both the primary and general elections would make a powerful statement.Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden set for Michigan showdownMarch 7, 202001:49A Detroit Free Press poll on Monday put Biden up by a whopping 24 points, although Sanders' loyalists are quick to note that pre-primary polling also put Hillary Clinton ahead in 2016.Of more concern for Sanders is his support among white voters without a college degree — a big chunk of Michigan's Democratic electorate. In '16, he won these voters by 15 points in Michigan, key to his overall victory. But in contests so far this year, Sanders hasn't been doing as well with non-college whites. Last Tuesday in Minnesota, for instance, he lost them by 12 points to Biden.Add in Sanders' continuing struggle to attract support from African Americans — about 20 percent of Michigan's primary electorate — and there are some worrying signs for him in what could amount to a must-win state.2. WashingtonDelegates: 89. Type of election: PrimaryThe single most important fact about this contest is that it is a primary, and not a caucus. It matters because Sanders tends to excel in caucus states, with their narrower voting universes, where the most committed activists hold disproportionate sway.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceWashington was a caucus state in 2016, and Sanders romped to a 73 percent to 27 percent win over Clinton, good for a sizable delegate haul. But the state Democratic Party decided to switch to a primary this year — and it looks like a big problem for Sanders.Consider what happened last Tuesday in Minnesota, another state that made the switch to a primary this year. In '16, Sanders rolled up 62 percent in Minnesota's caucuses, but facing a primary electorate this time around, he lost to Biden by 9 points. Notably, Washington also held a nonbinding presidential primary in '16, two months after its caucuses. In that primary, Sanders actually lost to Clinton by 5 points. It didn't count for any delegates, but that result is worth recalling now.Even if Sanders wins Washington's primary, his margin will likely be much narrower than his caucus rout four years ago. And that means that even in victory, his net delegate haul here will be severely reduced, something Sanders can ill afford now that he's playing catchup against Biden.3. MissouriDelegates: 68. Type of election: PrimaryJust two-tenths of a point separated Sanders from victory here in 2016, but now Missouri looms as a big question mark. In other contests so far, Sanders hasn't been performing as well as he did in '16 among blue collar and rural white voters, a significant component of the electorate. For that matter, Sanders also ran particularly well with white college graduates here in '16, a group that surged strongly to Biden on Super Tuesday.Sanders will need deep support from white voters in Missouri to make up for an expected lopsided loss with black voters, who should account for about 20 percent of the primary electorate. Sanders notched just over 30 percent of the black vote in Missouri in '16, better than his performance in Deep South states but still a major problem for him.In the last week, Biden has loaded up on endorsements from the state's political class. A solid Biden win here would go a long way toward making Tuesday a big night for him.4. North DakotaDelegates: 14. Type of election: Firehouse caucusWhat is a firehouse caucus? It's not a quite a primary, but it's pretty close.It's run by the state political party, not the state (which administers traditional primaries), and allows voters to show up at party-designated polling sites during an eight-hour window and cast ballots. The hours are shorter and there aren't nearly as many voting locations as in a primary, but otherwise the procedure is basically the same.What that adds up to is a headache for Sanders, since North Dakota has previously held caucuses, the type of contest best suited for Sanders. In 2016, he racked up a 38-point win over Clinton here. The new process should erode that advantage, though it's not clear to what degree.5. IdahoDelegates: 20. Type of election: PrimaryHere it is again: another state where Sanders dominated caucuses in 2016 that has switched to a primary this time around. Four years ago, Sanders earned nearly 80 percent in Idaho's caucuses. It's hard to see him getting close to that in a primary. Could he still win the state? It's anyone's guess, but if the contest is even close, no one will net a significant number of delegates out of this state.6. MississippiDelegates: 36. Type of election: PrimaryIt's a small state, but it may end up being more consequential than any other state  Tuesday night. The reason: Biden should run up the score here, massively. He's been crushing Sanders among black voters, and black voters should make up around 70 percent of Mississippi's Democratic primary electorate — the largest share of any state.In 2016, this state was an absolute disaster for Sanders, who lost it 83 percent to 16 percent to Clinton. Just last week, he was routed 63 percent to 16 percent in next-door Alabama. There's every reason to believe that Sanders is in for more of the same here Tuesday. And that would mean that Biden would take the vast majority of the state's delegates.In other words, it's possible that Sanders could narrowly win all the other states Tuesday and still have his net delegate gain from them erased by Biden's Mississippi landslide.",It gets a whole lot harder for Sanders today.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump told lawmakers he wants a payroll tax cut that would last at least through the election to give consumer spending a jolt as the coronavirus threatens to cripple economic growth.The president told Republicans at a closed-door lunch Tuesday that he wants the payroll tax rate to drop to zero through the end of the year, according to a White House and a Senate official.Another White House official added that different timelines were discussed. Trump is currently backing only those that would stretch through at least November or December, with some talk of expanding the cuts beyond 2020. The official argued that anything shorter would be bad politically and make less economic sense, with the impact of the coronavirus likely to stretch through the summer.Trump has made the growing economy, record stock market numbers and low unemployment a keystone of his re-election pitch, sometimes telling crowds that they have no choice but to vote for him or else their retirement savings will be at risk. Under the president's timeline, he would ensure that the tax is zeroed out throughout his re-election campaign.Trump also repeated to senators his comments from Monday expressing a desire for federal assistance to provide paid sick leave, loans for small businesses and tax relief for specific industries, according to White House aides and senators who attended the lunch.Help for the oil industry was also discussed, senators said. The White House is considering federal assistance for the shale oil industry, which has been hit hard by the oil price collapse this week, a White House official said. But the official cautioned that the situation is still fluid and that any aid would not be on the level of an industry bailout.Let our news meet your inbox.

""I think we do need more information, more detail.

"WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor will not participate next month when the court hears one of two cases that could change a key element of the system America uses to elect its president — the Electoral College.The court disclosed Tuesday that Sotomayor took herself off a case from Colorado involving a challenge to a state law directing how presidential electors must cast their votes because of a personal friendship with one of the challengers. That friend, Polly Baca, was one of three electors who argue that they ought to be able to vote for the candidate of their choice instead of the person who won the popular vote in the state — what's known as a ""faithless elector.""In a letter to the lawyers in the case, the Supreme Court's clerk, Scott Harris, said Sotomayor concluded that ""her impartiality might reasonably be questioned due to her friendship with respondent Polly Baca.""

The two cases will be argued April 28 and were originally to be considered in a single one-hour argument. On Tuesday, the court separated the cases and set an hour of argument for each case.Sotomayor's recusal is unlikely to make any practical difference. Even if the justices turned out to be divided 5-4 in the Colorado case, her absence would result in a 4-4 tie, meaning the outcome would have no legal significance; her participation in the other case would count, however, and it would be the controlling decision.More than half the states have laws requiring electors to obey the results of the popular state vote and cast their ballots accordingly. When an elector refuses to follow the results of a state's popular vote, the state usually simply throws the ballot away.The cases before the Supreme Court involve faithless electors during the 2016 presidential election. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated Colorado's law requiring conformance with the popular vote. But faced with a similar challenge, Washington's Supreme Court upheld that state's similar law.The nation's highest court ruled in 1952 that states do not violate the Constitution when they require electors to pledge that they will abide by the popular vote.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump turned insulting big-name rivals and celebrities into a form of modern political art. His top Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, has refined it into a post-modern name-calling style exhibited in limited fashion to voters who confront him with cheap shots.""Don't be such a horse's ass,"" Biden scolded a worker at an auto plant in Detroit on Tuesday as Michigan voters went to the polls.The worker had falsely asserted that Biden wants to ""end our Second Amendment right"" to own guns. Biden, the author of a decadelong 1994 ban on certain semi-automatic weapons, has proposed new gun control measures but not a repeal of the Second Amendment — which as president he would have no formal role in adopting.But the heated exchange, in which Biden threatened to slap the man and said he was ""full of s---,"" was just the latest example of a tough-talk tactic the former vice president has deployed repeatedly to push back on critics on the campaign trail. While allies of Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders say the aggressive approach will backfire politically, many Democrats and some anti-Trump Republicans like the unusually muscular response.They see a candidate who has risen in the polls and in early state primaries by demonstrating his resilience to Democratic voters and one who is telegraphing to the broader electorate that he's ready to go toe-to-toe with the bombastic Trump if he wins his party's nomination.""Kind of amazing that anybody thinks this video makes Biden look anything other than terrific,"" David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush who supports Biden, wrote on Twitter. ""He shushes the aide who wants to lead him away — and then engages a hostile critic face to face, fact to fact.

He challenged the man to take an IQ test and to do push-ups with him.At times, though, Biden's penchant for snapping back has been less clearly directed at someone attacking him with false information.In New Hampshire last month, Biden called a woman a ""lying, dog-faced pony soldier"" after she asked whether he could win the nomination following his poor performance in the Iowa caucuses and then told him she had caucused before. His campaign played down the line, which comes from a John Wayne movie, as a joke.Trump's campaign and the conservative media echo chamber jumped on Biden on Tuesday, repeating the false claim that Biden is trying to repeal the Second Amendment and expressing outrage at his use of profanity.Trump himself has repeatedly used profanity on the campaign trail and in office. He called Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a fellow Republican, a ""p----"" in 2016, he has branded various Democratic politicians with nicknames that are ethnically insensitive or made fun of their intelligence or physical features, and he often mocks or suggests that violence might be done to protesters at his rallies.But it wasn't just the Trump campaign that said it found Biden's interaction with the Michigan worker uncouth. Faiz Shakir, who manages Sanders' campaign, tweeted out video of the moment. The first time, he subtweeted the Republican National Committee's rapid response director before deleting that version and retweeted another version.Conservatives were split on whether to suggest Biden had an angry moment or whether he was being dishonest with the voter.Mark Levin, the conservative radio host, said Biden ""loses it again,"" while Dana Loesch, a former spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, said Biden had admitted ""the exact thing about gun confiscation that the worker questioning him described,"" adding that ""Biden called the worker a liar, blamed Trump and cussed at him in response.""But in the interview Loesch promoted, Biden said he was going after assault weapons specifically and explained why he believes that the Second Amendment does not prevent the government from enacting laws that restrict the ownership of certain firearms — like currently banned machine guns — as he told the worker in Detroit.Ultimately, voters will decide whether they think Biden's right to hit back when he thinks he's being unfairly attacked — whether it's by Trump or a guy with a hard hat.

"The six states voting in the primaries and caucuses Tuesday are bracing for a strong turnout after some voters in California and Texas waited hours in long lines to cast their ballots.Election officials and experts are hoping that with less new technology, more paper-based methods and early and absentee voting options, the states — Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Washington, and North Dakota — are expected to have fewer bottlenecks. But other changes may delay reporting of the results.“We do not anticipate unusually long lines in the March 10 states, primarily due to variables such as voting methods, state sizes and the absence of major process changes such as the introduction of Vote Centers,” Eddie Perez, an election administration analyst with the OSET Institute, said in an email.NBC News has collaborated with the OSET Institute since 2016 to monitor U.S. election technology and voting issues.Voters and local administrators have hit roadblocks with newer machines and polling technology that can sometimes result in unanticipated problems — such as the Iowa app that was confusing for precinct chairs to use and encountered a coding issue that caused it to crash and be abandoned on caucus night.In some states this primary season, new technology or processes were implemented in locations that also saw long lines or administrative errors, highlighting the challenges of instituting cutting-edge election systems and processes and the need for election infrastructure resilience and contingency planning.The states voting Tuesday, however, should not encounter such problems, election integrity experts say. All states except Mississippi will be using some form of hand-marked paper ballots.In Michigan, the state with the most delegates up for grabs Tuesday, more than 800,000 ballots have already been cast under the state’s policy that allows anybody to cast an absentee ballot.

Alabama cited its new e-poll books as cutting down on check-in times. Minnesota reported an increase in voter participation of more than 175 percent over its 2016 caucuses.But a handful of counties had issues that will require closer review. Harris County, Texas, which uses voting machines from Hart InterCivic, opened an investigation after a vote was registered as cast after polls closed and a pollworker reported security seals missing on one device the next morning. This same location, Texas State University, also experienced lines in excess of 6 hours on Super Tuesday.Scrutiny was higher on jurisdictions using new equipment. ES&S, the dominant U.S. voting system maker, said that as of November, it has delivered nearly 35,000 new ExpressVote and ExpressVote XL universal voting machines, and over 7,500 ballot scanners and tabulation machines to more than 150 jurisdictions.Biden and Sanders vie for delegates in 6 states, with Michigan the prizeMarch 10, 202001:56The new machines have been heavily marketed across the county for their ease of use for voters and security and accuracy for administrators. ES&S said many new customers were delighted with the new equipment and experienced no issues. But NBC News found some isolated cases of reported problems.“Our call center was active, but typical and on par with previous elections as election officials familiarize themselves and voters with newer secure technologies,” Katina Granger, an ES&S spokesperson, said in an email.One Texas county that used new ES&S equipment is taking extra steps to review the results. A Dallas County judge ordered a recount of paper ballots from 44 new ES&S machines after thumb drives containing the ballots weren't included in final results.One South Carolina county, Richland, replaced its election director and is looking for answers after malfunctions, frozen screens and printer jams affected at least 10 new ExpressVote machines during its Feb. 29 primary voting and forced poll workers to break security seals to fix printers.Election board members said humidity and back-end administration issues may have played a factor, but the number of errors were excessive for the state’s brand new $51 million equipment, said Duncan Buell, a board of elections member and a computer scientist who has researched voting system issues.“That sort of failure of scanner should happen so rarely. It should be once in an entire county, not one in every four,” Buell said. “This should be a big issue.

"A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that House Democrats are entitled to get materials gathered by a grand jury during former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of the Trump campaign and Russian election meddling in 2016.By a 2-1 vote, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the House Judiciary Committee can receive the materials, along with an unredacted version of the Mueller report, even though such materials are normally shielded by federal rules that protect the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.The ruling, which can be appealed to the full D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court, is a major victory for the power of Congress to demand investigative materials over an issue that has long divided federal courts. But it is likely to have little immediate effect.No ‘credibility’: Trump losing 2020 battle to hide secret parts of Mueller reportMarch 6, 202006:08The appeals court said the House ""has repeatedly stated that if the grand jury materials reveal new evidence of impeachable offenses, the committee may recommend new articles of impeachment."" But there is little interest in another around of impeachment hearings in the House or another impeachment trial in the Senate.After the Senate acquitted President Donald Trump, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, said, ""There's not much appetite for revving up the engines of impeachment, because the Senate is behaving like a bunch of religious cultists. Next thing you know, they'll be selling flowers at the airport.""Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceUnder federal law, materials gathered by a grand jury must remain secret, with only a few exceptions. One of them is ""preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding."" The court upheld an October 2019 ruling by a federal judge which concluded that a Senate impeachment trial is a judicial proceeding, not a legislative one.Tuesday's ruling said the Constitution's framers understood impeachment to be an exercise of judicial power. It said that as long ago as 1811, the courts were providing grand jury materials during congressional investigations.The Justice Department objected to the release of the Mueller materials, but a key holding of the appeals court was that the courts, not the executive branch, control access to grand jury materials.""Grand jury records do not become executive branch documents simply because they are housed with the Department of Justice,"" the decision said.Whatever the government's interests may be in upholding general grand jury secrecy, they ""do not outweigh the committee's compelling need for disclosure,"" it said.In her dissent, Judge Neomi Rao, who was appointed by Trump, said the House might have had a need for the documents last fall, but she questioned whether that was still true with the impeachment process now over.""A reasonable observer might wonder why we are deciding this case at this time,"" Rao said. ""Why is this controversy not moot?""The issue of congressional access to grand jury materials has long been debated. In 1974, after a federal grand jury in Washington finished an investigation of the Watergate scandal, it prepared a special report on its findings and recommended that it be forwarded to the House Judiciary Committee, which had begun impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon.U.S. District Court Judge John Sirica ruled that while a grand jury's proceedings are secret, he had the authority to release the material to the House. His decision said that the normal reason for keeping grand jury proceedings secret — such as preventing the escape of someone who might be indicted or insulating the grand jury from outside influence — no longer applied once the grand jury's work was done.Subsequent rulings have said the judicial proceedings exception to grand jury secrecy was not the central holding of Sirica's ruling, but Tuesday's appeals court decision makes it clear that the rule applies to an impeachment proceeding.A Justice Department spokesman said the administration was studying the ruling and had no immediate comment on whether it would appeal. But an appeal by the government seems likely, in part because of the consequences of the decision on future legal battles between Congress and the White House.","House Democrats can get secret Mueller information, appeals court rules",Mar 10 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-democrats-can-get-secret-mueller-information-appeals-court-rules-n1154631,nbc
"DETROIT — Former Vice President Joe Biden told a factory worker he was “full of s---” at a campaign event here after the man claimed the Democratic presidential candidate was going to take away his guns.The heated altercation happened during a meet-and-greet with workers at a Fiat Chrysler assembly plant ahead of Michigan's crucial primary. While supporters were waiting in line, Biden was immediately confronted by a worker who claimed he would try to do away with his Second Amendment right after seeing videos of him and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, talking gun control.“You’re full of s---,” Biden said. “I did not.”Beto O'Rourke: I see three reasons to support BidenMarch 3, 202007:45O’Rourke, who endorsed Biden last week, dropped out of the 2020 Democratic field in November.

In December, Biden called an Iowa voter a ""damn liar"" and challenged him to a pushup contest after the man questioned his age, as well as his son's business dealings in Ukraine.At a pre-planned event in Ohio on Tuesday to reiterate his commitment to passing gun control legislation, Biden reacted to the confrontation in Detroit.

"WASHINGTON — Super Tuesday resurrected Joe Biden’s campaign and powered him into a delegate lead. Super Tuesday II must revive Bernie Sanders or the nomination could slip away from him again.A new CNN poll shows Biden leading Sanders by a margin of 52 percent to 36 percent in a two-person race. The biggest dividing line is age — voters under 45 said they prefer Sanders by nearly 2-to-1, while voters 45 or older picked Biden by more than 4-to-1.That generational gap looms over another big day of voting Tuesday, with Democratic voters in Michigan, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington set to deliver their verdict on who should be the party’s nominee to take on President Donald Trump. It’s also the last day for Democrats living abroad to participate in the primary.Here are five things to watch on Super Tuesday II.1. Will Sanders see a turnout revolution?Sanders has said his path to the presidency involves young and irregular voters turning out in big numbers to outnumber establishment-friendly Democrats. So far, the opposite has happened. There hasn’t been a progressive revolution for change; there has been a suburban revolution for normalcy.Consider the results from Virginia last week. Compared to 2016, the Democratic primary turnout surged in upscale suburban areas like Loudoun County from 36,149 to 71,632, and in Fairfax County from 139,818 to 244,664. Biden lapped Sanders in both counties.Meanwhile, voters younger than 30, who overwhelmingly voted for the Vermont senator, shrunk as a share of the Virginia primary electorate from 16 percent in 2016 to 13 percent in 2020.Sanders desperately needs that trend to change.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceHow Bernie Sanders can stay competitive with wins in Michigan, WashingtonMarch 9, 202004:272. Michigan, Michigan, MichiganIn 2016, Michigan delivered Sanders a stunning come-from-behind victory that revived his campaign and gave him staying power in his battle with Hillary Clinton. If he is to mount a comeback this year, it would have to begin in Michigan.It’s the most delegate-rich contest on the map Tuesday. And as a key battleground state, Sanders must show strength to close Biden’s perceived “electability” advantage nationwide, which soared to 40 points in the new CNN poll. That’s not sustainable if he wants to win over a base that is desperate to defeat President Donald Trump.A Detroit Free Press poll showed the former vice president leading Sanders by 24 points, while a Monmouth survey had him ahead by 15 points. Sanders beat the polls last cycle, and he has placed a big bet on the state this time, with a packed campaign schedule over the weekend and a focus on trade in the industrial Midwestern hub.“I still have PTSD from 2016. We certainly thought we were going to win Michigan by 10 points and we lost by a point and a half,” former Clinton campaign aide Adrienne Elrod said on MSNBC. “So you never know what’s going to happen in a state like Michigan.”3. Margins matter more than victoriesThe contest is no longer about winning states, but rather about delegate math. Delegates are awarded proportionally based on margins, so big victories matter more than narrow ones. Sanders needs to notch big victories to cut into Biden's delegate lead.Apart from Michigan, Sanders handily won North Dakota, Idaho and Washington state in 2016. He lost Missouri by a wafer-thin margin. In theory, Sanders could narrowly win those five states and still fall behind in delegates if he gets walloped again in Mississippi.In 2016, 7 in 10 Mississippi primary voters were black, and Biden showed his dominance among African American Southerners last week. He paid a visit to Mississippi over the weekend to rally voters after Sanders canceled a planned speech there Friday to spend more time in Michigan.4. Where will Warren supporters go?Super Tuesday results indicated Biden was the main beneficiary of former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s supporters after they dropped out and endorsed him. Since then, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has also dropped out, but she has not endorsed either Biden or Sanders — and it’s unclear where her voters will go.Biden has a chance to win older and college-educated white women in her base, while Sanders may add to his base of young liberals who were torn between the two progressives who aligned on policy.A Morning Consult poll taken last week found that among Warren supporters, 43 percent prefer Sanders as their second choice while 36 percent choose Biden.5. Will caucus-to-primary switches hurt Sanders?Sanders has proven stronger in caucuses — which tend to be low-turnout affairs that draw the most enthusiastic voters — than primaries. It boosted him to a big victory in the Nevada caucuses. But he lost Minnesota, which switched to a primary system after caucuses in 2016 that Sanders won handily.Washington and Idaho have also switched from caucuses to primaries. Can Sanders carry those states? Having fallen behind in delegates, he can ill-afford to lose places he won last time.",5 things to watch on Super Tuesday II,Mar 10 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/5-things-watch-super-tuesday-ii-sanders-revolution-faces-reckoning-n1153581,nbc
"WASHINGTON — Four years ago, Bernie Sanders shocked the political world and defied the public polling by winning the Michigan primary — even though he was unable to change the overall delegate math.But here are three reasons why Sanders winning Michigan tonight on this Above-Average Tuesday (with a total of 365 pledges delegates up for grabs) would be an even bigger surprise than it was in 2016.One, Joe Biden’s bounce after winning South Carolina and most of the Super Tuesday states has been enormous. A national CNN poll released Monday found Biden leading Sanders by 16 points (after Sanders was ahead by 3 points in January). And a national Quinnipiac poll had Biden ahead by 19 points (after Sanders led in February).Biden and Sanders vie for delegates in 6 states, with Michigan the prizeMarch 10, 202001:56If you’re leading nationally by double digits, chances are you’re ahead in Michigan, too.Two, the coronavirus story that’s been dominating the news has probably helped Biden more than Sanders. That same CNN poll shows that Democratic voters — by a 42-point margin — believe Biden would better handle a major crisis than Sanders would.And three, Sanders has been underperforming among white working-class voters in the north. “Overall, Mr. Biden defeated Mr. Sanders by 10 points, 38 percent to 28 percent, in counties across Maine, Minnesota and Massachusetts where white voters made up at least 80 percent of the electorate and where college graduates represented less than 40 percent of the electorate,” the New York Times’ Nate Cohn writes.That seems to suggest that part of Sanders’ success in 2016 was because he was running against Hillary Clinton.Outside of Michigan, Sanders might even have a bigger problem tonight: Idaho and Washington state have replaced their caucuses with primaries.And to show you how that could change the delegate math, Sanders won 72 percent in Washington’s caucuses four years ago. But when the state party held a primary that same year — which didn’t count for the delegates sent to the convention — Clinton actually edged Sanders in that contest (when a lot more voters were participating).Two weeks ago, Joe Biden was making his final stand in South Carolina, and it worked for him — better than anyone could have imagined.Today, Sanders is making his own final stand in Michigan.But he’s making it on much more unfavorable turf.Data Download: The number of the day is … 77Seventy-seven.That’s Joe Biden’s delegate lead over Bernie Sanders heading into tonight’s contests.Biden has been allocated 652 delegates, according to the NBC News Decision Desk, while Sanders has 575.That doesn’t include 143 delegates that have NOT been allocated from contests that have already taken place.Of those 143, 63 are from California, while 80 are from other Super Tuesday States.California: 63Utah: 20Colorado: 16North Carolina: 9Massachusetts: 9Tennessee: 8Texas: 5Maine: 4Alabama: 3Oklahoma: 2Virginia: 2Arkansas: 1Minnesota: 1Trump’s looking at stimulus measures to boost the economy“President Donald Trump said Monday that he is looking at a possible payroll tax cut, along with other measures, to help American workers and boost the economy, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak,” per NBC News.Let our news meet your inbox.

"WASHINGTON — Two weeks ago, Bernie Sanders was the Democratic presidential front-runner, the U.S. economy was humming and President Donald Trump had reason to be optimistic about his re-election prospects.Then the first American died from the coronavirus. The campaign as we knew it would soon be over.The pandemic subsumed businesses and sports leagues, hammered the travel industry and caused some analysts to project an economic downturn, if not a global recession. Democrats who rated the coronavirus as important to their vote picked former Vice President Joe Biden by wide margins in primary contests, padding his victory margins and handing him a commanding delegate lead.The president and his two main rivals canceled rallies, allowed or directed staff to work from home and began shifting their events to online gatherings. Democrats moved their Sunday debate from Phoenix to Washington and eliminated the live audience, while Louisiana became the first state to postpone its primaries due to the virus. American public life was grinding to a halt.In the nation’s capital, Trump struggled to contain the fallout, initially downplaying the magnitude of the crisis and offering mixed messages that went against guidance from public health officials.The coronavirus outbreak has challenged Trump as he has never been challenged before. The scorched-earth playbook that has gotten the former reality TV star out of trouble in the past is failing on a complex problem that requires technocratic competence and expertise. A president who has confounded his critics with an apparent invincibility in one crisis after another now sees the virus attacking his two biggest assets heading into re-election — a growing economy and the approval of older Americans, whose lives are disproportionately threatened.Let our news meet your inbox.

He underperforms his rivals on the question of who would better handle a crisis: American voters picked Joe Biden over Trump by 16 points, and Sanders over Trump by 6 points, a Quinnipiac poll said.This week, the president delivered an Oval Office address that misstated his own policy of restricting travel from Europe, which panicked Americans abroad and further tanked the markets. On Friday, one day after the worst stock market crash since 1987, he declared a national emergency in order to unlock resources to help states and localities address the pandemic. He denied responsibility for the slow rate of coronavirus testing.""No, I don’t take responsibility at all,"" he told reporters at a White House press conference, blaming the ""set of circumstances"" he inherited, flanked by administration officials and corporate executives enlisted to help mitigate the crisis. Hours later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a deal with the administration on a bill to protect Americans with two weeks of paid sick leave, three months of family and medical leave, enhanced unemployment benefits and a boost in Medicaid and nutrition funding.Before Trump came around to declaring an emergency, he latched onto the rosiest forecasts and sought to blame his predecessor, attack the press and accuse Democrats of perpetuating a “hoax” to bring down his presidency. Meanwhile, the death toll has gradually risen, testing remains scarce compared to other developed countries and the president’s response has fueled criticism that he’s more worried about his political health than the pubic's.“The administration’s failure on testing is colossal, and it’s a failure of planning, leadership and execution,” Biden said in remarks on the crisis Thursday. “We must know the true extent of this outbreak so we can map it, trace it and contain it. Nor should we hide the true number of infections in hope of protecting political interest or the stock market.”Biden’s speech came one day after the president’s Oval Office address, offering Americans a visual comparison of how their two most likely options this fall would act in a crisis. Voters in recent general elections have not necessarily been drawn to the candidate with the most governing experience — Hillary Clinton, John McCain and John Kerry all lost — but a pandemic could change that.Sanders said Friday the virus “has radically changed our campaign,” by preventing him from hosting big rallies and relegating his staff to work from home. He touted his signature issue of “Medicare for All” and argued that a national insurance plan would make the U.S. better equipped to combat public health threats like the coronavirus.“We need fundamental changes to our economy, we need fundamental changes to our health care system,” he told reporters in Burlington, Vermont. “I would hope that this crisis should be a moment in which people ask fundamental questions about the dysfunctionality of our current health care system.”At his press conference Friday, Trump sought to look ahead to the light at the end of the tunnel.""This will pass,"" he said.

"New York state opened its first drive-thru coronavirus test site Friday in New Rochelle, the city that Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said has the biggest cluster of coronavirus cases in the country.With 158 cases in Westchester County, many of them in New Rochelle, the city has become a hot spot not just for the outbreak but also for unique ways to track and minimize the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, Cuomo implemented a ""containment zone"" around a one-mile radius of the city as an emergency measure to limit movement in the area and shut down schools, houses of worship and other gathering places.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakThe drive-thru test site is capable of testing up to 200 people a day at the moment and will eventually be able to test 500 a day, Cuomo said.

People with underlying conditions or those who are elderly are considered more vulnerable populations and will get appointments first.""You want to find the positive cases because you want to be able to isolate those positive cases.""""You want to find the positive cases because you want to be able to isolate those positive cases, and then find out who that person may have been in touch with so you can get them the assistance they need,"" Cuomo said at a press conference Friday.

"WASHINGTON — Many of the nation's mayors and governors are ordering schools, courthouses and even large public gatherings shut down, but where do they get the power to do that?Every state in the United States — and virtually every country in the world — has laws conferring this legal authority. They're some of the oldest on the books, stemming from the plagues of past centuries that devastated Europe and were reworked again after the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic and the more recent Ebola outbreak.""There's no question that states have very broad powers to do rather extraordinary things in public health emergencies,"" professor Wendy Parmet, an expert on public health law at Northeastern University, says.President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency Friday, but that largely would provide more assistance to state and local governments and would not enlarge federal power to restrict public gatherings or travel. It provides the same kind of aid that is made available in response to national disasters like hurricanes.Trump plans to declare national emergency over coronavirusMarch 13, 202001:50The federal government has long had authority to prevent people who could be carrying disease from entering the country.

It's the same provision Trump invoked in the past, with varying degrees of success, to limit travel from mostly Muslim countries and to restrict immigration at the southern border.Chief Justice John Roberts referred to this power two years ago when the court upheld a modified version of Trump's Middle Eastern travel ban. If the opponents were right about the limits of the law, ""the president would not be able to suspend entry from a particular country in the event of an epidemic in that country or even if the United States were on the brink of war with that country.""Separately, federal public health laws give the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the authority to detain and examine anyone arriving in the U.S. suspected of carrying a communicable disease. The federal government could even limit travel from one state to another by people deemed a public health risk, though the practical limitations of actually doing it make that largely theoretical.Professor George Annas, a public health law expert at Boston University, said, ""I don't think you're going to see any restriction on interstate travel in the United States.""Most of the restrictions popping up now in response to the coronavirus pandemic are local ones. All states and the District of Columbia have laws, as part of their general police powers, authorizing quarantine, which is a restriction on people who may have been exposed to see if they become sick, and isolation, which is intended to stop people known to be sick from spreading a disease.While these laws vary widely, most give governors or public health officials authority to limit public interactions in emergencies.Washington state's law, for example, says the governor ""after proclaiming a state of emergency ... may issue an order prohibiting ... any number of persons, as designated by the governor, from assembling or gathering on the public streets, parks, or other open areas of this state, either public or private.""That includes banning such nongovernment gatherings such as sporting events or concerts. The ability of private businesses to successfully challenge these restrictions is very limited, assuming the state and local authorities follow the rules and don't act irrationally or with intent to illegally discriminate.""If somebody were to challenge something like (New York) Gov. Andrew Cuomo's containment order or the one shutting down Broadway, I think it would be very hard in this climate to prevail in court,"" Parmet said. ""Things may change depending on how long this goes on, but courts have traditionally been extremely deferential to public health emergency powers.""Some states restrict how local officials can close public gathering places, and places like movie theaters can be closed without further authority from a legislature, Annas says. ""In general, as long as you have the support of the public, the power is nearly unlimited.""President Bill Clinton used that authority in 2000 to help New York and New Jersey deal with an outbreak of the West Nile virus, allowing them to conduct spraying against mosquitoes that spread the disease.

Are we listening? Are we getting all the information we need to?” he said. He didn't say whether he would sign or veto any of the bills.Utah barred abortion after 18 weeks last year, becoming one of several states to adopt strict bans.

"WASHINGTON — This has been a week that has changed the trajectory of the 2020 election, as well as the trajectory for the entire nation.The disruption from the spread of the coronavirus — and the political reaction to it — is certainly the biggest part of that change.An economic recession now seems almost inevitable.Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders got to contrast their leadership abilities with President Trump’s.And as for Trump, the coronavirus plays into all of his weaknesses — blaming others, misstating facts, not leading by example and an inability to unite the country — and few of his strengths.But the coronavirus isn’t the only thing that changed the 2020 race this week.Joe Biden has taken absolute command of the race for the Democratic nomination, and the next two weeks of contests look even better for him.And when it comes to the 2020 race for the Senate, Democrats convinced Montana Gov.

"CHICAGO — Chicago mom Rya Smith has no doubts about backing the top prosecutor in the nation's second-biggest county for another term, even while acknowledging the office fumbled a criminal case against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett.Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's involvement in the Smollett case has dominated much of the attention in her reelection campaign, but Smith contends the focus instead should be on her record exonerating the innocent, tossing minor marijuana convictions and as the first black woman in the job.“She’s done a great many things, especially for minorities,” Smith said. “The Jussie Smollett case was a pebble in the giant boulder of her career. That shouldn’t discredit her for one little mistake. She isn’t getting a fair shake.”Jussie Smollett due in court for his first appearance on new chargesFeb. 24, 202000:29Foxx is counting on more voters like Smith as she seeks a second term against three Democratic primary challengers who've seized on the Smollett case and a fractured relationship with police. In what's likely the most expensive race of its kind, they've called it a bungled prosecution that benefited a politically-connected person and undermined public trust.The controversial decision to dismiss charges against Smollett, who's accused of fabricating a racist, anti-gay attack, has haunted Foxx, something that's increasingly frustrated her. She declined an Associated Press interview but recently called the Smollett focus “B.S.""Defeating Foxx will be tough with her establishment backing, union support and super PACs targeting her opponents. But challengers — including Navy veteran Bill Conway, whose first run for office is being fueled by his billionaire father — believe they've found an opening for Tuesday.“She just kept not telling the truth to the public,” said Conway, 41, a former assistant state's attorney.He's aired television ads since November, with far more money combined than all candidates — including two Republicans. About $10.5 million of the roughly $11.5 million he’s raised, comes from William Conway, co-founder of Carlyle Group, a Washington D.C.-based investment firm. Foxx, 47, has raised nearly $3.5 million.Foxx acknowledged missteps. She recused herself from the Smollett case, but questions linger about whether she acted improperly for speaking to a Smollett relative and aide to former first lady Michelle Obama before the charges were dismissed. A special prosecutor reinstated the charges last month, which Foxx blasted as political.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service“That we are continuing to talk about this in a city that continues to deal with gun violence, in a city that is continuing to reckon with police accountability,” Foxx told the Chicago Sun-Times. “That somehow this case has been elevated to one of the greatest criminal injustices in our time feels disingenuous.”There’s wide agreement she's made reforms.Foxx's office was the first to dismiss low-level marijuana convictions as part of Illinois’ law legalizing recreational marijuana. She personally handed over roughly 1,000 petitions to a judge.She ramped up a Conviction Integrity Unit with prosecutors vacating convictions of roughly 100 people linked to a former Chicago police sergeant’s scheme to shake down poor and black public housing residents.Josh Tepfer of the Exoneration Project at the University of Chicago Law School called Foxx’s office “the most transparent” he’s worked with, noting she apologized to victims even though they were convicted before her tenure.“She speaks to the unfair treatment of people of color in ways that are very unique,” he said.That resonates with Tanya Watkins, who runs Soul in Action, a PAC that focuses on black candidates. Nearly one quarter of Cook County's 5.1 million residents are black.Watkins believes Foxx hasn't received fair treatment because of race. The other candidates are white.“She has no margin for error,” Watkins said. “The things I’ve heard said about this black woman have reminded me how much more difficult it is to be a black woman in the public arena.”Defense attorneys note the easing up on charges for lower-level crimes and alternative punishments. Some also praise her cash bail reforms. Her office has allowed the release of detainees held on nonviolent charges who can't afford bonds up to $1,000.But others aren’t so complimentary.Foxx has a rocky relationship with police, who dislike her reforms, including for nonviolent crimes like shoplifting. Things worsened when the Smollett charges were dropped. The tensions hit a peak in April with dueling protests outside her office involving the police union.“There’s this attitude among law enforcement that this is a ‘catch and release’ system,” said Kulmeet Galhotra, who's retired as the head of the Cook County Public Defender’s Homicide Task Force.The sentiment is echoed by challenger former Chicago Alderman Bob Fioretti, 67. He and former federal prosecutor Donna More, 62, who’s also running, say the office needs to be more independent.Some defense attorneys are also critical of her office for inconsistencies, saying the policies aren't applied evenly.Still, the Smollett case does resonate with some.Chicagoan Demetrius Williams, 35, voted for Foxx before but thinks Smollett got off easy and will support Conway.“I believe he has enough money to take on Kim Foxx,” said Williams, 35. “I’m not going to say that I’m so Conway crazy. I’ll take a chance.

"WASHINGTON — An unexpected crisis has sent the stock market into free fall, Congress is divided on how to respond, and experts across the political spectrum are demanding unprecedented action to stave off catastrophe.It’s a situation that’s all too familiar for Jason Furman, who advised President Barack Obama’s campaign during the 2008 financial crisis and went on to serve as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.Now a professor at Harvard University, Furman has been pushing Congress to go big with a rescue package that includes sending one-time checks of $1,000 for every American adult and $500 for every child to help cope with the fallout from the coronavirus.NBC News talked to Furman about what to expect from the ongoing situation and how the federal government might prevent a worst-case scenario when it comes to the economy. Here's what he had to say in the interview, edited for length and clarity:NBC News: A lot of Americans are seeing the stock market plummet this week and trying to figure out what it means, beyond just the immediate health crisis. How worried should they be?Furman: I think the economic side is very serious, potentially more serious than the financial crisis.In the financial crisis, millions of people lost their jobs, but most people kept their jobs, and many people maintained their consumption. In this case, everyone is cutting their spending and lots of people, even if they don’t lose their jobs, will lose time at work, hours, tips, potentially a large blow to their income.NBC News: Some are making the opposite argument, including the president. The financial crisis occurred because the underpinning of the economy was bad, they say, but this is a temporary situation and eventually things will go back to normal.Furman: If the virus goes away in two months, I wouldn't be that worried. My expectation based on the medical professionals is that it is not realistic to expect it to go away in two months, and that if it did, it could come back even more virulently again in the flu season next year.The problem with the economic side is that if it lasts more than a few months, it then takes on its own momentum. If you look across the United States and across other countries, the unemployment rate can go up very quickly, but it can’t come back down very quickly. It never has. A business whose balance sheet is in tatters after nine months without revenues might go bankrupt, it might go out of business, or it won’t be in position to hire people back immediately even if demand returns.Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of ServiceNBC News: You have proposed a one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult and $500 to every child in the country. Why do you think that’s the best approach? In part, because I exhausted all other alternatives. You should spend as much as you can on health, on testing, on hospital infrastructure. You should spend as much as you can in a targeted way on things like unemployment insurance, nutritional assistance, paid leave, and help for states.Once you've gone through all of that, you’ve maxed out on health and maxed out on targeted assistance, you have two problems: One is millions, or tens of millions, of households are going to be hurting from lower incomes, lost jobs, or time off work. Second, just from a macroeconomic perspective, the amount of stimulus you want for the economy under that scenario is still smaller than what you need. The only way to reach everyone you need and get to the size you need is with some broad-based tax transfer.NBC News: What level of spending do you think we need to avert the worst consequences?Furman: A week ago, I called for $350 billion. Today, I would say $700 billion.NBC News: The president hasn’t put out details, but he’s said his preferred approach is a payroll tax cut. What do you make of that idea? Furman: I don't think a payroll tax cut is a terrible idea. I think it's an imperfect idea, but I think it’s moving in some respects in the right direction. The problems it has is it gives a lot more money to high income than to middle income, it gives nothing to people who aren't getting a paycheck, and in the current circumstances it dribbles out slowly.NBC News: Democrats in Congress want to boost federal aid to states to help pay for Medicaid while Republicans are skeptical of the idea. You’ve argued this is an essential part of any rescue package. Why? Furman: In a normal recession, state revenues go down a lot and that can lead them to cut back. That is going to happen. In addition, state spending is going to go up a lot to take all the public health measures and treatment measures we’re going to need to do right now.We need to make sure states can afford public health, that they can afford to treat people, and from a macroeconomic perspective, aren’t cutting back spending in some areas to meet their balanced budget requirement.NBC News: You say that any bill should renew automatically if the economy continues to suffer. A number of Democrats have said they’re worried the next Democratic president could take office in a crisis and find Republicans suddenly very concerned with deficits and unwilling to fund more help. Furman: You can obviate that concern, and I strongly think you should, by passing something today and including with it triggers that continue based on economic circumstances. So, you can write people checks this year and if the unemployment rate is above 5.5 percent, they get the checks next year, or raise the Medicaid match rate, then make a formula that links it to the unemployment rate by state.I've been a longtime fan of automatic stabilizers. In the current political environment it's especially important, because it’s always hard for Congress to pass anything.NBC News: What do you think of the White House’s economic response so far and is there anything more they can do at the executive level? Furman: The White House response has been pathetic, inconsistent, at times too small, and sometimes flailing in different directions. I've been really disappointed. As recently as Friday of last week, their top economic advisers were talking about how very little needed to be done, just little targeted measures. They keep floating a payroll tax cut, but they haven’t proposed it.My experience also is Congress has a lot of great people, but even on legislation at a time like this, really the administration needs to take a big lead.

"In a direct rebuttal to President Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders delivered somber, and at times searing, speeches Thursday slamming the administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and detailing how they believe the government should be responding to the crisis.""If there ever was a time in the modern history of our country where we are all in this together, this is that moment,"" Sanders said in Burlington, Vermont, after suggesting the death toll may exceed that of American service members during World War II.

On the other side, a different reality for Americans.Political communication experts told NBC News those moves suggest Biden is attempting to seize on the disorder created by the pandemic.""In this case, this is not just about communication. It's also about public health. And your responsibility as a political leader is not only to send the message to the public, it's to serve as an example to the public,"" said Jennifer Glover Konfrst, a professor of strategic political communication at Drake University,in Des Moines, Iowa.Trump, in contrast, has come under increasing fire in recent weeks over his response to the pandemic while his administration has come under enormous criticism for the lack of coronavirus testing being done compared with other countries, something both candidate's pointed to in their addresses Thursday.In addition to having insisted for weeks that he had the outbreak under control, Trump also propagated personal beliefs about the coronavirus that contradict those of veteran health officials and experts.Health officials in recent days have sounded the alarm, warning the public that the outbreak is likely to get worse. Many major public events, including all NBA, NHL, MLS and MLB preseason games and Broadway shows, have been canceled this week, and Thursday saw the Dow's worst day since the 1987 crash.As panic began to set in, Trump tried to quell the fears of Americans across the country by giving a speech from the Oval Office on Wednesday night. He announced that he would ban many foreign travelers from Europe for the next 30 days and offered a series of economic relief actions to help workers and companies deal with the outbreak. But his speech was met with swift pushback after he misstated several aspects of the policy and failed to propose any new action to combat the outbreak domestically.Meanwhile, voters have seemed to express a growing sense of trust in Biden's ability to handle a crisis — even before Biden made his latest moves.An NBC News exit poll on Super Tuesday found that Biden was the candidate of choice of nearly half of those who rated the outbreak as an important factor, above Sanders. And a Quinnipiac University Poll released Monday showed that 49 percent of registered voters across the U.S. said they disapproved of Trump's response to the coronavirus. Forty-three percent said they approved.Philippe Reines, a former senior adviser to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, told NBC News that Biden's experience in the previous administration gives him ""a real leg up"" on the issue.","Biden, Sanders take aim at Trump over coronavirus: 'Incompetence and recklessness'",Mar 12 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-seeking-project-competence-amid-crisis-announces-coronavirus-plan-n1156946,nbc

But it ends up playing into what they had set up as a ""presidential moment"" and clear contrast.”The question is whether Biden can deliver that presidential moment and clear contrast.Sanders stays in the raceAfter his losses Tuesday in Mississippi, Missouri, Michigan and even Idaho, Bernie Sanders said he was staying in the Democratic presidential race.And he used his address to challenge Joe Biden ahead of Sunday’s Dem debate in Arizona.“Joe, what are you going to do for the 500,000 people who go bankrupt in our country because of medically-related debt, and what are you going to do for the working people of this country and small business people who are paying on average 20% of their incomes for health care?”“Joe, what are you going to do to end the absurdity of the United States of America being the only major country on Earth where health care is not a human right? Are you really going to veto a Medicare for all bill if it is passed in Congress?”“Joe, how are you going to respond to the scientists who tell us we have seven or eight years remaining to transform our energy system before irreparable harm takes place to this planet because of the ravages of climate change?”The questions we have: One, what happens after for Sanders the debate, especially if there isn’t a game-changing moment?And two, while the debate might get plenty of eyeballs (with Americans staying home), do Americans want to hear any non-coronavirus news/debate from their presidential candidates right now?Especially in a presidential race where the handwriting is already on the wall?By the way, Biden is now ahead of Sanders in Washington state by more than 16,000 votes with 78 percent in.And in California, Sanders’ lead is down to 6.6 points.Data Download: The number of the day is … 147147.Let our news meet your inbox.

Even Bernie Sanders can't force Bernie Sanders supporters to do anything,’ she said. ‘Letting Sanders determine what's best for his people is probably ultimately what's best for Biden, so long as Sanders supporters are not echoing Trump's arguments.’”Added progressive activist and former Sanders supporter Jonathan Tasini: ""The price of unity has to be extracting some very specific concessions on big issues that speak to what Bernie supporters want.""On the campaign trail todayJoe Biden delivers his speech on the coronavirus at 1:00 p.m. ET from Wilmington, Del.Dispatches from NBC’s campaign embedsIn a Biden memo obtained by NBC News, Marianna Sotomayor reports the campaign’s thinking on Bernie Sanders’ decision to stay in the presidential contest: “Discussing the ‘path forward,’ the campaign points out that a Sanders rebound would require ‘the kind of blowouts’ that they were able to pull off in Alabama, Mississippi and Virginia where Biden won roughly three dozen delegates in each state. ‘It is hard to imagine which upcoming states would provide Sanders this opportunity,’ the memo says, pointing out that many of the Vermont senator’s ‘strongest states have already voted.’ The campaign, whose strategy has always prioritized winning delegate rich counties, does concede that Sanders will win Oregon, but it would not be enough to make up for his ‘significant delegate deficit.’”Tweet of the dayWho would’ve thought the child of two journalists would arrive 3.5 weeks ahead of her deadline?

"LONDON — President Donald Trump's ban on most travel from 26 European countries caused uproar on the continent early Thursday, with E.U. leaders blasting Trump's decision and saying they were not consulted, as chaos and confusion erupted at several major airports.European Union leaders issued a rare joint statement condemning Trump's move, saying it was taken ""unilaterally and without consultation."" They also condemned attacks he made on them during an address Wednesday night, when he accused the E.U. of spreading the virus in the U.S. by not imposing sufficient travel restrictions on China and elsewhere.""The coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent, and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,"" said a joint statement from Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the presidents of the European Commission and the European Council respectively.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak""The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,"" they added.

With Donald Trump as president, our core values, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America is truly at stake.”And with Biden now leading Sanders by 150 delegates per NBC’s latest count (double the 77-delegate edge he had going into last night’s contests), much of the party is already starting to coalesce around the former vice president.Guy Cecil, who heads the Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA, tweeted: “The math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for President and @prioritiesUSA is going to do everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November.”Another Dem group, American Bridge, did the same.It all raises important questions for Sanders: How does he go forward, especially with the upcoming contests later this month (Florida, Georgia) on even more unfriendly terrain for him?If he stays in the race, how does he campaign against Biden, especially with Trump waiting in the wings?And what message does he send to his young, progressive and Latino-heavy supporters – particularly since the Dem nominee is going to need them to win in November?Tweet of the dayRep. Clyburn on NPR just now: ""I think when the night is over, Joe Biden will be the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination... If the night ends the way it has begun"" it's time to ""shut this primary down,"" meaning the DNC should ""step in"" and cancel future debates.— Miles Parks (@MilesParks) March 11, 2020 Breaking down where Sanders has been weaker than he was in 2016Part of the story of the Democratic primary season has been Joe Biden’s overperformance – especially since South Carolina.But the other part of the story has been Bernie Sanders’ underperformance.He’s now lost several states he won in 2016, including Michigan and Idaho from last night.The white non-college Democrats who sided with him over Hillary Clinton in places like Michigan went to Biden.And even in Sanders’ home state of Vermont, his winning percentage went from 86 percent in 2016 to 51 percent this year.Let our news meet your inbox.

The former vice president won union-affiliated voters there, 63 percent to 33 percent.2020 Vision: Troll Tide in Alabama“President Donald Trump on Tuesday endorsed Jeff Sessions' rival in the Alabama Senate race,” per NBC News.“‘Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement,’ Trump said of the former Auburn University football coach. ‘I love Alabama!’”“The president tweeted that Tuberville ‘was a terrific head football coach’ and ‘a REAL LEADER who will never let MAGA/KAG, or our Country, down!’”The Sessions-versus-Tuberville runoff is on March 31.On the campaign trail todayThere are no public events scheduled for today after last night’s were canceled over fears of public safety amid coronavirus.Dispatches from NBC’s campaign embedsAfter Joe Biden’s multiple victories last night, Bernie Sanders chose not to address the press, NBC’s Gary Grumbach reports.But Biden did — and he tried to sound like a presumptive nominee, per NBC’s Marianna Sotomayor: “Biden saw tonight’s victories as consequential as his last several wins in South Carolina and Super Tuesday states. But unlike those nights, he projected confidence—and at one point full acceptance—that he could be the party’s nominee. ‘This campaign is taking off, and I believe we're going to do well from this point on.’ Biden said. He also thanked Sanders for the race he has run thus far in remarks that sounded similar to ones delivered by past nominees whose opponents had conceded the race. ‘I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal, and together we'll defeat Donald, we'll defeat him together.’”But of course, Sanders has not conceded the party’s nomination. While he hasn’t addressed last night’s results, his press secretary tweeted that she is “excited” about this week’s Democratic debate and that America will get “to see Biden defend his ideas, or lack thereof, on Sunday.”The Lid: Primary colorsDon’t miss the pod from yesterday, when we looked at how Sanders’s 2016 success was largely built around his dominance in caucuses — and what the demise of those contests in favor of primaries has meant for his chances in 2020.ICYMI: New clips you shouldn’t missSahil Kapur has these key takeaways from last night’s primaries — and they’re not good news for Sanders.Gabby Giffords is backing Joe Biden just days before the Arizona primary.There won’t be a live audience at the Sunday debate amid coronavirus concerns.President Trump is proposing an elimination of the payroll tax through the end of the year (and through his reelection campaign).Trump Agenda: (Tele)work it outThe Trump administration is preparing to move hundreds of thousands of federal workers to telework amid the coronavirus scare.Sonia Sotomayor is recusing herself from a Supreme Court case involving the electoral college.There’s a new FISA deal.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo questioned Wednesday why so few people in the U.S. have been tested for the coronavirus.“When they do the retrospective on this one, they are going to say, 'Why did it take the United States so long to bring up the testing capacity?'” said the governor on the ""TODAY"" show. “China did something like 200,000 tests per day. South Korea did about 15,000 tests per day. The United States has only done about 5,000 tests to date.”On Tuesday, Cuomo announced that he was implementing a ""containment area"" around a one-mile radius in the city of New Rochelle, a New York City suburb.Let our news meet your inbox.

But he acknowledged Monday that he did not know how many patients had been tested so far.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that more than 8,500 specimens have been tested for the coronavirus across the U.S. Because multiple specimens are required from each individual, the number of actual patients who have been tested is likely far lower.A running national tally kept by the Johns Hopkins University center tracking the outbreak puts the total number of cases in the U.S. at 1,039, with 29 deaths.'Incompetence': Schumer criticizes Trump's handling of coronavirusMarch 10, 202001:46Cuomo wasn't the only Democratic politician questioning the rate of testing in the U.S. On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., slammed the Trump administration's handling of coronavirus and requested clarity on the availability of tests.""The Trump administration’s total mismanagement of the coronavirus response and insistence on downplaying this epidemic has led to complete confusion when it comes to how people can get tested and whether they will be charged out-of-pocket if they do get tested,” Schumer said in a statement.Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, admitted on Sunday that early attempts to send out coronavirus tests were frustrated by delays, but said the nation's testing capacity is ""accelerating dramatically.""President Trump has not been tested for coronavirus, White House saysMarch 10, 202000:44""Early on, there were some missteps with regard to the test and some technical aspects to it.

"Joe Biden extended his delegate lead over Bernie Sanders in Tuesday night's primaries, according to NBC News projections.The former vice president now has a nearly 150-delegate lead over the Vermont senator after winning four of the six states that voted Tuesday, according to NBC News. Nationally, Biden has 837 delegates to Sanders' 689, as of 8 a.m. ET.Biden appears on track to win Mississippi and Missouri by lopsided margins, which will lead to big delegate hauls since Democrats award delegates in proportion to the margin by which candidates win in each state. He won Idaho by a narrower margin, NBC News projected early Wednesday.Biden has also won the biggest state on the map, Michigan, with 125 delegates at stake. Sanders had won the state at a crucial moment in his 2016 battle against Hillary Clinton and he staked his 2020 comeback on it.Let our news meet your inbox.

Biden has a wide lead in the few public polls that have been taken of those states, with a recent Florida Atlantic University poll showing Biden ahead 61 percent to 25 percent.A week later will come Georgia, the type of Southern state with a large black population where Biden has been especially strong this year. Sanders could hope for success in Puerto Rico later that week given his strength with Latinos.April 4th is the next best slate of states for Sanders, with contests in Alaska, Hawaii, Wyoming, all of which Sanders won in 2016. But they together have roughly the same number of delegates as Louisiana, which also votes that day, where a larger African-American population gave Hillary Clinton a big win four years ago.","Biden rolls on with big win in Michigan, grows delegate lead over Sanders",Mar 11 2020,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-s-rolls-big-win-michigan-grows-delegate-lead-over-n1155031,nbc

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic-controlled House, with President Trump’s support, early Saturday passed a bill to provide free testing for the coronavirus, as well as paid sick and family leave, strengthened unemployment insurance and increased food aid to ease the hardship on families. The vote was 363-40. The legislation will be taken up by the Senate next week. It would require paid leave for workers who contract the virus or who care for those who do and additional food aid for the poor and senior citizens. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, it causes more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus. The legislation includes: FREE CORONAVIRUS TESTING It requires private health insurance plans to provide free coronavirus testing and waives cost-sharing rules for testing provided to people covered by Medicare, Medicaid and federal retirement programs. Another $1 billion is provided to test people without health insurance. It boosts federal matching funds to state Medicaid programs by 6.2% to ease the financial strain on states. PAID SICK/FAMILY LEAVE It establishes a temporary coronavirus-related sick leave benefit paid by employers with fewer than 500 workers. Workers with the coronavirus would receive 100% or their wages if they have the coronavirus or are self-isolating and two-thirds of their pay when caring for family members. The benefit would expire in January 2021. It also permits 12 weeks of job-protected family or medical leave at two-thirds pay, though the first 14 days of the extended leave would be unpaid. In both cases, businesses would be reimbursed by the federal government through a refundable tax credit. FOOD AID It provides $1.3 billion in emergency food aid for low-income pregnant women and their young children, senior citizens and food banks. It allows states to provide food stamps to make up for lost school lunch benefits if their children are kept home from school and directs $100 million of the funds to U.S. territories. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak are already eligible for unemployment benefits, but the legislation provides $1 billion for additional caseloads and administrative costs to encourage temporarily furloughed workers to obtain unemployment benefits. PROTECTION FOR FIRST RESPONDERS The Occupational Safety and Health Administration would be required to issue a temporary rule requiring increased protections against the coronavirus.

"The federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., granted a request by House Democrats Friday to rehear cases over testimony from former White House Counsel Don McGahn and funds for President Trump’s border wall. Both cases are scheduled to be argued before the full circuit court on April 28. Democratic lawmakers in Congress have argued the president violated federal law by reallocating more than $8 billion from the Department of Defense to build the border wall. They also claim Mr. Trump abused his authority by denying the lawmakers from receiving testimony from Mr. McGahn during the impeachment inquiry.

"The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is calling on the Trump administration to “admit” that its ongoing pressure campaign against Iran is not working. The comments from Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, came just days after Iranian-backed military group Kata’ib Hezbollah launched an attack on a base north of Baghdad that killed two U.S. service members and one British soldier and wounded 14 others. The U.S. responded Thursday evening with airstrikes on five of the group’s weapons storage facilities that the Pentagon says “will degrade Kata’ib Hezbollah’s ability to conduct future strikes.” In a statement Friday evening, Mr. Menendez, the ranking member of the committee, said “that in attributing Wednesday’s attacks to Iranian-backed militia groups, the Trump Administration must admit its efforts to deter Iranian aggression are failing and American service members are paying the ultimate sacrifice.” The escalation in tension between Washington and Tehran quickly resurfaced just as the House approved a war powers resolution aimed at limiting the president’s authority to use force against Iran without explicit congressional approval. The bill — while expected to be vetoed by President Trump — “directs the President to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces for hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran or any part of its government or military, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force against Iran.” Mr. Menendez highlighted the bipartisan support for the resolution that allowed it to be approved by the Republican-held Senate and said this majority “has made clear it does not support an unnecessary war with Iran.”  ",Menendez calls on Trump to admit Iranian deterrence efforts are failing,"Friday, March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/13/menendez-calls-on-trump-to-admit-iranian-deterrenc/,washington_times
"In his quest to regain a Senate seat he once held, Jeff Sessions may have lost the endorsement he most coveted — the president’s — but he is racking up stamps of approval from many players in the conservative establishment. On Friday, the National Rifle Association backed Mr. Sessions’ bid to return to the Senate, an uphill fight in which the former attorney general trailed one time Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville in the March 3 primary. The two are now heading into a March 31 Republican runoff. The NRA’s backing came just two days after President Trump gave Mr. Tuberville his enthusiastic endorsement, driving a final stake through any pretension Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions maintained a political alliance or friendship. In Mr. Trump’s eyes, Mr. Sessions committed an unforgivable betrayal when, shortly after he got the attorney general position, he recused himself from the investigation into fraudulent charges the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. That led to the appointment of a special prosecutor who packed his office with supporters of Hillary Clinton and generally haunted the first three years of the Trump administration. No evidence of collusion was ever found. Nevertheless, the Sessions campaign has crafted itself as Trump loyalists, all behind a conservative lawmaker who could advance the president’s agenda better than a political neophyte and Alabama carpetbagger like Mr. Tuberville. “Powerful, well-funded national forces are bent on destroying our right to keep and bear arms,” Mr. Sessions said. “Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are working day and night to gut the Second Amendment. I have fought Schumer and Pelosi on this issue, and I have won, and I will do so again when I return to the Senate. “Alabama cannot afford to send an untested, unproven, weak-kneed greenhorn to the Senate who will get run over by Schumer and Pelosi,” Mr. Sessions added. Jason Ouimet, who heads the NRA’s Political Victory Fund, said endorsing Mr. Sessions was an easy choice. “Based on your strong leadership on Second Amendment issues as a U.S. senator and U.S. attorney general, you have earned the highest attainable rating, an A+ from NRA-PVF,” Mr. Ouimet said in the announcement. The winner of the Tuberville-Sessions runoff will face Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in November. Mr. Jones, who rode to office on a tide of out-of-state money in a 2017 special election to replace Mr. Sessions, is rated the most vulnerable senate incumbent by most political analysts. The myriad endorsements Mr. Sessions has collected reflect how the conservative establishment trusts him after he spent decades in Washington as a rock-ribbed Republican. Earlier this week, Mr. Sessions garnered support from the Eagle Forum PAC, which joined the endorsements from the Family Research Council PAC, the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, the Alabama Forestry Association and several conservative luminaries in the Yellowhammer state. But the establishment’s muscle may be hard pressed to push Mr. Sessions over the hurdle of Mr. Trump’s endorsement of his opponent, and the fact the March 3 primary saw a plurality of voters prefer either Mr. Tuberville or Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne who finished third.

"Count Sen. Bernie Sanders among the people who think President Trump should get tested for the coronavirus. During a press conference in Burlington, Vt., Mr. Sanders was asked whether Mr. Trump should get tested and release those results after reportedly  being around people who have been diagnosed with the virus. “I would,” Mr. Sanders said. “To the best of my knowledge I have not been in proximity to somebody who had the virus. If I knew that I was, I would get tested, and I think that holds true for the president.” During a press conference at The White House Friday, Mr. Trump said he sees no reason for that to happen because he has not exhibited symptoms of COVID-19.

"President Trump declared a national emergency to deal with the new coronavirus that’s swept the globe and hit the U.S., saying states will get federal money and face fewer obstacles in testing and caring for patients. “Two very big words,” Mr. Trump said from the White House Rose Garden. “No resource will be spared, nothing whatsoever.” The designation will invoke the Stafford Act and extend up to $50 billion in aid to states and municipalities. He also ordered states to activate emergency-operation plans. Mr. Trump said he is temporarily waiving interest on student loans held by federal entities and that he directed the Department of Energy to buy up oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Also, his administration will give hospitals and health centers the flexibility to see patients from afar through telehealth and waive certain licensing requirements, so doctors can’t help areas that need them. He’s also waiving restrictions that limit the number of hospital beds in each facility or the length of a patient’s stay. Mr. Trump also revealed he plans to be tested for the virus.

"The White House reached a sweeping agreement with congressional Democrats late Friday on a bill to provide relief to workers hurt by the coronavirus outbreak. “We are proud to have reached  an agreement with the Administration to resolve outstanding challenges,  and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act,”  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to her colleagues. After some last-minute wrangling, President Trump tweeted his support for the measure shortly before 9 p.m., clearing the way for a bipartisan vote. “This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers,” Mr. Trump said. “I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt.” He added, “I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES! I will always put the health and well-being of American families FIRST. Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!” Mrs. Pelosi had a dozen conversations with Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin throughout the day as they negotiated the details. The package includes free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured; two  weeks of guaranteed paid sick leave, as well as increased family leave;  increased spending on  unemployment benefits; more money to provide  school lunches to students whose schools are closed; and an increase in  Medicaid funding. Mr. Trump had been pushing for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year, but Democrats opposed it. Getting the White House’s approval means the Republican-controlled Senate would likely approve the measure sometime next week. Lawmakers are planning to take up an even larger emergency response bill on the coronavirus in the weeks ahead. Congress has already approved an $8.3 billion measure to help states with their initial emergency health care responses.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont said the coronavirus crisis is exposing gaps in the nation’s “cruel” and “dysfunctional” health care system that leaves millions of people without coverage when they need it most and millions of others more susceptible to contracting the virus. Mr. Sanders said the virus is helping the public come to grips with the fact that it is time to make fundamental changes to the economy and health care system that lifts up the working-class, calling for paid family leave, overhauled trade deals and a guarantee of health coverage. “In my view, the most cost-effective way to reform our dysfunctional and cruel system is to move to a Medicare for All single-payer health care system and I think in the midst of this crisis more and more Americans understand the truth of that,” Mr. Sanders said at a press conference in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont. “It is nearly impossible to believe that anyone can still think it is acceptable to continue with a health care system that leaves tens of millions of people uninsured.” “The cruelty and absurdity of that view is more obvious in the midst of this crisis,” he said. “Let’s be clear, the lack of health care and affordable medicine does not only threaten the health and well-being of the uninsured, it impacts everyone who comes in contact with them. In fact, what this crisis is beginning to teach us is that we are only as safe as the least insured person in America.” Fears over the virus have changed the contours of the 2020 presidential race, with Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden taking the advice of health officials and deciding against holding campaign rallies and events with large numbers of people. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden are set to appear in their first one-on-one debate Sunday. Citing concerns over coronavirus, the Democratic National Committee and the event sponsors, CNN and Univision, announced the debate would be moved from Phoenix to Washington, D.C., and that there would be no live audience. Consequently, Mr. Sanders has relied on getting his message out at press conferences this week that have been streamed online and picked up by cable news networks. On Friday, Mr. Sanders said public health officials, doctors, and scientists should lead the response to the virus  - not politicians. The federal government must dramatically increase the availability of test kits, intensive care units, and doctors and medical personnel needed to combat the virus, while making sure the frontline workers are protected, he said. Mr. Sanders said the nation must take stock of the mistakes the government has made responding to the virus and what moves can be made to the federal government to make sure people are better equipped to face future challenges. Mr. Sanders drove home the point that he expects support for universal health care to increase and lamented how the nation’s trade deals have sent jobs overseas and made the nation reliant on foreign countries such as China for the supplies it needs to combat this sort of crisis. “People who are sick today, who woke up with symptoms of the coronavirus are saying, ‘You know I feel sick, but I can’t afford to go to a doctor,’ and when somebody is not treated for the virus, somebody who is unable to afford to go to that doctor, that means that the infection can spread to many others, putting us at risk,” Mr. Sanders said. “Now the lack of health insurance for many millions of people threatens other people as well.”  ","America ‘only as safe as the least insured person,’ Sanders says regarding coronavirus emergency","Friday, March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-only-safe-least-insured-bernie-sanders/,washington_times
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats will vote later Friday on a coronavirus relief package, with or without the support of the White House. “The American people expect and deserve a coordinated, science-based and whole-of-government response to keep them and their loved ones safe,” Mrs. Pelosi said at the Capitol. But she didn’t answer a reporter’s question about whether President Trump supports the bill. The president wants a cut in payroll taxes through the end of the year; Democrats haven’t included it in the measure. Mr. Trump said later that the White House was still negotiating with Democrats, but he wasn’t pleased with the bill. “We just don’t think they’re giving enough,” the president said. “They’re not doing what’s right for the country. We thought we had something, but all of a sudden they didn’t agree to certain things they had agreed to.” The package would make coronavirus testing free for everyone who needs it, allow for two weeks of paid sick leave and provide unemployment insurance for furloughed workers. “We can only defeat this outbreak if we have an accurate determination of its scale and scope, so that we can pursue the precise science-based response that is necessary to put families first,” Mrs. Pelosi said. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin has been negotiating nearly round the clock with Mrs. Pelosi on the bill. They spoke eight times on Friday alone.

"NEW ORLEANS — Louisiana postponed its scheduled presidential primary by two months Friday in response to the ongoing coronavirus health crisis, officials said.Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced the primary, slated to be held on April 4, will now be June 20.Mr. Ardoin is expected to provide more details at a press conference later Friday. While major professional and college sports events, along with many college campuses, have shut down, Louisiana is the first political event to be postponed because of the virus. The state had 33 presumptive cases of coronavirus as of Friday morning, with the biggest cluster of those — 23 — being New Orleans. Many of Louisiana’s Election Day commissioners are 65 or older, and to date the coronavirus has been most lethal to the elderly. In addition, 32 polling locations are in nursing homes of senior facilities, according to the secretary of state’s office. “This decision has been made out of an absolute abundance of caution for Louisiana’s voters, voting officials and the general public as a whole,” Mr. Ardoin said. The primary was formally switched when Mr. Ardoin’s request to move it to June 20 was approved by Gov. John Bel Edwards. Although it does not appear to have moved voting days because of health scares in the past, Louisiana has altered its election schedule because of major hurricanes and natural disasters, officials said.

"Sen. Bob Casey took a shot at the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus, saying Americans would have better luck purchasing a semi-automatic rifle than they would tracking down a test kit for the virus. “Right now in America, it is easier to get an AR-15 than a test kit for COVID-19,” the Pennsylvania Democrat said on Twitter. President Trump and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been widely-criticized for being too slow to react to the spread of the infection. On Friday, Mr. Trump has shifted the blame for the shortage of test kits onto the Obama administration and the CDC, arguing they left the nation unprepared for this sort of outbreak. A week ago, Mr. Trump said that, “Anyone who wants a test can get a test” and Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said there is “no testing kit shortage.” Democrats on Capitol Hill have vehemently disagreed.

"The coronavirus has started to infect more and more political ads — particularly attacks targeting Republicans on health care. Advertising Analytics, an independent ad tracking firm, highlighted the recent uptick in coronavirus-related ads in its weekly recap, pointing out that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was the first to run a pair of COVID-19-related television spots in his short-lived 2020 campaign, and outside groups aligned with Democrats have since followed in his footsteps. Fair Fight Action, a voting rights group created by former Georgia state Rep. Stacey Abrams, has accused Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who defeated Ms. Abrams in the state’s 2018 gubernatorial race, of seeking to “blow up” programs that “keep Georgia Safe.” “Kemp is proposing blowing up our criminal justice system, cutting millions of dollars, blowing up job training programs, blowing up mental health services blowing up health care funding for every Georgia county as coronavirus hits our state,” the narrator says in the ad. Sen. Steve Daines, Republican Montana, was the target of a coronavirus-inspired attack ad from Protect Our Care, a liberal health care group that advocates for Obamacare. “Too many Montana families go to sleep at night worried about health care — coverage, costs, now the fear of coronavirus,” the narrator says in the ad. “That doesn’t worry. Steve Daines.” The Health Care Education Project, meanwhile, is accusing President Trump in an ad of trying to cut health care that people will need to protect themselves from the virus. “Now Trump wants billions more health care cuts when we need it most,” the narrator says over a screenshot of Mr. Trump and a news headline “CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK.” It then pivots to a video clip from a press conference in which New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says, “There has to be a play where you don’t play politics.” “It has to end somewhere, and it should end with health care,” the Democrat says.

"The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee moved forward with a subpoena against a lobbying shop for records relating to the work former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s son, Hunter, did for a Ukrainian energy firm. The committee suddenly shifted its attention to Blue Star Strategies earlier this week instead of its former consultant, Andrii Telizhenko, who turned to conservative talk radio to make his case. Sen. Ron Johnson, committee chairman, notified his Democratic colleagues on Thursday that he was sending a subpoena to Blue Star for records of its work on behalf of Burisma Holdings, the firm connected to Hunter Biden. Mr. Johnson’s letter indicates he also wants Blue Star’s CEO and chief operating officer to testify before his committee. Lawmakers were expected to vote in committee on Wednesday to issue a subpoena to Mr. Telizhenko, but Mr. Johnson abruptly shifted course to focus directly on Blue Star itself. Mr. Johnson has reiterated the decision was made based upon the suggestion of “both Democrat and Republican members of our committee.” Mr. Telizhenko still wants to have his voice heard, and appeared on conservative radio host Glenn Beck’s program on Thursday. Mr. Telizhenko said he did not want to speak about Blue Star until he felt threatened and heard that if Mr. Biden wins the presidency Mr. Telizhenko may no longer be welcome in the United States. “I have emails, communications, with Blue Star Strategies throughout the time I worked for them, before and after, that I wanted to share with the Senate, which is relevant for the investigation,” Mr. Telizhenko told Glenn Beck. “There’s no Russia collusion here, it’s just documents.” Mr. Telizhenko said his information is covered by a nondisclosure agreement, which is why he cannot voluntarily turn his information over to the Senate in the absence of the issuance of a subpoena. No hearing has yet been scheduled for the testimony of Blue Star executives.

"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who had dinner with President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence last weekend, said Friday his second test for the coronavirus was negative. Mr. Bolsonaro made the announcement on his Facebook page after a major daily newspaper in Brazil reported that his first test was positive. His son Eduardo, a lawmaker who was also on the trip, told Fox News that his father’s initial test was positive. Eduardo Bolsonaro tweeted Thursday that Mr. Bolsonaro was tested but was “not exhibiting any symptoms of the disease.” The populist Brazilian leader has developed a bond with Mr. Trump and met with the president Saturday at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Mr. Bolsonaro’s top press aide, who also attended the meetings with Mr. Trump, also has tested positive for the virus. The White House said Thursday that Mr. Trump hasn’t been tested, and the president said he was not concerned about being in close proximity to someone with the virus. Mr. Bolsonaro was wearing a surgical mask Thursday while carrying out his official duties in Brazil.

"House Majority Whip James Clyburn said he considers President Trump to be a racist and that the U.S. “could very well go the way of Germany in the 1930s,” Axios reported Friday. Mr. Clyburn, South Carolina Democrat, made the remarks in a recent interview scheduled to air this weekend on the “Axios on HBO” cable program, the news site reported. “I used to wonder, how could the people of Germany allow Hitler to exist? But with each passing day, I’m beginning to understand how. And that’s why I’m trying to sound the alarm,” Mr. Clyburn said in an excerpt released ahead of the episode airing. The third-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives and one of the most influential congressmen on Capitol Hill, Mr. Clyburn has been frequently critical of Mr. Trump and his policies as president. Mr. Clyburn endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden right before South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary. The congressman has also previously drawn parallels between Mr. Trump and former Nazi leader Adolf Hitler on more than one occasion. “Having studied history and having taught history, I can only equate one period of time with what we are experiencing now and that was what was going on in Germany around 1934 right after the 1932 elections when Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor,” Mr. Clyburn said during a CNN interview in January 2018. “When I see and hear and experience what’s going on in the country today, I think back to that time, and I really believe that we as Americans had better get a handle on things. If we don’t, we could very well see ourselves going the way of Germany,” he said at the time. More recently, Mr. Clyburn reiterated that warning while speaking to NBC News last March. “Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor of Germany. And he went about the business of discrediting institutions to the point that people bought into” it,” Mr. Clyburn said last year. “Nobody would have believed it now. But swastikas hung in churches throughout Germany. We had better be very careful.” The full version of the recent interview with Mr. Clyburn will air Sunday on HBO, Axios reported.

"PHOENIX (AP) - Maria Chavira, a senior administrator in the Diocese of Phoenix, says Spanish-speaking Catholic parishes in her area are “bursting at the seams” and celebrates the emergence of Hispanics as the largest ethnic component of the church nationwide. Throughout the Southwest, where the surge has been dramatic, Roman Catholic leaders are excited by the possibilities - and well aware of daunting challenges.  Hispanics now account for 40% of all U.S. Catholics, and a solid majority of school-age Catholics. Yet Hispanic Americans are strikingly underrepresented in Catholic schools and in the priesthood - accounting for less than 19% of Catholic school enrollment and only about 3% of U.S.-based priests.  In the Phoenix diocese, there are than 700,000 Hispanics out of a total of 1.2 million Catholics. Yet out of more than 200 priests, Catholic researchers counted only seven American-born Hispanics.  Extensive efforts are under way to narrow the demographic gaps. They have been highlighted in a nearly completed four-year study  by U.S. Catholic bishops seeking to strengthen the church’s engagement with Hispanics.  ”We have a lot of opportunities,” said Chavira, who oversees the Hispanic Mission Office and other departments in the Phoenix diocese. “There may be a little turbulence ahead, but we’re going to make it.”  Chavira is among more than two dozen Catholic leaders and activists who shared their thoughts about the Hispanic Catholic phenomenon with The Associated Press, some in telephone interviews and others face-to-face during a reporting trip to Arizona and Texas’ Rio Grande Valley.  Evidence of the change can be seen each December, when thousands of Hispanic Catholics dance and march in downtown Phoenix to celebrate Our Lady of Guadalupe. It can be seen in fast-growing, heavily Hispanic communities in Phoenix’s western suburbs.  Nationwide, more than 1,200 Catholic schools have closed in the past decade, usually under financial stress. Yet in the suburb of Avondale, enrollment is surging at a handsome new Catholic high school.  The school, named for Pope John Paul II, opened in 2018. About 70% of its 220 students are Hispanic; plans call for rapid expansion to accommodate an enrollment of 1,000.  “We’re serving people who’ve been underserved in this nation,” said the principal, Sister Mary Jordan Hoover. “These young people are trying to learn to be the next teachers, the next administrators, writers, doctors. They’re dreaming big.”  The hopefulness contrasts with circumstances in some other regions. Hundreds of parishes have closed in the Northeast and Midwest. The clergy sex abuse scandal has forced more than 20 dioceses across the U.S. into bankruptcy since 2004, most recently in the Northeast. The scandals haven’t spared the Southwest. The dioceses in Tucson, Arizona, and in Santa Fe and Gallup, New Mexico, are among those that declared bankruptcy. But in states along the Mexico border, past scandals don’t diminish the excitement over a future Hispanic-accented Catholic church. More than 400 new parishes have opened since 1970 in the border states, and many Hispanic Catholics were elated by the recent election of Mexican-born Los Angeles Archbishop José Gómez as the first Hispanic president of the bishops’ conference.  “It’s the tale of two churches,” said Hosffman Ospino, a professor of Hispanic ministry at Boston College. “In Boston, I see a Catholicism that’s very reserved. In the Southwest it’s very public, very expressive.”  A major challenge for the Catholic hierarchy: persuading more Hispanic young men to become priests.  An example of that challenge: 30-year-old Diego Piña Lopez of Tucson. He’s devoted his life to the Catholic tenet of supporting the dignity of all people, including asylum seekers who visit Casa Alitas, the Catholic-run shelter in Tucson where he works.  Growing up, he sometimes considered becoming a priest, but opted instead to pursue graduate degrees in social work and public health. Why not the priesthood? “I wanted to have a family,” he said.  By the latest count of the bishops’ conference, there are about 37,300 U.S.-based priests. Among them are roughly 3,000 Hispanics - more than 2,000 of them foreign-born.  One problem, said Ospino, is that Hispanics in the U.S. have lagged behind other groups in regard to college-level education, limiting the pool of young men qualified for seminary.  But even as the second and third generations of many Hispanic immigrant families do pursue higher education, other factors are at play.  “With those generations, there’s extremely heavy pressure to think more about economic success than the glory of God,” said Daniel Flores, bishop of Brownsville, Texas. “We need to teach them the concept of service, rather than you need to earn as much as you can.”  Overall enrollment in Catholic schools in the U.S. has plummeted in recent decades, from more than 5.2 million in the 1960s to about 1.73 million this year. Of the current students, only 18.5% are Hispanic.  Experts cite several reasons. Many Hispanics in the U.S. come from Latin American countries where private schools, including Catholic ones, are viewed as bastions of the wealthy. With tuition averaging more than $5,000 for elementary grades and $10,000 for high school, Catholic education in the U.S. seems unaffordable to many families. And many Catholic schools are losing students to charter schools which are able to access government funds for their operations.  All these factors are present in the Brownsville, diocese, where Catholic school enrollment has dropped sharply in recent years in the face of tougher competition from charter and public schools.  One of the elementary schools fighting to maintain its enrollment is St. Mary’s Catholic School. Its principal, Ana Gomez, says 95% of her 350 students are Hispanic. She’s been able to keep enrollment stable with strategies taught by the Latino Enrollment Initiative, a program based at Notre Dame University. Tactics include ensuring that schools are culturally in sync with Hispanic families, and helping parents fit tuition into their budgets. About 80 St. Mary’s students now get some financial aid, Gomez said.  While the Hispanic population in the U.S. is sure to grow, the extent of the Catholic Church’s hold on them is uncertain. Last year, the Pew Research Center reported that U.S. Hispanics are no longer a majority-Catholic group, with 47% of them calling themselves Catholic, down from 57% in 2009. The number identifying as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” increased from 16% to 23%; those identifying as Protestant rose from 23% to 26%.  Melba Salazar-Lucio, a professor and migrant-rights activist in Brownsville, says today’s Catholic Church seems too rigid for many Hispanics. Her mother no longer attends church, she said, and her three grown children are no longer practicing Catholics.  “There are other denominations - they have more music, younger pastors who are more accepting of people’s ways,” Salazar-Lucio said. “The Catholic church is not going to be changing with the times.”  At a migrant outreach center in Nogales, Mexico, abutting the Arizona border, Jesuit priest Sean Carroll ministers every day to asylum seekers who dream of joining the ranks of Hispanic Catholics in the U.S.  “They are bringing their culture, their gifts,” he said. “The challenge for the church is to be open to receiving those gifts. How do we get them to see themselves as leaders? How do we get them to feel at home?”  ___  Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

"BAGHDAD (AP) - At the once bustling hub of the largest anti-government protest movement in Iraq’s modern history, crowds have dwindled, and donation boxes have sprouted up. Loudspeakers resound with calls by activists for funds to keep their hard-fought revolution alive.  The six-month-old movement has faced one setback after another, from the shifting positions of a mercurial Shiite cleric to an apathetic political class and, now, fears over an outbreak of the coronavirus  that Iraq’s decrepit health system has struggled to contain, with nearly 93 confirmed cases and nine deaths.  Where once Baghdad’s Tahrir Square had seen thousands every day, now only a few hundred protesters turn up. Morale has been dampened among young Iraqis who first took to the streets on Oct. 1 to decry rampant government corruption, poor services and unemployment.  Protesters have found it difficult to revive the strength of their leaderless movement after scoring victories early on, like pressuring lawmakers to pass a key electoral reform bill and forcing former Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi to step down. Assassinations, abductions and threats targeting prominent protesters have contributed to blunting the momentum.  A looming economic crisis linked to the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing political dysfunction could eventually bring a new jolt that inspires Iraqis back to the streets. But for the moment, the movement is looking at what went wrong. The difficulties of recent months caused the poles of authority among protesters to shift from the capital to the south, while some say shunning any form of central leadership was a mistake. In Tahrir Square, a group of young men recently shared a hookah pipe under a tarp by a tunnel replete with the wall art of their revolution. Together, they embodied the spirit that first brought many into Iraq’s central squares to protest. Marwan Ali, 23, had attended university to study communication but could only find work as a barber after graduation. Mohammed Abbas, 19, didn’t bother pursuing a higher education, convinced it wouldn’t secure a job. So in October he picked up a banner and joined the movement.  Hussein al-Hind, 22, was a teenager when he heeded a call by Iraq’s top Shiite cleric to take up arms and defeat the Islamic State group with what would later become the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Forces. He soon became disenchanted as his one-time war heroes joined the ranks of the political class by running in the May 2018 election.  The young men have also suffered the violence that has met the movement. Al-Hind showed off two bullet wounds from clashes with riot police; Abbas was detained by police for three days early on in the demonstrations; Ali’s family has received messages from unknown groups threatening his life.  Now, the future of their hard-fought protest movement depends on the ability of these youth to keep to the streets. When the conversation turned to the state of their movement, Marwan Ali took a moment’s pause.  “We are disappointed,” he said. Asked why he was still coming to Tahrir, he said, “This isn’t about the homeland anymore, we are here for the blood of our martyrs.” Over 500 people have been killed since October under fire by security forces who have used live ammunition, tear gas and recently pellet guns to disperse crowds.  In nearby Khilani Square, clashes still rage between a core group of protesters and security, with at least two demonstrators dead last week.  The movement was dealt a blow in January after radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who also heads a major political bloc, withdrew support after elites selected a prime minister candidate he backed, Mohammed Allawi. Al-Sadr’s reversal instilled a climate of fear in the square as militiamen affiliated with his group, which once protected protest sites, intimidated demonstrators who refused to back Allawi, activists said. Allawi has since withdrawn from the post. “We were tools in al-Sadr’s game,” said Kamal Jaban, an activist.  It was an eventuality that activists said they wanted to avoid when al-Sadr’s followers first joined the movement.  As early as November, protesters bristled at the question of leadership and were quick to diminish the credibility of those making claims of authority over them. They tore down stages built by political parties in protest plazas, fearing the fate of previous grassroots movements that fizzled out when co-opted by political actors.  Three months since, protesters said in hindsight the lack of core leadership had hobbled their movement, enabling figures like al-Sadr to do exactly what they had feared.  “There is no one to represent us, put pressure on the government,” said Ali, under the tarp in Tahrir.  Al-Sadr’s move also diminished Tahrir Square’s status as the central voice of the movement. Activists started looking to Haboubi Square in the southern city of Nasiriya for orders. Nasiriya’s protesters have been resilient against infiltration by political parties, partly due to support from local tribes.  In hindsight, said Ali, this weakened the movement.  “Tahrir Square became tainted with al-Sadr supporters,” he explained. “At first Nasiriya was listening to us, now we listen to them.”  It was Nasiriya that gave political elites a deadline to make progress on protester demands, prompting an escalation in demonstrations across the country. Later, calls from the southern city led protesters in Baghdad to block the strategic Mohammed al-Qassim highway. When Haboubi Square raised the image of activist Alaa Rikabi as their choice for prime minister, Tahrir did the same.  Other protesters said fatigue from months on the street was taking a toll as donations for food and supplies were running short and temperatures dropped over the winter. “Weak turnout was expected some time ago because the protesters who have been here for five months are tired, sleeping in cold and far from wor¬¬k, their families and school,” said Murtada Emad, a protester and university student at Babil College of Basic Education. “I left school, but my family is pressuring me to go back.” By February, protesters were marginalized as political bickering over Allawi’s government formation ignored the core demands of the street. Allawi withdrew as prime minister-designate on March 1 after failing to secure parliamentary support for his Cabinet.  Back in Tahrir, Ali Jumaili, 22, said all hope was not lost.  “Every day, I sit on the sidewalk with my friends and weep because of the weakening demonstrations,” he said. “The revolution will repeat itself with more vigor in the future.”  ",Iraq's protesters struggle to keep waning movement going,"Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/iraqs-protesters-struggle-to-keep-waning-movement-/,washington_times
"BEIJING (AP) - Courtney Huang fell in love with the U.S. as a nursing student in Texas. She ended up staying 13 years and wants to become a U.S. citizen. But Huang now finds her job, future, and dreams of citizenship on the line since the Trump administration barred entry last month to non-U.S. citizens and residents flying in from China over the coronavirus outbreak. With crucial deadlines looming, her plans look increasingly at risk. “I’m really scared,” Huang said. “I have a lot there. If I don’t go back, it’s just going to be very difficult.” The U.S. suspended visa processing in China on Feb. 3, citing limited staffing during the virus outbreak. No deadline extensions have been announced and it’s not known when the suspension will be lifted. That’s put hundreds of Chinese citizens applying for U.S. work visas in limbo, fretting as their jobs look increasingly at risk. Huang had returned to China to see her parents over the Lunar New Year holiday in late January. She had recently landed a new job in California and her work visa was on the verge of approval when the American Consulate in Shanghai announced it was returning everyone’s passports. After weeks of fretting and weighing her options at her parent’s home in eastern China, Huang flew to Thailand. She now plans to wait out a mandated 14-day self-quarantine before seeing if she can get her visa from the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok. Though Huang was born and raised in China, her whole life is now in Oakland, California, where she has an apartment, car, friends and job. With her Christian faith and gregarious, outspoken manner, the U.S. feels like home. “I feel like I fit in better there. Free speech, free religion,” Huang said. Clean air, better career opportunities for women and a liberal social environment were also draws, she added. Huang obtained a nursing degree in Texas, then a master’s degree in bioengineering from U.C. Berkeley. She’s on the verge of completing an M.B.A., with an eye toward settling permanently. Now, Huang is concerned those plans could fall apart. Though her new employers, a company that provides clinical support for physicians, are understanding, Huang worries that as the months go by, there’s a possibility she may lose her job - and with it, her right to work in the U.S. Like Huang, Kevin Yang, a Chinese doctoral student researching immunology at an American university, is also reconsidering his options. After moving to the U.s. eight years ago, Yang has returned home each winter holiday and had his student visa renewed without a hitch. This year, though, Yang became one of many Chinese citizens caught up in the brutal tussle between Beijing and Washington over trade and technology. When Yang applied for a visa in December, the State Department told him it was being delayed while they investigated his background for ties to the Chinese government. American officials have in recent years grown alarmed over the alleged theft of U.S. technology by China, casting a cloud of suspicion on Chinese citizens like Yang who work in the sciences. Told the check would take four weeks, Yang changed his flights and prepared to stay longer. Then in late January, the Chinese government began locking down whole cities to contain the virus. Soon after, Trump announced the U.S. travel ban. Yang got his passport back in the mail with no visa. American officials told Yang’s academic adviser that since Yang no longer had a visa, they could no longer pay his stipend or fund his research with federal grant money. Hospital surveys that Yang said he spent “thousands of dollars and thousands of hours” over two years to set up were now in peril, something he described as a crushing blow. “Maybe it’s time for me to start thinking about an alternative career,” Yang said, mulling the possibility he won’t be able to finish his Ph.D. “It’s like restarting my life.” Discouraging high-skilled foreigners from immigrating could undermine the U.S. economy and its global prominence, said Anastasia Tonello, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Nearly 2.5 million Chinese were in the U.S. as of 2018, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, and most are significantly better educated than the average American. China is also the main source of foreign students enrolled in U.S. higher education. While health and safety are legitimate concerns, blanket travel bans aren’t the answer, Tonello said. “I just don’t think this was thought through,” she said. “These are just such broad strokes and can cause so much damage.” The U.S. isn’t the only country currently restricting entry from China. Travelers face restrictions across the globe, from neighboring North Korea to far-flung New Zealand, Somalia, and Guatemala. Australia, a major destination for Chinese students and immigrants, also has banned arrivals and stopped issuing visas. Such restrictions have been loudly criticized by China’s Foreign Ministry, though Beijing frequently singles out the United States. Yang and Huang both say they understand why a travel ban could help contain the virus. But they say the U.S. halt on new visas - with no deadline extensions or other accommodations - is frustrating and unreasonable. Even more frustrating for Huang is the sense that the U.S. is trying to bar her from coming back. “I’m not being respected. I work in the states as a talent; I pay my taxes diligently,” Huang said. “This just makes me feel like, ‘Oh, maybe I’m just not welcome in the states.’” Even for Chinese with visas, the clock is ticking. Tom, a programmer from the epicenter of the outbreak, the city of Wuhan, had just obtained a master’s degree in computer science from Emory University in Georgia. He has a U.S. visa but got stuck in Wuhan after the city was quarantined. Under American law, foreign students have 90 days after graduation to start new jobs if they want to stay and work in the U.S. If Tom is still trapped in Wuhan by May, he’ll lose both his new job at Amazon and his chance to work in America altogether. “I’d have to start all over again,” Tom said, declining to provide his last name for fear it could affect his visa and career prospects. “I just worry every day about whether I can go back to America.” Tom says his family spent around $70,000 to send him to Emory for a shot at a better life in the U.S. He didn’t want to work in China, deterred by the Chinese tech industry’s notoriously-long hours, popularly known as “996” –9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. U.S. officials told him there was nothing he could do.  “We just want some help or advice,” Tom said. “Please don’t ignore us, it’s something completely out of our control. That’s the worst thing.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"PHOENIX (AP) - The U.S. government says a new rule disqualifying more people from green cards if they use government benefits will not apply to immigrants with coronavirus or virus symptoms if they seek care.  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said late Friday that seeking treatment or preventive services won’t affect someone’s immigration status under the new, highly criticized public charge rule, which took effect last month and which punishes immigrants who need public assistance.  The agency acknowledged that some immigrants may fear seeking care in the wake of the virus, saying that it “will neither consider testing, treatment, nor preventative care” related to the virus in determining someone’s eligibility for permanent residency. It said that those who can’t work or attend school and must rely on public benefits during the duration of the virus outbreak and recovery can later explain and provide documentation and that it will be taken into consideration.  The announcement came after lawmakers and advocacy groups urged the government to suspend the rule during the coronavirus outbreak. Advocates say they have been fielding panicked calls from immigrants who are worried about the impact on their status if they seek health care.  Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles, said her group and others held a news conference urging immigrants to seek care if needed and reminding them that their health, and the health of their families, is most important.  “People are wondering about their vulnerability both in terms of disease but their vulnerability in terms of immigration status, in terms of being discovered,” she said. Salas said she doesn’t fully trust the Trump administration but feels confident that state, county and local authorities will support immigrants who come forward to seek the health care they need, regardless of their immigration status. Advocates have long derided the public charge rule, which punishes immigrants who are in the country legally and who are allowed to access some benefits, such as food stamps, for their American-born children.  As the coronavirus began to spread more widely in the U.S., supporters and lawmakers cautioned it could be detrimental to public health if some immigrants were too afraid to seek care.  Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights Boston, said his organization got a request for legal support from a woman who worked in hospitality industry in Chelsea, Massachusetts. The woman said her work schedule is in flux, and she doesn’t have a steady income. She wanted to apply for food stamps for her 9-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, but was too afraid. Now, with her son’s school closing down indefinitely, she was even more concerned.  “There is a tremendous reluctance, even among immigrant parents raising U.S. citizen children. There is a lot of fear surrounding the public charge rule, especially because immigration courts have remained open, creating a strong impression that removal proceedings trumps public health concerns,” Espinoza-Madrigal said.  On Thursday, Democratic lawmakers pressured Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, to suspend or disregard the rule during the virus outbreak. Cuccinelli said the public health exemptions written into the rule already addressed that issue.  U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, said the rule scares away people from seeking care, posing a public health risk for everyone. She tweeted after the new statement on Friday: “This is a huge win for immigrants, public health AND everyone!” ___ Associated Press reporter Amy Taxin contributed to this report   ",US: Immigrants can seek coronavirus care without fear,"Friday, March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/13/us-immigrants-can-seek-coronavirus-care-without-fe/,washington_times
"WASHINGTON (AP) - Seattle’s immigration court will close down as the nation continues to grapple with managing the coronavirus pandemic, and several other large immigration courts will postpone certain hearings for immigrants who are not detained that often involve large groups.  The court in Seattle was temporarily shut down earlier this week over a report of a second-hand exposure to the virus and will remain shut until April 10. Seattle is among the areas hardest hit so far, with a cluster of deaths and dozens sickened. The number of cases in the U.S. was put at around 1,700 Friday, with about 50 deaths. But by some estimates, at least 14,000 people might be infected. According to a statement obtained by The Associated Press from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which manages the immigration court system, other courts will remain open where the virus has struck, including Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Newark, New Jersey, and Sacramento, California. But “master calendar” dates for those who are not detained will be postponed. Those hearings can include dozens of people in a single courtroom. “The agency continues to evaluate the dynamic situation nationwide and will make decisions for each location as more information becomes available,” according to the statement from EOIR, which is a division of the U.S. Department of Justice.  There are 68 immigration courts nationwide; the others will operate as scheduled but officials with EOIR said they are evaluating and will adjust as needed.                  The U.S. immigration courts  are dealing with a massive backlog of 1 million cases. There have been some delays of trials among the nation’s criminal courts, and some states have closed courtrooms as the virus spreads.  There have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the immigration system, but it’s not clear how frequently tests are being performed, if at all. There is often movement between detention facilities at the border, where some migrants enter the U.S. sick, and throughout the immigration system that has put employees on edge.  A union representing immigration judges has called for a temporary halt to the “master calendar” hearings. On Thursday, Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the head of the union, wrote to the leadership of EOIR asking for more measures be put in place to protect judges and employees.  “In the absence of uniform guidance, some immigration judges have attempted to implement their own risk mitigation strategies,” she wrote. “However, these efforts have been frustrated by a time-consuming bureaucratic process that is simply not sufficient in the current circumstances.” Tabbador also called the postponements in six cities “wholly inadequate to address the public health risk” and called on EOIR “to shut down all of these large group hearings in all immigration courts across the country.” In El Paso, Texas, some guards work shifts at both the long-term detention center and the public courts where people are not detained. On Friday, guards were seen interacting with two dozen migrants for a mass hearing in the non-detained court, which sits on the 7th floor of a building that also has public offices for the IRS and other federal agencies.  The migrants have been required to live in Mexico while they apply for asylum. They sleep in a network of shelters in Ciudad Juarez, along with migrants from other countries and other continents.  Separately on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it would temporarily suspend social visits at all of its detention facilities across the U.S. Officials said there were no detainees in ICE custody who had confirmed cases of COVID-19 and said canceling visitation was precautionary to “further safeguard those in our care.” ICE holds more than 37,888 immigrants in more than 130 facilities, including local jails and prisons. But unlike other detention centers, have wide discretion on who can be released while their cases wind through the courts.  The federal Bureau of Prisons also shut down visitation; inmates at all 122 federal correctional facilities across the country will no longer be allowed visits from family, friends or attorneys for the next 30 days. ___ Associated Press Writer Cedar Attanasio contributed to this report from El Paso, Texas.

"DETROIT (AP) - An expected guilty plea to corruption charges by former United Auto Workers President Gary Jones has been delayed due to the coronavirus and traveling concerns. Jones was to appear in federal court in Detroit on Thursday. He’s accused of conspiring with UAW cronies to embezzle more than $1 million. Defense attorney Bruce Maffeo told The Detroit News that he asked for - and received - a two-week delay and that the guilty plea now will come on April 2. Maffeo is from New York.

Some officials took kickbacks from union contractors. Jones was president for about 1 1/2 years until quitting under a cloud in November. The government said union money was spent on golf, cigars, spas, high-end lodging and liquor. Jones‘ alleged scheme goes back years to his time as the leader of a UAW regional office near St. Louis.

"LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) - Slovenia’s new, right-leaning government was sworn in on Friday, pledging stronger efforts to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. The 90-member parliament voted 52-31 to approve a coalition government led by Prime Minister Janez Jansa, leader of the anti-immigrant Slovenian Democratic Party and an ally of Hungary’s hardline Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Jansa, 61, promised a more concerted effort to contain the spread of the disease, criticizing the previous government which declared an epidemic on Thursday. The outgoing government “flunked the test in recent days,” Jansa said. “What was coming was underestimated and reactions were chaotic,” the official STA news agency quoted Jansa as saying.  Slovenia reported 141 cases of infections on Friday, with a surge of 45 new confirmed cases in less than 24 hours in the Alpine country of 2 million people that borders Italy, the focus of Europe’s coronavirus crisis.  Jansa’s predecessor, Prime Minister Marjan Sarec, was a rare liberal head of government in Central and Eastern Europe. He announced he was stepping down in January, citing lack of support for his minority government.  Sarec, a former actor and comedian, had called for an early election, but his two former coalition partners instead agreed to form a new government with Jansa.  Jansa served twice as the prime minister in the past. He was convicted of corruption in a verdict that was later overturned by Slovenia’s top court, before turning harshly anti-immigrant ahead of the 2018 election that followed the mass influx of migrants into Europe in 2015-16. Jansa’s SDS won the most votes in the 2018 parliamentary election, but other groups in parliament initially refused to cooperate with the party because of its right-wing policies. Analysts in Slovenia say Jansa somewhat has toned down his rhetoric to position himself as an acceptable political figure.

"CHICAGO (AP) — Joe Biden held a town hall in Illinois — or at least  tried to — from 800 miles away in Delaware. Bernie Sanders is staging  daily news conferences from Vermont, instead of his usual rallies around  the country with thousands of supporters. The global coronavirus pandemic has sent the 2020 presidential campaign into a virtual phase. Big rallies and handshakes are out. Virtual phone banks and town  halls are the new normal. Political parties and groups are canceling  in-person gatherings. States holding primaries in coming weeks have urged more voters to  cast ballots by mail and extended hours for early voting centers in an  effort to avoid election day crowds. On Friday, Louisiana’s governor  said he planned to postpone his state’s April 4  primary to June. The Biden campaign scrapped plans for a Chicago rally ahead of  Illinois’ Tuesday primary due to warnings from public and health  officials against large gatherings. Instead, the Democratic front-runner  was supposed to take questions Friday in a virtual town hall via  Facebook live. But it was a rocky start. The livestream started after Biden had  begun speaking, cutting off his introduction, and at one point Biden -  holding a cell phone in his hand - turned and walked partially off  camera, so viewers could no longer see his face. The stream lasted less  than five minutes before wrapping up, with the campaign apologizing for  “technical difficulties.” “I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the  connections,” Biden said after answering a question about protecting  endangered species. “There’s a lot more to say but I’ve already probably  said too much to you.” Sanders, Biden’s rival for the Democratic nomination, has been  holding daily press briefings from his home state, where he has blasted  President Donald Trump and his administration’s response to the virus.  Biden did the same in an address Thursday. Speaking to reporters Friday, Sanders was subdued - the emotional  opposite of the big rallies that have helped fuel his support at the  polls. He drew over 10,000 people at a Chicago rally on Saturday, before  officials starting warning against large events. Sanders said his team  has mastered the use of internet campaigning, livestreaming almost all  of its events already. COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and  cough, for most people. It can cause more severe illness, including  pneumonia, for some people, especially older adults and those with  existing health problems. Most people recover from it. Those with mild  illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness  may take three to six weeks to recover, according to the World Health  Organization. With the coronavirus causing a sea change in presidential  campaigning, candidates and their supporters worry that the virtual  events won’t have the same impact. “We do more rallies than anybody else, and (they’re) often very well  attended. I love to do them,” Sanders told reporters at a hotel in his  home state of Vermont. “This coronavirus has obviously impacted our  ability to communicate with people in the traditional way that we do.  That’s hurting.” In Chicago, Biden volunteer Lally Doerrer was preparing to have a few  other supporters over to her home Friday to watch the virtual town  hall. The retiree finished an online MBA program a few years ago and  said it helped familiarize her with technology like virtual classrooms  and the potential for it to reach many more people than a rally. And  while she believes canceling large gatherings is the right thing to do,  she doesn’t think the virtual events will have the same impact as when  people come together in person. “There is a common physical element that comes from being face to  face, or better yet marching side by side, and that’s what is lost in  this,” Doerrer said. At Biden headquarters, Friday is the last day before the campaign  moves to a work-at-home model for everyone, from the most senior  advisers to the newest organizer. The policy extends to field offices around the country, as well —  just as the campaign was looking to build out the campaign toward a  potential general election matchup against President Donald Trump. Trump  himself has canceled rallies, for now. Biden advisers are reluctant to talk about what the coming weeks may  look like, mostly because they don’t know. They’ve not announced a  public schedule beyond Friday’s town hall and a similar event in Miami  on Monday, both replacing scheduled rallies ahead of Tuesday primaries. If anything, those events are tryouts for a new style, while aides  continue monitoring public health advisories from the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention. In a staff memo, Anita Dunn, Biden’s top strategist, and Jen O’Malley  Dillon, his new campaign manager, said that as of Thursday, that  guidance still suggests that “small gatherings are safe,” as long as no  exposed persons participate. “We will continue to hold smaller events  like roundtables, house parties and press statements,” besides the  virtual events. It’s not the first time this election cycle that candidates have had  to get creative about reaching voters. Stuck in Washington for Trump’s  impeachment trial in the weeks before the kickoff Iowa caucuses, Sens.  Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar held telephone town halls with Iowa  voters, and Sanders held nightly online chats where he spoke to  supporters via live stream, offering updates on the impeachment trial  and his campaign. Klobuchar, who said over 12,000 Iowa voters participated in one of  her telephone town halls, also spoke via phone to voters in New  Hampshire, the second state to vote. Warren held similar calls with  voters in New Hampshire and South Carolina ahead of those states’  primaries, as she campaigned elsewhere. She suggested later while  campaigning in person that she’d reached thousands of voters that way,  but her campaign never released figures on how many people actually  dialed in. Biden has held at least one virtual fundraiser, a rather uneventful  telephone gathering on Dec. 5, when he called in and essentially  delivered a modified version of a stump speech that he’s since  overhauled. Last week, he called in to a fundraiser being held at a  private residence in northern Virginia. Donors heard in person from  former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who’s endorsed Biden, and Steve  Ricchetti, one of his closest and longest-serving advisers, before the  former vice president called in. ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

"ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) - The Michigan Supreme Court has accepted a case involving the University of Michigan and the papers of a man considered to be an influential voice in anti-immigration matters. Dr. John Tanton of Petoskey donated 25 boxes of papers to the university, but 11 boxes were to remain closed until 2035. Those terms now are in question. The Michigan appeals court last year said the closed records are public documents under the Freedom of Information Act because they’re being held by a campus library as an “official function.” It’s a key phrase in state law.  The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the months ahead. Tanton died in July at age 85, days after the appeals court decision. He had a key role in forming Federation for American Immigration Reform. The lawsuit was filed by Hassan Ahmad, an attorney in McLean, Virginia.

"PITTSBURGH (AP) - The soothing voice that transports listeners to faraway places is still there. Visitors to the famed Nationality Rooms inside the University of Pittsburgh’s Cathedral of Learning can still hear E. Maxine Bruhns, 96, pay tribute to the countries and cultures of immigrants who helped shape Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. They simply have to flip an audio switch. Narrations that she researched and wrote for nearly all of the 31 classrooms, each intended to represent those nations before Pitt’s 1787 founding, are part of the legacy of a West Virginia native who spent more than half a century as Nationality Rooms director before retiring this year, citing health issues. Her departure means that for the first time in 54 years, a new director will be sought for the rooms whose rich wood, stained glass, colorful artifacts and other furnishings are of museum quality, yet serve as modern-day classrooms for Pitt students. Creating an updated job description for the woman who supervised it all could be tough given the web of duties that Ms. Bruhns embraced - from greeting world dignitaries and fundraising, to crawling around in a hard hat during maintenance inspections. Throughout her tenure, the rooms had no greater fan or fierce protector, said Maryann Sivak, assistant to the director. “They were her children,” she said. “People would ask her which one was her favorite, and she would say ‘They’re all my favorites.’” Ms. Bruhns was not available to be interviewed for this story. In a farewell to the campus published in the Nationality Rooms newsletter, she referenced health setbacks but focused more on her beloved rooms and a worldview influenced by a period starting in the 1940s when she lived and traveled through Europe, Africa and Asia with her husband, Fred C. Bruhns, who later taught at Pitt. Mr. Bruhns, who worked in refugee resettlement, died in 2006 at age 90. “In 15 years, we never stayed more than two years in any one place. I survived all of these different moves with no tragedies and learning not to hate but always appreciating the culture in which I was living,” Ms. Bruhns wrote. “I brought that back with me and found this marvelous job …” Globally minded Each room - Russian, Hungarian, German, Swedish, Ukrainian, Israeli, Norwegian, African, English, Philippine and others - is distinctive, built with donations from immigrant communities proud of what their sweat in the Pittsburgh steel mills and elsewhere achieved. About 25,000 visitors a year pay to tour the rooms on the first and third floors of the 42-story Cathedral, the tallest classroom building in the Western Hemisphere. Those patrons (adults pay $4 and youths $2) are in addition to others who poke their heads into the rooms during the semester while classes are in session. University officials said they hope by summer to identify a successor for Ms. Bruhns. That person will need to embrace the digital age, while safeguarding the authenticity of a landmark whose oldest rooms date to 1938. “We want someone who is global in mind, but also someone who can understand Pittsburgh and its history and knows what these Nationality Rooms have meant,” said Ariel Armony, vice provost for global affairs and director of the University Center for International Studies. Ms. Bruhns was decades ahead of many in embracing international study, he said. She immersed herself in the cultures of each room - the festivals and the personalities tied to them - knowing that a strong presence within each ethnic community solidified their bond with the university. She never got used to the computer, said staff, who would print out emails for her. Around the cathedral, she was a force far larger than her 5-foot-4, 100-pound frame - not shy about letting everyone know what needed to get done and not above a little colorful language for effect. Her complex travels took her to 83 countries, many with her husband. They left her with some simple truths. “She’d always say, ‘We all came from someplace,’ ” said Ms. Sivak. “She accepted the fact that we all come with our own customs and cultures and they’re all different, and yet we’re able to be accepted into this country. “Everyone felt she was on their side.” The voice of the rooms Ms. Bruhns’s soft, in-room recorded narrations resemble the practiced speech of a museum guide. They blend history, geography, culture and architecture into mini-lectures, with references to Christianity and Noah’s Ark in one room and Mecca and Muhammad in another. “You have entered the Armenian nationality Room through a doorway which tells more of the story of these remarkable people …” her voice informs those standing inside the 21st Nationality Room, later adding: “The stone arch is carved with grapes and pomegranate. These fruits, so prevalent in the area, are symbolic of a fertile land.” In another room, as strains of the bandura are heard behind her, the narration tells visitors they, in effect, are in the reception room of an Eastern European home from the 18th century. “The importance of hospitality to Ukrainians is reflected in their proverb: ‘When a guest enters the house, God enters the home.’” Ms. Bruhns steadfastly steered the rooms clear of politics and protected their historical accuracy, said Michael Walter, the rooms’ tour coordinator. As the Soviet Union dissolved, some encouraged renaming the Czechoslovak room the Czech-Slovak room, but she said that was out of line with the room’s history. Yet she also advocated for a Ukrainian room, though at the time, it was a state within the Soviet Union and not a sovereign nation. Appealing to immigrants On a research campus where clout is wielded by surgeons, scientists and executives with tongue-twisting titles, Ms. Bruhns drew her authority from a different place. Said Mr. Walter, “She talked to everyone.” Born in 1924 as E. Maxine Moose, she grew up 100 miles or so south of Pittsburgh in Grafton, W.Va., owned a pit bull, raised chickens and two piglets that her mother won in a hog-calling contest at a 4-H Club, according to co-workers. As she grew, so did Pitt’s massive Cathedral of Learning, an Indiana limestone structure symbolizing the university’s reach. It was commissioned three years before her birth and built between 1926 and 1936. Then-Chancellor John Bowman, who promoted the Cathedral, sought to harness the enthusiasm of immigrant mill workers by establishing classrooms that would honor their traditions and inspire their children to seek a college education. That idea became the Nationality Rooms. Staff say Ms. Bruhns has always worn her rural roots with pride, often calling herself a “by-gosh hillbilly.” She was an insatiably curious traveler and passionate voice for global scholarship at Pitt, a commuter campus in the 1960s beginning to realize its global aspirations. But her spontaneity was never far away. One day she greeted young 4-H Club members from Westmoreland County with a hog call in the Cathedral’s Commons Room. On the building’s third floor, just past the Armenian and Swiss rooms, two wall display cases are filled with artifacts and memories from her travels - many before she arrived at Pitt. Some are beautiful, if obscure, like the Mende mask from Sierra Leone, and the white oak plate and vessel from 20th century Ukraine, crockery made from a tree sacred to Ukrainians. Other mementos leap out: the photo of Ms. Bruhns standing with Dr. Albert Schweitzer, the theologian, humanitarian and physician of the early 20th century, with whom she spent 36 hours in 1964 while on the west coast of Africa. She and her late husband hopscotched the globe before arriving at Pitt in 1965. During that time, Ms. Bruhns learned to speak French “well,” German “with cute little mistakes,” and “conversational” Arabic, Farsi and Greek, she told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2006. She knew “basic” Italian and Cambodian and “emergency” Spanish and Chinese, she said. The couple ventured to Austria shortly after World War II to resettle war refugees, she said in the interview. Then it was off to Beirut, where the Ohio State University alumna finished a master’s degree and her husband examined the Palestinian refugee crisis. They were in South Vietnam in 1955 to help refugees fleeing from the north. Then there was Cambodia, and later, Iran during the reign of the shah. “We were supposed to go to Baghdad, but they had just killed the king, so they sent us to Tehran,” she said. Dalai Lama to Khrushchev At Pitt, her tenure dating nearly to the Cuban missile crisis generated colorful experiences and stories, from rice she shared with co-workers that had been blessed by the Dalai Lama and given to her during a visit to Oakland, to recollections of a tour of the Nationality Rooms by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, several years before she began her job. “He didn’t like the Russian room because it didn’t have any symbols of his beliefs,” she told the Post-Gazette in 2007. “They took him up to the Early American room and he said, ‘Now this is a Russian room.’ It had a big fireplace, a wooden floor, big, heavy wooden beams and a carved table.” Yet her most colorful stories may be the recorded room descriptions themselves, like that of the Syria-Lebanon Room, originally a library in a fine Damascus home dating to 1782. “Linden-paneled walls and ceiling are decorated with Gesso painting, in which a mixture of chalk and glue is applied by brush in intricate relief then painted and overlaid with silver and gold leaf.’’ The images may be why Ms. Bruhns was at peace telling an interviewer in 2006 that she doesn’t need to travel much anymore. “You can go around the world in about a week just from the people you speak to and the cultural events that go on in this building,” she said. “It’s never boring here.” ___ Online: https://bit.ly/2IA38iJ ___ Information from: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, http://www.post-gazette.com  ","Nationality Rooms director retires, but her voice lives on","Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/nationality-rooms-director-retires-but-her-voice-l/,washington_times
"President Trump isn’t getting tested for the coronavirus after all. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said in a memo released shortly before midnight Friday that the president would not be tested, nor would he self-quarantine, despite having interactions with at least two infected people from the Brazilian delegation last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The president’s interactions with the infected people were “low risk,” Dr. Conley wrote. “The president’s exposure to the first individual was extremely limited (photograph, handshake), and though he spent more time in closer proximity to the second case, all interactions occurred before any symptom onset,” he wrote. “Testing for Covid-19 is not currently indicated.” During a press conference on Friday, Mr. Trump said he “most likely” would be tested for the virus soon.

"Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, indicated his opposition Saturday to the coronavirus relief bill supported by President Trump and approved by the House of Representatives. Mr. Johnson, the chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, voiced concerns about the Families First Coronavirus Response Act being considered on Capitol Hill. In a statement, Mr. Johnson criticized language in the legislation that would require government employers and companies with fewer than 500 people on their payroll to provide paid sick leave to workers who contract COVID-19, the infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. “Although mandating that all employers must pay for sick leave might sound good, we need to consider the unintended consequences of this legislation. I fear that rather than offering a workable solution, the House bill will exacerbate the problem by forcing small businesses to pay wages they cannot afford and ‘helping’ them go further into debt,” said Mr. Johnson. “I hope the Senate will approach this with a level head and pass a bill that does more good than harm — or, if it won’t, pass nothing at all,” he said in the statement. “The president and states already have adequate authority and funding to address the current situation.” The Democratic-led House voted 363-40 early Saturday to pass the coronavirus relief bill, putting it on path to be considered next by the Senate where Republicans maintain a majority. Every House Democrat and most Republicans in the House voted to pass the bill, although Mr. Johnson is hardly the only Wisconsinite to raise objections. Each of the state’s Republican congressmen — U.S. Reps. Mike Gallagher, Glenn Grothman, Jim Sensenbrenner and Bryan Steil — were among the 40 lawmakers who voted against the bill Saturday, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted. President Trump announced his support for the bill Friday, saying on Twitter that he encourages “all Republicans and Democrat to come together and VOTE YES” and that he looks forward to signing the bill as soon as possible. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said during a press conference Saturday that 2,226 domestic cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the U.S. Around 50 people have died after contracting the disease, Mr. Trump said at the press conference.

"Republicans and Democrats linked arms early Saturday morning and pushed a massive coronavirus relief package through the House, calling it a down payment on the kinds of assistance Americans are going to need as the epidemic sweeps the country, The bill now heads to the Senate where GOP leaders said they’ll study it over the weekend, with an eye toward votes next week. House lawmakers brushed aside worries about the price tag and voted on the bill without knowing a cost, saying the virus is an unprecedented threat that must be dealt with no matter what the damage to the budget. The new bill has the government pick up the tab for coronavirus testing, pumps money into food assistance and unemployment programs and pays for sick leave so those who contract COVID-19, or who have to take off to care for someone who did, will be compensated. “Democrats worked tirelessly with the Trump administration and with Republicans in the House and Senate to ensure this is a truly bipartisan bill,” said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer. Mr. Trump also praised the bipartisanship. “Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats,” he said on Twitter. “Bill really pulled together. Nice to see!” House members voted just after midnight on Saturday, capping a few days of feverish negotiations. The House had first been slated to vote Thursday, and then Friday, on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s version of a bill. But she negotiated changes with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and the final result won overwhelming support from both sides, 363-40. Every Democrat who voted backed the bill, while the “No” votes came from conservative Republicans. The chamber’s lone independent voted “present.” More than two dozen lawmakers missed the vote, including several who are in self-quarantine after coming into contact with someone who later tested positive for the virus. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said he expects the bill will have wide support in his chamber, too. But first the Senate must figure out how to get beyond a surveillance bill that’s the pending business on the floor. The emergency virus bill does not include President Trump’s demand for a payroll tax cut, nor other economic stimulus measures. Mrs. Pelosi said they’ll look at stimulus measures in a future bill, which won’t be as rushed as this one. The bill that did pass focuses on addressing needs amid massive public institution closures. A major selling point of the bill was getting food out into communities for children who rely on free meals at schools, which have been shuttered for weeks to try to control virus spread. The bill also suspends work requirements for those who apply for food stamps, and pumps money into state Medicaid programs, so they can handle an influx of patients. All sides agreed the biggest aspect of the bill was promoting testing, so public health officials can get a better sense for the extent of the virus.

"Vice President Mike Pence told White House staffers on Saturday to use “social distancing” and to “avoid physical contact” to protect themselves and their colleagues from the coronavirus. In a staff-wide email, Mr. Pence cited “additional cases throughout the National Capital Region” in urging they take proper precautions. “As an employee aboard the White House Complex, we have an additional duty to protect the health of our Executive Branch and those working with us,” the vice president said. He noted that healthcare experts on the task force he’s leading advise the following steps to reduce transmission and illness: President Trump said Saturday that he has been tested for the coronavirus and is awaiting the results. The president, who also shook hands with several guests at a press conference on Friday, acknowledged it’s a hard habit to break. “It’s sort of a natural reflex, and we’re all getting out of it,” Mr. Trump said. “All of us have that problem. We’re all getting out of that, shaking hands. It’s not a great thing to be doing right now. People are thinking about it more and more, we have to think about it, it’s important.” The White House also has begun taking the temperatures of everyone who could come in close proximity to the president and the vice president. Mr. Pence’s email noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “recommends home-quarantine only for those who have had close (within 6 feet) prolonged (>10 minutes) contact with a symptomatic (cough, fever, etc.) COVID-19 patient, or their respiratory droplets.” “This excludes casual, limited interactions such as handshakes, photographs, etc.,” he wrote. “If you interacted with an individual when they are without symptoms (asymptomatic), but whom subsequently receives a positive test, the risk of you becoming infected from that interaction is considered LOW. You do not require testing, nor home isolation.  Active social distancing would be appropriate.”  ",Pence urges White House staffers to 'avoid physical contact' and use social distancing,"Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/pence-urges-white-house-staffers-avoid-physical-co/,washington_times

"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Misdemeanor, traffic and petty offense cases in federal court have been postponed in the Eastern District of Virginia in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The district also has suspended all non-case related events, tours and other gatherings in courthouses, including naturalization ceremonies. Chief Judge Mark S. Davis said in a special order posted Thursday that there have been confirmed or presumptive cases of coronavirus within the Alexandria, Richmond and Norfolk divisions of the court. He also said there have been reports of people scheduled to appear in court who are under self-quarantine based on possible exposure. The order says the cases will be continued through April 30. New dates will be reset without the need to file any motions. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that the delays caused by the continuances will be excluded from requirements of the Speedy Trial Act. “In exceptional circumstances, any judge in the Court may make a case-specific exception to the District-wide continuance if the parties and counsel agree that there is a valid case-specific reason to proceed with a hearing,” the order says. No changes have been made to civil or criminal felony dockets. The courthouses and clerks’ offices remain open.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez urged young New Yorkers on Saturday to stop crowding into bars and restaurants amid the coronavirus outbreak because they might be spreading the pathogen even if they feel OK. The bartender-turned-congresswoman tweeted about the need for “social distancing” amid evidence people in urban areas, including the popular 14th Street area of D.C., aren’t heeding calls to stay at least six feet away from others to avoid spreading the viral disease, COVID-19. “To everyone in NYC but ESPECIALLY healthy people & people under 40 (bc from what I’m observing that’s who needs to hear this again): PLEASE stop crowding bars, restaurants, and public spaces right now. Eat your meals at home,” the progressive first-term House Democrat wrote. “If you are healthy, you could be spreading COVID.” By “crowded,” she meant any place where you could not stand at least six feet away from another person. Andy Slavitt, the former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama, echoed that advice, saying the tribulations in hard-hit Italy should serve as a warning. “What are mayors, governors & their staffs reporting? That people are jamming the bars,” Mr. Slavitt tweeted. “I get it. Home from work. Cooped up. Crisis mentality. We need to let steam off. Shared experience. But stop that. All the bars & restaurants are closed now across Europe.” As people stay home, however, workers who cannot telework or rely on tips will take a major financial hit. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said Washington needs to step in to provide relief, including a universal basic income. “The need for social distancing from restaurants only underscores the need for relief for tipped workers, freelancers, shift workers, etc.” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote. “Tax credits & unemployment insurance does not help many of these workers — that’s a huge segment of our economy. We need emergency UBI, now.” The coronavirus was discovered in China in December and has sicken more than 150,000 people around the world, while killing over 5,700. The U.S. has recorded nearly 2,500 cases and about 50 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - A group of sheriffs is suing Illinois to halt a 2017 law that bans police from detaining people based on their immigration status without a court-ordered warrant. The lawsuit states that the Illinois Trust Act interferes with law enforcement’s ability to respond to detainers issued by the U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement. The detainers require police to keep custody of prisoners who are in the U.S. illegally for up to two days.  The lawsuit was filed Monday by sheriffs from McHenry, Ogle, Stephenson and Kankakee counties. It names Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul as a defendant.  “This language requires Illinois law enforcement officers to comply with an immigration detainer they receive from those federal officers tasked with carrying out national immigration policy,” the lawsuit states. “Immigration detainers notify law enforcement officials that DHS (the Department of Homeland Security) has found probable cause that the person subject to the request is a removable alien.” The sheriffs said the act has exposed them and their offices to litigation over the years, as three of the four  have been sued for allegedly violating the statute. The Illinois Sheriffs’ Association said last month that some violent felons who had faced deportation are instead being released after their prison terms end as a result of a policy change by Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration. The sheriffs’ concerns came just days after President Donald Trump’s administration announced the unusual step of dispatching Customs and Border Patrol Agents to Chicago and other “sanctuary cities” that have set up impediments to enforcement. The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigrant Justice Center called the lawsuit “a thinly veiled attempt to justify ongoing violations of the law.”  “Under the Trust Act, Illinois simply requires that federal immigration officials provide a judicial warrant, like would be expected for any other arrest, before local law enforcement are permitted to honor an immigration detainer,” the groups said. “Nothing about the Trust Act is unconstitutional. It simply doesn’t comport with the way in which these four sheriffs want to conduct their work. Law enforcement in Illinois cannot pick and choose which laws they follow and which they do not.” The Trust Act, which the General Assembly approved, was  signed into law by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. Critics argued that it turned Illinois into a sanctuary state, which Rauner and other supporters denied.

"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - When New Mexico law enforcement agents carrying Glock pistols and AR-15 rifles enter homes in predawn raids these days, they sometimes find themselves outgunned by the crooks. That’s not the only troubling trend. Violent offenders are getting younger, often recruited by older career criminals who know that under the state or federal laws they face stiffer sentences if caught. And suspects aren’t only wearing bulletproof vests, they are selling them on the streets. Such is the state of violent crime in the Albuquerque metro area and elsewhere in New Mexico as an FBI-led violent crime task force begins its second year on the streets. Over the past 10 months, nearly 100 people have been arrested and 76 firearms confiscated by task force agents who work 16 to 18 hours a day and carry active caseloads of up to 80 each. As proof of its success - and the continuing criminal hold on New Mexico - the special force of FBI agents, New Mexico State Police, Albuquerque Police Department detectives and Bernalillo County Sheriff’s deputies is set to nearly double in size, said FBI violent crimes division supervisor Percy Giles. Eight new task force officers, including one from the state probation/parole office, will join the 11 other members – who include four APD detectives, one from the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department and a total of three positions from State Police. “It’s basically a force multiplier for us, and it’s going to give us additional resources to do the things we need to do at a faster rate,” Giles said. The new boost in federal funding for the effort “is a testament to all the partnerships and the work we’ve been seeing. …” Most of those arrested are prosecuted federally, where conviction rates are “extremely high,” Giles said. FBI Special Agent Bryan Acee, coordinator of the task force, told the Journal his team puts a “priority” on targeting “that dedicated career offender” who has violent crime and/or drug trafficking convictions. Giles added that “in working with our state and local partners, we’re also looking for the individuals who are creating the violent acts on the streets.” Even if they aren’t considered career criminals or don’t have long rap sheets of convictions, they might be targeted “based on intelligence that we’re seeing on the ground.” But the work is getting more dangerous. Over the past year, Acee said, task force members have seen an increase in high capacity magazines for pistols and rifles and the use of AR-15 pistols, which can be concealed. “We’re seeing a lot of the AR-15 pistols, which is essentially an AR-15 rifle (with the butt stock removed), the same rifle the FBI is carrying when they’re entering a house.” He said the team is also coming across an increase in Glock pistols, “there again, by the coincidence, the same gun we carry.” But there’s a difference in the firepower. Agents carry Glocks with magazines that hold 15 rounds. Offenders are now using high capacity 30- and 50-round magazines that can be inserted into Glock pistols. And Acee said the team is starting to see Glock full-automatic selector switches. “So you can have a Glock pistol, with a 50-round magazine, then you can insert a device at the back of the Glock which converts it into a machine gun, or fully automatic. “Simply stated, a regular squad of FBI agents going into a home, we’re carrying that Glock pistol. We’re carrying the AR-15. They have more firepower than we have going into the house.” Giles said the task force is seeing more targets with bulletproof vests. “If we are in a firefight, that basically makes things equal, because we have bulletproof vests, too. That emboldens them to potentially do harm to law enforcement. …” In one recent case, Matthew “Goat” Martinez, a member of the Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico prison gang, was out on the streets selling bulletproof vests. Undercover task force agents bought four of the vests from him before arresting him. Martinez was later convicted of possession of heroin with intent to distribute. Last month, the task force arrested Manuel Bolivar after a predawn raid in Southwest Albuquerque. They found 3 pounds of methamphetamine, almost $16,000 in cash, five pistols and two rifles, 96 blue fentanyl tablets, 155 packaged strips of suboxone and a bulletproof vest, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition. And they recovered a selector switch to allow a Glock 9mm pistol to be fired as a fully automatic firearm. Bolivar is 21 years old. “One of the trends that we’ve been seeing is, and that’s also with the gangs as well as the violent actors, is they’re becoming younger and younger,” Giles said. “The older guys tend to have more of a criminal history, more convictions, and the word is getting out on the techniques that we’re using … the more convictions you have, the higher your criminal points are on the federal side, which means more prison time if convicted. “So they’re sending juveniles to do their dirty work for them.” One task force member, the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department, had this to say about the effort: “Sheriff Manuel Gonzales believes that our partnership with Federal agencies is critical to assist in keeping our community, children, families and businesses safe. The additional staffing complements our previous crime fighting efforts and will also assist in stronger prosecution of the violent offenders.” Giles and Acee said the involvement of state and local agencies is invaluable. Task force members with state or local jurisdiction can often arrest an offender on state charges, while federal agents look at federal crimes that might be filed. Or, Acee said, in the case of an offender who is a felon suspected of committing a homicide with a firearm, “that APD detective on our task force can charge the offender with being a felon in possession of the firearms (in the federal courts) and we can run with that case while the state continues to investigate the homicide.” The result often is getting the offender off the streets. Giles said roughly 60% of the cases investigated by the task force are “proactive.” Offenders targeted typically have a criminal history and are suspected in other violent crimes. For example, Casiano Coronel at age 21 was charged as a habitual offender in state District Court in 2018. Last April, he pleaded no contest to aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer, aggravated DWI, child abuse and receiving or transferring a stolen motor vehicle. State District Judge Daniel Ramczyk of Albuqueque released Coronel on his personal recognizance and referred him to comply with “Youth Adult Court,” pending further resolution. But months later, Coronel became a suspect in a shooting under investigation and the violent crime task force opened a “proactive case” on him. In late June, the task force requested its probation and parole partners put Coronel on GPS monitoring, and he was placed under task force surveillance. Within days, Coronel cut off his ankle monitor and tried to carjack an undercover APD detective, who killed Coronel in a shootout. According to news reports, the detective was conducting surveillance. Giles said the case underscores why the task force is also requesting its own federal prosecutor. “We need to execute things in a swift manner, because these are dangerous individuals we are targeting. They’re dangerous for the community. They’re dangerous for law enforcement, so a swift apprehension is most preferred.”  ",New Mexico authorities eye tactic changes amid violent crime,"Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/new-mexico-authorities-eye-tactic-changes-amid-vio/,washington_times
"MOSCOW (AP) - Police in the Russian capital have detained dozens of people at a protest against political repression outside the headquarters of the Federal Security Service. The OVD-Info group that monitors arrests at demonstrations in Russia said 49 people were detained on Saturday. It was not immediately clear what charges would be filed. The detentions came as people stood in line to take part in a single picket protest. Russian law allows lone picketers without prior permission. Rotating single pickets, in which each person stands for a short period before giving way to the next, is a frequent strategy. The security service is the main successor to the Soviet KGB and its headquarters building on Lubyanka Square has strong symbolic resonance.

"IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - Amid growing concern about the expensive incentives promised to Amazon to land its new headquarters, Kentucky lawmakers considered a bill to shield its largest city’s failed pitch from public scrutiny. To open government advocates, the effort to hide Louisville’s bid was an outrage that soon got worse: A House committee approved the bill with an amendment barring residents outside Kentucky from obtaining public records on any subject. Labeled a “wrecking ball” to the public records law, the bill stalled last March amid opposition. But opponents are anxiously waiting to learn whether a similar measure will be introduced again. “I fear that something’s going to drop and it’s not going to be good,” said Amye Besenhaver of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition. Advocates like her in all 50 states are getting a new tool to help identify legislation like the Amazon bill that affect the public’s right to know - and give a glimpse of what’s happening across the country. The National Freedom of Information Coalition is launching a bill tracker that aims to find, in real-time, all pieces of legislation that affect government transparency in state legislatures. On its website, the coalition is releasing dashboards of pending or recent legislation in all states for Sunshine Week, an annual celebration of open government that runs from March 15-21. One goal is to alert the public quickly so advocates can try to stop anti-transparency bills from becoming law or from spreading to other states. Another is to allow journalists and researchers to spot trends, ranging from efforts to expunge more court cases from the public record to preventing out-of-state residents from seeking documents. In Kentucky’s case, the tool could have helped flag the Amazon secrecy bill as well as legislation in states like Tennessee and Kansas to require more, not less, transparency around economic development incentives. Daniel Bevarly, the coalition’s executive director, said tracking such bills is challenging because only a few states, such as Florida and Maine, require such legislation to state up-front that they would affect government transparency. The number of reporters covering statehouses also has dropped significantly in recent years, meaning there are fewer eyes watching legislative action. Anti-transparency provisions are often buried deep in legislation, some of which may be about unrelated topics, Bevarly said. The new program could act as an early alarm system that blocks poorly written bills from becoming laws. “Hopefully when we are tracking this, lawmakers will have a better idea that they are under close scrutiny by the public,” said Bevarly, whose group has state and regional affiliates representing 37 states. The program uses software from Quorum, a Washington D.C.-based technology company, that scrapes the raw text of bills from all 50 state legislative websites once or more a day. That information goes into a database where key search terms can be used to identify a bill’s potential relevance to a group or an industry. Quorum has previously launched bill-tracking efforts for groups such as the Sierra Club, which has credited the program with helping mobilize its response to legislation that would ban protests around critical infrastructures such as pipelines. The National Freedom of Information Coalition conducted a pilot program with Quorum on all 142,000 state bills introduced in 2019. It found that 13.6 percent of those, or more than 19,000, contained transparency-related search terms that the coalition wanted to track, including phrases such as “public record,” “open meeting” and “body camera.” In a report on the pilot program in January, the coalition said that volume of bills was “too great” and turned up some that were extraneous. The coalition said the tracker would be more successful in the future as its members refine search terms and tailor them to each state. Eventually, the program could use machine learning to further inform its tracking and output. Quorum co-founder and CEO Alex Wirth noted that most, but not all, of the coalition’s state affiliates tracked legislation and their methods for doing so varied greatly. He said his company is helping centralize that information “so that every state can be alerted when there is a piece of legislation.” “That is the big value and the breakthrough, and the next step on that journey will be making that available to all of their coalition members and the general public,” he said. Coalition outreach manager Kelsey Ryan, who helped investigate secrecy in Kansas government  when she was with the Kansas City Star, said the dashboard isn’t perfect yet but will allow for a “more analytical and thorough method for finding transparency-related bills.” “This is particularly true for states like my home state of Kansas, where legislators have a history of doing ‘gut-and-go’ bills - passing bills before the public ever has a chance to find out what the bill is about,” she said in an email. Besenhaver, the Kentucky advocate, said she tracks legislation “the old-fashioned way” by reviewing the text of proposed bills. But she said her approach is not exhaustive and it takes good luck not to miss any potentially important provisions. The Kentucky bill was introduced in February 2019 amid a pending lawsuit filed by the Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper seeking records about the city’s unsuccessful bid for Amazon’s “HQ2” project. The bill would have shielded all records related to “proposed economic development incentives not accepted” by businesses. Dozens of cities and states offered Amazon tax breaks and other incentives worth hundreds of millions of dollars or more for the project, which ultimately went to Arlington, Virginia. Amazon abandoned its plan to build a second location in New York City after opposition from residents and politicians. Some government agencies that did not land the project have sought to keep their bids secret, with varying degrees of success. In August, the Kentucky Court of Appeals ordered the Louisville Metro Government to release its records to the newspaper, but the ruling remains on appeal. “It’s pretty clear they were going to make some extreme concessions to try to bring Amazon in,” Besenhaver said. “The public needs to know that.”  ",Legislative tracker sounds alarm on anti-transparency bills,"Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/legislative-tracker-sounds-alarm-on-anti-transpare/,washington_times

Any journalist, news organization or First Amendment group will be able to search and download the information for research purposes or to create their own, more detailed tracking system.

"WASHINGTON — As the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates return to the debate stage, their party, the stakes, and the world look much different than in their last meeting less than three weeks ago. The fast-moving coronavirus was something of an afterthought in that debate; now the escalating crisis is likely to dominate Sunday’s contest. Rising infections in the United States and around the world have prompted a dramatic slowdown of global travel, upended financial markets, and raised questions about President Donald Trump’s ability to lead the nation through a prolonged period of uncertainty. Just two Democrats - former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - remain to make the case that they are best-positioned to challenge Trump in November. Five other candidates who joined them on stage in the Feb. 25 debate in South Carolina have dropped out, with many rallying behind Biden’s surging candidacy. For both Biden and Sanders, the debate is a moment to display their leadership skills in front of what could be one of the largest audiences of the primary. They’ll aim to draw a contrast with Trump, but also with each other, arguing that they have the right experience, temperament and policy prescriptions to lead the nation through a crisis. “Moments like these don’t come around often in campaigns and this is a perfect opportunity to show millions that you have what it takes,” said Robert Gibbs, former White House press secretary and campaign adviser to President Barack Obama. “They must show voters they are the answer to what is missing right now by being calm, honest, ready to lead and empathetic.” The coronavirus crisis rapidly upended plans for Sunday’s debate. First, the Democratic National Committee announced that it would hold the contest without a live audience. Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel. One of the moderators had to withdraw because of potential exposure to a person who tested positive for coronavirus. It is Biden who will step on stage as the front-runner, a distinction that seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago. After disappointing showings in the early contests, Biden roared back with a commanding victory in South Carolina and has continued to rack up wins across the country, winning broad and diverse coalitions of voters. Moderate Democratic leaders, including former rivals Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, have rallied behind his candidacy and voters have done the same. Advisers say Biden will aim in Sunday’s debate to show voters who backed Sanders or other liberal candidates that they have a home in his campaign. In one overture to liberals, Biden announced his support for a bankruptcy plan championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who ended her campaign earlier this month and has yet to endorse. In a virtual town hall on Friday, Biden said his support for Warren’s proposal, which aims to simplify the bankruptcy process, is “one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on.” Biden holds a solid lead over Sanders in the all-important delegate race, and a strong showing in Tuesday’s primary contests could effectively guarantee his nomination. Four big states will be up for grabs: Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and Florida, a perennial general election battleground where Biden appears to have an edge over Sanders. After a strong start, the race has moved rapidly away from Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist with a loyal following among young voters and liberals. But he’s failed to expand his appeal, particularly among black voters, and his calls for a sweeping political and economic revolution have also fallen flat with suburban voters. Sanders is facing some pressure from within the Democratic Party to step aside and allow Biden take Trump on one-on-one. Several Democratic groups that were waiting to endorse until after the primary have consolidated around Biden, including super PAC Priorities USA. Sanders’ advisers say he is a realist about his current standing and the difficulty of the path ahead. Yet the senator is pledging to grill Biden in Sunday’s debate on his plans for tackling college debt, for his past support of the Iraq war and for his backing of multilateral trade agreements. “I’m going to ask Joe Biden, I mean Joe is part of the establishment for a very long time, ‘Joe, what role have you played in trying to make sure that we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?” Sanders said Saturday during an online “fireside chat” with supporters. Yet it’s unclear if the issues Sanders is aiming to highlight will resonate with voters at a time when much of the nation’s focus has shifted to the growing toll of the coronavirus and put a spotlight on the need for presidential leadership. Schools and businesses across the country are closed, and many hospitals and clinics are struggling to obtain tests for the coronavirus. For Biden, the outbreak of a global pandemic has been a moment to bolster the central argument of his candidacy: that his eight years as vice president give him the experience, as well as the relationships in Washington and around the world, that are needed in the Oval Office during turbulent times. With campaign rallies halted because of warnings against large gatherings, Biden delivered a speech in front of reporters and advisers on his proposal for combating coronavirus, including guaranteeing free testing. Sanders’ later announced his own speech, which focused largely on advocating for his call to overhaul the nation’s health insurance system and replace it with a Medicare for All program. After Sunday’s debate, it’s unclear where the candidates and the campaign go from here. Neither Biden or Sanders has announced any public rallies for next week or given any indication of when they may be able to appear in person for voters again. ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC  ","Coronavirus crisis presents 'perfect opportunity' for Biden, Bernie"," -

"JERUSALEM (AP) - A Jerusalem district court announced on Sunday that it was postponing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s criminal trial for two months because of restrictions arising from the outbreak of the coronavirus. Netanyahu was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday to face charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in connection to a series of scandals. But following the emergency health measures the government enacted restricting the gathering of people in public places, the court announced that it was pushing back the hearing until May 24. Netanyahu is accused of receiving expensive gifts from wealthy friends and offering to exchange favors with powerful media moguls. The long-ruling Israeli leader denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a media-orchestrated witch hunt. Netanyahu’s lawyers had previously appealed for a delay, saying they needed more time to review evidence. But it was swiftly rejected on ground that the March 17 hearing was a procedural reading of the charges only and the defendant’s response was not needed. But after Netanyahu announced a new series of coronavirus-related restriction late Saturday, including the barring of gathering more than 10 people, the justice ministry announced a state of emergency in the courts as well. The virus has spread to more than 100 countries and infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,700. In Israel, some 200 people have been infected with no casualties yet, as severe measures seem to have proven effective thus far. Netanyahu’s legal troubles stood at the center of Israel’s third national election in less than a year. Like elections last April and September, the March 2 vote also ended inconclusively. Netanyahu’s opponent, Benny Gantz, refuses to sit with him in government and has been looking to push for legislation in the incoming parliament that would bar anyone indicted for a crime being able to lead a government - in effect disqualifying Netanyahu from leading the country. But the coronavirus crisis has raised calls for an emergency unity government instead.

"MADRID — Spain’s government said Saturday that the wife of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has tested positive for the new coronavirus. It said Begoña Gómez and the prime minister are in good health and following the instructions of medical authorities at their residence in La Moncloa Palace in Madrid, the government seat. Two ministers of Sánchez’s Cabinet, the minister of equality and the minister of regional affairs, had already tested positive earlier this week. The government said both are in good health as well. The others member of the Cabinet have tested negative. The government informed the media of Gómez’s infection shortly after Sánchez gave a nationally televised address to announce a battery of measures his government will take to combat the pandemic during a two-week state of emergency. Prior to the address, Sánchez presided at a seven-hour Cabinet meeting that was attended by all the ministers except for the two who had tested positive. Health authorities said Saturday that coronavirus infections have reached 5,753 people in Spain, half of them in Madrid, since the first case was detected in late January.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Saturday he had the power to fire or demote Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, adding new fuel to his long-running animus toward the central bank’s leader at a moment when the economy was at risk of edging into recession. Trump told reporters that he wasn’t considering firing Powell, but reiterated his frustration with the chairman. The comments were particularly striking because they came as the coronavirus pandemic shook the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst week since October 2008. In just a few weeks, U.S. stocks have lost all the gains made during 2019. “I have the right to do that or the right to remove him as chairman,” Trump said Saturday at a news conference called to provide an update on the administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. “He has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.” No Fed chairman has ever been removed by a president. The law creating the Fed says its officials and those of other independent agencies can be “removed for cause” by a president. While that issue has never arisen in regard to a Fed official, the courts ruled decades ago that “for cause” meant more than a policy disagreement. Powell announced earlier this month a half-point interest rate cut that shrank the Fed’s key rate to a range of just 1% to 1.25%. It marked the first time the central bank has cut rates between scheduled policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis. And it’s the steepest rate cut the Fed has made since then. Yet, the president continued to complain that he was “not happy with the Fed” because it was “following” and “we should be leading.” The president pointed to lower interest rates set by the central banks in Japan and Germany as proof that Powell had not been aggressive enough in bolstering the U.S. economy. Economists, however, say the lower rates reflect the weaker economic outlooks than the U.S. economy. Trump said he’s made no decision, but suggested he could simply remove him as chairman. Powell’s four-year term ends in February 2022, and his term as a member of the Board of Governors expires January 2028. “I have the right to also take him and put him in a regular position and put somebody else in charge. And I haven’t made any decisions on that,” the president said.  ",Trump threatens Fed chairman as coronavirus roils markets," -

"NEW YORK — As schools across the U.S. shut down in hopes of helping to fight the coronavirus, New York City officials are arguing just the opposite: They’re keeping the nation’s largest school system open to ensure that health and emergency workers aren’t tied down with kids at home. But teachers, many parents and some health experts say the city is making a grave mistake by continuing to call more than 1.1 million children to public schools even as it calls for “social distancing” elsewhere to stem the virus’ spread. While many families elsewhere in the country spent Saturday making hasty plans for an unexpected school shutdown, New Yorkers debated the city’s decision. “You’re not going to have a functioning health care system if the folks in the medical field, the doctors, the nurses, the techs, everyone has to stay home with their kids,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on MSNBC. Parent Anna Gold didn’t see it his way. “It would be a hardship if they closed the schools, but I think it’s a necessary one we need to take in the space of this emergency,” said Anna Gold, who pulled her third-grader and kindergartner out of public schools in Brooklyn on Friday and plans to keep them home next week. Another parent, Dori Kleinman, said she wishes the mayor would allow individual schools to make a decision about whether to close. “I don’t want my children at risk,” she said. New York City became a big outlier as other major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Boston, and several states decided to shutter schools for a week or more. New York health care workers’ unions said the city shouldn’t close schools without a plan to care for the children of those staffing hospital wards. The unions and city officials fear that even New York’s massive health care system could be quickly overwhelmed by a surge in serious cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “If it’s apparent it’s the safe thing, then it must be done, but it’s going to have a big impact on nurses,” said Eileen Toback, executive director of the New York Professional Nurses Union, which represents nurses at Manhattan’s Lenox Hill Hospital. “They’re on the front lines. They need to be here in shifts. They’re single mothers or single fathers sometimes, so they don’t have many backups, and the hospital is 24/7.” In a column in The New York Times, three teaches from Stuyvesant High pressured de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo to close the schools, and develop a plan to feed students that depend on school meals. The teachers describe a lengthy journey for some to and from school that puts students, their relatives and educators at risk. “No amount of hand washing and extra cleaning can prevent our thousands of students and hundreds of faculty and staff members from transmitting germs as they move in and out of classrooms for 10 periods a day,” Samantha Daves, Maura Dwyer and Annie Thoms wrote. De Blasio, a Democrat, has not ruled out closing schools eventually and said city officials would continue a day-by-day examination. But he has noted that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that while there can be reasons to shut schools, it’s not clear that closures will make more difference than other measures, such as hand-washing and isolating the sick. But Dr. Dena Grayson, a researcher and infectious disease expert who works in the private sector, called de Blasio’s decision so far to keep schools open “incredibly foolish.” “The virus will spread like wildfire among the children. They get infected, and they can spread that virus easily to older people who are at a much higher risk,” she said. The city has confirmed coronavirus cases in at least two public school students and at least one teacher. Their schools have been closed for cleaning but are expected to reopen. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover, but the outbreak has caused more than 5,000 deaths worldwide. Teachers’ unions are pressing de Blasio to close the schools, saying they’re worried for their students’ families, their own and New Yorkers at large. “To have 1.1 million students and countless employees crisscrossing the city, it feels to me beyond irresponsible,” says Derek Stampone, who teaches physics and computer science at a Manhattan high school where only about 2/3 of students showed up Friday, a dropoff echoed in the system as a whole. Stampone found himself spending much of Friday’s classes talking about the virus and such prevention tips as hand-washing. “I can see the anxiety in the room,” he said. So did social studies teacher Elise Ritter, who works at a different Manhattan high school that happens to focus on emergency management. The students who did attend, she said, were “really looking around and saying, ‘Why are we still here?’” Many live with grandparents and worry about them contracting the virus, she said. Teachers suggest the city could find ways to provide child care for health care workers - and supply food to the hundreds of thousands of poor students who depend on school meals - without keeping the entire school system open. De Blasio has said that any alternative would recreate the problem that closing schools would seek to solve: People congregating. Cuomo, a Democrat, said school closings remain “purely a local decision” unless a student tests positive, in which case a school must be closed for cleaning. “The closing of schools is a significant trade-off of benefits and burdens,” he said Saturday in a conference call with reporters. “If you close the schools, there are people who will not show up for work the next day. The public education system is also a day care, in many ways.” __ Associated Press reporters Adam Geller and Vanessa Alvarez contributed to this report.

Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel. One of the moderators had to withdraw because of potential exposure to a person who tested positive for coronavirus. It is Biden who will step on stage as the front-runner, a distinction that seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago. After disappointing showings in the early contests, Biden roared back with a commanding victory in South Carolina and has continued to rack up wins across the country, winning broad and diverse coalitions of voters. Moderate Democratic leaders, including former rivals Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, have rallied behind his candidacy and voters have done the same. Advisers say Biden will aim in Sunday’s debate to show voters who backed Sanders or other liberal candidates that they have a home in his campaign. In one overture to liberals, Biden announced his support for a bankruptcy plan championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who ended her campaign earlier this month and has yet to endorse. In a virtual town hall on Friday, Biden said his support for Warren’s proposal, which aims to simplify the bankruptcy process, is “one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on.” Biden holds a solid lead over Sanders in the all-important delegate race, and a strong showing in Tuesday’s primary contests could effectively guarantee his nomination. Four big states will be up for grabs: Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and Florida, a perennial general election battleground where Biden appears to have an edge over Sanders. After a strong start, the race has moved rapidly away from Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist with a loyal following among young voters and liberals. But he’s failed to expand his appeal, particularly among black voters, and his calls for a sweeping political and economic revolution have also fallen flat with suburban voters. Sanders is facing some pressure from within the Democratic Party to step aside and allow Biden take Trump on one-on-one. Several Democratic groups that were waiting to endorse until after the primary have consolidated around Biden, including super PAC Priorities USA. Sanders‘ advisers say he is a realist about his current standing and the difficulty of the path ahead. Yet the senator is pledging to grill Biden in Sunday’s debate on his plans for tackling college debt, for his past support of the Iraq war and for his backing of multilateral trade agreements. “I’m going to ask Joe Biden, I mean Joe is part of the establishment for a very long time, ‘Joe, what role have you played in trying to make sure that we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?” Sanders said Saturday during an online “fireside chat” with supporters. Yet it’s unclear if the issues Sanders is aiming to highlight will resonate with voters at a time when much of the nation’s focus has shifted to the growing toll of the coronavirus and put a spotlight on the need for presidential leadership. Schools and businesses across the country are closed, and many hospitals and clinics are struggling to obtain tests for the coronavirus. For Biden, the outbreak of a global pandemic has been a moment to bolster the central argument of his candidacy: that his eight years as vice president give him the experience, as well as the relationships in Washington and around the world, that are needed in the Oval Office during turbulent times. With campaign rallies halted because of warnings against large gatherings, Biden delivered a speech in front of reporters and advisers on his proposal for combating coronavirus, including guaranteeing free testing. Sanders‘ later announced his own speech, which focused largely on advocating for his call to overhaul the nation’s health insurance system and replace it with a Medicare for All program. After Sunday’s debate, it’s unclear where the candidates and the campaign go from here. Neither Biden or Sanders has announced any public rallies for next week or given any indication of when they may be able to appear in person for voters again. ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC  ","Coronavirus crisis presents 'perfect opportunity' for Biden, Bernie","Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/democratic-debate-coronavirus-crisis-presents-perf/,washington_times
"JERUSALEM (AP) - A Jerusalem district court announced on Sunday that it was postponing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s criminal trial for two months because of restrictions arising from the outbreak of the coronavirus. Netanyahu was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday to face charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in connection to a series of scandals. But following the emergency health measures the government enacted restricting the gathering of people in public places, the court announced that it was pushing back the hearing until May 24. Netanyahu is accused of receiving expensive gifts from wealthy friends and offering to exchange favors with powerful media moguls. The long-ruling Israeli leader denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a media-orchestrated witch hunt. Netanyahu’s lawyers had previously appealed for a delay, saying they needed more time to review evidence. But it was swiftly rejected on the grounds that the March 17 hearing was a procedural reading of the charges only and that the defendant’s response was not needed. But after Netanyahu announced a new series of coronavirus-related restrictions late Saturday, including the barring of gatherings of more than 10 people, the justice ministry announced a state of emergency in the courts as well. Much of the country ground to a standstill Sunday, with schools, malls and places of entertainment shut down. Employees were encouraged to work from home and strict restrictions have been placed on personal interactions. The virus has spread to more than 100 countries, infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,700. In Israel, some 200 people have been infected with no casualties yet, as severe measures seem to have proven effective so far. Netanyahu’s legal troubles stood at the center of Israel’s recent parliamentary election, the third such vote in less than a year. As previous elections last April and September, the March 2 vote also ended inconclusively. Netanyahu’s opponent, Benny Gantz, refuses to sit with him in the government and has been looking to push for legislation in the incoming parliament that would bar anyone indicted for a crime from leading a government - in effect disqualifying Netanyahu from remaining prime minister. But the coronavirus crisis has raised calls for an emergency unity government instead. Netanyahu formally extended an offer Sunday to Gantz to join a government aimed at at halting the spread of the virus, suggesting two frameworks, including one that would see an alternating leadership between them over the course of four years. “The state of Israel needs it. The people of Israel expect it,” Netanyahu said. But Gantz’s centrist Blue and White party seems to consider the outreach yet another ruse after what has been an extremely acrimonious campaign that included unfounded smears against Gantz. “Netanyahu, let’s not manipulate the public. If you’re interested in unity, why postpone your trial at 1 a.m. and send an ‘emergency unity’ outline to the press, rather than sending your negotiating team to a meeting,” Gantz responded on Twitter. “As opposed to you, I will continue to support every appropriate governmental measure, leaving political considerations aside. When you get serious, we can talk.” His fellow party leader and former military chief Moshe Yaalon was even more blunt, comparing Netanyahu’s conduct to that of Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “Whoever criticized us for warning against Israel turning into Erdogan’s Turkey should internalize the cynical exploitation of the corona crisis for the political needs of a man standing before trial,” he said. The anti-Netanyahu forces in the new incoming parliament command a 62-58 majority but are deeply divided among themselves, and appear unlikely to unite to form an alternative government. Against the backdrop of the public health scare, Israel’s president began a series of consultations Sunday with all the elected parties to determine who to tap as prime minister-designate. It typically goes to the leader of the largest party, which in this case would be Netanyahu, but could also go to Gantz if he secures more recommendations from lawmakers.  Given the circumstances, President Reuven Rivlin has implored for a power-sharing unity deal. “Anyone who has watched the news in recent days understands that this is a time of trial, and that these are not regular consultations,” he said. “We must now deal with forming a government as soon as possible … at this complex time.” If the deadlock continues, Israel could see itself heading toward a fourth straight election, which experts say would have disastrous effects on the public’s confidence in their elected officials and electoral system - regardless of the corona crisis.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Sunday that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are already in talks for a third coronavirus bill. On ABC’s “This Week,” Mr. Mnuchin explained that this latest package will be a stimulus bill targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as specific industries that have been hit hard by the virus, including the airline and cruise industries. “We will use whatever tools we have and whatever tools we don’t have we will go to Congress on a bipartisan basis and get more tools,” he said. “We’re in the second inning of nine innings.” Just after midnight on Saturday, the House passed a massive relief package to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers. It mandated free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone that does. The bill also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and school kids. It also bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. “This bill was very important in getting workers money in their pockets, people that have to be home,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The bill passed without lawmakers knowing exactly how much it will cost. This came after Congress passed an $8.3 billion bill to get more resources to state and local health officials. Mr. Mnuchin said he would also ask Congress to help the Federal Reserve have more resources to help the economy weather the virus. However, he would not comment on President Trump’s frustration with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. On Saturday, the president told reporters he had the power to fire or demote Mr. Powell, reiterating his frustrations at what he sees as a slow response. The Fed recently cut rates, now at historic lows, and offered $1.5 trillion in loans to banks. “I’m not going to make comments on that. It would be inappropriate for me as Treasury secretary,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The markets plummeted last week, but recovered somewhat on Saturday, which Mr. Mnuchin credits to the president’s national address Friday and the bipartisan bill.

"Dr. Antony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, urged Americans to shut down more aggressively as the coronavirus spreads. On MSNBC’s “Meet the Press” Mr. Fauci endorsed a 14-day “national shutdown” to help slow down the virus. He explained that he has brought it up with the administration, which is generally open to his ideas. “I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,” he said. On ABC’s “This Week” the doctor explained that lockdowns helped China and South Korea fight the rapid spread of the disease in their countries. China, he said, has reached its peak and is starting to see number of cases drop, whereas South Korea has flatlined. However, he warned that while its hard to predict exactly how long the virus will be a threat, the U.S. should prepare for this to last for several weeks or a few months. “What we should be doing is absolutely much much different. Not business as usual. Just chill down,” he said on ABC. Across the nation, public schools and events are being shut down as states and local officials try to contain the virus.

"VIENNA, Va. (AP) - Everything was in place: the silver kiddush cup beside the rolled-up Torah. The ceremonial candle, brushing braided challah. Twin boxes of Streit’s matzot, unopened. But this wasn’t a hushed synagogue readying for the holidays. It was a Northern Virginia high school - loud, growing louder as class let out one Tuesday last month. Jacob Book, 16, adjusted his kippah and stepped forward to face two dozen students, none of whom he knew, at James Madison High School, which he does not attend. He pointed to three friends standing beside him, behind the table with the challah. “We are here to talk about our lives as Jewish teens,” Book said, “to you.” He cleared his throat. “Other teens.” The afternoon in Vienna, Va., marked the 25th time this school year that Jewish students walked into Washington-area classrooms, gymnasiums or auditoriums - during or after class - to spend an hour explaining their faith to non-Jewish peers. The visits take place through Student to Student, an adaptation of a decades-old Missouri program that the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of Greater Washington brought to the District last school year in a bid to combat a massive spike in anti-Semitic bullying. Washington-area schools have suffered a spate of swastika-filled graffiti in recent months - and incidents of anti-Semitic harassment in K-12 schools nationwide quadrupled between 2015 and 2017, according to a study conducted by the Anti-Defamation League. At the same time, some express concern that awareness of the Holocaust may be diminishing. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that Americans 65 and older displayed slightly greater knowledge of the genocide than did younger generations. “We’re seeing a literal epidemic of anti-Semitism,” said Ron Halber, executive director of JCRC. “It has to be fought.” Trump’s executive order on campus anti-Semitism draws praise, concern During trips, Jewish high school students - belonging to Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist traditions - discuss topics such as how they celebrate Shabbat, which Jewish holiday is most important (“It’s not Hanukkah,” Book said to surprise) and the Holocaust. Then, they take questions from the adolescent audience, some of whom, said program director Sara Winkelman, have never met a Jewish person. “It’s like Judaism 101,” Winkelman said. “But from your peers - and that humanizes it.” The need to “humanize Judaism,” Halber said, also spurred JCRC to begin pushing for a law to improve Holocaust education in Virginia about the same time it introduced Student to Student. JCRC’s legislative lobbying found success last month when the Virginia General Assembly passed a bill that forms a committee to revise how the state teaches students about the Holocaust, genocide and slavery. The legislation awaits the signature of Gov. Ralph Northam (D), whose spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky declined to say whether he plans to sign it. Yarmosky promised the governor will “carefully review” the legislation and said Northam “is committed to ensuring a safe, tolerant and inclusive school environment.” Schools throughout the nation are struggling to handle the outbreak of anti-Semitic harassment, experts said, and to ensure students graduate with a solid grasp of the Holocaust. In many places, Jewish groups are stepping in to help, said Barbara S. Burstin, a University of Pittsburgh lecturer who teaches on the Holocaust and the American Jewish experience. Often, that assistance has involved lobbying for bills similar to the one just passed in Virginia, Burstin said. Twelve states require Holocaust education by law - a number that jumped over the past few years, Burstin said, largely attributable to the efforts of Jewish organizations and Holocaust centers. School officials in Maryland strengthen requirements for Holocaust education Virginia is one of the 12, though Halber says its required lessons - listed in a state Education Department handout that says students should know the Holocaust is “prejudice . . . taken to the extreme” - lack gravity and detail. Education Department spokesman Charles Pyle noted “the department supports” the JCRC-backed bill, meant to make the state’s offerings more comprehensive. “This push for Holocaust education has been ongoing - but getting students to talk to students?” Burstin said. “Huh. Wow! I’ve never heard of anything like that before.” Inside James Madison High, Sam Nunez, 17, listened with arms folded across his Virginia Tech sweatshirt as the four presenters shifted the conversation to food. After sharing their favorites (matzoh ball soup was on three of four lists), the teens summarized Jewish dietary rules and rituals. Rachel Friedman, 16, raised a blue plastic pack of Oreos: These, she said, are kosher, meaning the cookies were prepared in accordance with Jewish culinary precepts. Those rules stipulate that Jews cannot eat pork or mix dairy products and meat, Friedman said. “Also, no shellfish,” she said. “So no shrimp and no lobster.” Nunez, increasingly agitated, could hold back no longer. “Ever?” he interrupted, uncrossing his arms, and most of the room giggled. Afterward, Nunez said the presentation taught him “new things about Judaism.” He knows some Jewish students at school, he said, but would never have thought to ask about their religion. This is the power of Student to Student, said Rori Picker Neiss, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of St. Louis, which originated the program. The St. Louis JCRC, inspired by an initiative that brought Israeli Jewish teenagers to talk to their American counterparts, launched Student to Student with six presenters in 1992. Popular from the start, it grew rapidly: Today, the Missouri program involves roughly 120 Jewish teens and reaches 4,000 non-Jewish teens each year, Picker Neiss said. It has also proved effective at fighting hatred - in yearly surveys conducted by the St. Louis JCRC, teachers reported that, after a Student to Student visit, their classrooms saw reductions in anti-Semitic bullying. Still, no one thought of extending the program beyond St. Louis, Picker Neiss said, until the recent national surge in anti-Semitism. Fueled by anxiety - and two grants totaling $30,000 from a Jewish nonprofit - her organization collaborated with Jewish groups and schools to launch Student to Student in Chicago, Indianapolis, Des Moines and the D.C. area. The ambition, Picker Neiss said, is to spread Student to Student to all 50 states. “An adult comes, and teens’ eyes glaze over,” she said. “But when they can interact with one another, they just perk up right away.” The program falls within a long tradition of “what you might call Jewish-American public relations campaigns,” said Hasia R. Diner, a professor at New York University who studies American Jewish history. The campaigns, often waged by faith leaders or activist groups in response to upswells in anti-Semitism, sent Jewish adults into libraries or churches to explain their religion to non-Jews. One came in the 1920s, amid heightened activity of the Ku Klux Klan, Diner said, another during Adolf Hitler’s ascent to power in the 1930s, still another during the 1950s. In the 1980s, Holocaust survivors began traveling the country to share their experiences in concentration camps - although that effort is ending, as survivors die or grow too old to continue. There is “no real sense” of the efficacy of these initiatives, Diner said. Today’s landscape of anti-Semitic harassment, she noted, may suggest they were in vain. “But I’m glad to know of Student to Student,” she said. “Teaching people how wrong their prejudices are, catching them young, with the young . . . maybe that works.” The stint at James Madison was Book’s third time participating in a Student to Student presentation. He often wonders, afterward, how his words affected fellow high school students. Most seem curious, Book said, eager to learn. One response he will never forget. At a presentation last month, Book began by telling the audience that he is Orthodox and attends a private, all-Jewish school in Rockville, Md. He joined Student to Student, he said, because he believes hatred will subside if Jews and non-Jews get to know each other. Near the hour’s end, a student raised her hand. “She asked me, why do I go to a Jewish school if I’m so interested in teaching about Judaism?” Book said. “Why am I keeping myself in the bubble?” Book did not know what to say. The silence stretched, so he blurted that it’s nice to be around people who “share the same morals” - but that, Book felt, was not quite right. He has thought more, since. He still doesn’t know the answer.

"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Turkish and Russian troops began joint patrols Sunday on a key highway in northwestern Syria, Turkey’s Defense Ministry said, while both the Russian government and Syrian opposition activists said the patrols were shortened because of protests.  Patrols on the highway known as the M4, which runs east-west through Idlib province, are part of a cease-fire agreement between Turkey and Russia signed earlier this month. The cease-fire ended an escalation in fighting that saw the Turkish military in rare direct conflict with Syrian government troops. The vital highway, which runs through northern Syria from the Mediterranean to the Iraqi border, has been partially closed since 2012. Work has been underway over the past days to refurbish it for traffic. Some sections of the M4 remain under rebel control, unlike the  north-south M5 highway, which Syrian forces completely recaptured in the latest offensive. For the past three days, residents along rebel-held parts of the M4 have protested in rejection of Russian troops patrolling the road because of Moscow’s strong support to Syrian government forces.  “The first Turkish-Russian united land patrol was carried out on the M4 highway in Idlib with the involvement of land and air elements,” Turkey’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Turkey and Russia carried out their first joint patrol mission along the M4 highway Sunday adding that “the patrols’ route was shortened” after militants used women and children to block the way. The Defense Ministry’s statement was carried by state-run news agency Tass. Ankara has been given additional time to ensure the safety of troops taking part in joint patrols, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Syrian opposition activists said residents blocked the highway with burning tires near the village of Nairab on the southern edge of Idlib in rejection to patrols by “Russian occupation forces.” The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor with activists on the ground in Syria, said the joint patrols were not successful as they moved a short distance west of the government held town of Saraqeb before being stopped by the protests.  It added that jihadi groups have threatened to attack Russian forces on the highway. Idlib is mostly controlled by al-Qaida-linked militants.  Ankara backs some of the opposition groups in Idlib, the fighters’ final stronghold against the Russian-backed forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Some 60 Turkish soldiers have been killed in Idlib since the start of February as Syrian troops carried out a ground and air offensive into the province that began in early December. The assault killed hundreds of civilians and sent 1 million fleeing towards the Turkish border. Russian officials visited Ankara last week to hammer out the cease-fire. After four days of talks, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkey hoped the deal would prove to be permanent. Turkey and Russia already conduct joint military patrols elsewhere in Syria. Following an agreement that halted Turkey’s attack on Kurdish forces in October, soldiers from the two countries monitor an area of northeast Syria along the Turkish border.

"With many houses of worship shuttered around the country, President Trump proclaimed Sunday a national day of prayer for all Americans affected by the coronavirus pandemic and for the national response efforts. He said Americans must remember that “no problem is too big for God to handle.” Mr. Trump urged people “of all faiths and religious traditions and backgrounds to offer prayers for all those affected, including people who have suffered harm or lost loved ones.” “As we continue to face the unique challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, millions of Americans are unable to gather in their churches, temples, synagogues, mosques, and other houses of worship,” the president said in a proclamation. “But in this time we must not cease asking God for added wisdom, comfort, and strength, and we must especially pray for those who have suffered harm or who have lost loved ones.” He said, “In our times of greatest need, Americans have always turned to prayer to help guide us through trials and periods of uncertainty.  I ask you to join me in a day of prayer for all people who have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and to pray for God’s healing hand to be placed on the people of our nation.” “We should all take to heart the holy words found in 1 Peter 5:7:  ‘Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you,’” the president’s proclamation said. “Let us pray that all those affected by the virus will feel the presence of our Lord’s protection and love during this time.  With God’s help, we will overcome this threat.” Mr. Trump declared a national emergency on Friday, freeing up about $50 billion in federal aid to combat the virus in states and localities. “I now encourage all Americans to pray for those on the front lines of the response, especially our nation’s outstanding medical professionals and public health officials who are working tirelessly to protect all of us from the coronavirus and treat patients who are infected; all of our courageous first responders, National Guard, and dedicated individuals who are working to ensure the health and safety of our communities; and our Federal, State, and local leaders,” the proclamation said. “We are confident that He will provide them with the wisdom they need to make difficult decisions and take decisive actions to protect Americans all across the country.  As we come to our Father in prayer, we remember the words found in Psalm 91:  ‘He is my refuge and my fortress:  my God; in him will I trust.’” The proclamation continued, “As we unite in prayer, we are reminded that there is no burden too heavy for God to lift or for this country to bear with His help. Luke 1:37 promises that ‘For with God nothing shall be impossible,’ and those words are just as true today as they have ever been.” “As one Nation under God, we are greater than the hardships we face, and through prayer and acts of compassion and love, we will rise to this challenge and emerge stronger and more united than ever before,” he said. “May God bless each of you, and may God bless the United States of America.”  ",Trump proclaims national day of prayer for Americans affected by coronavirus,"Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/donald-trump-proclaims-national-day-prayer-america/,washington_times
"Though it was certain to come at some point, Joe Biden picked up a big endorsement Saturday when the country’s largest union — the National Education Association — backed his presidential bid. The NEA and the American Federation of Teachers, the powerful teachers’ unions, are rock solid Democrats and in the general election back that party’s candidate. But prior to the NEA’s announcement they had waffled a bit, telling members that either Mr. Biden or Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders had their support. Since Mr. Biden cruised to an impressive victory in the Michigan primary and others last Tuesday, however, it has become clear his lead in delegates makes him the overwhelming favorite to clinch the Democratic nomination this summer. “Biden is the tireless advocate for public education and is the partner that students and educators need now in the White House,” NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia said in a statement. Thus far in 2020, Mr. Sanders has been the biggest recipient of NEA cash, according to OpenSecrets.com, which puts his total of $18,734 well ahead of Mr. Biden’s $7,595. The NEA endorsement means Mr. Biden can now finish the primary season with the union’s considerable muscle and deep pockets behind his campaign. In the 2016 presidential election year, the NEA showered $11.14 million on politics, and among direct contributions to candidates 84% — $2.88 million — of its giving went to Democrats, according to Open Secrets.

"MADRID — Spain’s government said Saturday that the wife of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has tested positive for the new coronavirus. It said Begoña Gómez and the prime minister are in good health and following the instructions of medical authorities at their residence in La Moncloa Palace in Madrid, the government seat. Two ministers of Sánchez’s Cabinet, the minister of equality and the minister of regional affairs, had already tested positive earlier this week. The government said both are in good health as well. The others member of the Cabinet have tested negative. The government informed the media of Gómez’s infection shortly after Sánchez gave a nationally televised address to announce a battery of measures his government will take to combat the pandemic during a two-week state of emergency. Prior to the address, Sánchez presided at a seven-hour Cabinet meeting that was attended by all the ministers except for the two who had tested positive. Health authorities said Saturday that coronavirus infections have reached 5,753 people in Spain, half of them in Madrid, since the first case was detected in late January.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Saturday he had the power to fire or demote Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, adding new fuel to his long-running animus toward the central bank’s leader at a moment when the economy was at risk of edging into recession. Trump told reporters that he wasn’t considering firing Powell, but reiterated his frustration with the chairman. The comments were particularly striking because they came as the coronavirus pandemic shook the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst week since October 2008. In just a few weeks, U.S. stocks have lost all the gains made during 2019. “I have the right to do that or the right to remove him as chairman,” Trump said Saturday at a news conference called to provide an update on the administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. “He has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.” No Fed chairman has ever been removed by a president. The law creating the Fed says its officials and those of other independent agencies can be “removed for cause” by a president. While that issue has never arisen in regard to a Fed official, the courts ruled decades ago that “for cause” meant more than a policy disagreement. Powell announced earlier this month a half-point interest rate cut that shrank the Fed’s key rate to a range of just 1% to 1.25%. It marked the first time the central bank has cut rates between scheduled policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis. And it’s the steepest rate cut the Fed has made since then. Yet, the president continued to complain that he was “not happy with the Fed” because it was “following” and “we should be leading.” The president pointed to lower interest rates set by the central banks in Japan and Germany as proof that Powell had not been aggressive enough in bolstering the U.S. economy. Economists, however, say the lower rates reflect the weaker economic outlooks than the U.S. economy. Trump said he’s made no decision, but suggested he could simply remove him as chairman. Powell’s four-year term ends in February 2022, and his term as a member of the Board of Governors expires January 2028. “I have the right to also take him and put him in a regular position and put somebody else in charge. And I haven’t made any decisions on that,” the president said.

"NEW YORK — As schools across the U.S. shut down in hopes of helping to fight the coronavirus, New York City officials are arguing just the opposite: They’re keeping the nation’s largest school system open to ensure that health and emergency workers aren’t tied down with kids at home. But teachers, many parents and some health experts say the city is making a grave mistake by continuing to call more than 1.1 million children to public schools even as it calls for “social distancing” elsewhere to stem the virus’ spread. While many families elsewhere in the country spent Saturday making hasty plans for an unexpected school shutdown, New Yorkers debated the city’s decision. “You’re not going to have a functioning health care system if the folks in the medical field, the doctors, the nurses, the techs, everyone has to stay home with their kids,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on MSNBC. Parent Anna Gold didn’t see it his way. “It would be a hardship if they closed the schools, but I think it’s a necessary one we need to take in the space of this emergency,” said Anna Gold, who pulled her third-grader and kindergartner out of public schools in Brooklyn on Friday and plans to keep them home next week. Another parent, Dori Kleinman, said she wishes the mayor would allow individual schools to make a decision about whether to close. “I don’t want my children at risk,” she said. New York City became a big outlier as other major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Boston, and several states decided to shutter schools for a week or more. New York health care workers’ unions said the city shouldn’t close schools without a plan to care for the children of those staffing hospital wards. The unions and city officials fear that even New York’s massive health care system could be quickly overwhelmed by a surge in serious cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “If it’s apparent it’s the safe thing, then it must be done, but it’s going to have a big impact on nurses,” said Eileen Toback, executive director of the New York Professional Nurses Union, which represents nurses at Manhattan’s Lenox Hill Hospital. “They’re on the front lines. They need to be here in shifts. They’re single mothers or single fathers sometimes, so they don’t have many backups, and the hospital is 24/7.” In a column in The New York Times, three teaches from Stuyvesant High pressured de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo to close the schools, and develop a plan to feed students that depend on school meals. The teachers describe a lengthy journey for some to and from school that puts students, their relatives and educators at risk. “No amount of hand washing and extra cleaning can prevent our thousands of students and hundreds of faculty and staff members from transmitting germs as they move in and out of classrooms for 10 periods a day,” Samantha Daves, Maura Dwyer and Annie Thoms wrote. De Blasio, a Democrat, has not ruled out closing schools eventually and said city officials would continue a day-by-day examination. But he has noted that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that while there can be reasons to shut schools, it’s not clear that closures will make more difference than other measures, such as hand-washing and isolating the sick. But Dr. Dena Grayson, a researcher and infectious disease expert who works in the private sector, called de Blasio’s decision so far to keep schools open “incredibly foolish.” “The virus will spread like wildfire among the children. They get infected, and they can spread that virus easily to older people who are at a much higher risk,” she said. The city has confirmed coronavirus cases in at least two public school students and at least one teacher. Their schools have been closed for cleaning but are expected to reopen. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover, but the outbreak has caused more than 5,000 deaths worldwide. Teachers’ unions are pressing de Blasio to close the schools, saying they’re worried for their students’ families, their own and New Yorkers at large. “To have 1.1 million students and countless employees crisscrossing the city, it feels to me beyond irresponsible,” says Derek Stampone, who teaches physics and computer science at a Manhattan high school where only about 2/3 of students showed up Friday, a dropoff echoed in the system as a whole. Stampone found himself spending much of Friday’s classes talking about the virus and such prevention tips as hand-washing. “I can see the anxiety in the room,” he said. So did social studies teacher Elise Ritter, who works at a different Manhattan high school that happens to focus on emergency management. The students who did attend, she said, were “really looking around and saying, ‘Why are we still here?’” Many live with grandparents and worry about them contracting the virus, she said. Teachers suggest the city could find ways to provide child care for health care workers - and supply food to the hundreds of thousands of poor students who depend on school meals - without keeping the entire school system open. De Blasio has said that any alternative would recreate the problem that closing schools would seek to solve: People congregating. Cuomo, a Democrat, said school closings remain “purely a local decision” unless a student tests positive, in which case a school must be closed for cleaning. “The closing of schools is a significant trade-off of benefits and burdens,” he said Saturday in a conference call with reporters. “If you close the schools, there are people who will not show up for work the next day. The public education system is also a day care, in many ways.” __ Associated Press reporters Adam Geller and Vanessa Alvarez contributed to this report.

"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo — States across the U.S. are allocating hundreds of millions of dollars to respond to the coronavirus, even as the U.S. government prepares to send billions more their way. Many states have built up sizable stockpiles in their “rainy day” funds during several robust years of tax collections. Some governors and state lawmakers now are tapping into those savings for emergency expenses. Others are looking to set aside even more in reserve, fearing the economic uncertainties stemming from the coronavirus could send tax revenues into a tailspin. “Forget the closure on Broadway - the loss of revenue to the state government, right now, is incalculable,” said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. He pulled the curtain on Broadway theaters this past week while banning gatherings of 500 or more people. President Donald Trump said Friday that he would free up as much as $50 billion for state and local governments as he declared the virus pandemic a national emergency. Many governors also have declared emergencies, giving themselves greater flexibility to spend money and waive regulations as needed. “All the resources we can have on hand - to make sure if things get worse - we want,” said Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, while announcing a state of emergency just hours after the president did so. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. State and local public health agencies have been on the front lines of the response, monitoring and testing those suspected of having the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease. Costs are mounting for staff time and medical supplies. But states also are bracing for a potential ripple effect on their revenues. The cancellation of major sporting and entertainment events could mean less tax revenue from tourists and local residents. Directives to work and study at home instead of at offices, schools and colleges could mean less revenue from fuel taxes and public transit fares. And if some employees can’t go to work, that could put a damper on state income and withholding taxes while driving up spending for public welfare programs such as unemployment insurance and state Medicaid health care programs. “It definitely has the potential to have a significant impact on state budgets - both on the spending and revenue side,” said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers. “One positive, if you want to use that word, is that this is coming after a period where states have seen strong revenue growth for the past couple of years … and have been able to increase the size of their rainy day funds and reserves,” Sigritz added. Across all states last fiscal year, the median rainy day fund balance equaled 7.6% of general fund expenditures. That’s a record high that was way up from a 1.6% share of general fund expenditures in the 2010 fiscal year, according to the budget officers group. In Washington state, which has seen the greatest number of U.S. coronavirus deaths, lawmakers this past week approved a budget that draws $200 million from the state’s rainy day fund. Of that, $175 million is to go to the public health system with the rest going to a special unemployment fund for affected businesses and workers. “The urgency of this is clear, the demand for action is clear, and we’ll stretch this as far as we can and we’ll find some way to finance more if we have to,” said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat. While tapping the emergency fund, Washington state lawmakers also pared back some proposed spending, allowing the state’s reserves to continue to grow in case the coronavirus causes more budgetary hardships. Georgia lawmakers this past week approved shifting $100 million from the state’s $2.8 billion of reserves into a governor’s emergency fund for the coronavirus. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, signed legislation allowing the state to tap up to $50 million from its rainy day fund. The spread of the coronavirus has coincided with crunch time in some state legislatures. Florida lawmakers, for example, extended their 60-day session that was scheduled to end Friday while working on a budget plan that has been complicated by the coronavirus outbreak. Concern about the economy has prompted budget writers to consider adding hundreds of millions of additional dollars to the state’s reserves to help offset any potential shortfalls. Some states where legislatures already had wrapped up budgets are now scrambling to account for the coronavirus costs. New Mexico lawmakers adjourned Feb. 20. This past week, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed about $150 million in infrastructure spending as coronavirus concerns caused world oil prices to plunge. The oil sector is a mainstay of the New Mexico economy. The cuts included nearly $50 million for local transportation projects plus funding for a rural water system, a preschool and senior center at Native American communities, and improvements at district courts. ___ Associated Press writers Jeff Amy in Atlanta; Bobby Caina Calvan in Tallahassee, Florida; Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington; Morgan Lee in Sante Fe, New Mexico; and Marina Villeneuve in Albany, New York, contributed to this report.

"TRENTON, N.J. — Officials are considering a statewide curfew to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Sunday morning. Hoboken already implemented one - from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. - starting Monday. Murphy was asked about curfews and also self-quarantine after Teaneck Mayor Mohammed Hameeduddin called for a citywide self-quarantine for the Bergen County town hit hard by COVID-19. “We’re not there at a statewide level on either of those steps, but we could be,” Murphy said on WBLS-FM 107.5. “The curfew is probably, of the two, is probably the more immediate one under consideration.” Murphy on Saturday night announced the second death in the state from coronavirus, a woman in her 50s who was being cared for at CentraState Medical Center in Monmouth County. Earlier, he had announced 19 new positive cases, bringing the statewide total to 69. More than a third of the COVID-19 cases - 25 - are in Bergen County, with 10 in Middlesex County, according to the state Department of Health website. The New Jersey Department of Corrections said its suspending visits for the next 30 days as of Saturday evening. Murphy said earlier that the state is preparing for closing schools statewide, though he stopped short of taking that step. He said it’s a matter of when, not if, they close. Education officials said some 354 districts, or roughly half, in the state have closed already. ___ HOBOKEN CURFEW Hours after announcing that gyms, health clubs, day cares and movie theaters would join the list of closures in Hoboken, Mayor Ravi S. Bhalla announced the forthcoming curfew and additional restrictions. The citywide curfew that begins Monday will be in effect from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. and requires all residents to remain in their homes, barring emergencies. People who are required to report to work are exempted. To further limit gatherings, the city’s Office of Emergency Management will not permit restaurants and bars to serve food within their premises. Bars that don’t serve food will be shut down, effective Sunday at 11 a.m. Any establishment that serves food will be allowed to conduct takeout and delivery service. Bhalla said that, as he was writing the statement, he received a call from the city’s police chief notifying him of a bar fight in downtown Hoboken. One person fell in and out of consciousness and police waited more than 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive because of the number of service calls emergency services have received. He said the incident illustrated how bar operations “can trigger calls for service that are delayed in part because of this public health crisis.” ___ COURTS SUSPENSION The chief justice of New Jersey’s court system announced a two-week suspension of municipal court sessions to mitigate public exposure to the coronavirus. Chief Justice Stuart Rabner said Saturday that individuals scheduled to appear through March 27 before a municipal court to contest a traffic or parking ticket or for a minor local ordinance violation should await notice of a new court date. Municipal courts will continue to handle some things such as applications for temporary restraining orders, hearings in which a defendant has been detained and matters that implicate public safety. Filings and payments will continue to be accepted except where a municipality has closed the municipal court building. Rabner earlier announced an indefinite suspension in all new jury trials, criminal and civil, in New Jersey due to the coronavirus outbreak. The order Thursday said jury trials already underway will continue and grand jury proceedings will continue pending further communication with county prosecutors and the state attorney general. ___ DRIVER’S LICENSES AND REGISTRATIONS State officials announced a two-month extension of expiration dates for driver’s licenses as well as vehicle registrations and inspection stickers. Murphy and Sue Fulton, chief administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, said the extensions apply to driver licenses expiring in March, April, and May; to registrations expiring in March, April, and May; and for inspection stickers expiring in March, April, and May. ___ CASES For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. ___ • The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Sunday that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are already in talks for a third coronavirus bill. On ABC’s “This Week,” Mr. Mnuchin explained that this latest package will be a stimulus bill targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as specific industries that have been hit hard by the virus, including the airline and cruise industries. “We will use whatever tools we have and whatever tools we don’t have we will go to Congress on a bipartisan basis and get more tools,” he said. “We’re in the second inning of nine innings.” Just after midnight on Saturday, the House passed a massive relief package to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers. It mandated free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone that does. The bill also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and school kids. It also bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. “This bill was very important in getting workers money in their pockets, people that have to be home,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The bill passed without lawmakers knowing exactly how much it will cost. This came after Congress passed an $8.3 billion bill to get more resources to state and local health officials. Mr. Mnuchin said he would also ask Congress to help the Federal Reserve have more resources to help the economy weather the virus. However, he would not comment on President Trump’s frustration with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. On Saturday, the president told reporters he had the power to fire or demote Mr. Powell, reiterating his frustrations at what he sees as a slow response. The Fed recently cut rates, now at historic lows, and offered $1.5 trillion in loans to banks. “I’m not going to make comments on that. It would be inappropriate for me as Treasury secretary,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The markets plummeted last week, but recovered somewhat on Saturday, which Mr. Mnuchin credits to the president’s national address Friday and the bipartisan bill.

"A former staffer in House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff’s office has tested positive for coronavirus. “We consulted with the House Attending physician and will be acting on their recommendations. Medical professionals believe that my former staff member likely contracted the virus after leaving the office, but we will still be taking additional precautions over the next few days,” the California Democrat said in a statement. The staffer left Mr. Schiff’s office 10 days ago. Mr. Schiff had already suspended public events in his district this coming week-long recess and ordered his staff to work from home before they found out about the sick staffer. Several outlets are reporting that the staffer is Daniel Goldman, who helped Mr. Schiff throughout the impeachment investigation as his top legal aide. Mr. Goldman spent the last week detailing on Twitter the difficultly he had trying to get a test for the coronavirus. Let’s be very clear: unless you have pneumonia and traveled to one of 5 high-risk countries recently, you can NOT get a #COVID19 test in New York City. If you, like me, have a fever and a headache (but tested negative for the flu), you are unable to rule out #COVID19. Shameful. Last week, a senate staffer working for Sen. Maria Cantwell also tested positive, prompting her D.C. office to close as they worked to sanitize the workspace. Across Capitol Hill, several lawmakers have already gone into self-quarantine after coming into contact with individuals who contracted the disease.

"Republican Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said Sunday that schools in his state could remain closed for the rest of the year. “You know, this may not peak until the latter part of April or May. So we’ve informed the superintendents, while we’ve closed schools for three weeks, that the odds are this is going to go on a lot longer and it would not surprise me at all if schools did not open again this year,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Ohio is one of several states across the country that have moved to shut down public schools in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Many universities as well have closed campuses and moved to online classes. Earlier this week, Mr. DeWine said, based on models and what he’s heard from experts, there are likely 100,000 undiagnosed cases of coronavirus in the state, and cases were likely to double every six days. The point of that was to illustrate to people that we have a lot of people walking around Ohio who are positive who haven’t been tested.

WHO is coordinating global response and has sent teams inside China to learn how the virulent bug sprouted and infected over 80,000 Chinese, by far the world’s most by country. Zhao Lijan, spokesperson and deputy director general of the Foreign Ministry information department, shifted virus blame to America on Twitter. “What are the names of the hospitals?

The that the deadly SARS, also a coronavirus,  was traced to bats fancied by the region’s diners. China’s Western critics have blamed the virus’s fast spread on the communism regime’s secrecy.

"A top member of the White House task force on combating the spread of coronavirus says the administration has “not seriously discussed” restricting travel within the United States. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, said on ABC’s “This Week” that the idea of domestic travel restrictions have come up during administration deliberations but such action is unlikely “right now or in the immediate future.” Fauci’s comments come a day after President Donald Trump told reporters that he was considering imposing restrictions on travel within the U.S. to areas hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The president said Saturday he was also adding the United Kingdom and Ireland to a list of countries that would face sweeping travel restrictions over the next 30 days. Last week, Trump announced a temporary suspension of travel into the U.S. for foreigners who had recently spent time in the 26-nation Schengen area, the European Union’s border-free travel zone.

"The Senate will convene Monday amid coronavirus panic with an eye toward “swiftly” voting on the massive relief package that cleared the House early Saturday morning, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday night. The Kentucky Republican, in a statement, implicitly rejected calls to send the Senate home and pass the coronavirus bill through an abbreviated process. He said they still have work to finish not only on the virus, but also on a bill to extend the government’s secret surveillance capabilities. House lawmakers, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, approved legislation that would boost food assistance for those struggling during the virus crisis, would give an infusion of cash to the unemployment program and to state Medicaid funds so they can treat those who contract COVID-19, and would give companies means to pay workers forced to take off because of the virus. Mr. McConnell called those first steps, and said he and his troops are already working on other legislation to bolster the economy amid a coronavirus downturn. “This new disease is challenging our great nation in unfamiliar ways. But we have overcome far greater challenges before,” he said. “Those of us in elected office — at all levels — must continue to put partisanship aside and focus on our common work to serve the common good.” The House went home for a week vacation after passing its bill Saturday. The Senate’s second-ranking Democrat on Sunday said he and his colleagues should also stay home, and said the House bill could pass by “unanimous consent” — which would take agreement of all senators. Sen. Richard Durbin, Illinois Democrat, said making lawmakers travel back to Washington puts them at risk. “Set an example for America, Senator McConnell.  Think about our staff, their families, and our constituents, as well as your Senate colleagues,” he said. The Senate had planned a vacation to match the House, but Mr. McConnell last week canceled it after calls from Republicans to stay in session to try to help the government manage the coronavirus crisis. Mr. McConnell pointed out that they still have the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act renewal bill to deal with. That bill is currently the pending business on the floor, and it must be surmounted before the chamber can turn to the House coronavirus legislation.

The power struggle created an awkward moment in which Mr. Nadler canceled the markup of his own bill just minutes before it was scheduled. FISA allows U.S. intelligence agencies to meet with judges behind closed doors and explain why spying is needed without anyone to question their evidence. The process has come under scrutiny since revelations last year confirmed that the FBI abused FISA to surveil Trump campaign figure Carter Page as part of its probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Liberal civil libertarians and conservative defenders of President Trump united in an attempt to curb the government’s powers with FISA reforms. Instead, Mr. Schiff, at the urging of the intelligence community, pushed for smaller tweaks to the law. As a result, the House passed a bill that few lawmakers liked, that advocacy groups on the left and the right condemned, and that Mr. Trump hinted he would veto. Three critical FISA provisions lapsed when the Senate failed to take action Friday on the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and Trump ally, urged swift passage of the House bill, but a Republican faction also pressing for a Trump veto blocked a quick vote. Senate Republican leaders aim to pass the House bill this time and hope the president won’t veto it. Sean Vitka, policy counsel for the left-leaning Demand Progress, slammed the House’s reform measures as “an insult to Americans.” “This bill fails to address the innumerable famously well-documented problems with recent and ongoing FISA surveillance,” he said. The Senate is poised to take up the House bill Monday, one day after three critical FISA provisions lapsed. The Senate’s fiercest civil liberties defenders are urging their colleagues to reject the legislation. Those who followed the FISA fight say Mr. Schiff’s interference may have cost a chance at meaningful reform. “Schiff was fairly careful to keep his hands clean publicly from meddling in that process, but what everyone behind the scenes was saying is that he in some ways had ownership of the final results of this process,” said Josh Withrow, senior policy analyst for FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. “He made it clear that nothing would be allowed to pass that the [intelligence committee] hadn’t signed off on first.” Rep. Zoe Lofgren, California Democrat, pointed a finger at Mr. Schiff after a markup hearing was canceled because leadership opposed amendments she planned to attach to the FISA bill. She told Politico that whenever there was a chance to overhaul FISA, regardless of which party proposed the change, the intelligence committee chairman scuttled it. Spokesmen for Mr. Schiff did not acknowledge requests for comment from The Washington Times. Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, rejected the idea that Mr. Schiff’s involvement in a bill outside of his committee had sunk the chance for FISA reform. He said staff from multiple committees, along with the Justice Department, had a hand in crafting the bill. “There were all types of elements at play,” he told The Times. “You are negotiating with everyone. That’s why it took forever over the last several days.” Though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed that Mr. Schiff’s refusal to concede the administration a talking point on the Page warrant was a factor in his go-small approach to reforms, they said the main issue was pressure from the intelligence community to keep the status quo. The National Security Agency, the CIA, the FBI and other agencies said their powers were necessary to keep the U.S. safe. Even Attorney General William P. Barr, a fierce critic of the Page warrant and an ally of Mr. Trump, surprisingly went against the president by lobbying Republicans for a clean renewal of the FISA provisions. He praised the House bill after it passed. “The establishment intelligence community was generally on the same page the whole time,” said former Rep. Dan Glickman, Kansas Democrat and a former intelligence committee chairman. “It doesn’t surprise me that Schiff would be inclined to support the intelligence community’s agenda.” Mr. Glickman said that after years of criticism by Mr. Trump and Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and the panel’s previous chairman, it is not surprising that the intelligence community and Mr. Schiff would look out for each other. “They’ve been browbeaten by the president for a long time now with him saying he knows more than they do and disregarding their raw intelligence,” he said. “I think in many respects the Democrats treated them more fairly than the president. Schiff has a better relationship with the intelligence community, certainly more than Nunes.” Mr. Vitka said the ability of the intelligence committee to control other members of Congress is “very unique and dangerous to the privacy of all people in the United States.” Civil liberties hawks, who viewed Mr. Nadler as one of their staunchest allies in Congress, said they were surprised he was rolled by Mr. Schiff. Mr. Nadler relentlessly opposed the Patriot Act and championed additional FISA reforms during a similar fight in 2015, but he sputtered to defend his committee’s bill last week. “It greatly increases civil liberties protections. Not as much as I would want … but it’s what we could get,” he said tepidly when urging his colleagues to support the legislation. “Chairman Nadler as an individual has consistently supported good civil liberties amendments, and he has already said he doesn’t think this bill goes far enough,” Mr. Vitka said. “The issue here was how much he was pressured to give up control to the intelligence committee, which has always been the primary obstacle in passing surveillance reform in the House.” Mr. Schiff wouldn’t have been able to bring Mr. Nadler to heel without the backing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, according to Capitol Hill insiders. The speaker last year repeatedly rebuffed Mr. Nadler’s push to begin the impeachment process. When she ultimately relented, she appointed Mr. Schiff to lead the proceedings. “Schiff has the ear of the speaker,” said Mr. Withrow, the FreedomWorks analyst. “Nadler is a weak chairman. I’m not saying it to knock the guy, but If you watch his hearings, he doesn’t have command of the committee a chairman should have. Schiff played that to his advantage.” The Senate on Monday will try to figure out what to do with the FISA bill. It does have some support among Republican leadership, including Mr. McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, but it has detractors in both parties, too. Sen. Mike Lee, Utah Republican, demanded a 45-day extension Thursday so senators could hammer out a better deal. Richard Burr, North Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, denied the plea. Mr. Vitka said he expects an intense battle in the Senate this week. “There are maybe 20 to 25 Republican senators who are willing to go along with whatever Burr and McConnell tell them to do,” he said. “Thankfully, people like Sen. Lee make it clear there are members, on both sides of the aisle, who will fight hard against this fake reform bill.”  ",Schiff protects intel ‘status quo’ power by sinking wide-reaching FISA reform: Source,"Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/adam-schiff-fisa-reform-intervention-protects-fbi-/,washington_times

"The Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step Sunday of cutting interest rates to zero and launching a massive emergency $700 billion quantitative easing program to protect the economy from the impact of the coronavirus, while Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi began work on a third relief bill to help U.S. businesses and workers. As restaurants, taverns, schools and some major companies closed across the country, the Fed announced it was lowering its prime lending rate to 0% to 0.25%, the second major cut in two weeks. Combined with the new easing program, it was the largest one-day action the central bank has ever taken. “The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,” the central bank said in a statement. “The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.” President Trump said the move was “really good news.” “It’s really great for our country,” the president told reporters at the White House. “I think people in the [stock] market should be very thrilled.” Still, stock futures fell Sunday after the Fed’s action, indicating more losses loom on Monday. Major stock indexes have plummeted more than 20% in the past two weeks from their highs in mid-February, largely on concerns about the economic impact of the virus. Stocks bounced back nearly 10% on Friday, bolstered by Mr. Trump’s announcement of a national emergency and steps to speed testing and aid to states. The dramatic action by the Fed emphasized the threat to the U.S. economy from the coronavirus outbreak. The central bank had just reduced the prime lending rate by 0.5% two weeks ago, and last week it injected $1.5 trillion into the bond market. The rate is a benchmark for short-term lending for financial institutions and is a guide to many consumer rates from car loans to mortgages. Reserve requirements at banks also were eased, and the Fed said it is coordinating with foreign banks to enhance dollar liquidity in Japan, Britain, Europe, Canada and Switzerland. Mr. Trump had been imploring the Fed to cut rates further to keep the U.S. economy competitive with other nations whose central banks have been cutting their rates deeper. In the coming months, the Fed said it will purchase at least $700 billion more in bonds as part of its new quantitative easing to ensure enough money in the economy. The majority of it, about $500 billion, will be U.S. Treasury bonds. The rest will be mortgage-backed securities. “The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,” the Fed said in a statement. Mr. Mnuchin and Mrs. Pelosi are already talking about a third coronavirus bill, even as their second bipartisan legislative response to the outbreak awaits action in the Senate. The next package will be a stimulus bill targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as specific industries that have been hit hard by the virus, the secretary explained. “We will use whatever tools we have and whatever tools we don’t have we will go to Congress on a bipartisan basis and get more tools,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “We’re in the second inning of nine innings.” Its predecessor, however, still needs to get to the president’s desk. After a feverish 48 hours of negotiations, the House passed a massive relief package to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers just after midnight on Saturday. It mandated free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment-insurance programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone who does if they’re at a company with less than 500 employees. The bill also shores up food programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and schoolchildren, and bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. “This bill was very important in getting workers money in their pockets, people that have to be home,” Mr. Mnuchin said on ABC’s “This Week.” To help small businesses, the Treasury Department announced that those companies will be able to get deposits they gave the IRS and get a cash advance from the agency. This came just about a week after Congress passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion bill to get more resources to state and local health officials. And on Friday, President Trump declared a national emergency, freeing up about $50 billion in aid for states and localities to combat the virus. “I think there’s a lot of bipartisan support. We hope they pass this bill. If not, we’ll work with the center on whatever minor changes we need,” Mr. Mnuchin said on Fox News. The Senate, which left for the weekend on Thursday as plans for quick passage in the House fell apart, will be in on Monday, which will be the soonest the chamber could vote on the bill depending on what, if any, changes are made. At least one senator, though, is suggesting that the Senate doesn’t come back in at all this week. On Sunday, Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, called for the chamber to stay on recess and pass the bill on a unanimous consent vote — which can be derailed by just one objection — and allow those who object have it noted in the official record. He argued that doing otherwise would put senators and their staffers at risk of catching the virus unnecessarily. “We have been warned to limit unnecessary travel and gathering in large groups. Senators and staff are working to serve their states locally as best they can, and with unanimous consent for these measures there is no valid reason to force extra travel this week,” he said in a statement. However, the fact that lawmakers passed this latest legislative fix without a price tag, made it nearly impossible to push through the Senate on a unanimous basis. The chamber also needs to pass a bill to reauthorize and reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, parts of which expired Sunday. Both Mr. Mnuchin and Mrs. Pelosi said they will start working on the next package this week. The secretary wants the bill to specifically help sectors like the airline, tourism and cruise industries. Mr. Mnuchin defended the strategy, saying it wasn’t like the auto and banking bailouts that were spurred by the recession in the early 2000’s. “If you’re providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you’re taking collateral and you have security, that’s not a bailout,” he said on Fox News. “To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted — again, our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted.” The total cost of the bailouts from the financial crisis of 2008-09 was $498 billion, according to an analysis last year by Deborah J. Lucas, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Golub Center for Finance and Policy. Mr. Trump has repeated floated a payroll tax as another means to help alleviate some of the economic fallout of the virus, but it’s failed to capture any enthusiasm from anyone on Capitol Hill, least of all Democratic leadership. The Fed had been scheduled to hold a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 17-18. In Sunday’s action, the central bank also slashed the rate of emergency lending at the discount window for banks by 125 basis points, to 0.25%, and lengthened loan terms to 90 days. The Fed said the purchases under its new quantitive easing would begin Monday with a $40 billion installment. The Fed’s action cuts rates to a new range of 0% to 0.25%, from 1% to 1.25%. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester was the only “no” vote, preferring to set rates at 0.5% to 0.75%.

"WASHINGTON — The White House is putting in place new measures starting Monday to protect President Donald Trump and his staff during the coronavirus outbreak, including taking the temperature of anyone who enters the complex, from visitors to members of the press corps. This would expand on screenings the White House began on Saturday for anyone who gets close to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration response to the virus. “In order to keep the entire White House complex safe and healthy, beginning Monday morning, temperature checks will be conducted on everyone who enters campus,” spokesman Judd Deere said. “As was announced over the weekend, additional temperature checks will be conducted on individuals who are in close contact with the president and vice president throughout the day.” Press corps members are also taking steps, independent of the White House, to limit their exposure. The White House on Saturday began taking the temperature of reporters attending a coronavirus briefing led by Trump and Pence. One reporter with a temperature of 100.4 degrees was denied entry to the briefing room. Temperature checks were conducted before Sunday’s briefing, too. Trump has had contact with individuals who later tested positive for coronavirus, including the press aide for Brazil’s president, but the president initially refused to be tested. On Saturday Trump said he had taken the test in response to questions at a Friday news conference. The White House doctor reported late Saturday that the test came back negative. Trump, 73, would be considered at risk because of his age. Other precautionary steps the White House is taking: pausing its internship and volunteer programs, canceling public tours and canceling large events through the end of March. The White House also has closed its Navy Mess Dining Room, where many staffers get daily meals. The White House also has encouraged staffers to follow guidelines for telework issued by the Office of Management and Budget. The White House Correspondents’ Association also has taken steps to limit the number of journalists who are in the briefing room on a daily basis, starting with television crews. Television networks have agreed to “pool” camera coverage of the briefing room, the WHCA board said in a statement Sunday. That means just one crew will cover briefings and share footage with all the other networks, instead of having multiple crews covering the same event. That system was in place for Sunday’s coronavirus briefing. “This is an important first step for us, but we all agree more action is needed to protect our members and the integrity of the press pool covering the president,” the board said. Members are also being asked to leave every other seat in the briefing room empty to practice the “social distancing” that public health officials are impressing upon all Americans. They are also being asked to not stand in the aisles during briefings and to monitor such events remotely, if possible.

"The Supreme Court’s 2018 Janus decision was a landmark in labor law, but now the namesake in the case would like the justices to go further. The high court ruled in Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees that public-sector employees cannot be forced to pay union dues because it violates their First Amendment rights. Mark Janus, a former Illinois state employee, asked the justices last week to consider his petition to claw back the dues he paid unwillingly for years before he won his case. “The Supreme Court agreed that the union taking money from nonmembers was wrong, but the union still has the money it illegally garnished from my paycheck,” he said in a statement. “It’s time for AFSCME to give me back the money they wrongfully took.” Mr. Janus has lost his reimbursement argument at the district court level and before the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel ruled against him last year. He also lost before that appeals court in the original Janus case, only to have the high court overturn its decision. Now, he’s hoping that track repeats itself, said Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which represents Mr. Janus. “It was a huge victory in 2018 and what we’re now asking the Supreme Court is to help Mark get his money back,” Mr. Mix said. “If there was a violation of his First Amendment rights, and Janus ruled there was, then he ought to get relief and that is what this is about.” AFSCME, again the defendant in Mr. Janus’ case, did not respond to a request for comment, but Mr. Mix said the union has successfully employed “a good faith” defense, arguing it was legal at the time it took a portion of Mr. Janus’ paycheck for dues. “It’s true that we haven’t had a whole lot of success thus far,” Mr. Mix said. “But Supreme Court rulings are considered ‘black letter law,’ in that it is considered statutes should have always been that way.” Although labor experts expected the Janus decision to damage the finances of public-sector labor unions, the unions insist they have thrived in its aftermath, managing to hold on to most of their members and in some cases expand their rolls or raise dues. The Janus decision does not apply to private-sector unions, although the Supreme Court has ruled that members can receive a refund on the portion of compulsory dues that unions spend on political activity. Given that public-sector employees are paid by taxpayers and negotiate with public officials, all of their activity is inherently political, the majority of the Supreme Court ruled in Janus. A clawback of Mr. Janus’ past dues would be a game-changer, Mr. Mix said. The money at stake for Mr. Janus is small — about $3,000, which his lawyers say represents the amount “AFSCME seized from his paycheck without his permission from March 23, 2013, to June 27, 2018, representing the two-year statute of limitations from the date his case started in March 2015 through the Supreme Court’s 2018 decision in his favor.” The principle, however, is enormous as the Janus decision affected an estimated 5 million public employees. “Another favorable ruling in the case could have a massive impact, setting a federal precedent that would be controlling in dozens of other cases seeking refunds of dues taken unlawfully by public-sector union bosses,” said the National Right to Work Foundation. Mr. Mix said he is involved in or is aware of two class-action suits centered on union dues — one in California and the other in Ohio — that could affect more than 80,000 workers. About 30 post-Janus cases are in various stages of federal litigation, he said.

"Country music icon Charlie Daniels is plenty riled after leaning that China is the source for many antibiotics, generic medications and prescription drugs vital to Americans — a situation now in sharp focus following the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent national emergency. “The United States of America depending on any other nation for anything as critical as medicine is downright dumb and an ever-present threat to national security,” Mr. Daniels writes in an op-ed published by CNSNews.com. “There is a lesson to be learned here. Over the years, high tax rates caused American businesses to outsource so much manufacturing to China, our economies have become so entwined, and we’ve made so much money off the cheap Chinese labor that we have basically turned a blind eye to what our enabling of an oppressive communist government has accomplished for China,” Mr. Daniels said. “The Chinese military grows in strength and threat every day, using the enormous profits from Sino-American trade deals to maintain the largest standing army in the world. It’s time for America to adopt an ‘If we use it here, we should produce it here’ attitude,” he continued. “For the first time in modern times, thanks to the common sense and foresight of President Donald Trump, America is energy-independent and our economy no longer has to depend on the largesse of Saudi Arabia or any other nation who hates our guts. Now it’s time for America to bring it all back home. If we use it here, it should be made here,” Mr. Daniels concludes. MEDIA REMAINS IN ATTACK MODE News organizations hostile to President Trump remain in attack mode despite the coronavirus national emergency, and at a time when many Americans could use helpful news, straight talk and unbiased perspectives. Just a few very recent headlines: “The Trump presidency is over” (The Atlantic); “Tracking Trump’s false or misleading coronavirus claims” (The Washington Post); “Fact Check: Trump’s claims about his response to the coronavirus” (The New York Times); and “Donald Trump’s Sunday: An online church service, Twitter attacks” (USA Today). DOCTORS: THE TRUST FACTOR Only about one-third of Americans trust “elected officials.” But doctors? A new Pew Research Center analysis finds that 74% of the public give physicians a big thumbs up. Every group agrees with this, for once. “There were no significant partisan differences in views of doctors: Around three-quarters of both Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (73%) as well as Republicans and GOP leaners (77%) expressed a mostly positive opinion of medical doctors. This differs notably from the public’s evaluations of other societal institutions, especially the news media, where attitudes are deeply polarized along partisan lines,” the analysis said. The partisan gaps can be huge: 76% of Democrats give the press a positive review, compared to 30% of Republicans. FOR THE LEXICON “The Thin White Line.” Timely new phrase coined by Breitbart columnist James O. Pinkerton, referring to EMTs, paramedics and nurses. “So now maybe we should know a little bit more about the emergency and health professionals who will be charged with our care should we be stricken with corona-related medical misfortune,” Mr. Pinkerton writes. “We might call them the ‘Thin White Line,’ referring to their white coats, as a variation on the ‘Thin Red Line’ of British military history, and the ‘Thin Blue Line’ of American policing. These workers typically don’t get paid all that much; they are givers, not takers. That is, they give health and order, and take just a tiny fraction of what Wall Street Masters of the Universe pay themselves,” the columnist says. GREENLAND OFFICIALS: ‘STAY AWAY’ At 836,330 square miles, it’s the largest island on the planet, 81% of it is covered by ice and it is currently a territory of Denmark. That would be Greenland, home to 55,992 people and now one of the few places on Earth which has not been invaded by coronavirus. Yet. Officials on Greenland want to keep it that way. “We would like to tell our guests to stay home if you are considering traveling to Greenland right now,” Bjorn Tegner Bay, chief of Greenland’s police force, said in a Friday press conference. In recent years, cruise ships have frequented Greenland’s shores, guests eager to experience “a primordial place ruled by ancient ice,” this according to Quark Expeditions, which offers a Greenland itinerary. Air traffic also is a regular occurrence. “A plane from Denmark arrives every day, and there are often planes from Iceland. In recent days, we’ve seen planes land with passengers who were under suspicion of being infected,” said an urgent public announcement from the nation’s four opposition political parties: Inuit Ataqatigit, Partii Naleraq, Samarbejdspartiet and Atassut. Officials fear the health-care system will be “overwhelmed,” says a report from Arctic Today, which notes that Queen Ingrid’s Hospital in the capital of Nuuk has 130 beds — and room for only four patients in its intensive care unit. “We have had no guarantee from the Danish health authorities, but our expectation is that people in Greenland and the Faroe Islands would have as much right to care as people in Denmark, in the event we see people seriously affected by the coronavirus,” Henrik L. Hansen, Greenland’s chief medical officer, told Arctic Today. As of Sunday, meanwhile, Denmark had 827 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and Iceland, Greenland’s nearest neighbor, 161.

"President Trump said Sunday he is “strongly” considering a complete pardon for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI two years ago. “So now it is reported that, after destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has ‘lost’ the records of General Michael Flynn,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!” Typically, the president sidesteps the issue when he’s asked about a possible pardon for Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with the then-Russian ambassador to the U.S. after the 2016 election. But he asked a federal court in January to withdraw his guilty plea, citing prosecutorial misconduct. One form of misconduct that Flynn attorney Sidney Powell has publicly alleged is that the original notes from the FBI’s first interview with Flynn have gone missing. Attorney General William P. Barr has appointed an outside prosecutor, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri Jeffrey Jensen, to review the case.  Flynn was scheduled to be sentenced last month but the hearing was postponed indefinitely.

"A former staffer in House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff’s office has tested positive for coronavirus. “We consulted with the House Attending physician and will be acting on their recommendations. Medical professionals believe that my former staff member likely contracted the virus after leaving the office, but we will still be taking additional precautions over the next few days,” the California Democrat said in a statement. The staffer left Mr. Schiff’s office 10 days ago. Mr. Schiff had already suspended public events in his district this coming week-long recess and ordered his staff to work from home before they found out about the sick staffer. The staffer appears to be Daniel Goldman, who helped Mr. Schiff throughout the impeachment investigation as his top legal aide. His last day as a member of Mr. Schiff’s staff was March 6. He confirmed on Twitter that he had tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday. Mr. Goldman spent the last week detailing on Twitter the difficultly he had trying to get a test for the coronavirus. Let’s be very clear: unless you have pneumonia and traveled to one of 5 high-risk countries recently, you can NOT get a #COVID19 test in New York City. If you, like me, have a fever and a headache (but tested negative for the flu), you are unable to rule out #COVID19. Shameful. Last week, a senate staffer working for Sen. Maria Cantwell also tested positive, prompting her D.C. office to close as they worked to sanitize the workspace.

"Rep. Ayanna Pressley is calling for the compassionate release of some federal prisoners who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic. During an appearance Saturday on MSNBC, the Massachusetts Democrat and “Squad” member told host Al Sharpton that prisons “are an ecosystem in  a petri dish for the spreading of this pandemic.” “I’m just advocating to make sure that when we are talking about  those that are most vulnerable — our low-income residents and citizens,  those experiencing homelessness, our seniors — that we are also including  the incarcerated men and women who are certainly amongst one of the  most vulnerable populations,” Ms. Pressley said. “And given the crowding and overpopulating  in our prisons for a confluence of other reasons … are an ecosystem in  a petri dish for the spreading of this pandemic, which is why I  partnered with my colleagues, Reps. [Nydia] Velasquez, [Alexandria]  Ocasio-Cortez, and [Rashida] Tlaib, to lobby the Bureau of Prisons to  use their full power and to communicate guidance for how we will contain  and mitigate this epidemic behind the wall,” she continued. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) on Friday released its immediate plans to address the COVID-19 outbreak, including suspending all social visits for 30 days and curtailing legal visits, as well as giving prisoners extra phone time and suspending inmate transfers between prisons. Ms. Pressley said the BOP’s announcement was “woefully inadequate” and that the agency should use its authority to exact clemency, commutations and compassionate release. “I think now would be the time to commute some sentences, to exact  clemency and to take care of our most vulnerable,” she said. “Ten percent of those that are  incarcerated are over the age of 60 and already have an underlying  condition. We should be using compassionate release.”  ",Rep.

"The owner of seven Capitol Hill restaurants is defying Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s order to limit seating and close bars due to the coronavirus, saying “we will not bow down to pressure from the mayor’s office or any group for that matter who covertly is attempting to shut us down.” The Hill Restaurant Group, which operates the Hawk ‘N Dove tavern, Finn’s, Lola’s and several others, said it fully understands the gravity of the coronavirus outbreak. But it added in a statement, “We fully support our employees and our patrons. It is not our burden to bear nor is it our staff’s burden to bear.” “All HRG restaurants will continue to operate as normal and we encourage our fellow industry folks to do the same,” the owners said. The mayor tweeted at the restaurant group, “While I recognize that all of us have been stressed beyond our immediate understanding of how coronavirus has so quickly upended our daily lives and personal and business existence — you must comply with the DC Health notice.” The mayor on Sunday ordered licensed nightclubs to shut down operations, and all eating and drinking establishments to eliminate bar seating. There are also restrictions on the number of patrons who can sit at tables at restaurants. The restaurant group’s announcement drew a strong reaction on social media, with some people saying they would no longer patronize those restaurants. David Zipper, a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, tweeted, “I invite fellow Washingtonians to join me in never again visiting any restaurant owned by Hill Restaurant Group.”  ",Capitol Hill restaurant group defies mayor's order to close bars,"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/capitol-hill-restaurant-group-defies-mayors-order-/,washington_times
"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden holds a 20-point lead over Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont in Arizona, according to a poll released on Monday ahead of Tuesday’s presidential primary contest. Mr. Biden was the top choice of 51% of likely Democratic primary voters, followed by Mr. Sanders at 31% and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 1%, according to the Monmouth University poll. “Biden has a strong advantage going into the primary. This is because much of his support has already been banked in the early vote,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. “The closure of many polling places due to COVID-19 means it is uncertain how many voters who planned to vote on Tuesday will actually show up.” Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders squared off in their first one-on-one debate on Sunday evening in Washington, D.C. The debate had been moved from Phoenix due to coronavirus concerns. Maricopa County is planning to close about 80 polling locations on Tuesday because of the coronavirus outbreak. The county recorder also planned to mail ballots to registered Democrats who haven’t voted yet, though a judge quashed that plan late last week after Attorney General Mark Brnovich took legal action. Mr. Biden held a 3-point, 46% to 43% lead over President Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up in Arizona in the poll, while Mr. Trump held a 1-point, 44% to 43% lead over Mr. Sanders. “Impressions of the Democratic nominee will shift once the general election campaign gets under way, but Biden would start off by putting Arizona within reach,” Mr. Murray said. Democrat Mark Kelly also held a 6-point, 50% to 44% lead over Republican Sen. Martha McSally in a hypothetical November match-up in what will be one the most closely-watched U.S. Senate races in the country. Top elections officials from Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio issued a joint statement on Friday saying they are confident that voters can “safely and securely” cast ballots in Tuesday’s primaries. Still, Louisiana and Georgia recently announced they were pushing off their presidential primaries due to the coronavirus outbreak. Louisiana is pushing its April 4 primary to June 20, and Georgia’s March 24 primary has been rescheduled for May 19. The Democratic Party of Puerto Rico also said over the weekend that it would seek to delay the March 29 presidential primary. The Monmouth poll of 847 registered voters was taken from March 11-14 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. The subset of 373 likely Democratic primary voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.1 percentage points.

"The U.S. faced mounting pressure Sunday to mimic Europe and stop crowded bars and public spaces as Americans from coast to coast become sick with worry and the new coronavirus that is taxing the nation’s hospitals, economy and political leaders at an unprecedented scale. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Sunday said organizers should postpone or cancel events that consist of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks — an aggressive marker that would upend mass gatherings in the U.S. It said events of any size should include hand washing and proper distancing while recognizing the vulnerability of certain groups to the coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. It said the guidance does not apply to the day-to-day operations of schools, colleges or businesses, though it was unclear why. “This recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus,” the CDC said. “This recommendation is not intended to supersede the advice of local public health officials.” Indeed, some of them may go further. Governors in Illinois and Ohio said they are exploring ways to lock down bars and restaurants, and the nation’s top authority on infectious diseases endorsed a 14-day “national shutdown” to slow the outbreak as young people jammed into bars in New York City, the District of Columbia and elsewhere.

"Joseph R. Biden said Sunday that Americans staring at the  coronavirus crisis are “looking for results, not a revolution,” as he  painted himself as a middle option between an incompetent President  Trump and a too-radical Sen. Bernard Sanders, who sees the epidemic as  the reason to adopt a government-run health care system. Mr. Biden said he would set up hundreds  of drive-through testing sites across the country, would call out the  military to stand up emergency hospitals and hold meetings to decide  whether to declare a quarantine and to figure out a long-term economic  stimulus. But he said Americans need to be assured  the government has them covered for all their needs right now, in what  sounded like a limited test-drive of Mr. Sanders‘ own health care plans. “This is like in a war, and in a war you  do whatever needs to be done to take care of your people,” Mr. Biden  said. “Everything you need in terms of dealing with this crisis needs to  be free.” He was facing off one-on-one against Mr. Sanders in a debate in Washington ahead of primaries in four more states Tuesday. The two men settled on one thing: that Mr. Trump has not handled the crisis well. “Shut this president up right now,  because he is undermining the doctors and scientists,” Mr. Sanders said  about Mr. Trump’s public remarks and tweeting. “It is unacceptable for  him to be blabbering with unfactual information, which is confusing the  general public.” The senator from Vermont said the  American health care system isn’t prepared to handle COVID-19, and it’s  proof that it’s time for his “Medicare for All” health care plan. “We’re spending so much money, and yet we  are not even prepared for this pandemic. How come we don’t have enough  doctors? How come hospitals in rural areas are shutting down?” he said. He blamed corporate greed and said the answer is to take it out of the equation. Mr. Biden countered: “You have a single-payer system in Italy. It doesn’t work there.” Mr. Biden also announced that if he  becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, he will pick a woman as his  running mate. Mr. Sanders said “in all likelihood” he would, too. Democratic Party leaders were hoping for a  show of unity between the two remaining major candidates. Instead, the  debate was peppered with pointed exchanges. Mr. Sanders pointed to Mr. Biden’s votes  against gay rights in the 1990s, his support for a restriction on  abortion funding, backing legislation that would have cut Social  Security, and voting for a 2005 bankruptcy bill as evidence that Mr.  Biden is not the liberal champion the country needs. Mr. Sanders also said Mr. Biden’s climate change plans fall short. “I know your heart is in the right place,  but this requires dramatic, bold action. We have got to take on the  fossil fuel industry,” he said. “Your plan does not do that.” Mr. Biden acknowledged that he has moved  toward Mr. Sanders‘ stances in many areas. He said he has apologized for  his vote for the Defense of Marriage Act and noted that he was the  first major figure in the Obama administration to call for legal  recognition of same-sex marriage. He also said he has changed on the  abortion funding question and his vote for the Iraq War was a mistake —  but only because he believed President George W. Bush. But he said the country’s not ready to go full Sanders right now. “People are looking for results; they are not looking for a revolution,” Mr. Biden said. There were points of agreement in areas  such as immigration. Both men said they would severely curtail  enforcement inside the U.S. Mr. Sanders said he would end “raids” on  illegal immigrants, and Mr. Biden affirmed his vow for a 100-day  no-deportation period, and after that only those with felonies on their  records would be deported. That would carve almost all the estimated 11  million illegal immigrants out of any fear of removal. Both men said that doesn’t mean open borders. Mr. Sanders called that “a total lie.” Mr. Biden has been surging since the last  debate just ahead of the South Carolina primary, winning at least 15 of  the last 21 state contests, including several states that Mr. Sanders  carried over Hillary Clinton four years ago. His stunning success on Super Tuesday,  and the stumblings of former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg,  cleared out the field and left Mr. Biden the choice of the party’s  less-liberal wing. That has consolidated the vote behind Mr. Biden, who now holds a solid lead in the delegate count over Mr. Sanders. The senator, watching his second bid for  Democratic nomination falter, delivered a speech last week laying out  his plans for this debate. He said he would pressure Mr. Biden to stake  out positions on a plethora of “progressive” issues. The strategy appeared aimed at defining  the candidates’ differences and giving the former vice president a  political road map for how to connect with the far-left voters who have  rallied behind Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden took the first steps Sunday  before the debate. He announced he had updated his higher education  agenda to include tuition-free public college for students from families  with incomes lower than $125,000. Tuition-free college and his Medicare for All health care plan are the centerpieces of Mr. Sanders‘ democratic socialist agenda. Mr. Sanders welcomed the backing but questioned the late change. “This is a little about leadership,” he said. “Glad you’re coming around now.” Mr. Biden also announced that he was  adopting the bankruptcy plan of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out  of the presidential race this month but maintains credibility among  liberal voters. Ms. Warren’s plan, which Mr. Biden now embraces, would  make it easier for people to claim bankruptcy and allow them to shield  some assets in the process. The embrace was a makeup call for Mr.  Biden, who has taken fire for his vote in 2005 for a bankruptcy bill  that irks liberal Democrats. To win the nomination, a candidate must collect 1,991 delegates. Mr. Biden appears poised to expand his  lead Tuesday when voters in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio have  their say. Polls show Mr. Biden with double-digit leads over Mr. Sanders  in each of those states. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden greeted each  other Sunday night with an elbow bump rather than a handshake, and both  men assured the debate moderators that they wash their hands frequently  amid the coronavirus outbreak. The debate was relocated from Phoenix to Washington, and the live audience was scrapped. COVID-19 has led to more than 50 deaths,  upending people’s daily lives and leaving the presidential contenders to  navigate unknown political waters at a pinnacle moment in the campaign. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll  found that 60% of Americans think the worst of the epidemic is yet to  come. Democrats are far more concerned about the virus than other  voters, making the candidates’ handling of it a major campaign issue. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have canceled  mass rallies and headed online for virtual town halls and fundraisers,  fireside chats and an increasing number of press conferences. Mr. Sanders has penciled in a virtual rally Monday that is set to include musical acts.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders isn’t a fan of Joseph R. Biden’s plan to address climate change, saying it is mind boggling that the former vice president is not rallying behind bolder ideas such as his push to ban fracking. During their first one-on-one debate Sunday in Washington, Mr. Sanders said Mr. Biden’s vision for confronting the “world-shaking event” falls woefully short. “I know your heart is in the right place, but this requires dramatic bold action, we  have got to take on the fossil fuel industry,” he said. “Your plan does not do that.” Mr. Biden defended his plan, countering that he would provide no more subsidies to the fossil fuel industry and would bar drilling on federal lands and offshore. He also said that he doesn’t support any “new fracking.” Mr. Sanders said he doesn’t understand why fracking is allowed to continue in the United States, and that it is time to “take on the fossil fuel industry.” “What Joe is saying goes nowhere near enough,” Mr. Sanders said. Mr. Sanders said Mr. Biden’s desire to reenter the Paris Accord is useful, but it is not enough -  sparking a chuckle from Mr. Biden. “If you are laughing Joe then you are missing the point,” Mr. Sanders said. “This is an existential crisis.” “I am talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,” Mr. Sanders said. “I’m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet.”  ",'Nowhere near enough': Sanders blasts Biden's climate change plan,"Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-blasts-joe-biden-climate-change-pla/,washington_times

I would pick a woman to be my vice president.” Asked whether he would pick a woman as well, Mr. Sanders said he could also go that route. “In all likelihood I will,” Mr. Sanders said. “For me it is not just nominating a woman, it is making sure we have a progressive woman, and there are progressive women out there.” “So my very strong tendency is to move in that direction,” he said.

"Democrats’ top two presidential candidates declared Sunday that they will halt key aspects of immigration enforcement as soon as they take the White House, and promised to work to legalize most of those here illegally. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden affirmed his plan for a 100-day halt to all deportations. “No one, no one will be deported at all,” he said at a debate with Sen. Bernard Sanders. After the 100-day period he said he would only deport those with felonies on their record, effectively carving almost all illegal immigrants out of danger of deportation. Mr. Biden also refuted the Obama administration’s policy of cracking down on sanctuary cities, saying flatly that he would not ask local authorities to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, said he would stop “raids” by ICE — apparently referring to the at-large arrests the agency says it has to make particularly in sanctuary communities, where local prisons and jails refuse help in arresting criminals. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders insisted their plans don’t mean “open borders.” “That is a total lie,” Mr. Sanders said. The two candidates called for surging immigration judges to the border, saying illegal immigrants should be met with a legal process and released, not detained.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders said he is happy that Joseph R.

The Vermonter said he took hard voters when it mattered most, and staked out positions that were once unpopular, but have become so in vogue that people that Mr. Biden has finally come around. “What leadership is about is about going forward when it is not popular,” Mr. Sanders said. “When it is an idea that you get criticized for.” Mr. Sanders said that he voted against, and Mr. Biden voted for, the Defense of Marriage Act, the bankruptcy bill, the war in Iraq, trade deals that he says have hurt the economy, and the Hyde Amendment. “It takes courage sometimes to do the right thing,” Mr. Sanders said.  “The people of America know my record.

"Joseph R. Biden  and Sen. Bernard Sanders clashed in the Democratic presidential debate over the 2008 bailout of Wall Street, with the former vice president arguing that the nation would have sunk into a depression if the Obama administration didn’t act. Mr. Sanders said that he voted against the bailout package because he didn’t want to reward the “illegal behavior” of people on Wall Street. ‘Had those banks gone under all those people that Bernie says he cares about would be in deep trouble - deep, deep trouble,” Mr. Biden said. “All those little folks. They would have gone out of business. They would have found themselves in the position of losing everything they had in that bank - whether it was $10, $300 or a savings account.” Mr. Sanders said that at the time he felt the bailout should have been funded with a surtax on the nation’s most wealthy citizens. “We need to stabilize the economy, but we can’t repeat what we did in 2008,” he said. “Joe voted for that, I voted against it because we have to do more than save the banks or the oil companies. Our job right now is to tell every working person in this country, no matter what your income is, you are not going to suffer.” The disagreement underscored the divide between Mr. Biden’s push for short-term fixes and Mr. Sanders‘ call for long-term systematic change.

Bernard Sanders as the two remaining major candidates for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Sanders said his “Medicare for All” health plan would guarantee illegal immigrants get health care, so they could show up at clinics for testing and care. And he said he would halt at-large immigration enforcement altogether so illegal immigrants wouldn’t be afraid to show up.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders said Sunday that the first step to solving the coronavirus epidemic is to silence President Trump, who he said is undermining the doctors trying to give good advice. “Shut this president up right now,” Mr. Sanders said as he kicked off a two-man debate with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden in the Democratic presidential contest. Mr. Biden also blamed Mr. Trump for a slow response, saying he should have accepted the World Health Organization’s offer of testing kits, instead of waiting for the U.S. to develop its own. The two men were debating at the CNN studios in Washington set far apart from each other on stage and from the moderators, as if to underscore the social distancing recommendations from doctors. Mr. Biden said the solution to the virus is to set up drive-through coronavirus testing and task the military with standing up emergency hospitals to prepare for a health emergency. Mr. Sanders said the virus is the latest proof that his Medicare for All health plan is needed, saying a guarantee that nobody would have to pay for anything related to the virus would be reassuring. Mr. Biden countered that a single-payer system isn’t working in Italy, though he said when it comes to the virus Americans shouldn’t have to pay for any coronavirus care — effectively calling for a limited Medicare for All. “The national criss says we’re responding. It’s all free. You don’t have to pay for a thing,” Mr. Biden said. “We’re at war with the virus.” Mr. Sanders said 30,000 people in the U.S. died last year because they couldn’t afford treatment. “I think that’s a crisis,” he said.

"When North Carolina courts issue warrants to search homes or private property during criminal investigations, records of that process are supposed to be public with rare exceptions. But an examination by a dozen North Carolina news outlets found state courts typically don’t track how often they keep these records secret. And although they contend that sealing search warrants is uncommon, many clerks, district attorneys and judges can’t say how often it happens. The statewide project coincided with  Sunshine Week, a national celebration each March of open government  and the public’s right to know. Journalists requested records and surveyed court officials in 30 counties – rural and urban, wealthy and less prosperous – and found inconsistent approaches to sealing search warrants that persist nearly a decade after an effort to standardize the process and make it more transparent. Brooks Fuller, director of the N.C. Open Government Coalition and assistant journalism professor at Elon University, said it’s sometimes necessary to seal records. “However, it is critical for the public to have a sense of how often and in what types of cases judges seal records from public view,” Fuller said.  North Carolina law dictates that once a warrant is executed and returned to the court, anyone - whether it’s a reporter, a suspect or an interested citizen - should be able to access it, unless a judge seals it. Investigators are required to get a warrant from the courts in most cases before conducting a search. They must explain what they’re looking for and demonstrate probable cause. Making the warrant public, says Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman, acts as a check on the incredible authority of the state. “The public has the right and needs to have the ability to review the exercise of that authority,” Freeman said. District attorneys say they must meet a high bar in the rare instances that a judge seals a search warrant.  Temporarily sealing a search warrant can be necessary, prosecutors say, when investigators need time to build their cases before tipping off suspects.  In Rockingham County, Superior Court Judge Stanley L. Allen said he hasn’t signed many orders to seal information, though doing so can help law enforcement conduct searches or protect the identity of an undercover police officer. In some cases, he said, a seal is used “so the bad guys won’t find out about it.” In Johnston County, District Attorney Susan Doyle said that, to her knowledge, her office had only filed one motion to seal in 2019 – and that was to protect victims and witnesses in a gang-related case with four co-defendants. “We rarely file any motions to seal,” Doyle said. “However, that is a tool that becomes necessary when the safety of victims and witnesses is at stake.” Franklin County Clerk of Superior Court Patricia Chastain estimates that judges there seal between one and two warrants per year, on average.  District Attorney Greg Newman, the chief prosecutor for Henderson, Polk and Transylvania counties, said the rare instances in which he seeks a seal most often deal with victims through the Department of Social Services.  “There’s no one just agreeing to seal records for no good reason,” Newman said.  And in Mecklenburg County, Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Bob Bell said he couldn’t remember the last search warrant he put under seal. “It’s anything but routine,” Bell said. Still, court officials in almost all of the 30 counties surveyed said they had no way to track sealed warrants or provide a specific number, Statewide, the N.C. Administrative Office of the Courts “has no application that tracks the issue of sealed search warrants,” spokeswoman Sharon Gladwell said. Wake County is an exception. Every sealed warrant is logged, noting the case, the date the order was signed and when the seal expires. That order was revised and refined following a 2008 dispute between the district attorney and news outlets over sealed search warrants in a high-profile murder case. The North Carolina Court of Appeals ruled that while temporary seals were justifiable, trial courts should not withhold public records from public inspection unless it is in the interest of the “proper and fair administration of justice” or where “the openness ordinarily required of our government will be more harmful than beneficial.”  In Mecklenburg County, motions to seal search warrants occur in a hearing unannounced to the public. Once in place, a seal is rarely removed. According to county data, slightly more than 2 percent of about 4,200 warrants were sealed in 2018 and 2019. No other counties surveyed by reporters were able to point to any similar tracking system.  ___ This story was reported by Jonathan Drew, of The Associated Press; Kate Martin, of Carolina Public Press; Doug Miller and Michael Gordon, of The Charlotte Observer; Chris Day and Julian Eure, of The Daily Advance; Paul Woolverton, of The Fayetteville Observer; Josh Shaffer, of The News & Observer; Amelia Harper, of the Rocky Mount Telegram; Ann McAdams and Brandon Wissbaum, of WECT-TV; Jenn Emert, of WLOS-TV; Tyler Dukes, of WRAL-TV; and Jason deBruyn, of WUNC.

"Republican Sen. Mitt Romney proposed Monday giving a $1,000 handout to every American adult in an attempt to help the U.S. economy weather the coronavirus which is devastating markets. The money is intended to “help fill the gaps” for Americans who are starting to have issues with their paychecks and bills. The senator sees it as an additional step to the House-passed coronavirus bill that includes free testing, paid sick leave and solidifies unemployment benefits. “We also urgently need to build on this legislation with additional action to help families and small businesses meet their short-term financial obligations, ease the financial burden on students entering the workforce, and protect health workers on the front lines and their patients by improving telehealth services,” Mr. Romney, Utah Republican, said in a statement. The idea of giving $1,000 to every American adult was first made popular by ex-presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Hawaii Democrat Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a candidate in the Democratic primary race, introduced a bill with a similar proposal in the House last week. The stipend is just one of the suggestions Mr. Romney floated. He also called for bridge grants from the Small Business Association for small companies that expect a 50% revenue loss because of the virus. For students, Mr. Romney calls for loan payments to be suspended as well as student fees and grants next year to take into account last-minute expenses on travel, housing and storage students incurred as universities and colleges shut down. Mr. Romney also wants the government to foot the bill for private insurance companies to cover the cost of telehealth services related to the coronavirus.

"The second coronavirus relief package was on its way Monday night to the Senate for final passage as lawmakers in the Capitol tried to balance their responsibilities for leading the country against rapidly escalating health risks. The House passed an updated version of its bill Monday, including technical changes that nearly derailed the process after objections from Rep. Louie Gohmert. The Texas Republican said he was concerned about the last-minute tweaks and was unhappy about passing such a large and expensive bill on such short notice. “I will not give my consent without first reading these very serious changes that will hopefully minimize bankruptcies caused by the virus rather than causing more,” Mr. Gohmert said, before ultimately standing down. Now both the original bill and the updated version, which reportedly includes new language to aid small businesses, will head to the Senate where they both need to pass before heading to President Trump’s desk. The president said earlier Monday even more changes could be made to the legislation now that it’s in the Senate. “They’re [the Senate] working to only enhance it and make it better and it make fair for everybody,” he said. “We may go back and forth a bit with the House on it but both will be in a very positive fashion.” Earlier Monday, some lawmakers were skeptical of the relief package’s chances in the Senate. On Fox News, Sen. Tom Cotton said the bipartisan bill didn’t yet have the votes. “I don’t think the House bill is going to pass as written for one basic problem — it doesn’t go far enough and it doesn’t go fast enough,” the Arkansas Republican said. But four top administration officials, including National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, came up to Capitol Hill to meet with senators late Monday. After the closed-door meeting, Mr. Mnuchin emerged and told reporters he expects the package to move through the Senate on Tuesday. The bill initially passed the House on a 363-40 vote just after midnight on Saturday, after a feverish 48 hours of negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin. The bill also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and children and bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. With the legislation passed the House and headed to the Senate, lawmakers are already talking about getting started on a third coronavirus bill — this time, Republicans are pushing to give an economic break to hard hit sectors, like the airline and cruise ship industries. The trouble the House has with the challenge to unanimous consent shows the difficultly Congress has in legislating during the coronavirus. Members — many of whom are older and more vulnerable to the virus — need to come in to vote, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended suspending events of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. The president on Monday tightened that restriction further: no events for 10 or more people. The new health guidelines prompted the Senates’ health committee to cancel its scheduled hearing on the coronavirus response this week. Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, advised members to cancel plans to come back to Capitol Hill on Monday and did not have a firm fly-in date. Members will have 24-hours notice if they need to return to D.C. for votes. Leadership is also considering new policies to try and limit how many members are in the chamber at a time. Meanwhile, the Senate canceled its recess this week in order to pass the coronavirus bill and FISA reauthorization.  ",House passes coronavirus bill after Gohmert reverses objection,"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/house-passes-coronavirus-bill-after-louis-gohmert-/,washington_times
"The Senate on Monday agreed to pass a temporary extension of three expired national security tools so it could spend more time debating a broad overhaul of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The stopgap measure, which extends the national security tools controlled by FISA for 77 days, passed without intervening action or debate. It also gives senators more time to focus on a multibillion dollar House coronavirus package as public pressure mounts for government action. “We have the next two months to build consensus around important reforms and help everybody — Democrats and Republicans — with joining that effort,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy, Vermont Democrat. The last-minute deal also avoids a potential veto of a House-passed bill by President Trump, who tweeted his displeasure with that proposal. Senators were set to reauthorize fully the critical national security tools controlled by FISA, which lapsed Sunday after a contentious debate in the House last week. Civil liberties advocates who had opposed the House measure praised the stopgap agreement. “The deal secured by bipartisan group of senators ensures that there will be debate on amendments that will protect Americans’ civil liberties,” said Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs for FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. Senators were set to take up a House bill that was approved last week with a bipartisan 278-136 vote. The House bill fully reauthorized the critical national security tools controlled by FISA, which lapsed Sunday. Upon its arrival in the Senate, the bill was quickly condemned by civil liberties hawks, including Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Opponents insisted the legislation didn’t do enough to curb government surveillance, insisting on more sweeping reforms. Both Mr. Lee and Mr. Paul had demanded a substantial overhaul of FISA since revelations confirmed last year the FBI had abused its surveillance powers to monitor Trump campaign figure Carter Page as part of its Russian election interference probe. “We know that the law itself as a whole is subject to abuse and at moments like this, when these provisions are expiring, it’s appropriate for us to take a broader look at overhauling the legal framework in which FISA operates,” Mr. Lee said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other leadership figures had expressed support for the House bill. The Kentucky Republican touted the bill’s privacy protections and warned delaying passage could threaten national security. Mr. McConnell said the reform bill “strikes a key balance.” “It reauthorizes the tools which our national security requires while also imposing a number of new reforms, which basic accountability demands,” he said. Urging passage of the stopgap measure Monday, Mr. McConnell said the three expired FISA provisions needed to be back online immediately. “Hostile foreign intelligence surveillances — whether Chinese, Russian or Iranian — still seek to conduct operations within our borders, to recruit assets and agents among our population,” he said. “These threats will not wait around if the United States delays restocking the toolbox and so the Senate should not wait to act.” The three expired FISA provisions extended by the legislation eliminate the need for separate warrants to wiretap multiple cell phones; allow authorities to monitor “lone wolf” threats who don’t have formal ties to terrorist organizations; and collect business records. House-passed reforms to the FISA process that will be considered later include enhanced penalties for those who abuse the process for political purposes, increased accountability to Congress, transcripts of court proceedings, and a one-time historical review off FISA court rulings since 1979. Mr. Trump warned last week that he could veto the bill until the origins of the Russian probe, which described as an “attempted coup” are investigated. “Many Republican senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what that led to, and happened with the illegal, attempted ‘coup’ of the duly elected President of the United States and others,” the president tweeted. Attorney General William Barr had expressed his support for the House bill and encouraged senators of both parties to vote yes on it. Mr. Barr, a fierce critic of the Page warrant, surprisingly went against the president lobbying for the minor FISA reforms. “The bill contains an array of new requirements and compliance provisions that will protect against abuse and misuse in the future while ensuring that this critical tool is available when appropriate to protect the safety of the American people,” he said.

"When it comes to starting from scratch to fight a rapidly spreading global pandemic of a heretofore unknown disease, Ambassador Deborah Birx has been there. The White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator, Dr. Birx cut her teeth in public health with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, starting her career in immunology in 1985 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and rising to head the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR] in 2014. In naming her to the administration’s coronavirus task force last month, Vice President Mike Pence described her as a “world-renowned global health official and physician,” and that’s no exaggeration, according to others in the field. Dr. Birx, 63, is “absolutely the right person” to lead the Trump administration’s COVID-19 response, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, professor of infections diseases at the Emory University School of Medicine, who called PEPFAR “the most successful global health program ever.” “I would give money to see a meeting between her and [President] Trump,” said Dr. del Rio. “She won’t stay quiet when she has something to say. She’s a tough lady. If anyone can talk truth to power, it’s her.” At the daily White House press conferences on the coronavirus, Dr. Birx frequently draws comparisons between HIV/AIDS and the fast-spreading virus causing pneumonia-like symptoms that has killed more than 6,500 worldwide since emerging last year in Wuhan, China. “We had another silent epidemic: HIV,” she said at Monday’s briefing. “I just want to recognize, the HIV epidemic was solved by the community, the HIV advocates and activists who stood up when no one was listening and got everyone’s attention. We’re asking that same sense of community to come together and stand up against this virus.” The HIV/AIDS epidemic hit home for her in 1983. Immediately after the birth of her older daughter, her obstetrician ordered a blood transfusion, but she refused it based on her knowledge of the mysterious new infection that appeared to have contaminated the nation’s blood supply. Former Secretary of State John Kerry told the story at her April 2014 swearing-in as ambassador-at large and U.S. global AIDS coordinator, according to the Vote Smart transcript. “And literally, just before she passed out from pain, Debbi screamed, ‘Do not let them give me blood,’” Mr. Kerry said. “Her husband refused the transfusion, and it is a mighty good thing that he did. Because the hospital learned later that that the blood of her blood type — that they would have used — was contaminated with HIV.” The White House Coronavirus Task Force will benefit from Dr. Birx’s ability to “do things when there’s no infrastructure and no program,” said Dr. del Rio, an investigator with the Emory Center for AIDS Research. “I’ve never heard her say, we can’t do that. It’s always, we can do that,” he said. Millennials ‘will stop this virus’ An Army physician, she reached the rank of colonel before retiring from the military, helping lead the influential RV 144 HIV vaccine trial and winning two U.S. Meritorious Service Medals and the Legion of Merit Award, as cited in her State Department biography. Dr. Birx “has repeatedly demonstrated her unparalleled ability to control infectious diseases and is extremely well positioned to develop an effective plan to address COVID-19 in the United States of America,” said UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima in a Feb. 29 statement. The elderly, infirm and immuno-compromised have been identified as the most susceptible to the coronavirus, but Dr. Birx on Monday described millennials as “the core group that will stop this virus.” “Now why do I think the millennials are the key? Because they’re the ones that are out and about,” she said. “And they’re the most likely to be in social gatherings, and they’re the most likely to be the least symptomatic. And I think we’ve always heard about the greatest generation — we’re protecting the greatest generation right now, and the children of the greatest generation, and I think the millennials can help us tremendously.” Another reason: Millennials are adept at communicating with each other without being in each other’s presence. “They need to communicate with each other,” Dr. Birx said. “Public health people like myself don’t always come out with compelling and exciting messages that a 25-35-year-old may find interesting and something they would take to heart, but millennials can speak to one another about how important it is in this moment to protect all of the people.” Questions have been raised about the task force’s divided leadership, given that Mr. Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also oversee the panel, but Dr. Birx has played an increasingly visible role in fielding public-health questions at press briefings. She has a history with the panel’s other experts. On Monday, she deferred to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on a question about how long the virus can live on hard surfaces. “He was my mentor so I’m going to have to let him speak,” she said with a grin. Dr. Birx graduated from Houghton College and the Hershey School of Medicine at Pennsylvania State University. She has two daughters, Danielle and Devynn. Other task force members include U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Robert O’Brien, assistant to the president for national security affairs; Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun.

"Sen. Rand Paul says Uncle Sam should hold off on collecting taxes for a few months — and waive fees — as Americans attempt to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. The Kentucky Republican’s proposal elicited a wave of feedback Monday as the COVID-19 outbreak continued to disrupt and redefine daily life throughout the world. “Today I’m calling on the IRS to move our tax filing deadline from April 15 to July 15, and to waive any interest and fees for late payment,” Mr. Paul tweeted. “This will allow those who owe money not to have to send it during our current situation.” A sampling of the reactions include: Mr. Paul’s suggestion comes after an $8.3 billion coronavirus package passed Congress last week and as officials on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue were working on relief packages measured in the hundreds of billions. “Good teamwork between  Republicans & Democrats as the House passes  the big CoronaVirus  Relief Bill,” President Trump tweeted Saturday. “People really pulled together. Nice to  see!” Today I’m calling on the IRS to move our tax filing deadline from April 15 to July 15, and to waive any interest and fees for late payment.

"As chief of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, Vice President Mike Pence has upped his profile plenty on the public radar. Mr. Pence is also getting good reviews. “He’s a daily, consistent presence on the airwaves. He provides useful info rather than random digressions. He leans on health and medical experts — both at public events and behind the scenes,” write Axios co-founders Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei, in a review of this uncommon surge. It is his “presidential moment,” they say. “Pence, 60, a likely contender for the Republican nomination in 2024, has become one of the most praised administration officials during the virus crisis,” they note. Tech author Scott Galloway said the vice president had done a “reasonably good job” while Politico media columnist Jack Shafer said Mr. Pence “acted less like the ‘coronavirus czar’ and more like a good old-fashioned White House press secretary. He was calm. He was direct. He was polite in face of shouted, competing questions.” Mr. Pence’s chief of staff Marc Short tells Axios that the vice president “has an understanding of what people are looking for” — facts that are “straightforward, not alarmist.” “Most importantly, Pence seems on the level. The more Americans see of him, the more likely they are to believe what the administration says about this crisis, provided that Pence’s statements about the pandemic hold up over time,” advises Paul Mirengoff, a columnist at Powerline.com. REASSURING NEWS “Sixty-two percent of U.S. adults assess the strength of U.S. national defense as being ‘about right,’ two points off the record-high 64% from 1990. About twice as many say U.S. defense is not strong enough (25%) as say it is stronger than it needs to be (12%),” reports Gallup analyst Jeffrey M. Jones, who adds that the majority of Americans are also comfortable with the amount of military spending. “At a time when Americans are relatively satisfied with the strength of the U.S. military and the amount of military spending, 58% say the U.S. is No. 1 in the world militarily,” writes Mr. Jones.

As public alarm grows over the coronavirus health emergency, one veteran columnist has a simple panacea which could at least get the nation through the next month: Neutralize the bitter sparring between Democrats and President Trump. “It’s time to do something about our national divide. A 30-day political cease-fire is reasonable and doable. We must take a break from the hate,” writes New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin. “A month would be a good cooling-off period to allow the public-health emergency to take its rightful place at the top of the agenda without the distraction of personal sniping, which is especially demoralizing these days. In this environment, each attack smacks of pettiness and politics-as-usual. Partisanship has an important role in our enduring experiment with self-government, but not now. Now is the time for a united America to mobilize against a lethal scourge,” he continues. “A 30-day cease-fire would allow the entire nation to focus on saving lives and preventing further disaster to the economy and jobs. There would be plenty of time later to resume the political hostilities before the November election,” Mr. Goodwin advises. “An agreement would be nice, but isn’t necessary. All they need do is start behaving as Americans first and partisans second.” BORDERING ON INSANITY In the wake of the pared-down Democratic presidential field, one GOP official has a reminder. “Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are leading the Democrat Party’s charge for open borders. And they’re sounding like the same person: Biden has promised to end illegal immigration detention ‘across the board,’ and to not deport illegal immigrants who have committed felony-like offenses,” points out Steve Guest, rapid response communications director for the Republican National Committee. “Bernie backs a moratorium on all deportations of illegal immigrants in the U.S. and says that it is not ‘appropriate’ to deport illegal immigrants not following law in the U.S. And both Biden and Bernie support government health care for illegal immigrants. Bottom Line: While Bernie and Biden push for plans that would make the border crisis worse, President Trump’s deal with Mexico has achieved results,” Mr. Guest advises, citing a single Associated Press headline regarding the outcome of Mr. Trump’s productive call to Mexico to help with the illegal immigration challenge: “AP exclusive: Border apprehensions drop for eight straight months.” HELPFUL DIVERSION “Just because coronavirus has you avoiding public spaces doesn’t mean you can’t get cultured from home,” reports Fast Company analyst Lilly Smith, who shares all the details. “Google Arts & Culture has partnered with over 2,500 museums and galleries around the world, including Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum, London’s National Gallery, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

"Rep. Louie Gohmert could block the House’ final passage of the bipartisan coronavirus relief package Monday over concerns about last-minute updates to the bill. The House was set to make technical changes to the package on Monday before passing on a unanimous consent rule, which can be derailed by just one member. “I will not give my consent without first reading these very serious changes that will hopefully minimize bankruptcies caused by the virus rather than causing more,” Mr. Gohmert, Texas Republican, said in a statement. Mr. Gohmert said he has spoken to both House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and President Trump about his concerns. “My constituents did not elect the California delegation to represent them, they elected me — and that’s what I am trying to do,” he said. After a feverish 48 hours of negotiations, the House passed a massive relief package just after midnight Saturday to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers. It mandates free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those who contract the virus or need to care for someone that does if they’re at a company with fewer than 500 employees. The bill also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, such the elderly and schoolchildren and bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, who helped craft the White House-approved package with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, acknowledged Sunday there were technical changes that needed to be made before it even reached the Senate. He said he was speaking with senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, on Saturday about the bill. “We are hearing feedback that certain small businesses are concerned about the burden of this,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “I think there’s a lot of bipartisan support. We hope they pass this bill. If not, we’ll work with the center on whatever minor changes we need.” The Senate will take up the House bill once handed over and is working in the meantime to pass FISA reauthorization and reform after it lapsed Sunday.

"President Trump implored Americans Monday to avoid groups of 10 or more and enjoy takeout instead of stepping foot in restaurants, bars and food courts for the next 15 days, as the U.S. tries to avoid the fate of China or Italy in the fight against the coronavirus. His guidelines, which rely on public cooperation, say Americans should avoid discretionary travel and stay home if they are sick. Mr. Trump also wants everyone to learn or work at home, where possible, to disrupt chains of transmission. “We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it,” Mr. Trump said. It’s a sudden shift in tone from Mr. Trump, who in late February predicted the U.S. would tackle all of its cases swiftly. He now says the outbreak may last well into the summer. The White House guidelines are stiffer than ones the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released less than 24 hours earlier and come as governors and mayors enforce mandatory rules, such as shuttering schools, delaying primary voting and ordering restaurants, gyms and theaters to close outright. San Francisco and six area counties took the most stringent measures to date, saying residents can only leave home for necessities for the next three weeks, starting Tuesday. The lockdown applies to San Francisco, Marin, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa counties and the city of Berkeley. The federal, state and local moves reflect a more urgent phase in the fight against the coronavirus that’s sickened more than 4,000 in the U.S. and killed over 70, although nationwide testing is just getting started. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It infected tens of thousands in the surrounding Hubei Province before the epidemic shifted to other nations. It’s now spreading on six continents, particularly Europe. Authorities in Italy and Spain have locked down their entire populations, except for trips to work or grocery stores. France joined them on Monday. “We are at war,” French President Emmanuel Macron told the nation. Mr. Trump said he is not considering a nationwide lockdown because parts of the country aren’t seeing widespread transmission. “At this point, they shouldn’t worry,” Mr. Trump said. “We may look at certain areas, certain hotspots. We’ll be looking at that.” Mr. Trump said parts of New York, notably the suburb of New Rochelle, should be “tamped down even more” after Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, ordered a mile-wide lockdown in the town because of rapid transmission. Earlier Monday, Mr. Cuomo suggested the administration was at fault for not being explicit about quarantine measures. He said a patchwork of state-by-state rules is unworkable. “If the federal government isn’t going to do what it should do, then the states have to try their best,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference in Albany. He also called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to step in and retrofit buildings like college dorms and surplus property to function as hospitals in his state. He said there are 50,000 hospital beds and 3,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds in New York, and they might be overwhelmed. “You look at any of these projections and you see that coming,” he told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Mr. Trump said he told governors Monday to get things like ventilators through their own supply chains if they can get them faster than the federal government. In some ways, the press conference marked a pivot for Mr. Trump, as he highlighted health measures and the virus itself, instead of the financial fallout and Wall Street. He said markets would take care of themselves, and that airlines losing revenue would be taken care of at a later date. “We have an invisible enemy, we have a problem a month ago nobody thought about,” Mr. Trump said. “This is a bad one. This is bad in the sense of it’s so contagious. Sort of record-setting type contagion. My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything will fall into place.” Yet Mr. Trump continued to buck responsibility for hiccups in the response. He said he’d rate his efforts “a 10,” though a lack of testing has been an embarrassing blind spot in the U.S. response. Administration officials said they are entering a “new phase” of testing that taps commercial labs and makes it more available, with some areas opening drive-through service. The World Health Organization on Monday said testing is one of the most critical parts of the fight. “The most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate,” WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said. “You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.” The U.S. made progress in another critical area Monday — the race for a vaccine to the new coronavirus. The National Institutes of Health said it administered an investigational vaccine to a person as it kickstarts a phase-one trial at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. Scientists plan to enroll 45 healthy adults ages 18 to 55 and try out various dosages of the vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1273. It was developed by scientists at the infectious-disease arm of the National Institutes of Health and biotech company Moderna, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with [the new coronavirus] is an urgent public health priority,” said Anthony S. Fauci, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.” The vaccine model uses what’s known as messenger RNA and has shown promise in animal studies, but hasn’t been used on humans. This trial will test various dosages of the investigation vaccine. There is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19, and scientists say it could take a year to a year and a half before there is a shot for widespread use. While the world waits for an antidote, officials are imploring Americans to disrupt the spread of the disease through “social distancing,” in which people stay home when possible or six feet apart in public. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pushed to delay in-person voting from Tuesday to early June, saying it couldn’t in good conscience expose poll workers or invite crowds to its primary election. “I’m making this recommendation because we must also look out for our poll workers,” the Republican tweeted. “I believe when we look back on this, we’ll be happy we did this. The votes that have already been cast will still be counted — and this recommendation would allow others to vote in the future.” Governors across the northeast, meanwhile, decided to temporarily shutter bars, theaters and other public places late Monday, saying a lack of federal direction and public indifference to local transmission gave them no choice. Mr. Hogan defended his sweeping measures, saying he couldn’t afford to wait. “While these measures may seem extreme, if we do not take them now, it could be too late,” the governor said. Cancelations also rolled across official Washington on Monday. First Lady Melania Trump said Monday she decided to scrap the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on April 13 out of an “abundance of caution.” “The health and safety of all Americans must be the first priority, especially right now,” said First Lady Melania Trump. “I deeply regret this cancellation, but we need to make difficult decisions in the short-term to ensure a healthy country for the long-term.” The Supreme Court announced Monday it would postpone its next sitting for oral arguments due to the COVID-19 spread, saying it would look at the calendar to reschedule at a later time. The court was expected to hear cases from March 23 through April 1 but decided to put off the challenges for now. “The Court will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances,” a spokesperson announced in a press release. Some of the most eyed cases that were scheduled during that period were disputes over Congress’s authority to subpoena banking documents and other private financial records from Mr. Trump’s businesses, as well as a challenge over the validity of a subpoena out of New York to obtain the president’s tax returns. The justices were also set to hear a case involving Google, which weighs the issue of copyright protection. There was also a First Amendment dispute scheduled to be argued involving employment discrimination cases brought against religious employers. Moving the hearings is quite rare, though it has happened in the past. The court postponed arguments in 1918 during the Spanish flu epidemic. The press release also noted calendars at the court were changed in August 1793 and in 1798 over yellow fever. • Alex Swoyer contributed to this report.

"Voters like the idea of making legal immigrants pay their own way, and they are also keen on letting people sue sanctuary cities for crimes committed by illegal immigrants — both parts of President Trump’s immigration agenda — according to surprising polling numbers from Harvard University. Nearly four in five voters like the idea of an “immigration halt” with the coronavirus becoming a pandemic. Less popular is the move by a number of Democrat-led states such as New York to issue driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. Only about one-third of voters polled said people in the country without authorization should be allowed to apply for a license. The results of the Harvard Center for American Political Studies/Harris Poll suggest that Mr. Trump’s immigration policies have strong backing among the public at large, even though they are derided as racist or unfair in Washington and among Democratic leaders. “This should definitely be a warning, especially to Biden because he’s going to be the nominee, that going too far left is a real danger for him,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director at the Center for Immigration Studies. “I’m not even sure what he was thinking last night. He’s got the nomination. Why cater to the most radical anti-borders elements in his party?” Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, in a debate Sunday with Sen. Bernard Sanders, his chief opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, proposed shutting down all deportations for 100 days and then deporting only illegal immigrants with further felonies on their records. He also said he will cancel immigration detention for people awaiting court hearings if he wins the White House. He flatly said local police should not cooperate in turning over illegal immigrants to federal immigration authorities. “Xenophobia is a disease,” said Mr. Biden, condemning what he called “this demonization and divisiveness coming from the Trump administration on immigration.” The Harvard/Harris poll found immigration policy to be the second most important issue for voters, behind health care and ahead of terrorism and national security. When it comes to Mr. Trump, 49% said they approved of the president’s handling of immigration. That is at the high range of the past few years, with Harvard/Harris showing approval hovering between 44% and 49%. During his State of the Union address this year, Mr. Trump called for punishing sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal officials by allowing people victimized by illegal immigrants to sue the sanctuaries for damages. That idea earns 55% support, according to Harvard/Harris, though the pollsters asked the question without mentioning that Mr. Trump supports it. The same was true with a question on whether the government should deny green cards to immigrants who are likely to end up on the public dole. The Trump administration this year implemented a rule to do just that, and the Harvard/Harris poll said 60% support it — again, without Mr. Trump’s name attached to it. Immigrant rights activists have labeled that policy racist. They say it will hinder poor migrants from developing nations in Africa trying to achieve the American dream and reward those from richer nations in Europe. Mr. Krikorian said asking without the president’s name meant the pollsters were able to find Americans’ views without any Trump bias. He said there are probably people who would be hawkish on immigration, such as opposing sanctuary cities, though they dislike Mr. Trump. If told the president backed a crackdown, they might have a different answer to the polling question. “Because Trump’s name isn’t on there, people were giving answers based on what they actually thought policy should be rather than what is associated with the president,” he said. The Washington Times reached out to several immigrant rights activists about the numbers. They either didn’t respond or declined to tackle the questions. Mr. Trump has tied immigration to the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis, and the polling suggests Americans agree. A stunning 79% told the pollsters that an “immigration halt” should be imposed if the outbreak grows into a pandemic. On the other side of the ledger, voters resoundingly rejected the idea of issuing driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants, with 65% opposed and just 35% in favor. Immigration activists argue that illegal immigrants are on the roads anyway, and it makes more sense to license them and require them to have insurance. Fourteen states plus the District of Columbia have moved to grant licenses to those in the country without authorization, according to the National Council of State Legislatures. New York became the latest to offer licenses in December with its Green Light law. New Jersey will become the 15th state when its law takes effect in June.

"Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said late Monday that the state department of health will order polls to be closed on Tuesday as a “health emergency,” hours after a judge declined to delay the state’s March 17 presidential primary at the behest of Mr. DeWine. Mr. DeWine, a Republican, said that to conduct an election Tuesday would force poll workers and voters to place themselves “at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus.” He tweeted that Dr. Amy Acton, who heads the Ohio Department of Health, “will order the polls closed as a health emergency.” “While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State @FrankLaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,” Mr. DeWine said. Dr. Acton signed a three-page order saying that all polling locations in the state would be closed “to avoid an imminent threat with a high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19 with a significant risk of substantial harm to a large number of people in the general population.” The order said she had authority under Ohio code to “make special orders…for preventing the spread of contagious or infectious diseases.” The action came hours after Franklin County Judge Richard Frye denied a motion to push in-person voting to June 2 amid concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, saying such a move could set a terrible precedent. After the ruling, Mr. DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a joint statement saying that given the circumstances, “it simply isn’t possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by Ohioans.” “They mustn’t be forced to choose between their health and exercising their constitutional rights,” the statement said. Earlier in the day, Judge Frye had said that decision wasn’t his to make, saying he was “very reluctant” to “say well, we’ll have a judge in Columbus rewrite the election code, reset the election for some arbitrary date in the future and upset the apple cart in a terrible precedent.” Mr. DeWine spoke as voters in Ohio, Arizona, Florida, and Illinois were preparing to head to the polls to cast their ballots in a race that has been upended by concerns over the coronavirus that is changing the daily lives of millions of Americans. President Trump, who said on Monday that Americans should avoid gatherings of more than 10 people for the next 15 days as part of the coronavirus response, said postponing elections is a state matter but that he generally isn’t a fan. “I think postponing elections is not a very good thing,” Mr. Trump said. “They have lots of room in a lot of the electoral places … I think postponing is unnecessary.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday that elections can be done in a way that protects people. “We’ve limited access to the assisted living facilities in some of the areas where we may have vulnerable folks,” Mr. DeSantis said. “But at the same time, when you go and cancel that, the signal that that sends is somehow we’re paralyzed. And I don’t think that’s the case. I think we’re taking prudent steps.” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said Monday that officials understand voters might be apprehensive, but the election would proceed as planned. “This decision was not made lightly, and what it all comes down to is — that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,” Ms. Hobbs said. “The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this will become.” A spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections likewise said the state primary was proceeding as planned, saying the elections team has been working with public health officials and has made every effort to keep voters up to date on polling place location changes. Dan Kovats, executive director of the Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association, said Illinois has done a good job encouraging early voting and voting by mail over the last few cycles. “I believe we will have everything in place to ensure a legitimate primary election,” Mr. Kovats said. He said his group, in concert with the state Democratic Party, launched a large-scale texting program Monday morning to inform voters of changes in their polling locations and that he thought more than 300 precincts have had such changes. Officials in all four states already had been struggling to convince poll workers to show up and grappling with polling locations getting cut back or changed amid the escalating outbreak. Before Mr. Trump’s announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had issued guidance late Sunday recommending that the public avoid gatherings of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. In Florida, some local officials had already said they were short of where they wanted to be in terms of attracting enough workers to man the polls Tuesday in light of COVID-19. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, Florida Democrat, said Monday the state should have followed Ohio’s lead and pushed back its Tuesday election as well. “We need to protect the rights of all our citizens to safely have their voices heard,” Ms. Mucarsel-Powell tweeted, as she also expressed concern about reports of a lack of mail ballots in South Dade County. In Arizona, Maricopa County was planning to close dozens of polling locations because of COVID-19. “The closure of many polling places due to COVID-19 means it is uncertain how many voters who planned to vote on Tuesday will actually show up,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday his state will push its primary from May 19 to June 23, become the latest state leader to announce such a change. Louisiana and Georgia have already postponed their primaries that had been scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, and the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico said it was going to push for a delay in its March 29 primary.

"The Republican primary for the Kansas Senate seat has become uglier as Kris Kobach has emerged as the front-runner to succeed retiring Sen. Pat Roberts. The conservative Club for Growth has mounted a new advertising campaign attacking rival candidate Rep. Roger Marshall over his alleged poor treatment of female patients as a doctor. Mr. Kobach, Kansas’ former secretary of state, is a longtime ally of President Trump, but many Republicans are worried he would lose the Senate race, as he lost his gubernatorial bid in 2018. Mr. Kobach held a double-digit percentage point lead on Mr. Marshall, his nearest competitor, in a February McLaughlin & Associates poll. The free-market advocacy group is spending about $33,000 on a print and digital ad campaign accusing Mr. Marshall of “poor treatment of women” as an obstetrician/gynecologist. The anti-Marshall ads ran in several newspapers with large circulations in the state, including the Kansas City Star, Topeka Capital Journal and Wichita Eagle. “Online public reviews of [Mr. Marshall‘s] dealings with patients suggest his treatment of women was not received positively in far too many instances,” the print ad reads above quotations branding the candidate as “arrogant” and “insensitive.” “Are these reports accurate? What’s the truth? What was your — or your loved one’s — experience with Dr. Marshall?” The digital effort includes RogerMarshallTruth.com, which features criticism from women posted anonymously. The Club for Growth is soliciting other women to come forward with negative stories about Mr. Marshall. “Several of Dr. Marshall’s patients have raised important concerns about their treatment while under his care,” David McIntosh, Club for Growth Action president, said in a statement. “We think Kansas voters deserve to hear what these women have said, and if other women have similar stories, we hope they speak out as well.” Mr. Marshall’s campaign said he would ignore the attack ads and focus on talking with Kansans about “real issues.” “Slinging amateur garbage from a D.C. office during a national pandemic isn’t surprising coming from these losers,” said Brent Robertson, Marshall campaign spokesman, in a statement. “While we understand that they have a 2016 campaign grudge, they put the Senate majority at risk by doing the dirty work of fellow loser Kris Kobach.” The group is not the only one attacking Mr. Marshall’s candidacy. Free Forever PAC has spent $70,000 to air ads on Fox News opposing Mr. Marshall, according to the Kansas City Star. The group, which is bankrolled by billionaire Peter Thiel, is also running ads on Facebook criticizing Mr. Marshall as an unreliable supporter of Mr. Trump because of his previous support for former Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s failed 2016 presidential bid. While Mr. Kobach has a reliable supporter in Mr. Thiel, he has far fewer friends in the Republican Party establishment. The Club for Growth is not supporting Mr. Kobach’s bid and has not endorsed a candidate. The National Republican Senatorial Committee said in July that Mr. Kobach’s candidacy would “simultaneously put President Trump’s presidency and [the] Senate majority at risk.” No Democrat has won a Senate seat in Kansas since the 1930s, but the food fight on the right has proven useful for Democrats looking to expand the map of targeted states in November. State Sen. Barbara Bollier, a retired physician, is the Democratic front-runner to compete for the open seat. A former Republican who switched parties and identifies herself a “pragmatic Democrat,” she figures to make health care and the coronavirus crisis a central aspect of the campaign. The Club for Growth declined to say whether it had discussed the race with potential candidates and said its interviews are “confidential.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a former Kansas congressman, has reportedly ruled out running for the seat.

"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden has been declared the winner of last week’s Democratic presidential primary in Washington state, giving him victories in five out of six states that voted March 10. After nearly a week of counting votes, the former vice president on Monday held onto a small lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that turned out to be insurmountable. Washington was a state that Sanders had been hoping to win. In 2016, he won more than two-thirds of the delegates from the Washington caucuses over Hillary Clinton. Of the state’s 89 pledged delegates, only 31 are allocated based on the statewide result. The remaining 58 are determined based on the results of the state’s 10 congressional districts, and those results might not be calculated until the election is certified by the secretary of state’s office, which could be as late as March 27. Biden won four other states last Tuesday: Missouri, Mississippi, Michigan and Idaho. Sanders won North Dakota. In Washington, Democrats used he vote-by-mail presidential primary – moved up this year from May – for the first time to allocate delegates instead of the smaller caucuses used in previous years. Four states – Arizona, Ohio, Illinois and Florida – are scheduled to hold primaries on Tuesday.

"The Justice Department filed a motion Monday to dismiss charges against Concord Management and Consulting, a Russian company accused of bankrolling schemes to meddle in the 2016 election. Federal prosecutors said in a court filing that pursuing the case could expose American law-enforcement methods they’d prefer to keep under wraps. “The risk of exposure to law enforcement’s tools and techniques, and the post-indictment change in the proof available at trial, the balance of equities has shifted,” they wrote. “It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution.” Concord had been using the case as a means to gather intelligence about how the United States combats foreign election interference, the prosecutors alleged. “Concord has been eager and aggressive in using the judicial system to gather information about how the United States detects and prevents foreign election interference,” the filing said. It is a stunning reversal that just weeks before the case was set to head to trial. Concord Management was among 13 Russian individuals and two companies charged in 2018 by former special counsel Robert Mueller. The government said they used social media to sow discord and spread disinformation to undermine the 2016 election. Concord Management, owned by Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, is accused of bankrolling a Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency. It was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. Mr. Prigozhin was nicknamed “Putin’s Chef” for his close relationship with the Russian president. Although others ignored the charges, Concord fought Mr. Mueller’s team in court. But instead of defending itself, Concord used the case as a means to obtain secret information about how the government detected the purported meddling. Prosecutors worried about sharing in discovery a trove of documents with Concord that detailed government sources and methods. Fears that Concord will make the information public were raised by prosecutors in earlier court filings. Several non-classified documents that prosecutors turned over to Concord’s defense team ended up on a website last fall, angering the Justice Department. All told, more than a thousand files were posted on the website, prosecutors said. At the time, the documents were even promoted on a newly-created Twitter account hyping the material as access to Mr. Mueller’s secret database. Prosecutors said Monday such tricks made the case run counter to the government’s interests, especially given its limited ability to punish a Russian corporation. “The government has concluded that further proceedings as to Concord, a Russian company with no presence in the United States and exposure to a meaningful punishment in the event of a conviction, promotes neither the interests of justice nor the nation’s security,” they wrote.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department is moving to drop charges against two Russian companies that were accused of funding a social media campaign to sway American public opinion during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Prosecutors said they concluded that a trial, against a corporate defendant with no presence in the United States and no prospect of meaningful punishment even if convicted, would likely expose sensitive law enforcement tools and techniques, “potentially undermining their effectiveness.” Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering were among three companies and 13 individuals charged in 2018 by special counsel Robert Mueller in a conspiracy to spread disinformation on social media during the 2016 presidential race. The effort was aimed at dividing American public opinion and sowing discord in the electorate, officials said.  The case was one of the signature indictments from Mueller’s two-year Russia investigation. Together with a separate case against Russian government hackers accused of breaking into Democratic email accounts, it revealed a sweeping Russian effort to influence, or interfere in, the race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Concord was the sole defendant in the case to enter an appearance in Washington’s federal court and contest the allegations. The case had been set for trial next month, making the government’s filing all the more abrupt. Concord is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as “Putin’s chef” for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been hit with U.S. sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 election and is charged alongside his company in the indictment brought by Mueller. The company, with the help of a high-powered law firm, filed a series of motions over the last two years, including to dismiss charges and to exclude certain evidence from the case.  In January 2019, prosecutors alleged that confidential material from the Russia investigation, which had been handed over to defense attorneys for Concord, was altered and disseminated as part of a disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the special counsel’s Russia investigation. The files surfaced online in a link posted by a pro-Russia Twitter account. But the Justice Department stopped short of accusing Concord of leaking the material. Still, prosecutors argued that the company’s request to have sensitive new evidence sent to Russia “unreasonably risks the national security interests of the United States.”  Some of the court appearances in the case have been unusually contentious, with the federal judge overseeing it chastising a lawyer for Concord, Eric Dubelier, for references in court filings to Looney Tunes and the 1978 raunchy comedy “Animal House” to criticize the Mueller investigation. “I’ll say it plain and simply: Knock it off,” U.S District Judge Dabney Friedrich told Dubelier at a January 2019 court appearance. Dubelier, who has referred to the case as involving a “made up” crime, has made allegations of prosecutorial misconduct and even once accused the judge of bias. The judge rejected the allegation. But with the case approaching trial, prosecutors said they had to weigh the risk of potentially exposing sensitive national security information against the benefits of continuing with the case against a company that likely wouldn’t face any significant punishment in the U.S.  In the court filing on Monday, prosecutors said Concord had been “eager and aggressive in using the judicial system to gather information about how the United States detects and prevents foreign election interference.”  “In short, Concord has demonstrated its intent to reap the benefits of the Court’s jurisdiction while positioning itself to evade any real obligations or responsibility,” prosecutors wrote. “It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution.”  Concord Catering did not have attorneys appear in court, but prosecutors said they would seek to drop charges against that company as well because it too was controlled by Prigozhin and “based on the likelihood that its approach to litigation would be the same as Concord.” Prosecutors vowed to continue to pursue their case against the 13 Russians who were named in Mueller’s indictment, along with the troll farm that Concord was alleged to have funded, the Internet Research Agency.

"An Ohio judge on Monday denied a motion to push in-person voting in the state’s presidential primary past March 17, after Gov. Mike DeWine had said earlier in the day he was advocating a delay because of concerns over the expanding coronavirus outbreak. Franklin County Judge Richard Frye said he was “very reluctant” to “have a judge in Columbus rewrite the election code, reset the election for some arbitrary date in the future and upset the apple cart in a terrible precedent.” Pending any potential appeal, the ruling means that Ohio’s presidential primary is on for Tuesday despite Mr. DeWine’s last-minute overture. Judge Frye said there are too many factors to balance in the “uncharted territory” of taking things away from the legislature and elected statewide officials and throwing things to “a common pleas court judge in Columbus with 12 hours to go until the election.” Mr. DeWine had acknowledged earlier in the day that he couldn’t unilaterally move the election, but had expressed hope that a judge would grant a favorable ruling to a legal petition. “We cannot conduct this election, in-person voting, for 13 hours…and conform to [federal] guidelines,” Mr. DeWine said. “It is therefore my recommendation…that voting be extended until June 2nd.”  ",Judge rejects Ohio bid to delay primary,"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/judge-richard-frye-rejects-ohio-primary-delay/,washington_times
"WASHINGTON (AP) -  The U.S. Senate has voted to extend, rather than tweak, three surveillance powers that federal law enforcement officials use to fight terrorists, passing the bill back to an absent House and throwing the future of the authorities in doubt.  The 75-day extension pushes off the debate over the surveillance tools as Congress attempts to deal with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. It is not yet clear whether the House will accept the temporary extension of the surveillance powers, which lapsed on Sunday. The House last week passed a compromise bill negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy that would renew the authorities and impose new restrictions. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed the measure, but longtime skeptics of the surveillance tools in the Senate blocked a quick passage.  The House legislation would update the three expiring surveillance provisions, including one that permits the FBI to obtain court orders to collect business records on subjects in national security investigations. Another, known as the “roving wiretap” provision, permits surveillance on subjects even after they’ve changed phones. The third allows agents to monitor subjects who don’t have ties to international terrorism organizations.  The legislation would scale back some current authorities, such as the government’s access to certain records. It would also attempt to put stronger checks on some surveillance measures and make the process more transparent.  The compromise reflects angst in both parties about the way the surveillance powers have been used, but also a reluctance to strip those powers from the government’s arsenal. Republicans and Democrats in the House broadly agreed that they did not want civil liberties sacrificed in efforts to thwart terrorism and other crimes.  It is unclear whether the House will vote on the Senate extension, which would make no changes to the authorities during the 75 days. A Democratic aide said that House leadership was discussing how to move forward, as the House is on recess and has no set date for returning.  The Senate passed the extension by voice vote Monday after days of negotiations between McConnell and Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. The chamber had originally been scheduled to take a procedural vote to move forward on the House legislation, a step that would have set up final passage for later in the week. It’s not clear whether McConnell had enough votes for the House bill to pass.  McConnell said Monday evening that the Senate would eventually consider the House bill and several amendments, conceding to the demands from the three senators. The amendments would impose restrictions beyond the House bill on the government’s ability to surveil and gather information on Americans.  Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., speaking on the floor for McConnell, objected to that same deal last week, saying the Senate should pass the House bill. But there appeared to be more urgency to put off the surveillance issue Monday as coronavirus cases spiked in the United States and the economic damage mounted.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders emerged from the 2016 election and his strong challenge to eventual nominee Hillary Clinton believing the Democratic Party was at a tipping point, ready for his brand of democratic socialism. It’s increasingly apparent that he misread the voters. After a couple of early wins, Mr. Sanders has fallen on tough times in the Democratic primary, watching former Vice President Joseph R. Biden rocket past him, both in terms of state wins and the chase for delegates. Mr. Biden is poised for another big night Tuesday as voters in Arizona, Florida and Illinois vote in the Democratic primary — all states where Mr. Sanders trails badly in polling. Ohio is also slated to hold its primary, though the governor petitioned a court Monday for a postponement amid coronavirus fears. Analysts said it’s not that primary voters are rejecting Mr. Sanders‘ ideas, but they have a different goal in mind right now than policies like Medicare for All. “There is a great concern among Democrats about ensuring that Donald Trump is a one-term president and I think the Democratic establishment, and the media, has done a good job educating voters that if your goal is to beat Trump, Sanders is the candidate who is probably the least likely to help you achieve that goal,” said Mark P. Jones, political science professor at Rice University in Houston. Even voters who might agree with Mr. Sanders on policy see him as a tougher candidate for the party to sell to the nation. “That is certainly the case in Texas, where even many very progressive Democrats view Sanders as a nightmare for their broader goals of turning Texas purple, flipping the Texas House, having a seat at the redistricting table in 2021 and removing Donald Trump from The White House,” Mr. Jones said. It’s apparently the case in places like Michigan, where Mr. Sanders won the 2016 primary by scoring big in rural areas and overcoming Mrs. Clinton’s lead in Detroit. For liberal activists, that was proof that white working class voters were more excited about rallying behind the Sanders‘ revolution than they were in getting behind Mrs. Clinton’s more “moderate” vision. Last week, though, Mr. Biden easily carried the state — including the rural areas. “Bernie was making the fatal assumption that all of the 40 something percent of the vote that he got in the [2016] primary was favorable to his brand of progressivism,” said John Couvillon, a pollster. “I think the bigger question was how much of that was a visceral reaction to Hillary Clinton because what happened in Michigan didn’t just end in the primary. It continued on to the general election when Donald Trump upset Hillary Clinton there.” Mr. Sanders 2020 rejection in Michigan came even though 57% of primary voters told exit polling they backed Mr. Sanders‘ marquee idea of a “Medicare for All” government-run health care system. That also was true in states from Mississippi to Maine, where strong majorities said they liked Medicare for All — but rejected Mr. Sanders in favor of Mr. Biden. Nina Turner, national co-chair for the Sanders‘ campaign, described the trend as “the damnedest thing.” “It really doesn’t make sense. The world is really upside down,” Ms. Turner said. “The senator worked so hard for what four years ago seemed like it was impossible — for his vision for this country to be in the mainstream. And now his vision for the country is mainstream, and people are voting the other way.” “The forces of the status quo have been effective in portraying the two-term vice president as a pillar and really villainizing the senator,” she said. Meanwhile, Neil Sroka, spokesman for the progressive PAC Democracy for America, agreed that Mr. Sanders‘ benefited from running against Mrs. Clinton, but disagreed with the notion that his camp learned the wrong lessons of 2016. “No, we read it right,” Mr. Sroka said. “What has become clear is that, because of the media environment and because of elite opinion, a lot of voters have voted in this race as pundits, most have put punditry ahead of passion and ultimately made a decision essentially rooted in fear of re-electing Donald Trump more than in their preferred vision of the future.” On the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders acknowledges he’s losing the electability debate, even as he says he’s won on the ideas. “I cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said, ‘I like what your campaign stands for, I agree with what your campaign stands for, but I am going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,’” Mr. Sanders said at a press conference in Vermont last week. “We have heard that statement all over the country.” “Needless to say, I disagree with that assertion,” he said. He says that to beat Mr. Trump, the Democratic nominee must tap into new voters, reaching record turnout. He predicted that would happen in the primaries — but to a large extent, it has not. While Mr. Sanders has outperformed Mr. Biden among younger voters, they’ve not surged in turnout, according to exit polling. In just one state, Iowa, have they accounted for a larger share of the Democratic primary vote than they did in 2016. Meanwhile, 11 of the states where exit polling was conducted have seen a spike in the percentage of older people that turned out. That has been good news for Mr. Biden, who has been far and away the top choice of greying voters.

"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on China’s Communist Party to halt disinformation spread by propaganda outlets claiming the novel coronavirus was first spread in China by the U.S. Army. Mr. Pompeo made the comments in a phone call Monday to Yang Jiechi, director of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the Communist Party of China. The secretary “conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,” according to a statement issued by the State Department. “The secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat.” Mr. Yang, according to state-run Chinese television, told Mr. Pompeo that any attempt to smear China for its efforts to counter the coronavirus “will not succeed,” Reuters reported. The Chinese senior diplomat also threatened unspecified retaliation about what he said were efforts by U.S. politicians to denigrate China’s efforts to fight the virus. The exchange is the latest in Washington and Beijing’s growing war of words about the virus. White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien had harsh criticism in remarks last week to The Heritage Foundation for China’s early handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Mr. O’Brien said that instead of using best practices for handling new diseases, “this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up.” Doctors who sought to disclose the virus were imprisoned or silenced, he added. “It probably cost the world community two months to respond, and those two months … could have dramatically curtailed what happened in China and what is now happening across the world,” he said. First hints of disinformation Zhong Nanshan, a senior Chinese government scientist, first hinted in a late February press conference that the virus may not have originated in China. Last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian promoted the conspiracy theory on Twitter by saying the virus was brought to China by the U.S. Army. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” Mr. Zhao tweeted. He urged people to read an article in a Canadian publication known for spreading Russian disinformation that claimed the Army had spread the virus in China. “Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” China’s ambassador to South Africa retweeted the post and called it “more evidence” that the virus was “not so-called ‘made in China.’” Some U.S. lawmakers have urged the Trump administration to launch a more aggressive campaign to counter Beijing’s narrative. Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, denounced what he called a “shameless new chapter in China’s cynical campaign to control its own image.” “America has worked to assist all countries — China very much included — suffering from this pandemic,” he said in an op-ed on Breitbart.com. “But we cannot stand by as Beijing’s lies result in economic decline and in lives threatened across the world.” Chinese officials initially said the virus originated from a wild food market in Wuhan. However, some of the first people who contracted the flulike disease were not associated with the Wuhan seafood market that was thought to be the source. Health researchers believe the virus originated in bats, jumped to another wild animal and then spread to humans. Wuhan, however, is the location of China’s sole high-security biological research lab that is known to study coronaviruses, leading to speculation that the virus may have escaped from the laboratory through an infected worker or a lab animal sold to the market. Uneven response Prior to Mr. Pompeo’s statement, the State Department privately dressed down Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai over suspected disinformation efforts related to the pandemic. David Stillwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs delivered a diplomatic protest Friday, and Mr. Cui was later shown leaving the department in a video that went viral. President Trump, who has said the pandemic was caused by a “foreign virus,” has also sought to play down the controversy. He told reporters, “I did read one article, but I don’t think that article was representative — certainly not of my conversations with President Xi — and they know where it came from. We all know where it came from.” Lea Gabrielle, director of the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which is charged with countering foreign disinformation, told The Washington Times on Sunday that the Chinese are “engaged in an all-out aggressive campaign to try to reshape the global narrative around the coronavirus, essentially to the degree of trying to provide an alternate reality of what has actually happened since December.” She offered no specifics but said China’s propaganda efforts have “caused us to have to react with a full-spectrum activation of our own public messaging and diplomatic engagement, and really just having to push access to fact-based information by our own communicators so they’re able to counter these false narratives with local audiences.” Michael Pillsbury, a China analyst with the Hudson Institute and unofficial adviser to President Trump, said the Chinese were using disinformation techniques learned from the Soviet Union during the Cold War, including a false report uncovered by U.S. officials claiming that the U.S. Army created AIDS, he said. “There’s a social science theory that if you get your story out first, you get that first impression,” Mr. Pillsbury said on Fox News. “That’s what the Chinese seem to be doing.” Mr. Pillsbury said China is also pushing the argument that it is “racist” to call the coronavirus the Chinese virus or the Wuhan virus. “They’ve also gone further by telling stories that there were American soldiers [in China] for a competition, creating doubt about our motives,” Mr. Pillsbury said. Spotlight on China Christian Whiton is a former U.S. government official who has studied the use of foreign disinformation. “I can understand why Secretary Pompeo doesn’t want to get in a tit for tat with a mere Foreign Ministry spokesman, but we’re missing a great opportunity to spotlight China’s lies and force people to ask why they are resorting to disinformation, and what that says about the stability of Xi Jinping’s government,” Mr. Whiton said. Retired Navy Capt. Jim Fanell, a former Pacific Fleet intelligence director, said Chinese state-run media are continuing to spread the disinformation on a U.S.-origin of the virus. “The demarche appears to have had no impact given the several articles used today from PRC state-sponsored press organs that continue to spout this lie,” he said. “Our public diplomacy, which never recovered from the elimination of the U.S. Information Agency after the Cold War, is still a confused mess,” he said. “It brings to mind a quote by David Lloyd George about the intelligence bureaucracy: ‘It appears in the budget at quite a substantial figure, but when it comes to information it is not visible.’” Rich Higgins, a former National Security Council staff member in charge of strategic communication, said the entire global pandemic is the result of the Chinese Communist Party’s effort to cover up the initial outbreak and refuse to allow outside specialists into the country. “The U.S. government needs to expose and reinforce the [Communist Party‘s] culpability in the current situation to the American public, the Chinese people and the international community,” Mr. Higgins said. “In addition, the U.S. government needs to specifically call out the media interests in the United States that are busily parroting CCP talking points during this crisis.”  ",'Alternate reality': U.S. demands China halt coronavirus 'disinformation',"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/us-demands-china-halt-coronavirus-propaganda/,washington_times
"NEW YORK (AP) - A Florida man charged with conspiring with associates of Rudy Giuliani to make illegal campaign contributions claims prosecutors shouldn’t get to use electronics he mailed to lawyers in the case against him, but prosecutors disagreed Monday. Prosecutors said in papers filed in Manhattan federal court that they legally obtained a hard-copy notebook and electronic devices belonging to David Correia last October. They said Correia tried to mail them to his lawyers before flying to New York to surrender, apparently to avoid having them seized when he was arrested. Prosecutors obtained a warrant for the package and seized it, according to a letter prosecutors sent to Judge J. Paul Oetken. Correia’s claim that the materials are protected by attorney-client privilege is meritless, prosecutors said. They noted that a separate “filter team” of prosecutors supervised by senior prosecutors not handling the case were reviewing the materials to separate anything that was privileged. Correia, of West Palm Beach, Florida, has pleaded not guilty. He’s among four men charged with arranging illegal contributions to politicians to aid their political and business interests. Prosecutors said Correia was involved in a scheme to make illegal campaign donations to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada and other states in an attempt to get support for a new recreational marijuana business. Two other men charged in the case, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, worked with Giuliani to try and get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Democrat Joe Biden. They have both pleaded not guilty to charges. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who has served as a legal adviser to President Donald Trump, has said he had no knowledge of illegal donations and hadn’t seen any evidence that Parnas and Fruman did anything wrong. The judge, at the request of prosecutors, ordered defense lawyers to make any claims to block use of the electronic evidence by March 23. A message left with Correia’s lawyer for comment was not immediately returned.

"EL PASO, Texas (AP) - U.S. immigration courts sharply scaled back operations Monday but have stopped well short of a total shutdown demanded by employees, including judges and government attorneys. Wearing face masks, about 30 asylum seekers who had been waiting in Mexico were escorted by authorities into a federal building in El Paso, Texas, some carrying children.  They reported, as instructed, to a border crossing at 4 a.m. Monday and were driven to the court in white vans. Journalists were barred from the courtroom on the grounds that it was too crowded. A lawyer who attended said the judge appeared by video conference, and few, if any migrants wore masks once the hearing began.  “All of the benches are taken up,” Imelda Maynard said. “Most of the children are asleep in their parent’s arms.” The Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review late Sunday postponed preliminary hearings for people who aren’t in custody through April 10. While significant, the order doesn’t extend to courts in immigration detention centers or to the government’s “Migrant Protection Protocols” policy to make asylum seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in the U.S. It also didn’t apply to final hearings which determine whether migrants are granted asylum. The announcement came hours after judges and attorneys called for all courts to close for two to four weeks. “The (Justice Department) is failing to meet its obligations to ensure a safe and healthy environment within our Immigration Courts,” read a joint statement by the National Association of Immigration Judges, the American Immigration Lawyers Association and the American Federation of Government Employees Local 511, which represents Homeland Security Department attorneys.  Some asylum-seekers in the program known informally as “Remain in Mexico” live in squalid conditions outside in the Mexican border city of Matamoros. Others live in crowded migrant shelters in Mexico. The number of people on a typical day in immigration court exceeds 50, said Elise Wilkinson, a Houston-area immigration attorney. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday recommended  that the public avoid gatherings larger than 10 people over the next 15 days.  The judge’s union pressed Monday for additional action.  Judge Samuel Cole, speaking in his capacity as union spokesman, faulted lack of planning for “the current disaster of mismanagement and ad hoc decisions.”  “It is indefensible how they have placed people’s lives in danger,” he said. Of the decision to stick with “Remain in Mexico” hearings, the judges union said on Twitter, “The risks are simply too high.”  ___ Associated Press writers Nomaan Merchant in Houston and Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report.

"President Trump suggested Monday that he’d be open to making some changes to the House-passed coronavirus bill. “They’re [the Senate] working to only enhance it and make it better and make it fair for everybody,” he said. “We may go back and forth a bit with the House on it but both will be in a very positive fashion.” The bill still needs to be passed with some technical changes in the House on Monday before it even reaches the Senate — though attempting to pass the updates with a unanimous consent rule can be derailed by just one member. After a feverish 48 hours of negotiations, just after midnight on Saturday, the House passed a massive relief package to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers. It mandated free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone that does if they’re at a company with less than 500 employees. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, who helped craft the White House-approved package with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on Sunday acknowledged there were technical changes that needed to be made before it even reached the Senate. He said he was speaking with senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, on Saturday about the bill. “We are hearing feedback that certain small businesses are concerned about the burden of this,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “I think there’s a lot of bipartisan support. We hope they pass this bill. If not, we’ll work with the center on whatever minor changes we need.”  ",Trump floats changes to House coronavirus bill,"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/donald-trump-floats-house-coronavirus-bill-changes/,washington_times
"President Trump implored Americans Monday to avoid groups of 10 or more and enjoy takeout instead of stepping foot in restaurants, bars and food courts for the next 15 days, as the U.S. tries to avoid the fate of China or Italy in the fight against the coronavirus. His guidelines, which rely on public cooperation, say Americans should avoid discretionary travel and stay home if they are sick. Mr. Trump also wants everyone to learn or work at home, where possible, to disrupt chains of transmission. “We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it,” Mr. Trump said. It’s a sudden shift in tone from Mr. Trump, who in late February predicted the U.S. would tackle all of its cases swiftly. He now says the outbreak may last well into the summer. The White House guidelines are stiffer than ones the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released less than 24 hours earlier and come as governors and mayors enforce mandatory rules, such as shuttering schools, delaying primary voting and ordering restaurants, gyms and theaters to close outright. San Francisco and six area counties took the most stringent measures to date, saying residents can only leave home for necessities for the next three weeks, starting Tuesday. The lockdown applies to San Francisco, Marin, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa counties and the city of Berkeley. The federal, state and local moves reflect a more urgent phase in the fight against the coronavirus that’s sickened more than 4,000 in the U.S. and killed over 70, although nationwide testing is just getting started. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It infected tens of thousands in the surrounding Hubei Province before the epidemic shifted to other nations. It’s now spreading on six continents, particularly Europe. Authorities in Italy and Spain have locked down their entire populations, except for trips to work or grocery stores. France joined them on Monday. “We are at war,” French President Emmanuel Macron told the nation. Mr. Trump said he is not considering a nationwide lockdown because parts of the country aren’t seeing widespread transmission. “At this point, they shouldn’t worry,” Mr. Trump said. “We may look at certain areas, certain hotspots. We’ll be looking at that.” Mr. Trump said parts of New York, notably the suburb of New Rochelle, should be “tamped down even more” after Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, ordered a mile-wide lockdown in the town because of rapid transmission. Earlier Monday, Mr. Cuomo suggested the administration was at fault for not being explicit about quarantine measures. He said a patchwork of state-by-state rules is unworkable. “If the federal government isn’t going to do what it should do, then the states have to try their best,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference in Albany. He also called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to step in and retrofit buildings like college dorms and surplus property to function as hospitals in his state. He said there are 50,000 hospital beds and 3,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds in New York, and they might be overwhelmed. “You look at any of these projections and you see that coming,” he told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Mr. Trump said he told governors Monday to get things like ventilators through their own supply chains if they can get them faster than the federal government. In some ways, the press conference marked a pivot for Mr. Trump, as he highlighted health measures and the virus itself, instead of the financial fallout and Wall Street. He said markets would take care of themselves, and that airlines losing revenue would be taken care of at a later date. “We have an invisible enemy, we have a problem a month ago nobody thought about,” Mr. Trump said. “This is a bad one. This is bad in the sense of it’s so contagious. Sort of record-setting type contagion. My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything will fall into place.” Yet Mr. Trump continued to buck responsibility for hiccups in the response. He said he’d rate his efforts “a 10,” though a lack of testing has been an embarrassing blind spot in the U.S. response. Administration officials said they are entering a “new phase” of testing that taps commercial labs and makes it more available, with some areas opening drive-through service. The World Health Organization on Monday said testing is one of the most critical parts of the fight. “The most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate,” WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said. “You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.” The U.S. made progress in another critical area Monday — the race for a vaccine to the new coronavirus. The National Institutes of Health said it administered an investigational vaccine to a person as it kickstarts a phase-one trial at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. Scientists plan to enroll 45 healthy adults ages 18 to 55 and try out various dosages of the vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1273. It was developed by scientists at the infectious-disease arm of the National Institutes of Health and biotech company Moderna, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with [the new coronavirus] is an urgent public health priority,” said Anthony S. Fauci, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.” The vaccine model uses what’s known as messenger RNA and has shown promise in animal studies, but hasn’t been used on humans. This trial will test various dosages of the investigation vaccine. There is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19, and scientists say it could take a year to a year and a half before there is a shot for widespread use. While the world waits for an antidote, officials are imploring Americans to disrupt the spread of the disease through “social distancing,” in which people stay home when possible or six feet apart in public. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pushed to delay in-person voting from Tuesday to early June, saying it couldn’t in good conscience expose poll workers or invite crowds to its primary election. “I’m making this recommendation because we must also look out for our poll workers,” the Republican tweeted. “I believe when we look back on this, we’ll be happy we did this. The votes that have already been cast will still be counted — and this recommendation would allow others to vote in the future.” Governors across the northeast, meanwhile, decided to temporarily shutter bars, theaters and other public places late Monday, saying a lack of federal direction and public indifference to local transmission gave them no choice. Mr. Hogan defended his sweeping measures, saying he couldn’t afford to wait. “While these measures may seem extreme, if we do not take them now, it could be too late,” the governor said. Cancellations also rolled across official Washington on Monday. First lady Melania Trump said Monday she decided to scrap the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on April 13 out of an “abundance of caution.” “The health and safety of all Americans must be the first priority, especially right now,” Mrs. Trump said. “I deeply regret this cancellation, but we need to make difficult decisions in the short-term to ensure a healthy country for the long-term.” The Supreme Court announced Monday it would postpone its next sitting for oral arguments due to the COVID-19 spread, saying it would look at the calendar to reschedule at a later time. The court was expected to hear cases from March 23 through April 1 but decided to put off the challenges for now. “The Court will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances,” a spokesperson announced in a press release. Some of the most eyed cases that were scheduled during that period were disputes over Congress’s authority to subpoena banking documents and other private financial records from Mr. Trump’s businesses, as well as a challenge over the validity of a subpoena out of New York to obtain the president’s tax returns. The justices were also set to hear a case involving Google, which weighs the issue of copyright protection. There was also a First Amendment dispute scheduled to be argued involving employment discrimination cases brought against religious employers. Moving the hearings is quite rare, though it has happened in the past. The court postponed arguments in 1918 during the Spanish flu epidemic. The press release also noted calendars at the court were changed in August 1793 and in 1798 over yellow fever. • Alex Swoyer contributed to this report.

"Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said late Monday that the state department of health will order polls to be closed on Tuesday as a “health emergency,” hours after a judge declined to delay the state’s March 17 presidential primary at the behest of Mr. DeWine. Mr. DeWine, a Republican, said that to conduct an election Tuesday would force poll workers and voters to place themselves “at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus.” He tweeted that Dr. Amy Acton, who heads the Ohio Department of Health, “will order the polls closed as a health emergency.” “While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State @FrankLaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,” Mr. DeWine said. Dr. Acton signed a three-page order saying that all polling locations in the state would be closed “to avoid an imminent threat with a high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19 with a significant risk of substantial harm to a large number of people in the general population.” The order said she had authority under Ohio code to “make special orders…for preventing the spread of contagious or infectious diseases.” The action came hours after Franklin County Judge Richard Frye denied a motion to push in-person voting to June 2 amid concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, saying such a move could set a terrible precedent. After the ruling, Mr. DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a joint statement saying that given the circumstances, “it simply isn’t possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by Ohioans.” “They mustn’t be forced to choose between their health and exercising their constitutional rights,” the statement said. Earlier in the day, Judge Frye had said that decision wasn’t his to make, saying he was “very reluctant” to “say well, we’ll have a judge in Columbus rewrite the election code, reset the election for some arbitrary date in the future and upset the apple cart in a terrible precedent.” Mr. DeWine spoke as voters in Ohio, Arizona, Florida, and Illinois were preparing to head to the polls to cast their ballots in a race that has been upended by concerns over the coronavirus that is changing the daily lives of millions of Americans. President Trump, who said on Monday that Americans should avoid gatherings of more than 10 people for the next 15 days as part of the coronavirus response, said postponing elections is a state matter but that he generally isn’t a fan. “I think postponing elections is not a very good thing,” Mr. Trump said. “They have lots of room in a lot of the electoral places. … I think postponing is unnecessary.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday that elections can be done in a way that protects people. “We’ve limited access to the assisted living facilities in some of the areas where we may have vulnerable folks,” Mr. DeSantis said. “But at the same time, when you go and cancel that, the signal that that sends is somehow we’re paralyzed. And I don’t think that’s the case. I think we’re taking prudent steps.” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said Monday that officials understand voters might be apprehensive, but the election would proceed as planned. “This decision was not made lightly, and what it all comes down to is — that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,” Ms. Hobbs said. “The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this will become.” A spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections likewise said the state primary was proceeding as planned, saying the elections team has been working with public health officials and has made every effort to keep voters up to date on polling place location changes. Dan Kovats, executive director of the Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association, said Illinois has done a good job encouraging early voting and voting by mail over the last few cycles. “I believe we will have everything in place to ensure a legitimate primary election,” Mr. Kovats said. He said his group, in concert with the state Democratic Party, launched a large-scale texting program Monday morning to inform voters of changes in their polling locations and that he thought more than 300 precincts have had such changes. Officials in all four states already had been struggling to convince poll workers to show up and grappling with polling locations getting cut back or changed amid the escalating outbreak. Before Mr. Trump’s announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had issued guidance late Sunday recommending that the public avoid gatherings of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. In Florida, some local officials had already said they were short of where they wanted to be in terms of attracting enough workers to man the polls Tuesday in light of COVID-19. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, Florida Democrat, said Monday the state should have followed Ohio’s lead and pushed back its Tuesday election as well. “We need to protect the rights of all our citizens to safely have their voices heard,” Ms. Mucarsel-Powell tweeted, as she also expressed concern about reports of a lack of mail ballots in South Dade County. In Arizona, Maricopa County was planning to close dozens of polling locations because of COVID-19. “The closure of many polling places due to COVID-19 means it is uncertain how many voters who planned to vote on Tuesday will actually show up,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday his state will push its primary from May 19 to June 23, become the latest state leader to announce such a change. Louisiana and Georgia have already postponed their primaries that had been scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, and the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico said it was going to push for a delay in its March 29 primary.

"Stocks plunged again on Monday to wipe out nearly all of the three-year-long Trump rally, while U.S. airlines reeling from the coronavirus pandemic asked for $50 billion in federal aid and the White House weighed an economic rescue plan that is likely to top $800 billion. President Trump conceded the U.S. could be headed into a recession, but he predicted the markets would surge once the crisis subsides. “It may be,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re not thinking in terms of recession. We’re thinking in terms of the virus.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 2,997 points, or 12.9%, to close at 20,188. It was the Dow’s single biggest point drop in history. That’s more than 30% off its high just last month of 29,568. When Mr. Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, the Dow stood at 19,827. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 12.3%, while the S&P 500 was down 11.9%. Stocks fell so rapidly at the opening bell that the drop triggered an automatic temporary halt in operations for the third time in the past six trading days. The massive market losses, worst on a percentage basis since 1987, came despite the Federal Reserve’s emergency actions on Sunday to lower interest rates and pump more money into the economy to combat the impact of the coronavirus. The Fed on Sunday slashed interest rates by a full percentage point to zero, and said it would buy $700 billion in Treasury securities in a massive emergency move to protect the U.S. economy from the pandemic. Analysts increasingly are predicting a recession.

"Ronald Klain, an adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s presidential campaign, on Tuesday questioned Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s move to order the polls closed in his state’s presidential primary contest. Mr. Klain did compliment Mr. DeWine for his efforts on responding to the coronavirus outbreak, saying he’s been one of the “leading governors” and that it’s not a partisan issue. “[I’m] a little worried that this was done in defiance of a court order and that the state didn’t pursue this through the courts as it should have,” Mr. Klain, who coordinated the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak, said on CNN’s “New Day.” “I understand why Gov. DeWine did what he did, but I think we can have both public health and democracy,” Mr. Klain said. “I just think we have to make sure we’re doing these things the right way,” he continued. “The fact that the court ordered him not to do this, and he didn’t appeal that order [was] a little concerning.” Mr. DeWine said late Monday that Amy Acton, who heads the Ohio Department of Health, was ordering the polls closed as part of a health emergency. That announcement came after Franklin County Judge Richard Frye had turned aside a request to delay in-person voting in the March 17 primary at the behest of Mr. DeWine. The governor had acknowledged earlier in the day that he couldn’t unilaterally move the election and that he hoped for a favorable ruling from a judge. Dr. Acton’s order said she had authority under state code to “make special orders … for preventing the spread of contagious or infectious diseases.” Mr. Biden has been comfortably leading Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont in public polling on Ohio, as well as in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Those three states are pressing forward with their presidential primaries on Tuesday. A delay in voting in Ohio, coupled with the news that states like Georgia and Louisiana have postponed their primaries that were supposed to happen in the coming weeks, adds additional uncertainty to a race Mr. Biden is leading. The developments could give Mr. Sanders an incentive to hang around in the race longer than he might otherwise. After Sunday’s debate, Mr. Sanders said it was a valid question as to whether Tuesday’s primaries should be postponed. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people, doing all that stuff,” Mr. Sanders said on CNN. “Does that make a lot of sense? [I’m] not sure that it does.”  ","Ronald Klain, Joe Biden's campaign adviser, questions Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine's move to close polls"," -

"The Ohio Supreme Court overnight Tuesday turned aside a challenge that sought to keep some polls open for the state’s March 17 elections, after the state’s director of public health ordered them closed in light of the coronavirus outbreak. The complaint was filed on behalf of Corey Speweik, who is running for a seat on the Wood County Court of Common Pleas. It argues that changing the primary date would violate the “bedrock separation of powers” in the state constitution and that it would cause “chaos” for independent candidates. The decision, agreed to by four of the seven justices, simply read “writ denied.” Mr. Speweik had tried to get the court to compel Secretary of State Frank LaRose to hold the Wood County primary on March 17. In response, lawyers for the state said Mr. LaRose has no “clear legal duty” to heed the request and pointed out that Amy Acton, who heads the Ohio Department of Health, issued an order requiring that polls be closed on March 17. “The Secretary will not violate a clear legal duty by complying with an order from Ohio’s Health Director during a pandemic,” they said. Gov. Mike DeWine said late Monday that the polls would be closed due to a “health emergency,” capping a madcap day after a Franklin County judge had denied a request to push back in-person voting in Ohio just hours earlier. The complaint had cited comments from Mr. DeWine and Mr. LaRose at a Monday press conference where they had pushed for a delay in in-person voting. Those comments came before Franklin County Judge Richard Frye’s ruling and before Dr. Acton ordered the polls closed late Monday. Mr. DeWine and Mr. LaRose said people shouldn’t be forced to choose between protecting their health and exercising their constitutional right to vote in light of the expanding coronavirus epidemic. “It was simply untenable for us to continue telling Ohioans to go to the polls,” Mr. LaRose said Tuesday on CNN’s “New Day.” Mr. LaRose issued a directive to county boards of elections saying that the presidential primary is suspended until June 2. The directive says that boards of elections are to remain open on March 17 through 7:30 p.m. to receive any absentee ballots, but that they’re prohibited from tabulating and reporting any results until the close of polls on June 2. Asked what happens if things aren’t better by June 2, Mr. LaRose said: “That’s a bridge we’ll have to cross when we get to it.” Three other states are proceeding with their presidential primaries on Tuesday: Arizona, Florida and Illinois.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. Senate has voted to extend, rather than tweak, three surveillance powers that federal law enforcement officials use to fight terrorists, passing the bill back to an absent House and throwing the future of the authorities in doubt.  The 75-day extension pushes off the debate over the surveillance tools as Congress attempts to deal with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. It is unclear whether the House will accept the temporary extension of the surveillance powers, which lapsed on Sunday. The House last week passed a compromise bill negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy that would renew the authorities and impose new restrictions. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed the measure, but longtime skeptics of the surveillance tools in the Senate blocked a quick passage.  The House legislation would update the three expiring surveillance provisions, including one that permits the FBI to obtain court orders to collect business records on subjects in national security investigations. Another, known as the “roving wiretap” provision, permits surveillance on subjects even after they’ve changed phones. The third allows agents to monitor subjects who don’t have ties to international terrorism organizations.  The legislation would scale back some current authorities, such as the government’s access to certain records. It would also attempt to put stronger checks on some surveillance measures and make the process more transparent.  The compromise reflects angst in both major political parties about the way the surveillance powers have been used, but also a reluctance to strip those powers from the government’s arsenal. Republicans and Democrats in the House broadly agreed that they did not want civil liberties sacrificed in efforts to thwart terrorism and other crimes.  It is unclear whether the House will vote on the Senate extension, which would make no changes to the authorities during the 75 days. A Democratic aide said that House leadership was discussing how to move forward, as the House is on recess and has no set date for returning.  The Senate passed the extension by voice vote Monday after days of negotiations between McConnell and Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. The chamber had originally been scheduled to take a procedural vote to move forward on the House legislation, a step that would have set up final passage for later in the week. It’s not clear whether McConnell had enough votes for the House bill to pass.  McConnell said Monday evening that the Senate would eventually consider the House bill and several amendments, conceding to the demands from the three senators. The amendments would impose restrictions beyond the House bill on the government’s ability to surveil and gather information on Americans.  Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., speaking on the floor for McConnell, objected to that same deal last week, saying the Senate should pass the House bill. But there appeared to be more urgency to put off the surveillance issue Monday as coronavirus cases spiked in the United States and the economic damage mounted.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin is expected to meet with Senate Republicans Tuesday to discuss an $850 billion coronavirus relief package including aid for hard-hit industries. White House aides say the package could include more than $50 billion for airlines, about $500 billion in payroll tax cuts and $250 billion or more in Small Business Administration loans. The U.S. airline industry said it has lost about one million passengers in the first two weeks of March alone, compared with the same period a year ago. President Trump said Monday the pandemic, which has closed many businesses and schools across the country, could push the nation into a recession. The stock market suffered huge losses Monday, falling more than 12% to wipe out nearly all the gains since Mr. Trump was inaugurated. Markets were up slightly in early trading Tuesday.

"A spokesman for Sen. Bernard Sanders’ presidential campaign on Tuesday said that going to the polls in primaries amid the coronavirus outbreak is a “personal” choice and that they will respect the decisions of the public either way. The campaign is not doing traditional “get out the vote” outreach in states holding primary contests on Tuesday, said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca. “We are making clear to voters that we believe going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision, and we respect whichever choice they make,” Mr. Casca said. Ohio officials late Monday blew past a court order and ordered the polls closed on Tuesday, with plans to delay in-person voting until June 2 in light of the health risks the coronavirus is posing. Arizona, Florida and Illinois, meanwhile, are proceeding with their presidential primary contests on Tuesday, though officials are dealing with polling site closures and relocations because of COVID-19. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said there’s no guarantee that there would be a safer time to hold the election in the near future. “The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this will become,” she said on Monday. Mr. Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden have adjusted by pivoting to virtual events in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Biden is expected to increase his delegate lead over Mr. Sanders after Tuesday’s primaries, though other states have already moved to postpone their own contests as well, adding a dose of uncertainty to the contest.

"Yankton Daily Press & Dakotan, March 16 Proactive steps to combat COVID-19 Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. And that’s certainly what we are seeing and enduring as America and the world ramp up their response to the COVID-19 coronavirus that’s racing across the planet. The situation has been months in the making, and some countries have prepared relatively better than others. America is now working overtime in a feverish hope to catch up and minimize the damage as much as possible. We are seeing drastic steps that are literally touching every aspect of life across the country, across South Dakota and Nebraska, and in Yankton and every community in the region. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has called off school for the coming week (at least), and the Board of Regents did the same for state universities. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts on Friday mentioned the possibility of closing schools in that state for 6-8 weeks, if necessary. Indeed, events are being postponed or canceled in wholesale terms, from small local meetings to entire professional sports leagues and the NCAA “March Madness” college basketball tournaments. The NAIA basketball tournaments in Sioux Falls (for the men) and Sioux City (women) were canceled outright after the first day of action. The South Dakota Class B girls’ basketball tournament in Spearfish was postponed after the first round, and this coming weekend’s tournaments have also been postponed. Church service schedules are being altered. Even funerals are being delayed until the situation looks better. These are dramatic steps. But they are also important steps. They are strongly proactive in an attempt to slow the spread of the contagion, to protect as many people as possible and to avoid a crushing onslaught of patients on medical facilities, which would impact all medical care, even for non-COVID-19 patients. It’s part of what’s called “flattening the curve.” Much of it falls under the label of “social distancing,” which is actually not a new concept at all - just one expanded to societal terms. This purpose is to create isolation and separation to slow the spread of the virus. In spirit, it’s quite sensible. But in implementation, it is radical and will have a serious impact in other areas for some time to come. This is going to take a serious financial toll on a number of fronts, and states, cities and businesses must face those formidable battles. For instance, the cancellation of sporting events, which may seem minor to some people, will have major consequences on the cities and states that host these events, the vendors and other workers who make their livings from those events and so on. In effect, our nation is being asked to step back from its normal routines, and this will be tough for many people. It’s forcing us to re-think some things we do, in terms big and small. The consequences, either way you look at it, will be difficult. The debate over how we got here will be an important one, but the decisions we make in regard to what we do now are the most pressing. The government needs to do what it needs to do. And each of us needs to do what we must for the general good and health for both ourselves and those we know and love. It’s a battle we WILL ultimately win - and as was pointed out during a press conference of Yankton’s COVID-19 task force last week, if we fight this fight well enough, it will seem like we overreacted. So be it. Let’s make the fight worth it. ___ Madison Daily Leader, March 10 Government works better when open to citizens This week (March 15-21) marks the 15th Sunshine Week, a time to stress the importance of open government policies at all levels. The terms “Sunshine” suggests opening up government to the light of day. Sunshine Week started after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on America, when there was a rush to close off government information to the public. Tim Franklin, associate dean of the journalism school at Northwestern University, said the shutting down of access to public records and public meetings was based on the “misguided, and sometimes cynical, notion that Americans are safer the less they know about what the government is doing in their name and with their money.” That sounds a bit harsh, but we’re surprised how often we hear a phrase like “we don’t want the public to know this,” or “the public won’t understand this if we tell them.” At worst, we’ve heard “let’s not tell the public because it might cause a panic.” That’s what happened just recently in some countries with the coronavirus outbreak. Not surprisingly, we believe instead in the public’s right to know. A government “of the people” is not a private business owned by someone. Local governments are owned by citizens/taxpayers. We elect officials to conduct our business, but they still report to us as citizens. We deserve to have input into their decisions, open discussion about their decisions, and a permanent record of how they spend our money. We deserve to know what is going on in public schools. We want to be in the room when a zoning change is proposed in our neighborhood. We all need to be vigilant in asking for, and insisting on, open records, meetings and discussions. ___ Aberdeen American News, March 14 No more denying the uncertainty of COVID-19 If you’re not acknowledging the problem by now, you are part of the problem. The problem is, of course, COVID-19. And it’s real. There are many questions with unknown answers. And that’s what makes this such a slippery slope. That’s what’s sparking uncertainty and, in some cases, fear. That’s what makes this different from other viruses in the past. We hope, a few weeks or months from now, everything happening - closed schools, canceled events, travel restrictions, the shutdown of sports leagues - will look like wild overreactions. That’s the best-case scenario. But whether we reach that point, it’s too early to tell. In the meantime, here are some and inarguable facts to chew on: - After initially downplaying the COCID-19 outbreak, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency Friday. - That was hours after Gov. Kristi Noem did the same for the state. She wasn’t nearly as stubborn as the president. That said, the decision to kick media members out of a COVID-19 meeting earlier this week did nothing to instill trust. - The NCAA didn’t pull the plug on March Madness and give up hundreds of millions of dollars to make the president look bad. Or to inconvenience you. Nor did the other sports leagues that have paused their seasons act with those motives. Get over that kind of thinking. It’s petty, dangerous and foolish. No, all of these steps - the unprecedented actions - were made for our protection. Protection. Protection. Protection. And that is all. So stop looking for other reasons. That’s why South Dakota schools will be closed next week. That’s why college campuses will be empty next week. That’s why the state basketball tournaments have been postponed. That’s why there’s virtually nothing that’s not vital happening next week. Now it’s for all of us to help. And that’s the easy part. Because it involves some simple steps we’ve been hearing about for weeks: - Wash your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds. (You should have been doing this all along.) - Cover your mouth with your arm or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. - If you don’t feel good, stay home. Work remotely if you can or have to. - And avoid crowds if you are pregnant, older or have a weakened immune system. - Keep high-traffic and high-germ areas clean. - Oh, and don’t hoard toilet paper and sanitizer. Take what you need and leave some for the next shopper. This is not a fun time. It’s stressful and sometimes scary. Nobody is enjoying it. Not the government. Not the media. Not people making difficult decisions. Maybe, months from now, when with a little luck we are all looking back on this moment, we’ll see overreaction. Maybe the pandemic has peaked and it will start to backslide in the days to come. There’s no way to know. And that’s the reason for such drastic action. If we don’t encounter more problems, though, remember this time. Because the tough decisions being made now might be a big reason why.

"Voters like the idea of making legal immigrants pay their own way, and they are also keen on letting people sue sanctuary cities for crimes committed by illegal immigrants — both parts of President Trump’s immigration agenda — according to surprising polling numbers from Harvard University. Nearly four in five voters like the idea of an “immigration halt” with the coronavirus becoming a pandemic. Less popular is the move by a number of Democrat-led states such as New York to issue driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. Only about one-third of voters polled said people in the country without authorization should be allowed to apply for a license. The results of the Harvard Center for American Political Studies/Harris Poll suggest that Mr. Trump’s immigration policies have strong backing among the public at large, even though they are derided as racist or unfair in Washington and among Democratic leaders. “This should definitely be a warning, especially to Biden because he’s going to be the nominee, that going too far left is a real danger for him,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director at the Center for Immigration Studies. “I’m not even sure what he was thinking last night. He’s got the nomination. Why cater to the most radical anti-borders elements in his party?” Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, in a debate Sunday with Sen. Bernard Sanders, his chief opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, proposed shutting down all deportations for 100 days and then deporting only illegal immigrants with further felonies on their records. He also said he will cancel immigration detention for people awaiting court hearings if he wins the White House. He flatly said local police should not cooperate in turning over illegal immigrants to federal immigration authorities. “Xenophobia is a disease,” said Mr. Biden, condemning what he called “this demonization and divisiveness coming from the Trump administration on immigration.” The Harvard/Harris poll found immigration policy to be the second most important issue for voters, behind health care and ahead of terrorism and national security. When it comes to Mr. Trump, 49% said they approved of the president’s handling of immigration. That is at the high range of the past few years, with Harvard/Harris showing approval hovering between 44% and 49%. During his State of the Union address this year, Mr. Trump called for punishing sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal officials by allowing people victimized by illegal immigrants to sue the sanctuaries for damages. That idea earns 55% support, according to Harvard/Harris, though the pollsters asked the question without mentioning that Mr. Trump supports it. The same was true with a question on whether the government should deny green cards to immigrants who are likely to end up on the public dole. The Trump administration this year implemented a rule to do just that, and the Harvard/Harris poll said 60% support it — again, without Mr. Trump’s name attached to it. Immigrant rights activists have labeled that policy racist. They say it will hinder poor migrants from developing nations in Africa trying to achieve the American dream and reward those from richer nations in Europe. Mr. Krikorian said asking without the president’s name meant the pollsters were able to find Americans’ views without any Trump bias. He said there are probably people who would be hawkish on immigration, such as opposing sanctuary cities, though they dislike Mr. Trump. If told the president backed a crackdown, they might have a different answer to the polling question. “Because Trump’s name isn’t on there, people were giving answers based on what they actually thought policy should be rather than what is associated with the president,” he said. The Washington Times reached out to several immigrant rights activists about the numbers. They either didn’t respond or declined to tackle the questions. Mr. Trump has tied immigration to the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis, and the polling suggests Americans agree. A stunning 79% told the pollsters that an “immigration halt” should be imposed if the outbreak grows into a pandemic. On the other side of the ledger, voters resoundingly rejected the idea of issuing driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants, with 65% opposed and just 35% in favor. Immigration activists argue that illegal immigrants are on the roads anyway, and it makes more sense to license them and require them to have insurance. Fourteen states plus the District of Columbia have moved to grant licenses to those in the country without authorization, according to the National Council of State Legislatures. New York became the latest to offer licenses in December with its Green Light law. New Jersey will become the 15th state when its law takes effect in June.

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed on Tuesday not to leave Washington until his chamber has passed a “significant and bold” third coronavirus bill to help the economy weather the spread of the disease. The Kentucky Republican said he was concerned the House’s bipartisan relief bill could cause more harm than good if another supplement fix isn’t passed immediately. “In particular, it seems increasingly clear that the House’s effort to mandate that small businesses provide new worker benefits, just many small businesses themselves are in major jeopardy of their own, might even be actively harmful unless we urgently address a broader package that includes more and broader small business relief,” he said on the Senate floor. On Tuesday, the Trump administration $850 billion coronavirus relief package, which would include aid for hard-hit sectors such as the airline and cruise industries. Talks between Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and Senate Republicans began Monday night and will continue on Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a key ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has a proposal of his own. On Monday, he called for at least $750 billion that would go toward shoring up hospital resources, affordability of coronavirus treatment, fund public transportation and emergency child care, and pause payments on loans immediately. The outline did not include aid for industries the administration wants. Other Republicans are floating ideas as well, aside from the payroll tax the administration has called for. Some, such as Sens. Mitt Romney and Tom Cotton, have suggested giving cash handouts to Americans to help them with bills over the next few weeks. First, the Senate still needs to pass the House’s coronavirus bill that cleared the lower chamber Monday evening. If legislation on a third coronavirus package does move in the Senate, the House will need to reconvene to pass it as early as next week, despite delaying their return from recess in light of the virus.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin is expected to meet with Senate Republicans Tuesday to discuss an $850 billion coronavirus relief package including aid for hard-hit industries. White House aides say the package could include more than $50 billion for airlines, about $500 billion in payroll tax cuts and $250 billion or more in Small Business Administration loans.

"SAN DIEGO (AP) - Family, friends and lawyers of convicted ex-Rep. Duncan Hunter say the California Republican is a devoted father and proud former Marine who should be shown some mercy for making mistakes after returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Prosecutors paint a different picture. They have submitted 87 pages of details to U.S. District Court Judge Thomas J. Whelan ahead of Tuesday’s sentencing that shows a corrupt congressman who intentionally and repeatedly stole from his campaign funds for a decade.  The funds bankrolled private school tuition for his children, his wife’s shopping sprees, weekend trips with his mistress and drinking parties in Washington. A broke and debt-saddled Hunter also cavalierly spent campaign money on small things, such as a tin of chewing tobacco, and a copy of the book, “Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid,” according to prosecutors.  And after he was caught, he ran for reelection and tried to convince voters in the district east of San Diego that as a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, he was the victim of a political witch hunt by left-leaning prosecutors trying to drive him out of office in Democratic California.  A year after winning a sixth term, Hunter pleaded guilty to a single corruption charge. He and his wife, who served as his campaign manager, each faces up to five years in jail. Prosecutors said a 14-month prison sentence is needed to punish a lawmaker who misled his constituents and whose wrongdoing has now left the 50th congressional district without a representative. Hunter resigned from Congress in January. A Democrat and Republican are headed to a November runoff for his seat. “As we now know, Hunter lied to the people about his guilt. Not once, but countless times. In doing so, he conned voters into electing a soon-to-be-convict,” prosecutors wrote in their arguments for the prison term. The Hunters were accused in a 60-count indictment of stealing more than $250,000 in campaign contributions and trying to hide it on financial disclosure records, listing some personal expenses as contributions to wounded warriors. Each pleaded guilty to a single count in separate plea agreements last year.  Defense attorneys say he deserves 11 months in home confinement because of his military and public service. They said he saved thousands of San Diego jobs on the chopping block and helped craft laws to better the lives of veterans.  His parents wrote a letter pointing out his bravery in signing up for the Marine Corps the day after the Sept. 11 attacks, and a Democratic colleague, San Diego Rep. Juan Vargas, penned that “Mr. Hunter needs special counseling and treatment after fighting our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.” Hunter is not the first congressmen accused of the illegal use of campaign money. Prosecutors compared Hunter’s case to that of former Illinois Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr., who got 30 months for stealing $750,000 in campaign funds. Hunter’s defense lawyers compare him to former California Rep. Jay Kim, who was spared prison time in 1998 and sentenced to two months home confinement after he admitted to taking more than $250,000 in illegal campaign contributions.  Hunter’s conviction ended his family’s political dynasty in the 50th congressional district. Hunter won the seat after his father. Hunter L. Duncan, represented the area of suburbs and farm towns for 28 years before retiring.

"A spokesman for Sen. Bernard Sanders’ presidential campaign on Tuesday said that going to the polls in primaries amid the coronavirus outbreak is a “personal” choice and that they will respect the decisions of the public either way. The campaign is not doing traditional “get out the vote” outreach in states holding primary contests on Tuesday, said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca. “We are making clear to voters that we believe going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision, and we respect whichever choice they make,” Mr. Casca said. Ohio officials late Monday blew past a judge’s ruling and ordered the polls closed on Tuesday, with plans to delay in-person voting until June 2 in light of the health risks the coronavirus is posing. Arizona, Florida and Illinois, meanwhile, are proceeding with their presidential primary contests on Tuesday, though officials are dealing with polling site closures and relocations because of COVID-19. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said there’s no guarantee that there would be a safer time to hold the election in the near future. “The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this will become,” she said on Monday. Mr. Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden have adjusted by pivoting to virtual events in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Biden is expected to increase his delegate lead over Mr. Sanders after Tuesday’s primaries, though other states have already moved to postpone their own contests as well, adding a dose of uncertainty to the contest.

"The Republican primary for the Kansas Senate seat has become uglier as Kris Kobach has emerged as the front-runner to succeed retiring Sen. Pat Roberts. The conservative Club for Growth has mounted a new advertising campaign attacking rival candidate Rep. Roger Marshall over his alleged poor treatment of female patients as a doctor. Mr. Kobach, Kansas’ former secretary of state, is a longtime ally of President Trump, but many Republicans are worried he would lose the Senate race, as he lost his gubernatorial bid in 2018. Mr. Kobach held a double-digit percentage point lead on Mr. Marshall, his nearest competitor, in a February McLaughlin & Associates poll. The free-market advocacy group is spending about $33,000 on a print and digital ad campaign accusing Mr. Marshall of “poor treatment of women” as an obstetrician/gynecologist. The anti-Marshall ads ran in several newspapers with large circulations in the state, including the Kansas City Star, Topeka Capital Journal and Wichita Eagle. “Online public reviews of [Mr. Marshall‘s] dealings with patients suggest his treatment of women was not received positively in far too many instances,” the print ad reads above quotations branding the candidate as “arrogant” and “insensitive.” “Are these reports accurate? What’s the truth? What was your — or your loved one’s — experience with Dr. Marshall?” The digital effort includes RogerMarshallTruth.com, which features criticism from women posted anonymously. The Club for Growth is soliciting other women to come forward with negative stories about Mr. Marshall. “Several of Dr. Marshall’s patients have raised important concerns about their treatment while under his care,” David McIntosh, Club for Growth Action president, said in a statement. “We think Kansas voters deserve to hear what these women have said, and if other women have similar stories, we hope they speak out as well.” Mr. Marshall’s campaign said he would ignore the attack ads and focus on talking with Kansans about “real issues.” “Slinging amateur garbage from a D.C. office during a national pandemic isn’t surprising coming from these losers,” said Brent Robertson, Marshall campaign spokesman, in a statement. “While we understand that they have a 2016 campaign grudge, they put the Senate majority at risk by doing the dirty work of fellow loser Kris Kobach.” The group is not the only one attacking Mr. Marshall’s candidacy. Free Forever PAC has spent $70,000 to air ads on Fox News opposing Mr. Marshall, according to the Kansas City Star. The group, which is bankrolled by billionaire Peter Thiel, is also running ads on Facebook criticizing Mr. Marshall as an unreliable supporter of Mr. Trump because of his previous support for former Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s failed 2016 presidential bid. While Mr. Kobach has a reliable supporter in Mr. Thiel, he has far fewer friends in the Republican Party establishment. The Club for Growth is not supporting Mr. Kobach’s bid and has not endorsed a candidate. The National Republican Senatorial Committee said in July that Mr. Kobach’s candidacy would “simultaneously put President Trump’s presidency and [the] Senate majority at risk.” No Democrat has won a Senate seat in Kansas since the 1930s, but the food fight on the right has proven useful for Democrats looking to expand the map of targeted states in November. State Sen. Barbara Bollier, a retired physician, is the Democratic front-runner to compete for the open seat. A former Republican who switched parties and identifies herself a “pragmatic Democrat,” she figures to make health care and the coronavirus crisis a central aspect of the campaign. The Club for Growth declined to say whether it had discussed the race with potential candidates and said its interviews are “confidential.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a former Kansas congressman, has reportedly ruled out running for the seat.

"President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Tuesday they’re strongly considering giving Americans $1,000 each within the next two weeks to help with the impact from the coronavirus. “We’re going big,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. Mr. Mnuchin, who was meeting later with Republican senators, said the administration is quickly coming around to the idea of cutting checks for every American who needs it. “We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately. Americans need cash now,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “I mean now in the next two weeks.” He said the details for qualifying still would need to be worked out with Congress. “We don’t need to send people who make a million dollars a year checks,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The president said he wants to “do something that gets money to them as quickly as possible.” “Obviously some people shouldn’t be getting checks with $1,000,” he said. “We’ll have a pretty good idea by the end of the day how we’re going to do it.” The president has been pushing for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year, but he acknowledged on Tuesday that the impact of such relief would be felt more slowly. “Payroll tax is one way, but it does come over a period of months. We’re going big. It’s a substantial number,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Mnuchin underscored the urgency. “The president has instructed me we have to do this now,” he said. “This is no fault to American workers. For medical reasons, we are shutting down parts of the economy.” He added that other sectors of the economy need help too. “This is worse than 9/11. For the airline industry, they’ve almost ground to a halt,” he said. There are roughly 155 million workers in the U.S.  If every one of them got a check, the cost would be about $155 billion.

"State health officials can now authorize tests for the coronavirus and Medicare patients can confer with any doctor remotely, through “telehealth,” at no additional cost, President Trump said Tuesday, as his administration tries to blunt the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Mr. Trump said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is on standby in case they need to conduct emergency construction. Those operations may include renovations to expand and retrofit existing facilities or setting up smaller mobile field hospitals, or MASH units, to render care. The president said one way or another, the U.S. will declare victory over the pathogen. “One day will be standing up here and say: We won,” Mr. Trump told White House reporters. “Sure as you’re sitting there, we’re going to say that.” So far, the virus and the disease it causes, COVID-19, has sickened more than 4,600 people and killed over 85 people in the country, though testing is just ramping up. Mr. Trump reiterated that he wants people to avoid unnecessary travel and groups of 10 or more for the next two weeks. “We’ll see what happens after that,” Mr. Trump said. “Our country can be rolling again pretty quickly.” Deborah Birx, who is coordinating the federal response, implored younger Americans to stop going out and spreading the virus on doorknobs and countertops, saying they’re putting older Americans at risk. Officials also said mobile testing units are “blossoming” in states across the country, with federal help, Vice President Mike Pence said that as more diagnostics come online, each and every American must act on Mr. Trump’s push for “social distancing.” “You don’t need the results of testing to know what you should do,” Mr. Pence said. Mr. Pence also asked construction companies to donate special N95 respirator masks to local hospitals and forego new orders, so health workers can get the equipment they need. Officials said changes to telehealth rules will allow seniors to get regular checkups without leaving their homes amid the pandemic. “They can talk to their doctor via Skype, and they don’t have to risk exposure to the virus,” said Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Mr. Trump also spoke to restaurant executives by phone Tuesday, reminding them they can “flatten the curve” of transmission by urging customers to use drive-through, pickup or delivery options instead of entering their establishments. The executives agreed. “All of the executives committed their restaurants to this critical guideline and assured the president they fully intend to continue feeding their communities through these other innovative avenues,” White House Deputy press secretary Judd Deere said. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said many eateries use apps that allows for home delivery or quick handoffs. “You can order ahead of time,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “They can give it to you with social distancing, and it’s very fast.” Amazon, meanwhile, said it’s suspending shipments to its warehouses of items other than medical supplies or household staples so it can focus on the supply of things that are needed amid the outbreak. Individual states continued to take action. The San Francisco area faces the most stringent lockdown, with 7 million residents told to limit outings to trips for supplies. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said his state has recorded more than 1,300 cases, the most in the nation, though he rejected rumors that New York City would go into total quarantine. “That is not true,” the Democrat said. “That cannot happen. It cannot happen legally. No city in [the] state can quarantine itself without state approval, and I have no interest whatsoever and no plan whatsoever to quarantine any city.” Mr. Cuomo compared the situation to a tabletop snow globe. “Somebody picked up our country and just shook it,” Mr. Cuomo said. “It is a frightening time on every level. At the same time, it’s this much time,” the governor said, placing his hands slightly apart. “We will get through this much time. Understand what we’re dealing with, understand the pressures that we’re feeling — but we will get through this much time.” Mr. Trump said he had a “constructive” conversation with Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday, despite warring tweets over the past two days. “We’re both doing a really good job,” Mr. Trump said. The president also deferred to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s judgment in putting off his state’s primary election. “He’s definitely somebody who knows what he’s doing,” the president said. Mr. Trump said the best thing the country can do to preserve future elections is to defeat the virus. • David Sherfinski contributed to this report.

"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said a Chinese disinformation campaign around the coronavirus is part of an attempt to shift responsibility for dragging their feet in responding to the outbreak months ago. At the same time, he said the world should be focused on fighting the actual pathogen instead of pointing fingers. “Now is not the time for recrimination,” Mr. Pompeo told reporters. “There will come a day when we will go evaluate how the world responded.” Mr. Pompeo said the Chinese government did, however, have a special responsibility to sound the alarm over the virus after it popped up in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in December. “It took an awful long time for the world to become aware of this risk,” Mr. Pompeo said. America’s top diplomat was responding to claims by Chinese authorities that the coronavirus might have originated in a U.S. military lab.

"HOUSTON (AP) - After being denied U.S. asylum in Texas and returned to a squalid camp in Mexico, a mother from El Salvador chose to send her three children back across the border alone. Now, those children face deportation, even though their father lives in Maryland and is eager to take them in, according to attorneys.  Lawyers for the children sued the U.S. government Tuesday demanding that the children be released from a government facility and allowed to seek asylum.  Their mother remains in Matamoros, Mexico, where an estimated 2,000 people live in a squalid tent camp, waiting for their court hearings a short distance away in Brownsville, Texas.  Many parents at the camp have made the same choice. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 498 children in its custody have said their family is in Mexico. In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., the CAIR Coalition and Justice Action Center argue that the children deserve a new court hearing because they are now considered “unaccompanied” children under government rules.  The Associated Press is withholding the names of the mother and her children because they fear being targeted by MS-13 if forced to return to El Salvador.  According to the lawsuit, the mother and father were active in their local church in El Salvador and frequently evangelized to others. They believe their ministry drew the attention of MS-13, the violent transnational gang. Gang members attacked the father and eventually threatened his life, leading the family to flee. They lived in Mexico for two years, then moved back to El Salvador, going from town to town, the lawsuit says. But they concluded last year that they would have to try to enter the U.S. The father and his second eldest daughter went first, arriving in the U.S. in June 2019 and settling in Maryland after they were released by border agents.  The mother and three of their children - daughters now aged 16 and 14, and a 9-year-old son - left later and arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in September. By then, the U.S. had implemented its “Remain in Mexico” program in South Texas, under which more than 50,000 people have been sent back across the border with court dates sometimes months away. The mother and her three children were sent to Matamoros under the program.  In January, a judge in Brownsville denied their asylum claim and the family returned to the camp.  At the camp, someone grabbed the 16-year-old daughter and tried to assault her. Another person beat the 9-year-old boy and took money he had to buy food. They had seen kidnappings and extortion attempts, and once observed a corpse floating in the nearby Rio Grande.  So the mother sent her three children across the border alone in January.  The Department of Health and Human Services has declined to release the three children, so their father goes to a facility in Crofton, Maryland, to see them.  He says he is certain that if they are deported, they would be killed. “My only purpose was to save my family,” he said.  Even if the children win their case in U.S. courts, the mother may have no way of entering the country herself. According to her lawyers, she has missed a deadline to file an appeal.  The mom said she would be happy regardless. “A mother wants the best for her children,” she said. “Nothing can compare to a mother’s love.” ___ This version corrects the name of the Justice Action Center from Justice Action Council.

"Americans should postpone elective medical services because hospitals and doctors need the beds and patients shouldn’t expose themselves to the virus, the U.S. coronavirus coordinator said Tuesday. “If you’re a person with an elective surgery, you don’t want to go into a hospital right now,” Deborah Birx, an HIV/AIDS expert tapped by President Trump to coordinate his team, told reporters at a White House briefing. The administration also said seniors on Medicare can check in with their doctors remotely, through telehealth, at no extra cost as the administration scrambles to blunt the spread of the deadly coronavirus. “They can talk to their doctor via Skype, and they don’t have to risk exposure to the virus,” said Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Officials advised patients as part of Mr. Trump’s broader plea to stay home and avoid unnecessary exposure to the coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19. The virus has infected 5,200 people and killed more than 90 people in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University’s tracker — although testing is just ramping up. The president said he always viewed the situation as serious, although in late February he suggested 15 domestic cases could be knocked down to zero within days. “I’ve felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday. Looking ahead, Mr. Trump reminded people to avoid unnecessary travel and groups of 10 or more for the next two weeks. “We’ll see what happens after that,” Mr. Trump said. “Our country can be rolling again pretty quickly.” “One day will be standing up here and say: We won,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “Sure as you’re sitting there, we’re going to say that.” Mr. Trump said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is on standby in case they need to conduct emergency construction. Those operations may include renovations to expand and retrofit existing facilities or setting up smaller mobile field hospitals, or MASH units, to render care. Officials also said mobile testing units are “blossoming” in states across the country, with federal help, and that states have wide latitude to authorize tests. Vice President Mike Pence said that as more diagnostics come online, each and every American must act on Mr. Trump’s push for “social distancing.” “You don’t need the results of testing to know what you should do,” Mr. Pence said. Mr. Trump wants people to use takeout and drive-thru services instead of entering bars and restaurants, saying it’s another way to put the nation closer to victory against the pathogen. The White House said executives representing Chick-fil-A, Olive Garden, McDonald’s and other restaurants agreed to emphasize those options Tuesday in a phone call with the president. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said many eateries use apps that allow for home delivery or quick handoffs. “You can order ahead of time,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “They can give it to you with social distancing, and it’s very fast.” Amazon, meanwhile, said it is suspending shipments to its warehouses of items other than medical supplies or household staples so it can focus on the supply of things that are needed amid the outbreak. Individual states continued to take action. The San Francisco area faces the most stringent lockdown, with 7 million residents told to limit outings to trips for supplies. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said his state has recorded more than 1,300 cases, the most in the nation, though he rejected rumors that New York City would go into total quarantine. “That is not true,” the Democrat said. “That cannot happen. It cannot happen legally. No city in [the] state can quarantine itself without state approval, and I have no interest whatsoever and no plan whatsoever to quarantine any city.” Mr. Cuomo compared the situation to a tabletop snow globe. “Somebody picked up our country and just shook it,” Mr. Cuomo said. “It is a frightening time on every level. At the same time, it’s this much time,” the governor said, placing his hands slightly apart. “We will get through this much time. Understand what we’re dealing with, understand the pressures that we’re feeling — but we will get through this much time.” Mr. Trump said he had a constructive conversation with Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday, despite warring tweets over the past two days. “We’re both doing a really good job,” Mr. Trump said. The president also deferred to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s judgment in closing the state’s primary polls Tuesday. “He’s definitely somebody who knows what he’s doing,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump said the best thing the country can do to preserve future elections is to defeat the virus. • David Sherfinski contributed to this report.

"SAN DIEGO (AP) - Former California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter was sentenced Tuesday to 11 months in prison after pleading guilty to stealing campaign funds and spending the money on everything from outings with friends to his daughter’s birthday party.  The ex-Marine’s defense attorneys had asked for home confinement, citing his military service including fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his nearly six terms in Congress. Hunter resigned from Congress in January after representing one of Southern California’s last solidly Republican districts.  Prosecutors submitted 87 pages of details to U.S. District Court Judge Thomas J. Whelan ahead of Tuesday’s sentencing that showed a corrupt congressman who intentionally and repeatedly stole from his campaign funds for a decade.  Hunter and his wife were accused in a 60-count indictment of stealing more than $250,000 in campaign contributions and trying to hide it on financial disclosure records, listing some personal expenses as contributions to wounded warriors. Each had faced up to five years in prison. Each pleaded guilty to a single count in separate plea agreements last year.  The funds bankrolled private school tuition for his children, his wife’s shopping sprees, weekend trips with his mistress and drinking parties in Washington.  Hunter asked the court Tuesday to spare the mother of his three children jail time, and said he takes full responsibility. He showed little emotion.  The hearing was held despite many state and federal courts across California and the country all but shutting down or holding hearings by teleconference to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.  The judge said the full courtroom did not have more than 50 people in it. Whelan said Hunter wanted the hearing to proceed as planned. Federal judges in San Diego have held many call-in hearings when parties of a case could not be present.  Prosecutors said a 14-month prison sentence was needed to punish a lawmaker who misled his constituents and whose wrongdoing has now left the 50th congressional district without a representative. A Democrat and Republican are headed to a November runoff for his seat. A broke and debt-saddled Hunter cavalierly spent campaign money on small things, such as a tin of chewing tobacco, and a copy of the book, “Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid,” according to prosecutors.  And after he was caught, he ran for reelection and tried to convince voters in the district east of San Diego that as a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, he was the victim of a political witch hunt by left-leaning prosecutors trying to drive him out of office in Democratic California.  “As we now know, Hunter lied to the people about his guilt. Not once, but countless times. In doing so, he conned voters into electing a soon-to-be-convict,” prosecutors wrote in their arguments for the prison term. Defense attorneys said he deserved 11 months in home confinement because of his military and public service. They said he saved thousands of San Diego jobs on the chopping block and helped craft laws to better the lives of veterans.  His parents wrote a letter pointing out his bravery in signing up for the Marine Corps the day after the Sept. 11 attacks, and a Democratic colleague, San Diego Rep. Juan Vargas, penned that “Mr. Hunter needs special counseling and treatment after fighting our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.” Hunter is not the first congressmen accused of the illegal use of campaign money. Prosecutors compared Hunter’s case to that of former Illinois Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr., who got 30 months for stealing $750,000 in campaign funds. Hunter’s defense lawyers compare him to former California Rep. Jay Kim, who was spared prison time in 1998 and sentenced to two months home confinement after he admitted to taking more than $250,000 in illegal campaign contributions.  Hunter’s conviction ended his family’s political dynasty in the 50th congressional district. Hunter won the seat after his father. Hunter L. Duncan, represented the area of suburbs and farm towns for 28 years before retiring.  Hunter was ordered to report to prison on May 29.   ",Ex-California Rep.

"Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said he is eager to offer resources to President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin who signaled support Tuesday for the idea of a stimulus check to Americans during the coronavirus pandemic. The signature policy of Yang’s bid for the Democratic nomination was a universal basic income in the form of monthly $1,000 checks to all U.S. citizens 18 or older, which he branded the “freedom dividend.” “I’m pleased to see the White House adopt our vision of putting money directly into the hands of hard-working Americans,” Mr. Yang said in a statement posted to Twitter. “It’s unfortunate to see this development take place under the current circumstances, but this is exactly what Universal Basic Income is designed to do — offer a way to ensure that Americans can make ends meet when they need it most.” Mr. Yang added that his team has been in touch with the White House about the proposal and “are offering resources.” At a press conference Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin said the administration wants to send checks to Americans within the next two weeks. Some reports said the administration wants the checks to be larger than $1,000. “Although the president likes the idea of a payroll tax holiday … we’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” the Treasury secretary said. The stimulus is designed to help Americans cope with the economic disruption brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. and around the world. The idea has been floated by major figures, notably Sen. Mitt Romney, Utah Republican, in recent days.  Mr. Yang, an entrepreneur now working as a CNN analyst, suspended his Democratic presidential campaign after the New Hampshire primary and later endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.  “I look forward to monitoring the developments of the White House as they consider methods of distribution, and both me and my team are eager to offer our support to ensure this process runs as smoothly as possible,” Mr. Yang wrote.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday said a third coronavirus package needs to expand benefits for workers, and she also wants  refundable tax credits for self-employed and gig-economy workers. “During negotiations, the Democratic House will continue to make clear to the Administration that any emergency response package must put Families First before any aid to corporate America is considered,” Mrs. Pelosi said in a statement. She wants the third bill to expand on benefits for workers, including ensuring first responders and health workers have paid leave if they need it. Mrs. Pelosi and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin Tuesday morning about the next package and specifically concerns about the airline industry. The two Democrats will also speak with a group of airline CEOs Tuesday afternoon, according to Mrs. Pelosi’s chief of staff. The Senate still needs to pass the second coronavirus relief package, the final version of which was passed by the House Monday night. The Trump administration proposed a $850 billion coronavirus relief package, which would include aid for hard-hit sectors like the airline and cruise industries. Talks between Mr. Mnuchin and Senate Republicans began Monday night and will continue on Tuesday.

"While fierce new health protocols settle in with the general public during the coronavirus crisis, an esteemed physician also has a ready prescription for one and all. “There’s nothing wrong with praying in a crisis. Neanderthals no doubt proffered a few entreaties to their Zeus when a sabre-tooth tiger hunt went south. It’s pretty much part of the human toolkit. The wisdom and efficacy of prayer in a crisis depends wholly on one question: is the prayer directed to someone who is real, or is prayer based on a delusion?” writes Dr. Michael R. Egnor, a professor of neurosurgery and pediatrics at State University of New York, Stony Brook. “If the object of supplication is real, then prayer is probably the first thing you want to do in a crisis. A plea to the Boss is a fine preamble to the grunt work of managing a crisis. I’m a neurosurgeon, and I pray before each operation. It really helps,” Dr. Egnor advises in a column for Mind Matters, a publication of the Discovery Institute and the Walter Bradley Center for Natural and Artificial Intelligence. He also backs up his recommendations with thoughts from medieval philosopher and theologian St. Thomas Aquinas — plus another source. The physician also cited Vice President Mike Pence, who recently prayed with members of the White House coronavirus task force. In addition, President Trump has also prayed in the White House on multiple occasions with religious leaders of every description. “Should we be praying through the coronavirus crisis? Well, there is good evidence of the efficacy of prayer regardless of one’s view on the ultimate question, which ought to be a good thing for everybody concerned,” summarizes Mark Tapscott, an editor of Hill Faith, a blog covering religion on Capitol Hill, which also cites Dr. Egnor’s advice. CUOMO AND CUOMO CNN prime-time host Chris Cuomo has had a special guest on his evening program recently. That would be his older brother New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. On two occasions, the pair have discussed the coronavirus and President Trump’s response to it in less-than-flattering terms. “Does it make sense for liberal CNN host Chris Cuomo to interview his liberal Democrat brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, on the network’s prime time line-up? According to the network, it’s the perfect place for two members of a prominent Democrat family to bash the Republican president,” writes Newsbusters.org analyst Scott Whitlock, who reviewed the exchanges between the brothers. “This is the second time in less than a week that Andrew Cuomo appeared on his brother’s show. The idea that CNN had no problem with Democrat Chris Cuomo interviewing Democrat Andrew Cuomo — both children of Democratic governor Mario Cuomo — is bizarre. Was Anderson Cooper not available?” asks Mr. Whitlock. FOR THE LEXICON “MRNA-1273” That is the name of the potential vaccine for use against the coronavirus developed by Moderna, with input from the National Institutes of Health. The trial began at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle on Monday. Also of note: In case you missed the news reports, Jennifer Haller, 43, was the first to receive the vaccine, and will receive another dose of the vaccine in a month. “I hope that we get to a working vaccine quickly and that we can save lives and people can go back to life as soon as possible,” she told Time magazine in the aftermath. Another 44 adult volunteers will receive their doses of the vaccine in the next six weeks. SUCCESS: SAFEGUARDING AMERICA’S INTERNET A round of applause, please, for Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, who has successfully rallied the nation’s major online providers to look after the nation and keep people connected with one another during the coronavirus crisis. Mr. Pai has issued the “Keep Americans Connected Pledge” for providers, which ensures that service for residential or small-business customers will not be terminated if their bills go unpaid. The pledge also waives late fees for customers and opens Wi-Fi hot spots to any American who needs them. Within 24 hours, a reassuring cross section of 85 providers had signed up — from major names like T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T to the Farmers Telecommunications Cooperative, Antietam Broadband and Central Arkansas Telephone Cooperative. Mr. Pai says he is confident the nation’s broadband and telephone companies will prevail over the huge usage increases coming from increased telecommuting and social distancing. “I applaud those companies that have already taken the Keep Americans Connected Pledge. They are stepping up to the plate and taking critical steps that will make it easier for Americans to stay connected during this pandemic and maintain much-needed social distancing. I urge other companies to join them. This may be a difficult time for our nation, but if we all work together, I am confident that we can rise to the challenge,” Mr. Pai says.

"President Trump is pondering a move to declare the southwest border closed to all illegal immigration as officials eye the growing number of coronavirus cases in countries that are responsible for the lion’s share of unauthorized crossings. Under the policy the administration would claim powers to turn back into Mexico anyone who shows up without permission. Currently, they are arrested and usually go through a deportation process of varying speeds. One administration official said the possibility of COVID-19 cases making their way into the U.S. via the border has caused “profound alarm within the federal government, national security apparatus and health care community.” “The truth is that the unmitigated spread of pandemic through the [southwest] border will have dangerous, adverse and even deadly consequences to potentially millions of Americans, as well as migrants, law enforcement personnel, doctors and nurses, and so many more,” said the official, who is familiar with the discussions. Mr. Trump had publicly said he was considering shutting down the border, then reversed last week and said he doubted it would be necessary. In more recent days, though, he has stepped up his rhetoric, with immigrant-rights activists complaining after he called COVID-19 the “Chinese virus.” The virus originated in China. Word of the potential new border policy further enraged activists. Frank Sharry, executive director at America’s Voice, said Mr. Trump was playing politics with the move, “throwing red meat to white grievance voters and deliberately dividing the country.” “This is a nasty move by a nasty White House as they gear up to run the nastiest campaign in American history,” Mr. Sharry said. The New York Times first reported the potential border shutdown. Mexico, which accounts for more than half of illegal border crossings so far this fiscal year, and is the transit point for those from further south, had 53 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Tuesday afternoon. All told, migrants from 122 different countries have been nabbed at the border this year, according to Homeland Security data shared with The Times. Countries that have COVID-19 cases and also account for a large number of illegal immigrants include Brazil, Cameroon, China, Ecuador, Honduras and Guatemala.

"CHICAGO — Kim Foxx, the Chicago area’s top prosecutor, won the Democratic nomination Tuesday against three challengers who zeroed in on her handling of the Jussie Smollett criminal case. The primary race for Cook County state’s attorney was one of the most expensive of its kind, particularly with Navy veteran Bill Conway making his first run for public office with millions of dollars in family wealth. He had been running television ads for months questioning Foxx’s controversial decision to drop charges against the “Empire” actor. Smollett is accused of staging a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago. She recused herself from the Smollett case, but questions loom about whether she acted improperly for speaking to a Smollett relative and aide to former first lady Michelle Obama before the charges were dismissed. A special prosecutor reinstated the charges last month, which Foxx blasted as political. On the campaign trail, Foxx tried to focus on her record, touting the work of a conviction integrity unit and reforms to the cash bail system. She led in endorsements and establishment backing. Several super PACS also worked against her opponents, including Conway whose $11.5 million campaign came mostly from his billionaire father, William Conway, co-founder of Washington D.C.-based Carlyle Group. The other Democrats running were former Chicago Alderman Bob Fioretti and former federal prosecutor Donna More.

"LAS VEGAS — Nevada’s governor ordered a monthlong closure of casinos and other non-essential businesses like bars, movie theaters and gyms starting noon Wednesday and restaurants to shutter their dining rooms and only offer takeout or delivery in order to stem the spread of the new coronavirus.  The order from Democrat Steve Sisolak Tuesday night follows similar moves by more than 10 other governors as states scramble to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19.  Sisolak’s order gave thousands of businesses in the tourism capital less than a day to prepare. Though a number of casinos started to close their doors this week, the governor’s sweeping order shutters Nevada’s main industry, anchored by glitzy casinos lining the Las Vegas Strip.  The closures are part of federal guidance recommending social distancing. President Donald Trump has urged Americans to follow sweeping guidelines for the next few weeks, including for older residents to stay home and for all people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 as well as restaurants and bars.  Sisolak’s order comes after many casinos in Las Vegas moved to shut their doors entirely and the mayor of city said she hoped bars and restaurants would be able to stay open.  “My hope is that private industry rises to the top, that they’re allowed to stay open and take care of these families that are paycheck to paycheck,” Mayor Carolyn Goodman told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The mayor of Reno had issued an order similar to Sisolak Monday night, telling many of those non-essential businesses to close in that city starting Friday at 5 p.m. Mayor Hillary Schieve initially included casinos but rescinded that, allowing gambling operations to continue.  Nevada has reported more than 50 cases of the virus so far. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. In Las Vegas, MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts announced earlier in the week they planned to close their properties. Tuesday morning, three more casino resorts joined in.  The MGM casino closures of 13 properties included the Bellagio and its famous fountain show in front, which often draws a crowd to watch the fountains shooting as high 460 feet (140 meters) into the air, choreographed to lights and music.  The Hoover Dam, near the Arizona border and another Nevada tourist attraction, is temporarily closing to visitors “because of the nature of the structure and an inability to implement social distancing standards recommended by the” CDC, according to a statement.  With businesses closing and tourism expected to drop off, the state is forecasting a financial hit, but how big is unknown. In Nevada, gambling taxes are second only to sales taxes as a percentage of the state’s annual budget. The leisure and hospitality industry directly employs one of every four workers in the state and has an economic output of about $68 billion in Nevada, according to the Nevada Resort Association.  The state’s biennial Legislature isn’t scheduled to meet again until 2021, and legislative leaders are not yet planning to go into a special session to address Nevada’s budget.  Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson, both Democrats, said in a joint statement provided to the Associated Press on Tuesday that they’re evaluating all options and they’re working closely with the governor.  But “at this time, we have no plans to go into a special session,” they said.  State officials have not yet released any numbers of how many people have filed claims for unemployment benefits over the past few days.  Sisolak said over the weekend that the state was in “relatively good shape” to pay unemployment claims but it cannot last forever and the state was working to get some additional assistance from the federal government.   ","Nevada's governor shutters casinos, restaurants","Tuesday, March 17, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/17/steve-sisolak-nevada-governor-closes-casinos-resta/,washington_times
"President Trump clinched the Republican nomination for his reelection bid on Tuesday night when he won Florida’s 122 delegates. The victory gave the president 1,330 delegates, above the 1,276 needed to win the nomination, his campaign said. “The Republican Party is more unified and energized than ever before and it’s because of President Trump’s leadership and clear record of accomplishment on behalf of all Americans,” said Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager. “As his response to the coronavirus has shown, and as the broad and strong economy demonstrates, the president wakes up every day putting America first in every decision he makes. And voters have responded.” The president had only token opposition from minor GOP rivals such as former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, who never came close to threatening Mr. Trump. He will be formally nominated at the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, in late August.Mr. Trump has received at least four million votes more than the previous record for total votes cast for an incumbent president in the states that have held GOP primaries so far, besting the record held by former President Bill Clinton in his 1996 re-election campaign, the campaign said. The president set vote total records in Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Washington. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said nobody motivates the party’s base like Mr. Trump. “Fueled by both our longtime supporters and the thousands of new voters that continue to join our movement, we are united and enthusiasm is on our side,” she said.

"Homeland Security’s citizenship agency announced Tuesday it has canceled all in-person business for the rest of March, meaning no more asylum interviews or naturalization ceremonies, blaming the threat from the coronavirus. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it will automatically reschedule some of the appointments. Emergency requests can still be made, the agency said. The closure will last at least through April 1, USCIS said. “To protect our workforce and to help mitigate the spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in our communities, effective immediately, USCIS is suspending all routine face-to-face services with applicants at all of our offices, including all interviews and naturalization ceremonies,” the agency said. The move comes as agencies across the federal government shut their doors, hoping to limit person-to-person contact and constrain the rapid spread of COVID-19.

"Voters heading to the polls in Illinois, Florida and Arizona on Tuesday were greeted with unexpected closures and delays — as well as sightings of protective masks and hand sanitizers — as they tried to navigate their presidential primaries amid the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak. Election officials had expressed confidence heading into Tuesday that they could hold primaries while simultaneously advising voters to be smart about personal hygiene and “social distancing” in polling lines, but Illinois and Florida reported early problems. “It has been a hectic and trying day,” said Jay Young, executive director of the advocacy group Common Cause Illinois. “We immediately began seeing problems principally around polling places where election judges had chosen not to show.” Ohio abruptly postponed in-person voting that was scheduled for Tuesday, with Gov. Mike DeWine blowing past a judge’s ruling Monday evening to invoke a state health emergency and push the election to June 2. A spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners on Tuesday said they asked Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker last week to cancel in-person voting and switch completely to voting by mail after the World Health Organization classified the coronavirus as a pandemic, but the governor’s office declined. “It was a snowball we could all see coming down the hill,” Jim Allen, the spokesman, told reporters. Mr. Pritzker pushed back against Mr. Allen’s contention, saying their offers to provide the National Guard and other volunteers were rebuffed. “[It’s] times like these when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else,” the governor said. “If people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I’ll wear it like a badge of honor.” A spokeswoman for the governor had said earlier that there are no perfect solutions at the moment — only “least bad solutions.” As it stood, voters Tuesday were being turned away at some locations, including in Cook County, because of a lack of election judges. Cook County Clerk Karen Yarbrough posted a picture on social media of blue painters tape with instructions for poll workers to try to mark the floor and keep voters at least six feet apart. Dan Kovats, executive director of the Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association, said turnout was “very low” but that voting were proceeding. “We had some election judges call off, but county clerks have done a good job with having reserve judges ready to deploy as needed,” he said. “There have been some issues in Chicago but these issues are similar to a standard Election Day.” Officials in the three states were hoping that a surge in early voting and vote by mail would make up for lower in-person turnout, with both voters and poll workers wary of getting crosswise with national guidance to avoid large crowds to try to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s campaign issued a memo before the polls closed Tuesday estimating that turnout in Florida and Arizona would be about on pace with 2016 and that Illinois’ turnout would be about in line with 2018 levels. Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who is facing a significant deficit to Mr. Biden in the delegate count, said voting at the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and the campaign would respect whatever voters choose to do. Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections, said the state had been on pace to set new records for early and mail voting for a primary election. As of Monday, 504,000 early votes had been cast cast and 294,000 mail ballots sent to voters. That was up from a day before the 2016 primary, when the numbers were 400,000 and 160,000, respectively, he said. Slightly more than 2 million ballots were cast in the 2016 Democratic primary in Illinois. In Florida, meanwhile, some polling locations were forced to open late because poll workers failed to show. “We have experienced poll worker no-shows, causing some of our polling locations to open late,” Wendy Sartory Link, the Palm Beach County supervisor of Elections, said on Facebook. As of Tuesday morning, more than 658,000 Democrats had voted by mail and more than 438,000 had voted early in Florida, well ahead of the numbers from 2016. About 1.7 million ballots were cast in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary contest in Florida. In Arizona, in-person turnout was slow but Democrats exceeded their 2016 overall vote total through early ballots alone, according to estimates from the state Democratic Party. About 480,000 early ballots were cast in the 2020 election, compared to about 468,000 total ballots in the 2016 contest in Arizona, the party said. “We haven’t heard about a massive exodus of polling workers,” said Matt Grodsky, a spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party. “We never anticipated there being long lines in a negative sense — we always had a feeling that this would run pretty efficiently just because of the amount of Arizonans that leveraged the mail-in ballot option. “Turnout lines have been very small and minimal and I think they’ve been running efficiently, so we’re happy about that,” he said. Still, some advocates said the states should have followed in the footsteps of Mr. DeWine and delayed their elections. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a directive saying that the election would be held on June 2, in line with what Mr. DeWine had pushed for on Monday. Mr. DeWine defended the decision Tuesday amid questions about the legality of the move, saying officials did what they needed to do to protect residents in his state. “What is important as we discuss this is that people have an opportunity to vote over an extended period of time,” he said. “I am confident that we can protect people’s rights and give them that time.” Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said states holding primaries should make voting easier and that voting by mail should be made available to all registered voters. “What happened in Ohio … has only bred more chaos and confusion, and the Democratic Party leadership in Ohio is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote,” Mr. Perez said. He said states that have not yet held primary elections should make it easier to vote “instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.” • This article was based in part on wire-service reports.

"Illinois Democrats are ready to leave the Obama years behind them, according to early exit polling Tuesday that showed a plurality of the party’s primary voters in the state say they want the next president to be more liberal than President Obama. Mr. Obama served four years as senator from Illinois before springboarding to the White House, becoming the first black person to win the presidency in 2008. Four years later he won re-election. Yet Democratic voters in a number of states say they’re ready to turn the page on his eight years, telling exit pollsters that they want the next president’s policies to “be more liberal than Obama’s.” In Illinois, that was the position of 42% of voters, according to early exit polling posted by CNN. Just 37% said they wanted to see a return to Mr. Obama’s policies, and 8% said the next president should cool it and be more conservative. In Florida, which also held its presidential primary Tuesday, Mr. Obama’s reign was more popular. A plurality of 43% said they wanted to see a return to his kinds of policies, while only 36% wanted to go more liberal, according to the early exit polling data. In both states, a majority of Democratic voters said they backed government-run health insurance that would supplant the private market — akin to the “Medicare for All” plan Sen. Bernard Sanders has championed. Support hit 59% in Illinois and 57% in Florida. Fox News, which uses a different type of primary polling, found support for a Sanders-style health plan even higher, at 71% in Illinois and 74% in Florida.

"SAN DIEGO (AP) - The Trump administration is considering a plan to turn back all people who cross the border illegally from Mexico, two administration officials said Tuesday, using powers they say the president has during pandemics like the coronavirus outbreak to mount what would be one of the most aggressive attempts to curtail illegal immigration. The plan is under consideration and no final decisions have been made, according to the officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the plan hasn’t been announced. The officials said the president has authority to take such action in a pandemic and that Mexico’s efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus, along with Venezuela’s, have been the weakest in North and South America. The officials said its authority relies on a law that gives the president authority to deny entry to people or to reject cargo if the Surgeon General determines there is “serious danger” of bringing a communicable disease to the United States.  The administration had declared in November 2018 that anyone who crossed the border illegally from Mexico would be denied asylum, a measure has been blocked in court. Last month, a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in San Francisco upheld a lower court decision to keep that asylum ban on hold while a lawsuit proceeds. The ban now being considered, which was first reported by The New York Times, would turn back to Mexico all people who cross the border illegally, not just those seeking asylum. Homeland Security Department spokeswoman Heather Swift said the president was focused on protecting Americans from the coronavirus and that “all options are on the table.” Immigrant advocacy groups condemned the possible move. “Decisions relating to the pandemic should be guided by public health officials, not by the Trump administration’s long-standing agenda to close the border to refugees seeking asylum,” said Eleanor Acer, Human Rights First’s director of refugee protection. “The administration is using the pandemic as a pretext to advance its long-term goal of curtailing asylum rights for people fleeing persecution.” A third official familiar with the administration’s decision making and unauthorized to speak publicly said there was some alarm within the government and health care community about the health of people at the Southern border, and there could be consequences without further restrictions. The official noted that some migrants are coming over the border from countries with confirmed cases of the virus.  But the proposal is also in line with Trump’s overall policies on migrants, especially poor people arriving at the border, and his desire to clamp down on immigration. It would be the effort to deter asylum and illegal immigration on the Mexican border. About 60,000 asylum-seekers have been returned to Mexico to wait for hearings in U.S. immigration court since January 2019 under its “Remain in Mexico” policy, which the Supreme Court ruled last week could stay in effect during a legal challenge. The officials didn’t detail the mechanics of how this new effort would work.  Many migrants who are forced to wait in Mexico live in squalor in makeshift camps as they wait out their court cases to stay in the U.S., often facing violence and poverty. On Tuesday, some 30 asylum-seekers, many with children, wore masks to court in El Paso, Texas.  One U.S. official told the AP that people who cross the border illegally would still be processed by the Border Patrol, which has limited ability to so without taking people to a station. Mexico can refuse to take back non-Mexicans, but the Trump administration hopes the measure will increase pressure on Mexican authorities to address the public health threat. Since November, the administration has denied asylum to hundreds of people from El Salvador and Honduras and flown them to Guatemala with a chance to seek protection there.  There were more than 851,000 arrests for crossing the border during the 2019 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. The new policy would not apply to asylum-seekers who present themselves at land ports of entry, the official said.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The worldwide outbreak has sickened more than 180,000 people and left more than 7,000 people dead. In the United States, there have been more than 4,000 confirmed cases and scores of deaths. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden is close to putting away the Democratic presidential race after wins Tuesday in Florida, Illinois and Arizona that expanded his lead over Sen. Bernard Sanders. The races in all three states were called an hour after the polls closed or sooner, leaving little doubt that Mr. Biden was continuing his march through the March primaries. The contests were also the first to play out amid the full coronavirus panic. Ohio, which also had been slated to vote Tuesday, postponed its contests, while voters in the other states were bombarded with messages about limiting their exposure to others as they tried to do their civic duty. Analysts say the virus, which is responsible for over 100 deaths in the U.S., is rewriting the rules of politics. That was evident Tuesday when Mr. Biden addressed voters via a blurry livestream from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, rather than the customary roomful of cheering supporters. Mr. Biden said he has moved close to winning the nomination by building a coalition of voters that could power him to victory in November. “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” said Mr. Biden, signaling his support for expanding health care coverage, reducing income equality and combating climate change. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all these issues, and together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this county.” “So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by and supported Sen. Sanders, I hear you,” Mr. Biden said. “I know what is at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as campaign and my goal as a candidate for president of the United States is to unify this party and then to unify the nation.” Mr. Biden crushed Mr. Sanders in Florida, and the race there was called as soon as the polls closed. With 98% of the precincts reporting, Mr. Biden led Mr. Sanders by a 61.7% to 22.8% margin. Mr. Biden was leading Mr. Sanders by a 58.7% to 36.5% margin in Illinois with a little over half of the precincts reporting. And in Arizona, he held a lead of 42.4% to 29.6% with 58% of the vote counted. Despite the results, exit polls showed a majority of voters in Florida and Illinois (59% and 57%, respectively) backed government-run health insurance that would supplant the private market — akin to the “Medicare for All” plan that Mr. Sanders has championed. The exit polls also showed that a number of voters aren’t interested in returning to the policies of the Obama years. For Mr. Sanders, the setbacks could lead to some soul-searching and will spark more calls for him to pull out of the race. Party leaders are eager to avoid a repeat of 2016, when a prolonged primary battle and a nasty convention hurt the party’s ability to unify against President Trump. “We know how this race is going to turn out now. We just don’t know when,” David Axelrod, who was a senior adviser to President Obama, said on CNN. “The question for Sen. Sanders is: Does it benefit the project of defeating President Trump for him to say in this race simply to make a statement, or is it time to consolidate around Biden?” Coronavirus concerns and the difficulties it could cause in upcoming primaries are fueling the sense of urgency that Democrats will be better off if they can clear the way for Mr. Biden and let him focus on Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden said combating the virus is a national emergency that is “akin to a war.” “This is a moment when we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact on what happens, make a big difference in the severity of this outbreak and the ability of our medical and hospital systems to handle it,” he said. Ohio is the fifth state to push back its primary date in response to the pandemic, although it had the earliest scheduled date and did it with the smallest amount of notice — just hours before polls were to open. The virus has threatened to depress turnout, which has been up in many states since 2016. Michigan had record turnout last week, marking a 30% increase over four years ago. The ripple effect of the coronavirus manifested itself Tuesday at slow polling locations. Some voters decided to sit on their hands instead of potentially exposing themselves to the COVID-19 virus. The results Tuesday, though, showed plenty of others had already voted via absentee and mail-in ballots, which Mr. Biden dominated in Florida. The contests followed a tumultuous election eve in Ohio that ended when the state Supreme Court upheld Gov. Mike DeWine’s late-in-the-game decision to postpone in-person voting. Elected leaders in Ohio are now considering whether to have in-person voting on June 2. March has been good to Mr. Biden. Entering Tuesday, he had won 15 of 22 contests this month. Mr. Sanders had won six of them. Former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took the other — in American Samoa. Mr. Biden carried a 894 to 793 delegate lead into the contests. It marks a dramatic turnout from roughly a month ago when Mr. Biden limped out of the first three primary contests without a single victory — only to turn things around with a landslide win in the South Carolina primary. ⦁ Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.

"SAN DIEGO (AP) - The small federal courtroom in San Diego where former California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter was sentenced Tuesday was crowded, and there was no attempt by attendees, security or the judge to separate people as recommended to curb the spread of the coronavirus.  Before imposing an 11-month sentence, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas J. Whelan acknowledged concerns about the virus had interrupted proceedings in many courts. He said Hunter wanted the hearing to proceed and that attendance in the courtroom was below the 50-person limit recommended by federal health officials.  However, people in the gallery that seats 36 people were not adhering to the recommendation that people stay six feet apart. Reporters and others were sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in some cases.  Whelen did respond to a request for comment after the hearing. Hunter’s attorney, Devin Burstein, said he knew of no defendant asking for a postponement. While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said no gathering should surpass 50 people, President Donald Trump said Monday that a better limit is 10. Citing that number, Chief Judge Larry Alan Burns announced hours after Hunter’s sentencing hearing that all jury trials in civil and criminal cases in the district will be suspended until April 16. Sentencings, arraignments and other hearings will be suspended as well unless directed otherwise by individual judges, according to the order. Criminal complaints and arrest and search warrants, initial appearances, and bail and detention hearings will continue before magistrate judges.  The order mirrors the precautions taken by other federal and state courts nationwide.  The U.S. Supreme Court announced Monday that it was postponing arguments for the first time in more than 100 years because of the pandemic.  Federal courts in northern California, including San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose, are closed to the public until May 1 and will not be holding trials until then.  Judges can still rule on cases and hold hearings by teleconference, among other things.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders said Tuesday the federal government should consider giving every household $2,000 per month to help them deal with the financial fallout from the coronavirus. Mr. Sanders outlined a broad bailout package for Americans, saying unemployment compensation should be expanded to cover everyone who loses a job and to cover 100% of an individual’s salary up to $75,000. He said he will be presenting his package of proposals to Senate leaders this week. The plan calls for a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, and for the suspension of mortgage loan payments for primary residences. It calls for rental assistance to be provided to make sure people do not kicked out of their homes. It also calls for waiving student loan payments during the duration of the crisis.

"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s history of how the FBI targeted Donald Trump associates has become a constant presence on social media as journalists and Russia aficionados make more discoveries and connect the dots. Every page of the Horowitz report contains new disclosures. The report’s banner headline was that FBI agents supplied inaccurate information or withheld exculpatory evidence 17 times when they asked judges to approve four wiretap warrants on campaign volunteer Carter Page. Morsels of information placed in footnotes or buried in a few sentences also tell a fuller story about the Trump-Russia investigation. Four examples: ⦁ Former FBI Director James B. Comey has asserted that the FBI on July 31, 2016, opened cases not on the Trump campaign but on four Americans: Mr. Page, Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. But it would appear that in the mind of agent Peter Strzok, who led the probe dubbed Crossfire Hurricane, the entire campaign was under scrutiny from the start. A day after opening the investigation, he traveled to London to interview Alexander Downer, the Australian ambassador to Britain who had chatted with Trump volunteer George Papadopoulos over a drink in London. Mr. Downer’s report to the FBI prompted the FBI to open a history-changing investigation. As he returned to Washington, Mr. Strzok later told the inspector general, he decided he had to find out what Trump allies besides Papadopoulos had heard that Moscow might have dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state. Based on the Downer interview, Mr. Strzok told the inspector general that “the initial investigative objective of Crossfire Hurricane was to determine which individuals associated with the Trump campaign may have been in a position to have received the alleged offer of assistance from Russia.” In effect, the entire campaign from that moment was under FBI scrutiny. In the end, special counsel Robert Mueller found no Trump-Russia conspiracy to interfere in the election. ⦁ Attorney General William Barr last spring tapped John Durham, U.S. attorney for Connecticut, to conduct a special investigation into the origins of the long FBI inquiry and determine whether laws were broken in the process. One path Mr. Durham is taking is to look for any foreign intelligence involvement in targeting the Trump campaign. Was Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud, who told Papadopoulos he heard in Moscow that the Russians could share dirt on Mrs. Clinton, a Western agent or a Russian tool? The public learned for the first time in the Horowitz report that the Crossfire team from the outset did ask for foreign assistance. The single sentence states: “The FBI also sent names of individuals associated with the Trump campaign to other U.S. government agencies and a foreign intelligence agency and requested any information about those individuals.” The inspector general’s report does not name the foreign agency. The U.S. and Britain have a long history of intelligence sharing. ⦁ The intelligence community, led by the director of national intelligence and comprising the CIA, the FBI and other agencies, produced an assessment in January 2017. It said Russia hacked Democratic Party computers and waged a social media campaign to help candidate Trump and hurt Mrs. Clinton, the assessment said. The Washington Times first reported in September 2018 that Mr. Comey wanted the Christopher Steele dossier, financed by the Clinton campaign and by the Democratic Party, included in the official assessment. The Times headline: “James Comey was chief anti-Trump dossier proponent within U.S. intelligence community. Source: Then-FBI Director James B. Comey directly advocated inclusion.” The Horowitz report confirms the reporting in footnote No. 507, with details. “FBI leadership, including Comey and McCabe, advocated for the Steele election reporting to be included in the intelligence community assessment (ICA) on Russian election interference,” the inspector general’s report states. Mr. Comey telephoned Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper on Dec. 17, 2017, and lobbied for the dossier’s inclusion. The DNI and CIA Director John O. Brennan objected and decided to include a short summary of the dossier in the appendix. Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe on Dec. 28 sent an email to the DNI objecting to the summary. An FBI intelligence section chief told the inspector general that the CIA viewed the Steele dossier as “internet rumor.” The inspector general report said: “The FBI’s view did not prevail and the final ICA report included a short summary of the Steele election reporting in an appendix.” ⦁ The FBI’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application to federal judges begins with this heading: “Verified Application.” Some commentators have taken this to mean the agents were telling judges that the bureau had corroborated the affidavit’s stated evidence from Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence officer. Not true, says the Horowitz report. The FBI verification process is known as the Woods Procedures, named after the agent who devised FISA fact-checking in the early 2000s. Mr. Horowitz determined that the Woods process required agents to verify that the material came from a particular source and that the application quotes that source accurately. Here is the inspector general’s finding: “Corroboration of source information is not required by the FBI’s Woods Procedures. Although Woods Procedures require that every fact in a FISA application be ‘verified,’ when a particular fact is attributed to a source, an agent must only verify that the fact came from the source and the application accurately states what the source said. The Woods Procedures do not require that the FBI have a second source for the same information.” The Horowitz report also notes: “We found that the FBI did not have information corroborating the specific allegations against Carter Page in Steele’s reports when it relied upon them in the FISA applications.” Released on Dec. 9, the inspector general’s 476-page report was the first official accounting of the Obama administration’s initial selection of Trump allies to investigate. The FBI’s essential piece of material to obtain the surveillance was Mr. Steele’s error-filled dossier. When agents learned from his main source that the anti-Trump allegations were Kremlin gossip, they withheld the discrepancies from Justice Department overseers, thus obtaining more wiretaps. The Justice Department balked at approving the first wiretap until the Crossfire Hurricane team received the Steele dossier on Sept. 19, 2016. “Although the Horowitz dossier offers a helpful preliminary summary of a few of the criminal acts committed by the DOJ and FBI in support of the Democrats’ coup attempt against President Trump, there’s so much more to come when the full truth is finally revealed over the coming months.” Mr. Page told The Washington Times.

"Americans should postpone unnecessary surgeries because hospitals will need the beds, the U.S. coronavirus coordinator said Tuesday, as Amazon planned to limit its product line, the Outer Banks decided to reject visitors and major department stores closed their doors. Deborah Birx, an HIV/AIDS expert tapped to organize President Trump’s team, said ventilators and a hospital’s time and attention will be at a premium, so all need to do their part. “If you’re a person with an elective surgery, you don’t want to go into a hospital right now,” she told reporters at a White House briefing. “There’s a lot of distraction. There’s a lot of people doing a lot of other things to save people’s lives.” The administration also loosened Medicare rules so that seniors can see their doctors remotely, through telehealth, at no extra cost. “They can talk to their doctor via Skype, and they don’t have to risk exposure to the virus,” said Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The moves are part of Mr. Trump’s broader plea to Americans to stay home and avoid unnecessary exposure to the coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19. The U.S. case count rose to 5,900 and the death toll approached 100, according to Johns Hopkins University’s tracker on Tuesday. Yet testing is still ramping up, meaning the full extent of the domestic outbreak is unknown. States, localities and businesses continued to close up shop or clamp down on public movements to keep people apart. The United Auto Workers union pressured Ford, General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler to mimic their European counterparts and shut down their U.S. plants for two weeks to ensure the safety of employees. However the Big Three have remained reluctant to curtail production. Macy’s said it would close its stores until March 31 and Nordstrom announced a two-week closure. In North Carolina, tourists were banned from popular Outer Banks destinations such as Nags Head and Kitty Hawk. As Capitol Hill negotiated ways to prop up workers and businesses, Mr. Trump said he is taking the outbreak very seriously, after suggesting in February that a set of 15 domestic cases “within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.” “This a pandemic. I’ve felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday. “All you had to do was look at other countries.” The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It infected tens of thousands in the surrounding Hubei Province before the epidemic shifted to other nations. It’s now spreading on six continents, particularly Europe. Authorities in Italy, France and Spain have locked down their populations, except for trips for essential supplies. Mr. Trump hasn’t gone that far, but he reminded Americans on Tuesday to avoid unnecessary travel and groups of 10 or more for the next two weeks. “We’ll see what happens after that,” he said. “Our country can be rolling again pretty quickly.” Mr. Trump said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is on standby in case they need to conduct emergency construction. Those operations could include renovations to expand and retrofit existing facilities or the construction of small field hospitals, or MASH units, to deliver care. Officials also said mobile testing units are “blossoming” across the country and that states are authorized to approve tests created by the private sector. Vice President Mike Pence said that as more diagnostics come online, every American must act on Mr. Trump’s push for “social distancing.” “You don’t need the results of testing to know what you should do,” Mr. Pence said. Mr. Trump wants people to use takeout and drive-thru services instead of entering bars and restaurants, saying it’s another way to put the nation closer to victory against the pathogen. The White House said executives representing Chick-fil-A, Olive Garden, McDonald’s and other restaurants agreed to emphasize those options Tuesday in a phone call with the president. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said many eateries use apps that allow for home delivery or quick handoffs. “You can order ahead of time,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “They can give it to you with social distancing, and it’s very fast.” The National Institutes of Health published research suggesting the coronavirus can survive on hard surfaces for some time, including up to four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard and two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Officials made direct appeals to millennials to avoid partying even if they feel invulnerable, saying they might spread the virus to vulnerable groups on doorknobs and countertops. “We can’t do this without the young people cooperating,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Amazon, meanwhile, said it is suspending shipments to its warehouses of items other than medical supplies or household staples so it can focus on stocking and delivering things that will be needed amid the outbreak. Individual states continued to take action. The San Francisco area faces the most stringent lockdown, with 7 million residents told to limit outings to trips for supplies. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said his state has recorded over 1,300 cases, the most in the nation, though he rejected rumors that New York City would go into total quarantine. “That is not true,” the Democrat said. “That cannot happen. It cannot happen legally. No city in [the] state can quarantine itself without state approval, and I have no interest whatsoever and no plan whatsoever to quarantine any city.” Mr. Cuomo compared the situation to a tabletop snowglobe. “Somebody picked up our country and just shook it,” Mr. Cuomo said. “It is a frightening time on every level. At the same time, it’s this much time,” the governor said, placing his hands slightly apart. “We will get through this much time. Understand what we’re dealing with, understand the pressures that we’re feeling — but we will get through this much time.” Mr. Trump said he had a constructive conversation with Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday, despite warring tweets over the past two days. “We’re both doing a really good job,” Mr. Trump said. The president also deferred to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s judgment in closing the state’s primary polls Tuesday. “He’s definitely somebody who knows what he’s doing,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump said the best thing the country can do to preserve future elections is to defeat the virus. ⦁ David Sherfinski contributed to this report.

"NEW YORK (AP) - When the Brooklyn clothing factory where she worked closed its doors, Josefa Marín started picking up cans and bottles from trash cans to make ends meet. A decade later, the 50-year-old Mexican immigrant is handed hundreds of recyclables by bars and clubs and by concierges of private buildings, who know her so well that they even give her the keys to their trash rooms so she can take what she needs.  For Marín, working alongside her partner, Pedro Galicia, canning is a little business that allows her to pay bills, cover her $1,500 per month rent and put food on the table for two kids. “This is our job, we have learned to survive doing this, whether it’s hot in the summer or cold in the winter,” she said, hunkered down wearing plastic gloves, while fishing through containers. In one of the most expensive cities in the world, where monthly rents in wealthy neighborhoods surpass $10,000, people who scour through trash might be viewed by some as probably homeless, but many so-called canners refute that claim. They are called “bottle professionals” by some redemption centers employees who describe them as people who know by heart each recycling and trash pick-up route, who buy from other canners and who take the job seriously thanks to a 1982 law in New York that allows consumers to return empty containers for five cents. “They have the buildings that they are dedicated to. And if they do their job properly through their network, they should be able to earn, you know, 200 to 250 dollars a day, which should equate out to over 30 dollars an hour,” said Conrad Cutler, president of Galvanize Group, a redemption center that sends trucks to Manhattan to buy from about 220 canners. “It’s not work that everybody would want to do, but it’s certainly an honest way to make a living.” The closing of restaurants and bars in the city due to the coronavirus will mean less bottles and cans for canners. However, those who collect cans from residential buildings and concierges expect big quantities as residents hunker down. The majority of canners use gloves and some now use masks as protection against germs, but they keep going out on the streets as they need cash on a regular basis.  “I think we have a high immunization system because we are always around trash,” said Ana Martínez de Luco, a nun who co-founded Sure We Can, a Brooklyn nonprofit redemption center. Some canners sit on the nonprofits board. It isn’t clear what will happen to these underground economy workers if New York City starts putting restrictions on people leaving their homes in an attempt to control the virus outbreak. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that residents should be prepared to “ shelter in place ” if the city and state decide it is safer to keep people away from each other indoors. Under the Bottle Bill, beverage distributors return redemption centers the five-cent deposit and pay them a 3.5-cent handling fee. Besides New York, nine more states in the country have bottle bills. Distributor trucks, for example, park every day in front of Sure We Can. The smell of beer from empty bottles fills the air and a clinking noise is heard all day as dozens of canners come from the streets, take out their material from shopping carts and place it in clear bags or cardboard boxes.  They all know how to sort each container: some belong to Corona, others to Pepsi, others to Polar Spring. Each canner will get between six and six and a half cents per can or bottle if they do the sorting. That’s what Josefa Teco works on every week. Teco, 57, who is a Mexican immigrant started canning five years ago, when she became unemployed after the tortilla factory she worked at moved out of state due to high rents.  She and her husband Juan have informal agreements to take recyclables from several bars and from a building they also help clean. They make around $10 for a bag of 200 cans and bottles. “I am not going to ask people ‘give me a dollar.’ No, no. I prefer to do this so I can have my money, to eat, and for all expenses,” she said. Sure We Can serves more canners each year: about 500 in 2017, more than 700 in 2018 and more than 800 last year, de Luco said. The job is not only done by Latin American or Chinese immigrants, she said, but also by the elderly, people with disabilities and all kinds of low-skill workers or business owners out of a job. Many are not “bottle professionals” but people who needs some extra cash. De Luco is fighting for the nonprofit to stay alive after the landlord asked them to leave so he can sell the property. There are no official statistics on how many canners are the in the city, but an environmental consulting firm called Eunomia estimates the number to be approximately between 4,000 and 8,000.  Chicago Crosby is one of them. The New Yorker started canning seven years ago, when her mother got sick and she took a leave of absence from her job that became permanent. At first, she would get strange looks, she said, but now people help her on a regular basis, giving her all their empty bottles and cans. “I am mainly doing pickups from this person, that person, and it is so many now,” said Crosby. “I have to keep a calendar of who called me on this day, I know it is every two weeks for this one, I know it is one week for that one. So that keeps me very, very busy.” Canners have sometimes been at odds with officials because once recycling is left on the curb it belongs to the city. However, Belinda Mager, director of communications for the city’s Sanitation Department, said that it is not illegal for individuals to redeem cans and bottles and her department does not oppose residents who do this to make ends meet. “Our goal is to send zero waste to landfills,” she said.  For Jesus Corral, 41, and Carlos Vega, 44, canning is a temporary lifeline until they find a better job. The Mexican immigrants sleep in a public park in Greenpoint and walk the streets opening trash cans.  “What do you have?” Corral asked in Spanish on a recent morning to an employee of a Brooklyn meat warehouse, who then went to the back and came out with only a few empty water bottles. “That’s okay. We already made our money for the day,” explained Vega, who had spent all night canning. “I am looking forward to the summer. We make more. People drink more, so, more bottles.”   ","In New York, making a life out of bottles and cans","Tuesday, March 17, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/17/in-new-york-making-a-life-out-of-bottles-and-cans/,washington_times
"SALEM, Ore. (AP) - The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic is threatening to worsen labor shortages experienced by Pacific Northwest farms and food processors. On March 16, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico said it would suspend routine immigrant and non-immigrant visa services due to COVID-19, potentially cutting off seasonal and migrant agricultural workers through the H-2A visa program. Dan Fazio, CEO of Wafla - formerly the Washington Farm Labor Association - told the Capital Press that the USDA is working with the State Department to obtain an emergency designation for H-2A visas, which would allow temporary farmworkers to continue entering the country. “We’ve got to get these people here in May so we can have a harvest in October,” Fazio said. Washington state had over 25,000 H-2A labor certifications in 2019, which accounted for 25% of seasonal workers, Fazio said. So far this year, Wafla has brought in more than 5,000 H-2A workers, with the biggest wave still to come in late May for the start of cherry harvest. Agriculture is a baseline industry, Fazio said, and any disruptions would trickle down throughout the economy.  Spring is also peak shipping season for Oregon’s $995 million greenhouse and nursery industry. Jeff Stone, executive director of the Oregon Association of Nurseries, said it is already difficult to find workers willing to package products and load trucks. With coronavirus potentially stalling the H-2A program, he said it only adds to the pressure. “All this really shows is the fragility of the workforce,” Stone said. “This adds a layer of worry. I feel for every business.”  ","Virus threatens labor for farms, food processors in PNW","Tuesday, March 17, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/17/virus-threatens-labor-for-farms-food-processors-in/,washington_times
"Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez is calling on states with upcoming presidential primaries to use vote-by-mail and other measures to make it safe for people to vote because of the coronavirus outbreak. In a lengthy statement issued as three state held primaries Tuesday, Perez was critical of Ohio officials for postponing their primary on the eve of voting. Ohio Gov. Mike Dewine made the call Monday night, while officials in Arizona, Florida and Illinois decided to go ahead with in-person voting on Tuesday. Perez did not name DeWine, a Republican, but said the delay “has only bred more chaos and confusion.” Perez said states that already have mail voting should “proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots … postmarked by the date of the primary.” He also suggested expanding days and hours of early, in person voting and expanding absentee voting to all registered voters. Some state laws allow absentee voting for a limited number of reasons. Georgia, Maryland, Louisiana, Ohio and Kentucky have postponed upcoming primaries.

"NEW YORK (AP) - Fox News Channel’s influential prime-time lineup is starting to reflect the changed realities of the coronavirus outbreak, without embracing old enemies. The network most popular with President Donald Trump’s supporters has added a daily coronavirus-themed show and extended news hours, is practicing social distancing on the air and is frequently featuring guests like Dr. Mehmet Oz and Dr. Nicole Saphier. With the country hunkering down to protect against the virus’ spread, talk of “hysteria” and “panic” was gone Monday from the prime-time opinion lineup that is the network’s engine. Sean Hannity promised “facts without fear” and said that “we are all Americans.” Laura Ingraham said federal guidelines restricting movement should be taken extremely seriously. Some things remained consistent: There was time to criticize Democrats and non-Fox media. The sister channel Fox Business Network last Friday shelved a prime-time program hosted by Trish Regan, days after she suggested criticism directed at Trump for his coronavirus response was “yet another attempt to impeach the president.” Tucker Carlson, the first of Fox News’ three prime-time personalities, stood out last week with his calls to Americans to treat the coronavirus seriously. On Monday’s show, Carlson said that protecting the jobs of Americans should be the government’s top priority. Hannity, Trump’s top media ally and cable news’ most popular host, last week told his viewers that while the coronavirus is a serious matter that poses risks and challenges, it’s not “the end of days. It’s not the end of the world.” “I don’t like that we are scaring people unnecessarily,” he said. He has frequently drawn comparisons between the new coronavirus and the seasonal death rate for the common flu and, last Tuesday, to street violence. “To put it in perspective, 26 people were shot in Chicago alone over the weekend,” he said. “I doubt you heard about it. You notice there’s no widespread hysteria about violence in Chicago.” At one point when Hannity introduced statistics on how many people died of the flu, he was scolded by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci, a guest on the show, told Hannity to make sure that people understand that coronavirus is more lethal than the flu. There’s also a vaccine for the flu, and not for the new strain of coronavirus. Similarly, Oz applied the brakes last week when Hannity said that the odds of people dying from coronavirus were negligible unless they were elderly or had a preexisting condition. The doctor said: “The risk of dying is unclear because we haven’t been able to study it in this country.” While Hannity mentioned the flu again on Monday’s show, he also noted that the coronavirus death rate was higher. Most people who get coronavirus have only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. Both Hannity and Ingraham praised Trump this week for his decisions to restrict travel to the United States from China and Europe. “We can say tonight without a doubt, the president’s China and European travel ban I predict will go down as the single most consequential decision in history,” Hannity said. “That’s not political. It bought us time. It bought the hospitals time to prepare.” While attacking the “media mob” for criticizing Trump, Hannity also cited a Breitbart News report that suggested Democrats were not paying enough attention to coronavirus in its early stages because they were preoccupied with the president’s impeachment trial. “The media, some have been enjoying this moment that has brought great inconvenience, disruption and suffering to American workers and American families, let alone all the health challenges, the deaths and the infection rates,” Ingraham said. “Because some people think it is Trump’s downfall and they’re cheering it on.” All of Fox’s prime-time hosts have emphasized the virus’ origin, calling it the “China coronavirus” or the “Wuhan virus.” “Let’s not forget where it came from,” Ingraham said She has also questioned the restriction of movements of people who were not in “hot spots” of infection. “That’s panic and that’s hurting the market,” she said. On Monday, she urged Americans to heed warnings but also not to accept the current situation as “the new normal.” “If we don’t learn the right long-term lessons, well, we can just face a recurring cycle of misery and shutdowns if something happens that is bad in another country,” she said. She called for fewer imports of products from China, and tighter security and medical screening at the nation’s borders. Hannity on Monday had California Rep. Devin Nunes as a guest. He attacked the “media freaks” who criticized his comments on the Fox Business Network where he suggested people should go to restaurants - which are now closed to diners in many parts of the country. “Don’t just go to the grocery store and buy $4,000 of food,” Nunes said. “Go to your local pub.” Nunes told Hannity that he was suggesting people get take-out food at restaurants, although that wasn’t apparent a day earlier. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"The Senate is set to push ahead with a vote on the House coronavirus bill while Republicans ramp up their efforts to unify around a set of priorities for the third economic package. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the plan to leave the two packages separate Tuesday, though the timing of when his chamber will pass the House’s relief bill is still unclear. He dismissed suggestions of amending the House bill to make it broader, which would have forced the House to return and repass the legislation. The Republican leader acknowledged, though, that some of his GOP colleagues are unhappy with the bill as written, and urged them to focus on addressing those concerns later. “My counsel is — to gag and vote for it anyway,” Mr. McConnell said. However, Sen. Rand Paul is still pushing for a vote on an amendment before the Senate votes on the House bill, delaying the “warp speed” vote that Mr. McConnell wanted. “If they allow us an amendment, we’ll allow them to do it more quickly,” he said, according to The Hill. The bill mandates free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs, and pays for sick leave for those who contract the virus or need to care for someone who does if they work for a company with a cap of 500 employees. It also shores up food programs for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and children, and it bolsters state Medicaid programs so health care providers can handle an influx of patients. A version passed the House on Monday evening, after lawmakers tweaked some paid-leave provisions. Though there is no official price tag on the House bill, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it will cost around $104 billion. Mr. McConnell vowed to not adjourn the Senate until it has written and passed a third economic package to address the economic fallout — a plan that is still in its very early stages as lawmakers across Capitol Hill float their own priorities for the economic fix. To get his party on the same page, Mr. McConnell crafted three task forces to work on putting together a Republican version of the bill and negotiate with Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin to ensure it has White House approval. “I’ve told everyone else if they have a really good idea, how to funnel it into a particular task force,” he said. The administration initially proposed a $850 billion plan Tuesday, which would include aid for hard-hit sectors, particularly the airline industry which is lobbying the government for assistance after dramatically pulling back on flights. White House aides say the package could include more than $50 billion for airlines, about $500 billion in payroll tax cuts, and $250 billion or more in Small Business Administration loans. That figure soared, however, to $1 trillion by Tuesday afternoon. There’s also been an uptick of GOP support for immediate cash handouts to Americans — initially proposed by Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah. Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin said they were strongly considering giving Americans $1,000 each within the next two weeks to help with the impact of the coronavirus. “The president has instructed me we have to do this now,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “This is no fault to American workers. For medical reasons, we are shutting down parts of the economy.” The president had been pushing for a payroll tax cut to get more money to the American public, but acknowledged Tuesday it could take too long for people to feel that impact. The proposal also failed to get any enthusiasm on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, Democrats have laid out their own priorities for the upcoming package. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer called for at least $750 billion that would go toward shoring up hospital resources, affordability of coronavirus treatment, fund public transportation and emergency child care and pause payments on loans immediately. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants the third bill to expand on benefits for workers, including ensuring first responders and health workers have paid leave if they need it. She also wants refundable tax credits for self-employed and gig economy workers. “During negotiations, the Democratic House will continue to make clear to the Administration that any emergency response package must put Families First before any aid to corporate America is considered,” she said in a statement. Mrs. Pelosi and Rep. Peter DeFazio, Oregon Democrat and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman, began talks Tuesday with Mr. Mnuchin about the next package and specifically concerns about the airline industry. They also spoke with airline CEOs about their urgent need as well as the AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka about expanding paid leave benefits.

"Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado will self-quarantine “out of an abundance of caution” after contacting a constituent who tested positive for COVID-19. Mr. Gardner said he was alerted on Tuesday by the Tri-County Health Department that a constituent who visited his Washington office for a meeting tested positive for the coronavirus, although the senator himself isn’t displaying symptoms. “The health and safety of Coloradans and Americans across the nation is my top priority, and I will continue working to make sure Congress provides the resources needed to help combat the spread of COVID-19,” Mr. Gardner said. The effective date for the quarantine was March 11. Other U.S. senators who have self-quarantined for precautionary reasons include GOP Sens. Rick Scott of Florida, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Graham said a subsequent COVID-19 test he took turned up negative.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders’ campaign manager on Wednesday said the Democratic presidential candidate is going to be talking to supporters to “assess” his campaign, after former Vice President Joseph R. Biden racked up several more wins Tuesday to amass a daunting delegate lead. “The next primary contest is at least three weeks away,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. “Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.” “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable,” he said. Mr. Biden cruised to wins in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday to build a delegate lead that will be exceedingly difficult for the Vermont senator to overcome in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Biden has 1,147 delegates to Mr. Sanders’ 861, according to the latest tally from The Associated Press. Mr. Sanders spoke via livestream before the polls closed Tuesday, but devoted the entire address to his ideas to deal with COVID-19, including a proposal to pay every American $2,000 per month for the duration of the crisis. The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted the lives of millions of Americans, and has prompted states like Georgia and Louisiana that had primaries scheduled in the next few weeks to postpone them. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine blew past a judge’s ruling this week to invoke a health emergency and postpone in-person voting in Ohio’s primary from March 17 to June 2. The elections that did take place on Tuesday were plagued with polling location closures and delayed openings, as workers and voters were wary of congregating in public amid national warnings against doing so. Some advocates have talked up expanding vote-by-mail options for states that have yet to hold their primaries. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said on Tuesday that states should implement such measures moving forward “instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.”  ",Bernie Sanders will have talks to 'assess' his campaign," -

"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - Margaret Sparrow was 21 years old when she drank a concoction to induce an abortion, at a time when the procedure was both illegal and socially unacceptable in New Zealand.  Now age 84, Sparrow was delighted Wednesday when lawmakers passed a landmark bill that treats the procedure as a health issue rather than a crime.  “It’s been a long time coming,” said Sparrow, a doctor who has spent her life advocating for the reproductive rights of women. While views about abortions have generally become much more liberal in New Zealand since Sparrow’s experience, the law, while updated in 1977, had not fully reflected that change. Until Wednesday’s vote, the procedure was still regulated under the Crimes Act, requiring women to prove to a doctor that their pregnancy presented a danger to their physical or mental health before they could get an abortion. Justice Minister Andrew Little said that requirement forced most women to lie about their mental health and caused unnecessary delays which added health risks. The new law removes those obstacles, allowing women who are up to 20 weeks pregnant to get an abortion and those over 20 weeks to get one with approval from a health practitioner. Lawmakers voted 68 to 51 in favor of the bill.  Conservative lawmaker Simeon Brown, who opposed it, said an unborn child had a heartbeat and felt pain, and should be considered a person who is treated with dignity and respect. Jackie Edmond, the chief executive of Family Planning, New Zealand’s largest referrer of women to abortion services, said she was thrilled with the vote and that women were finally being trusted to make their own health decisions. “It’s fantastic Parliament has addressed something that they should have addressed 40 years ago,” Edmond said. Sparrow said the law stayed on the books for so long because people found a work-around and lawmakers worried about the political consequences of opening up a debate about it. That changed when Jacinda Ardern was elected prime minister in 2017 and followed up on a campaign promise to bring the issue to a vote. Sparrow said it wasn’t so much her own experience of having an abortion that motivated her work over the decades but more recognizing that there was an unfilled need for women. She began her career helping students get access to contraception and for several years helped send people to Australia to get abortions before the first New Zealand clinic opened. She said the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade gave people hope for change in New Zealand. Sparrow, who has received one of New Zealand’s top honors for her work, said the new law is a step forward but her work is not done yet. “It will be safer for women and better for access,” she said. “The next stage is making sure its implemented.”  ",New Zealand passes landmark law to decriminalize abortion,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/new-zealand-passes-landmark-law-to-decriminalize-a/,washington_times
"Voting rights groups and the head of the Democratic National  Committee want the states with remaining primary elections to offer  voting by mail as a way to ensure that voters can safely cast their  ballots amid the coronavirus outbreak. A quick and easy fix? Not always. For states that don’t already have vote-by-mail or that greatly  restrict it, such a change could require amending state law. It also  would require major changes to state and county voting and tabulating  systems. Buying the equipment and software to track ballots and read the  signatures on them could cost millions. And that’s not to mention  deciding who pays for return postage - individual voters or taxpayers? So far this year, there have been quick moves to extend mail voting  in only two cases, both limited in scope: Maryland postponed its primary  but decided to hold next month’s special congressional election by  mail. And the Democratic Party in Wyoming, which already was sending all  its members ballots, has canceled the in-person portion of its  presidential caucus. As in Wyoming, the Democratic caucuses and primaries in Alaska,  Hawaii and Kansas were already to be held largely by mail this spring.  So far, none of the five states that have postponed their primaries —  Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland or Ohio — have said they will  mail ballots statewide. A bill in Louisiana seeking to expand vote-by-mail was introduced  even before the state’s primary was pushed back, but it hasn’t received a  legislative hearing and is opposed by the state’s top elections  official. Pennsylvania lawmakers eased absentee ballot rules last year,  and now Democrats want to expand voting by mail. Republicans, who  control the statehouse, have generally resisted voting changes, and it’s  unclear if the virus crisis is enough to overcome concerns about the  costs of greatly expanding vote-by-mail. Opposition isn’t unusual, typically because lawmakers or election  officials believe it opens a pathway to voter fraud. The ability to  receive a ballot in the mail is greatly restricted in 16 states. Those states allow absentee ballots only for voters who give a valid  reason to get one - and require they be requested for each election. Of  those, Delaware and New York are phasing in no-excuse mail voting. The hurdles to implementing voting by mail for all voters is why  states might be better off taking only small steps at first, said  Charles Stewart, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology. That could mean simply making absentee ballots  easier to get. “Hastily implemented changes to voting rules and laws can end up  causing all types of problems that you didn’t anticipate,” he said. Doug Jones, an election security expert at the University of Iowa,  said universal mail voting also raises concerns about voters illegally  selling blank ballots or being coerced to vote a certain way. On Tuesday, after Ohio postponed its primary and poll workers failed  to show up at some Florida and Illinois precincts, Democratic National  Committee Chairman Tom Perez called a shift to voting largely by mail  “the simplest tool” to balance health concerns and the need to carry out  a fundamental function of democracy. A half-dozen states already have or are implementing systems where  all voters are mailed ballots. They can mail them back, drop them off at  designated spots or choose to vote in person on Election Day. Oregon has been conducting elections that way since the 1990s. Since  then, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Utah and Washington have implemented  or begun phasing in similar systems. With the coronavirus pandemic, the idea has generated more interest.  The National Vote at Home Institute advocates for a switch to a  mail-based voting system and consults with governments about it. Said chief executive Amber McReynolds: “It’s better than hoping  people show up and aren’t scared, and hoping that you don’t have a giant  poll worker shortage and hoping polling places aren’t closed.” ___ Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey. ___ Associated Press writers Frank Bajak in Boston; Melinda Deslatte in  Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,  contributed to this report.

"Voters heading to the polls in Illinois, Florida and Arizona on Tuesday were greeted with unexpected closures and delays — as well as sightings of protective masks and hand sanitizers — as they tried to navigate their presidential primaries amid the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak. Election officials had expressed confidence heading into Tuesday that they could hold primaries while simultaneously advising voters to be smart about personal hygiene and “social distancing” in polling lines, but Illinois and Florida reported early problems. “It has been a hectic and trying day,” said Jay Young, executive director of the advocacy group Common Cause Illinois. “We immediately began seeing problems principally around polling places where election judges had chosen not to show.” Ohio abruptly postponed in-person voting that was scheduled for Tuesday, with Gov. Mike DeWine blowing past a judge’s ruling Monday evening to invoke a state health emergency and push the election to June 2. A spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners on Tuesday said they asked Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker last week to cancel in-person voting and switch completely to voting by mail after the World Health Organization classified the coronavirus as a pandemic, but the governor’s office declined. “It was a snowball we could all see coming down the hill,” Jim Allen, the spokesman, told reporters. Mr. Pritzker pushed back against Mr. Allen’s contention, saying their offers to provide the National Guard and other volunteers were rebuffed. “[It’s] times like these when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else,” the governor said. “If people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I’ll wear it like a badge of honor.” A spokeswoman for the governor had said earlier that there are no perfect solutions at the moment — only “least bad solutions.” As it stood, voters Tuesday were being turned away at some locations, including in Cook County, because of a lack of election judges. Cook County Clerk Karen Yarbrough posted a picture on social media of blue painters tape with instructions for poll workers to try to mark the floor and keep voters at least six feet apart. Dan Kovats, executive director of the Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association, said turnout was “very low” but that voting were proceeding. “We had some election judges call off, but county clerks have done a good job with having reserve judges ready to deploy as needed,” he said. “There have been some issues in Chicago but these issues are similar to a standard Election Day.” Officials in the three states were hoping that a surge in early voting and vote by mail would make up for lower in-person turnout, with both voters and poll workers wary of getting crosswise with national guidance to avoid large crowds to try to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s campaign issued a memo before the polls closed Tuesday estimating that turnout in Florida and Arizona would be about on pace with 2016 and that Illinois’ turnout would be about in line with 2018 levels. Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who is facing a significant deficit to Mr. Biden in the delegate count, said voting at the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and the campaign would respect whatever voters choose to do. Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections, said the state had been on pace to set new records for early and mail voting for a primary election. As of Monday, 504,000 early votes had been cast cast and 294,000 mail ballots sent to voters. That was up from a day before the 2016 primary, when the numbers were 400,000 and 160,000, respectively, he said. Slightly more than 2 million ballots were cast in the 2016 Democratic primary in Illinois. In Florida, meanwhile, some polling locations were forced to open late because poll workers failed to show. “We have experienced poll worker no-shows, causing some of our polling locations to open late,” Wendy Sartory Link, the Palm Beach County supervisor of Elections, said on Facebook. As of Tuesday morning, more than 658,000 Democrats had voted by mail and more than 438,000 had voted early in Florida, well ahead of the numbers from 2016. About 1.7 million ballots were cast in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary contest in Florida. In Arizona, in-person turnout was slow but Democrats exceeded their 2016 overall vote total through early ballots alone, according to estimates from the state Democratic Party. About 480,000 early ballots were cast in the 2020 election, compared to about 468,000 total ballots in the 2016 contest in Arizona, the party said. “We haven’t heard about a massive exodus of polling workers,” said Matt Grodsky, a spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party. “We never anticipated there being long lines in a negative sense — we always had a feeling that this would run pretty efficiently just because of the amount of Arizonans that leveraged the mail-in ballot option. “Turnout lines have been very small and minimal and I think they’ve been running efficiently, so we’re happy about that,” he said. Still, some advocates said the states should have followed in the footsteps of Mr. DeWine and delayed their elections. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a directive saying that the election would be held on June 2, in line with what Mr. DeWine had pushed for on Monday. Mr. DeWine defended the decision Tuesday amid questions about the legality of the move, saying officials did what they needed to do to protect residents in his state. “What is important as we discuss this is that people have an opportunity to vote over an extended period of time,” he said. “I am confident that we can protect people’s rights and give them that time.” Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said states holding primaries should make voting easier and that voting by mail should be made available to all registered voters. “What happened in Ohio … has only bred more chaos and confusion, and the Democratic Party leadership in Ohio is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote,” Mr. Perez said. He said states that have not yet held primary elections should make it easier to vote “instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.” • This article was based in part on wire service reports.

"Illinois Democrats are ready to leave the Obama years behind them, according to early exit polling Tuesday that showed a plurality of the party’s primary voters in the state say they want the next president to be more liberal than President Barack Obama. Mr. Obama served four years as senator from Illinois before springboarding to the White House, becoming the first black person to win the presidency in 2008. Four years later he won re-election. Yet Democratic voters in a number of states say they’re ready to turn the page on his eight years, telling exit pollsters that they want the next president’s policies to “be more liberal than Obama‘s.” In Illinois, that was the position of 42% of voters, according to early exit polling posted by CNN. Just 37% said they wanted to see a return to Mr. Obama’s policies, and 8% said the next president should cool it and be more conservative. In Florida, which also held its presidential primary Tuesday, Mr. Obama’s reign was more popular. A plurality of 43% said they wanted to see a return to his kinds of policies, while only 36% wanted to go more liberal, according to the early exit polling data. In both states, a majority of Democratic voters said they backed government-run health insurance that would supplant the private market — akin to the “Medicare for All” plan Sen. Bernard Sanders has championed. Support hit 59% in Illinois and 57% in Florida. Fox News, which uses a different type of primary polling, found support for a Sanders-style health plan even higher, at 71% in Illinois and 74% in Florida.

"President Trump on Tuesday denounced China for falsely claiming the U.S. Army spread the deadly coronavirus in China, as Beijing condemned Mr. Trump’s use of the phrase “Chinese Virus” and said it was expelling more U.S. journalists from the country. Asked Tuesday about a tweet the day before referring to the virus, Mr. Trump told reporters, “Well, China was putting out information which was false that our military did this to them.” “That was false and rather than having an argument, I said I had to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So I think it’s a very accurate term,” he said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week also criticized the Chinese Communist Party for spreading the false notion the U.S. created the virus. Washington and Beijing have escalated the rhetorical war over the illness in recent days, with Chinese disinformation efforts suggesting that American soldiers attending a military competition in Wuhan last fall brought the virus to the country, and Chinese officials slamming U.S. criticisms of its handling of the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday that it was expelling journalists for The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post. The journalists, whose work permits were to expire at the end of the year, must to leave the country in four days. The Chinese were retaliating for the Trump administration’s recent designation of five state-run Chinese media outlets in the United States as foreign government entities covered by State Department restrictions on travel and real estate. That in turn was retaliation for China’s expulsion of three Wall Street Journal journalists over an opinion column critical of China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. “The U.S. approach to the Chinese media is based on Cold War thinking and ideological prejudice,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday. At the State Department, Mr. Pompeo said the expulsions were unjustified and that China lacks press freedoms enjoyed by news reporters in the U.S. “We know that that kind of freedom doesn’t exist inside of China,” he said. “Indeed the Chinese will tell you that they want more information, people to know more about the country, and yet they continue to take actions like the one you see today where they deny the world the capacity to know what is really going on inside of their country.” The Chinese news organizations sanctioned by the State Department “were part of Chinese propaganda outlets,” Mr. Pompeo said. Mr. Pompeo warned the Chinese will be held accountable for their role in spreading lies about the new virus that originated in Wuhan, China. “Look, this information campaign that they are waging is designed to shift responsibility,” he said. While saying “now is not the time for recrimination,” Mr. Pompeo said the time will come when the U.S. evaluates how the world responded to the pandemic. “We know this much, we know that the first government to be aware of the Wuhan virus was the Chinese government,” he said, adding that Chinese officials delayed alerting the world even after they learned of the potential health risk. China “had a responsibility to do this not only for Americans and Italians and South Koreans and Iranians who are now suffering but for their own people as well,” Mr. Pompeo said. Asked about Mr. Trump’s virus tweet, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang expressed “strong indignation and objection to such stigmatization.” The Communist Party-affiliated Global Times newspaper said Mr. Trump’s tweet signaled a new round of tensions. “The improper nomenclature from Trump and his ilk may be just the start of escalated China-U.S. tensions in a wide range of fields like trade, economic exchanges and politics,” the paper said. “In this sense, China needs to be prepared for the re-escalation of China-U.S. trade conflict in the coming period.” But naming a virus after its place of origin is not unusual. Several other dangerous viruses are named for the location where they broke out, including the Ebola virus named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Marburg virus after a city in Germany, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.

"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden is close to putting away the Democratic presidential race after wins Tuesday in Florida, Illinois and Arizona that expanded his lead over Sen. Bernard Sanders. The races in all three states were called an hour after the polls closed or sooner, leaving little doubt that Mr. Biden was continuing his march through the March primaries. The contests were also the first to play out amid the full coronavirus panic. Ohio, which also had been slated to vote Tuesday, postponed its contests, while voters in the other states were bombarded with messages about limiting their exposure to others as they tried to do their civic duty. Analysts say the virus, which is responsible for more than 100 deaths in the U.S., is rewriting the rules of politics. That was evident Tuesday when Mr. Biden addressed voters via a blurry livestream from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, rather than the customary roomful of cheering supporters. Mr. Biden said he has moved close to winning the nomination by building a coalition of voters that could power him to victory in November. “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” said Mr. Biden, signaling his support for expanding health care coverage, reducing income equality and combating climate change. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all these issues, and together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this county.” “So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by and supported Sen. Sanders, I hear you,” Mr. Biden said. “I know what is at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as campaign and my goal as a candidate for president of the United States is to unify this party and then to unify the nation.” Mr. Biden crushed Mr. Sanders in Florida, and the race there was called as soon as the polls closed. With 98% of the precincts reporting, Mr. Biden led Mr. Sanders by a 61.7% to 22.8% margin. Mr. Biden was leading Mr. Sanders by a 58.7% to 36.5% margin in Illinois with a little over half of the precincts reporting. And in Arizona, the former vice president held a lead of 42.4% to 29.6% with 58% of the vote counted. Despite the results, exit polls showed a majority of voters in Florida and Illinois (59% and 57%, respectively) backed government-run health insurance that would supplant the private market — akin to the “Medicare for All” plan that Mr. Sanders of Vermont has championed. The exit polls also showed that a number of voters aren’t interested in returning to the policies of the Obama years. For Mr. Sanders, the setbacks could lead to some soul-searching and will spark more calls for him to pull out of the race. Party leaders are eager to avoid a repeat of 2016, when a prolonged primary battle and a nasty convention hurt the party’s ability to unify against President Trump. “We know how this race is going to turn out now. We just don’t know when,” David Axelrod, who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said on CNN. “The question for Sen. Sanders is: Does it benefit the project of defeating President Trump for him to stay in this race simply to make a statement, or is it time to consolidate around Biden?” Coronavirus concerns and the difficulties it could cause in upcoming primaries are fueling the sense of urgency that Democrats will be better off if they can clear the way for Mr. Biden and let him focus on Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden said combating the virus is a national emergency that is “akin to a war.” “This is a moment when we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact on what happens, make a big difference in the severity of this outbreak and the ability of our medical and hospital systems to handle it,” he said. Ohio is the fifth state to push back its primary date in response to the pandemic, although it had the earliest scheduled date and did it with the smallest amount of notice — just hours before polls were to open. The virus has threatened to depress turnout, which has been up in many states since 2016. Michigan had record turnout last week, marking a 30% increase over four years ago. The ripple effect of the coronavirus manifested itself Tuesday at slow polling locations. Some voters decided to sit on their hands instead of potentially exposing themselves to the COVID-19 virus. The results Tuesday, though, showed plenty of others had already voted via absentee and mail-in ballots, which Mr. Biden dominated in Florida. The contests followed a tumultuous election eve in Ohio that ended when the state Supreme Court upheld Gov. Mike DeWine’s late-in-the-game decision to postpone in-person voting. Elected leaders in Ohio are now considering whether to have in-person voting on June 2. March has been good to Mr. Biden. Entering Tuesday, he had won 15 of 22 contests this month. Mr. Sanders had won six of them. Former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took the other — in American Samoa. Mr. Biden carried an 894 to 793 delegate lead into the contests. It marks a dramatic turnout from roughly a month ago when Mr. Biden limped out of the first three primary contests without a single victory — only to turn things around with a landslide win in the South Carolina primary. • Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.

"Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz’s history of how the FBI targeted Donald Trump associates has become a constant presence on social media as journalists and Russia aficionados make more discoveries and connect the dots. Every page of the Horowitz report contains new disclosures. The report’s banner headline was that FBI agents supplied inaccurate information or withheld exculpatory evidence 17 times when they asked judges to approve four wiretap warrants on campaign volunteer Carter Page. Morsels of information placed in footnotes or buried in a few sentences also tell a fuller story about the Trump-Russia investigation. Four examples: ⦁ Former FBI Director James B. Comey has asserted that the FBI on July 31, 2016, opened cases not on the Trump campaign but on four Americans: Mr. Page, Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. But it would appear that in the mind of agent Peter Strzok, who led the probe dubbed Crossfire Hurricane, the entire campaign was under scrutiny from the start. A day after opening the investigation, he traveled to London to interview Alexander Downer, the Australian ambassador to Britain who had chatted with Trump volunteer George Papadopoulos over a drink in London. Mr. Downer’s report to the FBI prompted the FBI to open a history-changing investigation. As he returned to Washington, Mr. Strzok later told the inspector general, he decided he had to find out what Trump allies besides Papadopoulos had heard that Moscow might have dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state. Based on the Downer interview, Mr. Strzok told the inspector general that “the initial investigative objective of Crossfire Hurricane was to determine which individuals associated with the Trump campaign may have been in a position to have received the alleged offer of assistance from Russia.” In effect, the entire campaign from that moment was under FBI scrutiny. In the end, special counsel Robert Mueller found no Trump-Russia conspiracy to interfere in the election. ⦁ Attorney General William P. Barr last spring tapped John Durham, U.S. attorney for Connecticut, to conduct a special investigation into the origins of the long FBI inquiry and determine whether laws were broken in the process. One path Mr. Durham is taking is to look for any foreign intelligence involvement in targeting the Trump campaign. Was Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud, who told Papadopoulos he heard in Moscow that the Russians could share dirt on Mrs. Clinton, a Western agent or a Russian tool? The public learned for the first time in the Horowitz report that the Crossfire team from the outset did ask for foreign assistance. The single sentence states: “The FBI also sent names of individuals associated with the Trump campaign to other U.S. government agencies and a foreign intelligence agency and requested any information about those individuals.” The inspector general’s report does not name the foreign agency. The U.S. and Britain have a long history of intelligence sharing. ⦁ The intelligence community, led by the director of national intelligence and comprising the CIA, the FBI and other agencies, produced an assessment in January 2017. It said Russia hacked Democratic Party computers and waged a social media campaign to help candidate Trump and hurt Mrs. Clinton, the assessment said. The Washington Times first reported in September 2018 that Mr. Comey wanted the Christopher Steele dossier, financed by the Clinton campaign and by the Democratic Party, included in the official assessment. The Times headline: “James Comey was chief anti-Trump dossier proponent within U.S. intelligence community. Source: Then-FBI Director James B. Comey directly advocated inclusion.” The Horowitz report confirms the reporting in footnote No. 507, with details. “FBI leadership, including Comey and McCabe, advocated for the Steele election reporting to be included in the intelligence community assessment (ICA) on Russian election interference,” the inspector general’s report states. Mr. Comey telephoned Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper on Dec. 17, 2017, and lobbied for the dossier’s inclusion. The DNI and CIA Director John O. Brennan objected and decided to include a short summary of the dossier in the appendix. Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe on Dec. 28 sent an email to the DNI objecting to the summary. An FBI intelligence section chief told the inspector general that the CIA viewed the Steele dossier as “internet rumor.” The inspector general report said: “The FBI’s view did not prevail and the final ICA report included a short summary of the Steele election reporting in an appendix.” ⦁ The FBI’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application to federal judges begins with this heading: “Verified Application.” Some commentators have taken this to mean the agents were telling judges that the bureau had corroborated the affidavit’s stated evidence from Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence officer. Not true, says the Horowitz report. The FBI verification process is known as the Woods Procedures, named after the agent who devised FISA fact-checking in the early 2000s. Mr. Horowitz determined that the Woods process required agents to verify that the material came from a particular source and that the application quotes that source accurately. Here is the inspector general’s finding: “Corroboration of source information is not required by the FBI’s Woods Procedures. Although Woods Procedures require that every fact in a FISA application be ‘verified,’ when a particular fact is attributed to a source, an agent must only verify that the fact came from the source and the application accurately states what the source said. The Woods Procedures do not require that the FBI have a second source for the same information.” The Horowitz report also notes: “We found that the FBI did not have information corroborating the specific allegations against Carter Page in Steele’s reports when it relied upon them in the FISA applications.” Released on Dec. 9, the inspector general’s 476-page report was the first official accounting of the Obama administration’s initial selection of Trump allies to investigate. The FBI’s essential piece of material to obtain the surveillance was Mr. Steele’s error-filled dossier. When agents learned from his main source that the anti-Trump allegations were Kremlin gossip, they withheld the discrepancies from Justice Department overseers, thus obtaining more wiretaps. The Justice Department balked at approving the first wiretap until the Crossfire Hurricane team received the Steele dossier on Sept. 19, 2016. “Although the Horowitz dossier offers a helpful preliminary summary of a few of the criminal acts committed by the DOJ and FBI in support of the Democrats’ coup attempt against President Trump, there’s so much more to come when the full truth is finally revealed over the coming months.” Mr. Page told The Washington Times.

"BETHEL, Alaska (AP) - An Alaska woman facing deportation was unaware she was not a U.S. citizen until she was 22 years old, she said. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has ordered Becky Trimble to leave the country, Alaska Public Media reported  Tuesday. The Bethel resident has lived in the United States since she was three days old. Trimble received a letter from the agency Feb. 10 saying she had 33 days to leave or risk being deported because she voted illegally in the 2008 presidential election. Until then, Trimble assumed she was a U.S. citizen. She had gotten a job, a driver’s license and voted. She is married with two children. But Trimble’s parents adopted her three days after her birth and brought her to the U.S. from Mexico. As a 19-year-old high school senior, Trimble was told voting was the right thing to do. President George W. Bush was ineligible for another term and Republican John McCain faced Democrat Barack Obama in the contest for the White House. “It was a very big election, 2008,” Trimble said. “We could make history.” Trimble told citizenship and immigration services she had no idea she was not a citizen when she cast her ballot, but the agency maintained her action was still illegal. “I feel like there are holes in the system and that I just need to be looked at as an individual, and not just over a letter,” Trimble said. Trimble is not worried about her upcoming departure deadline. “I just don’t feel like they could deport me when there’s just nowhere to go,” Trimble said. “There’s no proof (of where) to send me.” The birth certificate her adoptive parents received from her birth mother in Mexico was fake and she does not believe the United States will send her to a country where she does not officially belong. “Who knows if they even want me,” Trimble joked. Trimble has received encouragement from Alaska officials. Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski phoned her, while Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and Democratic state Rep. Tiffany Zulkosky said they have advocated on her behalf. “I’m going to stay here and just live out normal life, and just kind of see how things play out,” Trimble said. “It’s still scary because, of course, they could probably detain me, but I feel at peace that things are going to work out and that I’m safe.”  ",Alaska woman facing deportation believed she was a citizen,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/alaska-woman-facing-deportation-believed-she-was-a/,washington_times
"Sen. Bernard Sanders’ campaign manager on Wednesday said the Democratic presidential candidate is going to be talking to supporters to “assess” his campaign, after former Vice President Joseph R. Biden racked up several more wins Tuesday to amass a daunting delegate lead. “The next primary contest is at least three weeks away,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. “Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.” “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable,” he said. Mr. Biden cruised to wins in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday to build a delegate lead that will be exceedingly difficult for the Vermont senator to overcome in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Biden has 1,147 delegates to Mr. Sanders’ 861, according to the latest tally from The Associated Press. Mr. Sanders spoke via livestream before the polls closed Tuesday, but devoted the entire address to his ideas to deal with COVID-19, including a proposal to pay every American $2,000 per month for the duration of the crisis. The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted the lives of millions of Americans, and has prompted states like Georgia and Louisiana that had primaries scheduled in the next few weeks to postpone them. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine blew past a judge’s ruling this week to invoke a health emergency and postpone in-person voting in Ohio’s primary from March 17 to June 2. The elections that did take place on Tuesday were plagued with polling location closures and delayed openings, as workers and voters were wary of congregating in public amid national warnings against doing so. Some advocates have talked up expanding vote-by-mail options for states that have yet to hold their primaries. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said on Tuesday that states should implement such measures moving forward “instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.”  ",Bernie Sanders will have talks to 'assess' his campaign,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/bernie-sanders-will-have-talks-to-assess-his-campa/,washington_times
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to pass the House coronavirus bill on Wednesday as his chairmen continue to craft a third package behind the scenes. Mr. McConnell, Kentucky Republican, highlighted “shortcomings” he’s concerned about in the House’s relief package that extends benefits to workers hard hit by the virus, particularly the pressure on small businesses. “This is a time for urgent bipartisan action,” he said. “In this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers.” Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer slammed the Republican leadership for how Wednesday’s vote will unfold. “First, we must dispose of a Republican amendment that would make a condition of the bill a requirement that the president terminates military operations in Afghanistan,” the New York Democrat said. “In a time of national emergency, this Republican amendment is ridiculous,”  he added. Meanwhile looking ahead to the stimulus package, Mr. McConnell is dividing his senators to focus on different priorities for the next stimulus package: getting more money in the public’s pockets, shoring up public health resources and finding ways to support small businesses. He highlighted that many small businesses across the nation are being shuttered to help enforce the social-distancing practices urged by health professionals. Sens. Marco Rubio, chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, and Susan Collins will unveil a $300 billion relief package for these hard-hit companies later Wednesday afternoon. “So we’re going to pass the House’s bill, but its imperfections will make our more comprehensive package even more urgent,” Mr. McConnell said. “We aren’t leaving until we deliver it. The Senate will not leave small businesses behind.” Mr. Schumer, however, is calling for Republicans to stop negotiating among themselves and include the White House, himself and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the talks. “Secretary Mnuchin says he wants legislation passed by the end of the week. The McConnell process will not get us there,” he said. Because of the heightened concern of spreading the virus among lawmakers and their staffs, senators will have a 30-minute window to vote, with the leader urging members not to congregate but instead practice social-distancing as they enter and leave the chamber.

"The number of pro-life Democrats are dwindling on Capitol Hill. Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois became the latest casualty of the liberal push to remake the Democratic Party after Marie Newman declared victory over him in the state’s 3rd Congressional District primary race on Tuesday. It gave the far-left activists their first scalp of the 2020 election cycle and means the next Congress could have only three remaining pro-life Democrats. Waleed Shahid, spokesman for Justice Democrats, a liberal progressive group, celebrated Ms. Newman’s victory. “Lipinski opposed Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, abortion, and even opposed a $15 min wage up until 2018,” Mr. Shahid said on Twitter.  “He’s the third incumbent to lose to a @justicedems-backed primary challenger after @AOC and @AyannaPressley’s victories in 2018.” Mr. Lipinski, an eight-term member of Congress, had voted with President Trump 25% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight.com running analysis of votes. Sens. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts were among the high-profile liberal progressives that endorsed Ms. Newman, who tried and failed to defeat Mr. Lipinski in 2018. Pro-life groups lamented the outcome. “Congressman Lipinski has long been a profile in courage, bucking the sad trend of Democrat leaders vying to be the greatest advocate of abortion,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. The other pro-life House Democrats are Reps. Henry Cueller of Texas, who survived a liberal primary challenge earlier this month, Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Ben McAdams of Utah.

"SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) - A recent surge in white nationalism in the U.S. has led to a growing threat of violence by factions that embrace bloodshed and advocate for a race war, according to a report released Wednesday by an organization that tracks far-right extremists. The Southern Poverty Law Center’s annual report on extremist groups said its count of white nationalist groups has risen 55% over the past three years, from 100 in 2017 to 148 in 2018 to 155 in 2019. Many of these white nationalists are embracing “accelerationism,” a fringe philosophy that promotes mass violence to fuel society’s collapse, the law center said. “In their view, political activity is pointless, and escalating violence, on a broad scale, is the only way to bring down the pluralistic, democratic society they want to destroy,” its report says. The Montgomery, Alabama-based law center described another faction of U.S. white nationalism as “mainstreamers,” who often call themselves members of the “dissident right” and are trying to appeal to a wider audience. “Much of the movement’s energy lies in the growing accelerationist wing, which, for the most part, is organized in informal online communities rather than formal groups,” the report says. Over the past few months, the FBI has arrested a string of suspects linked to white supremacist groups, including The Base and Atomwaffen Division, that have advocated for violence and a race war. The man accused of attacking two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, and killing 51 people in March 2019 devoted a section of his manifesto to the concept of accelerationism. “There is little to suggest that the violence that has accompanied the surge in white nationalism in recent years will abate,” the report says. The total number of “hate groups” counted by the law center dropped by about 8%, from a record high of 1,020 in 2018 to 940 last year. But the law center said the decline “does not reflect a significant diminishment of the radical right” given an increased activity among white nationalist groups. The law center said Donald Trump’s first presidential campaign energized white nationalists “who saw him as an avatar of their grievances and their anxiety over the country’s demographic changes.” The conspiracy theory that white people are experiencing a “great replacement” by nonwhite populations is the most powerful force driving far-right extremism, according to the law center.  “Trump didn’t create the fear of nonwhite immigrants but rather harnessed it to win the White House in 2016 and continues to nurture it by fanning the flames of resentment within the most extreme elements of the Republican base,” the report says. White House spokesman Judd Deere said that, while the administration hasn’t seen the law center’s report, “President Trump has repeatedly condemned racism, bigotry, and violence of all forms and his policies have reduced violent crime and made communities safer.” Deere also said the law center is a “far-left smear organization that only wants to libel, slander, and defame this president with its lies.” “Their comments are disgusting, particularly while the president demonstrates unprecedented leadership to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Deere said in an email. Critics have accused the law center of using overly broad criteria to compile its list of hate groups. Some groups on the list have unsuccessfully sued the law center over the designation. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., dismissed a lawsuit  that accused law center leaders of trying to financially destroy one of the organizations that it has labeled as a hate group, the Center for Immigration Studies. A federal judge in Virginia ruled that the First Amendment protected a charity tracking website’s use of the law center’s hate group labels. In 2018, however, the law center apologized to a London-based group, Quilliam, and its founder, Maajid Nawaz, and agreed to pay $3.4 million in an out-of-court settlement after labeling them as anti-Muslim extremists. The law center defines a hate group as an organization that “has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics” and vilifies others because of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.

"Despite Sen. Bernie Sanders‘ lackluster performance since Super Tuesday, the self-professed democratic socialist has beefed up his presence in Joe Biden’s boyhood home state of Pennsylvania. The Vermont lawmaker opened five offices in the key swing state and staffed them with about 20 staffers last week, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Though, the campaign acknowledged offices may be short-lived due to the spread of the coronavirus and the campaign’s transition to digital outreach through virtual rallies and town halls. The Pennsylvania primary is scheduled for April 28, but some states have been moving primary dates to June due to fears of increased transmission COVID-19 in crowded spaces. G. Terry Madonna, the director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College, said it’s unclear if Mr. Sanders will remain in the race given the extension of some primaries despite him lagging behind Mr. Biden by hundreds of delegates in the count towards the Democratic Party’s nomination. “I don’t know if Sanders looks at the change in the primary dates will have some long term meaning for him,” Mr. Madonna said, adding it is “hard to find a way in which he can win. You just can’t find a way.” Fernand Amandi, managing partner of the public opinion research and consulting firm Bendixen & Amandi, echoed Mr. Madonna’s take, noting Mr. Sanders stayed in the race in 2016 longer against Hillary Clinton because he was still winning primaries late in the game. “Bernie has no rationale to continue running whatsoever and he only invites greater scorn,” Mr. Amandi said. “He will get out of the race. The only question is when because every additional day and hour he stays in the race he prevents Joe Biden from formally being able to take control.” After losing the primaries in Illinois, Florida, and Arizona Tuesday, Mr. Sanders’s campaign has said it is re-assessing its efforts.

"President Trump’s attempted truce with the media over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak has ended. After several days of offering unusual praise of the media for covering him fairly, Mr. Trump on Wednesday blasted the press for coverage portraying him as taking the pandemic seriously too late. “The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!” Mr. Trump tweeted. “I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the ‘borders’ from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved.” He also cited his approval ratings, saying they were “not bad considering I get nothing but Fake & Corrupt News, day and night.” On Tuesday, the president had sounded generally pleased with the press coverage of his response to the pandemic. “We’re all in this together, including you, and we want to see fair press,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “And I tell you what: Generally speaking, I think it’s been — it’s been a great thing to see.” On Monday, he said of the press, “I think a lot of the media actually has been very fair.  I think people are pulling together on this.”  ",Trump slams media's coronavirus coverage after days of praise,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/trump-slams-medias-coronavirus-coverage-after-days/,washington_times
"Hillary Clinton accused President Trump of relying on “racist rhetoric” to turn attention away from his bungled response to the coronavirus. The president is turning to racist rhetoric to distract from his failures to take the coronavirus seriously early on, make tests widely available, and adequately prepare the country for a period of crisis. Don’t fall for it. Don’t let your friends and family fall for it. Mr. Trump has been criticized for referring to COVD-19 as the “China virus” and for being too slow to react to the virus. He, however, had had a much different take, giving his response a ten out of ten. I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the “borders” from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!

"President Trump said he is invoking the Defense Production Act in the fight against a coronavirus that’s impacted all 50 states and put the White House on a “wartime” footing. The Korean War-era law gives the president broad authority to “expedite and expand the supply of resources from the U.S. industrial base to support military, energy, space, and homeland security programs,” according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency website. Experts say the U.S. is facing an equipment crunch for things like ventilators and masks. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said his department is making 5 million N95 masks available to health workers, including 1 million immediately, and freeing up 2,000 ventilators from its stockpile. Mr. Trump is also sending the USNS Comfort as a hospital ship to New York state and another ship, USNS Mercy, to a location yet to be named. The president said he is also finding ways to expand the use of “self-swab” tests for the virus that would free up busy health professionals. The U.S. has recorded about 7,300 cases and at least 115 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, although testing is still ramping up across the country. Worldwide, there have been over 200,000 cases and more than 8,200 deaths since the virus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. Mr. Trump said he’s on a wartime footing as Washington explores ways to resuscitate the economy and prop up workers who’ve been furloughed or laid off amid sweeping business closures and plummeting demand for things like flights and hotel rooms. “You have to do things, you have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they’ve ever been,” the president said. The administration said it is rushing sorely needed tests to every corner of the country, though people should not seek one unless they have symptoms. At the same time, Mr. Trump was unable to explain why privileged persons without symptoms, including NBA players, were able to get tests while everyday Americans could not. “Perhaps that’s the story of life,” Mr. Trump said. Moving forward, doctors will be able to operate across state lines so that health systems can share resources, according to Vice President Mike Pence. Officials said they’ll also issue guidelines that formalize their plea for Americans to defer elective surgeries. Deborah Birx, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, said she is concerned by early reports from Italy and France that suggest young adults can be severely impacted by the coronavirus. She said there’s been “a disproportional number of infections” in millennials but not a significant number of deaths in children. For days, she’s implored young Americans to avoid crowded bars and other situations that might spread the virus around. She also said people should try to avoid hard surfaces outside of the home, which may contain the virus. “The level of contagion has been incredible,” Mr. Trump said. The president in February predicted a swift end to the crisis. Now he’s striking a somber tone about the pandemic while calling on Americans to rally to the fight. “We’re all in this together and we’ll come through together,” Mr. Trump said. The president referred to the pathogen as the “Chinese virus” during his briefing.He says the name reflects its origins in Wuhan, but others say it stigmatizes Asians and Asian-Americans. Mr. Trump signaled he doesn’t plan to change his tune, even as a reporter pointed to reports of bias against Chinese Americans. “It comes from China. It’s not racist at all,” Mr. Trump said. “It comes from China. I wanted to be accurate.” The World Health Organization says people should refer to the coronavirus’s disease as “COVID-19.”  ",Trump to invoke Defense Production Act to ramp up supplies,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/trump-invoke-defense-production-act-ramp-supplies/,washington_times
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to pass the House coronavirus bill on Wednesday as his chairmen continue to craft a third package behind the scenes. Mr. McConnell, Kentucky Republican, highlighted “shortcomings” he’s concerned about in the House’s relief package that extends benefits to workers hard hit by the virus, particularly the pressure on small businesses. “This is a time for urgent bipartisan action,” he said. “In this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers.” Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer slammed the Republican leadership for how Wednesday’s vote will unfold. “First, we must dispose of a Republican amendment that would make a condition of the bill a requirement that the president terminates military operations in Afghanistan,” the New York Democrat said. “In a time of national emergency, this Republican amendment is ridiculous,”  he added. Meanwhile looking ahead to the stimulus package, Mr. McConnell is dividing his senators to focus on different priorities for the next stimulus package: getting more money in the public’s pockets, shoring up public health resources and finding ways to support small businesses. He highlighted that many small businesses across the nation are being shuttered to help enforce the social-distancing practices urged by health professionals. Sens. Marco Rubio, chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, and Susan Collins will unveil a $300 billion relief package for these hard-hit companies later Wednesday afternoon. “So we’re going to pass the House’s bill, but its imperfections will make our more comprehensive package even more urgent,” Mr. McConnell said. “We aren’t leaving until we deliver it. The Senate will not leave small businesses behind.” Mr. Schumer, however, is calling for Republicans to stop negotiating among themselves and include the White House, himself and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the talks. “Secretary Mnuchin says he wants legislation passed by the end of the week. The McConnell process will not get us there,” he said. Because of the heightened concern of spreading the virus among lawmakers and their staffs, senators will have a 30-minute window to vote, with the leader urging members not to congregate but instead practice social-distancing as they enter and leave the chamber.

"The number of pro-life Democrats on Capitol Hill is dwindling. Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois became the latest casualty of the liberal push to remake the Democratic Party after Marie Newman declared victory over him in the state’s 3rd Congressional District primary race on Tuesday. It gave the far-left activists their first scalp of the 2020 election cycle and means the next Congress could have only three pro-life Democrats. Waleed Shahid, spokesman for Justice Democrats, a progressive group, celebrated Ms. Newman’s victory. “Lipinski opposed Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, abortion, and even opposed a $15 min wage up until 2018,” Mr. Shahid said on Twitter.  “He’s the third incumbent to lose to a @justicedems-backed primary challenger after @AOC and @AyannaPressley’s victories in 2018.” Mr. Lipinski, an eight-term member of Congress, had voted with President Trump 25% of the time, according to the running analysis of votes by FiveThirtyEight.com. Sens. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts were among the high-profile progressives who endorsed Ms. Newman, who tried and failed to defeat Mr. Lipinski in 2018. Pro-life groups lamented the outcome. “Congressman Lipinski has long been a profile in courage, bucking the sad trend of Democrat leaders vying to be the greatest advocate of abortion,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. The other pro-life House Democrats are Reps. Henry Cueller of Texas, who survived a liberal primary challenge earlier this month, Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Ben McAdams of Utah.

"Recent editorials from Florida newspapers:  ___ March 18 The Orlando Sentinel on how the University of Central Florida is conducting its search for a new president: Florida narrowly dodged a dreadful new law that would have made the search for university presidents secret. The bill died a welcome death on Saturday, thanks to the state Senate. What a relief, until you consider how the University of Central Florida is circumventing the existing Sunshine Law without the Legislature’s help. Six months after UCF started looking for a new president, and less than a week before it was scheduled to pick one, a mystery candidate emerged on Monday. That’s right, a mystery candidate, whose identity was revealed on Wednesday morning as Alexander Cartwright, chancellor of the University of Missouri. After the search committee reviewed his credentials Wednesday morning, and conducted a video interview, they decided he should be a finalist, joining another finalist - Cato Laurencin of the University of Connecticut - whose name has been public since early March. (A third finalist dropped out Wednesday, perhaps sensing the fix is in.) Now, the UCF Board of Trustees is scheduled to make its final choice on Friday. That gives the public - and the trustees - all of 48 hours to figure out if Cartwright is the right person to lead America’s second largest university and one of the region’s most important and influential institutions. And to think we were worried about a proposed law that would have required universities to reveal their finalists for president three weeks ahead of making a selection. This community now has barely two days to take a look at a candidate who may become its next university president. This is an outrageous circumvention of the Florida Sunshine Law, which exists to ensure that records and meetings are open, including university presidential searches. Universities have gotten around the law in the past by hiring headhunting firms to go find candidates and then present a group of finalists to the people who do the picking. Leadership searches in years past by the University of Florida and the University of South Florida were marred by other cloak-and-dagger tactics to keep the public in the dark. From the beginning of this process, however, UCF made noise about getting students, faculty and the public involved in the selection. Beverly Seay, the chair of UCF’s Board of Trustees, promised the selection of a new president would be “inclusive, collaborative and transparent…” Introducing a mystery candidate into the mix 48 hours before picking a president is not our idea of inclusiveness, collaboration or transparency. We also don’t view prior, non-public meetings between the unidentified candidate and search committee members to be in the interest of transparency, either. As much as we’d like to have complete faith in the company UCF hired to recruit candidates - Storbeck/Pimentel & Associates - one of the other finalists it had chosen dropped out after the Fort Worth Star-Telegram unearthed allegations that he had mistreated employees. We’ve heard over and over the reason why universities prefer secret searches - the best candidates may not apply because they don’t want their current employer to know they’re looking around. But as Pamela Marsh of the First Amendment Foundation pointed out on Tuesday, before Cartwright’s identity was revealed, “If the secret inside candidate doesn’t want his current employer to know he’s applied to UCF, that means - prior to the big ‘reveal’ - no one can talk to his prior employer about his recent on-the-job performance. Most people wouldn’t hire a babysitter for their children without talking to prior employers.” The reason UCF is looking for a new president is because the last one, Dale Whittaker, got caught up in a spending scandal. The university can’t afford to get this one wrong, and introducing a candidate at the last minute, without time for a full public vetting, seems a sure-fire way to risk something going wrong. There may be reasons why UCF’s trustees and the firm it hired were willing to go to these lengths to protect Cartwright’s identity. But even if he turns out to be the university president equivalent of a superhero, this isn’t how it’s supposed to work in Florida, where the people in charge are expected to value open government. We teach our college students that rules matter. It’s why they can’t cheat. What is UCF teaching them about the value of rules right now? Online: https://www.orlandosentinel.com/ ___ March 18 The Sarasota Herald-Tribune on Sunshine Week: Ever since a collection of journalists and open-government advocates came up with the bright idea in 2005, Sunshine Week has happened quietly every March. Public response has ranged from respectful nods to dismissive yawns. This year is quite another story. We’re in the middle of Sunshine Week — March 15-21 — at the same time we’re in the throes of a novel coronavirus outbreak that has transformed the free flow of information from and about our leaders into our very lifeblood. Sunshine Week is a national observance of an abstract concept. It’s when pundits, newspaper editorial boards and investigative journalists try to get the public excited about its right to know what our government and political leaders are up to, and how they try to hide it. Unfortunately, this is a right that fails to impress most folks as compelling in times of relative peace, prosperity and tranquility. Government in the sunshine - especially in Florida, where far-sighted landmark legislation on public records access has sustained so many tiny chips and dings that it’s coming to resemble damaged goods - is too often seen as an inconvenience or violation of privacy. One example is the unsuccessful attempt in this year’s legislative session to create a public records exemption that would have made recruitment of state university presidents more confidential and thus, presumably, more selective. This time, wiser heads prevailed. But as with most legislation of this sort, it will likely be back next year. One reason that open-government laws have an image problem is that it’s difficult - and often expensive - to expose the most outrageous and pervasive cultures of secrecy. The more our elected and appointed officials are pressured to practice transparency, the more adept they become at devising new window treatments to shut out the public, and show themselves in a flattering light. Journalists and citizen activists almost daily have to weigh the costs of pursuing tips and hunches against the probable value of what public documents might reveal. So for Floridians, awareness of government in the sunshine is often confined to lawsuits where transparency advocates go after the low-hanging fruit. Local officials who run afoul of open-meeting laws are dragged into court as examples, and wind up costing taxpayers for their relatively innocuous offenses. Holding these low-level culprits to the letter of the law can sometimes obscure the vital importance of its larger spirit. That spirit is in danger of succumbing to a cynical politicization of public opinion that has intensified over the last decade in our state. When it comes to responding to requests for timely and detailed information, Florida’s county-based health departments have been increasingly controlled by the message-crafters in Tallahassee — ratcheted up under the administration of Gov. Rick Scott. Now we are feeling the effects of this self-serving trend. The current coronavirus outbreak is a timely reminder of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis’ nod, more than 100 years ago, to sunlight’s disinfecting properties. Brandeis is thought to have been paraphrasing the British jurist James Bryce, who wrote about government transparency in his 1888 book, “The American Commonwealth.” “Public opinion is a sort of atmosphere, fresh, keen, and full of sunlight, like that of the American cities,” he wrote, “and this sunlight kills many of those noxious germs which are hatched where politicians congregate.” Amen. Online: https://www.palmbeachpost.com/ ___ March 13 The SunSentinel on pregnant women in jail: You may not recognize the name Tammy Jackson. But you know her story. Left alone and abandoned in a Broward jail cell, Jackson gave birth to a daughter last April after seven hours of labor as her anguished cries for help went ignored. The 35-year-old Jackson, who is mentally ill, was in a Pompano Beach jail on a cocaine possession charge and held in isolation because she was pregnant, the sheriff’s office said. This inexcusable neglect was first brought to light last May when the Broward public defender, Howard Finkelstein, describing himself as “incensed and heartbroken,” raised pointed questions in a letter to Sheriff Gregory Tony. The mistreatment of Tammy Jackson forced the Legislature to take action after the case drew outrage across the country and brought demands for a full investigation. Lawmakers were shocked to discover that nothing in state law prevented a pregnant woman from being isolated in jail or held in confinement. Is it really necessary to legislate humanity and decency? Sadly, the answer is yes. A bill headed to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ desk will ensure that pregnant women are afforded basic protections of respect, dignity and humanity behind bars. The bill (SB 1259) is the work of Rep. Shevrin Jones, D-West Park, Rep. Amy Mercado, D-Orlando, and Sen. Jason Pizzo, D-Miami. They received encouragement from many community groups including the Dignity Coalition, a statewide grassroots effort of women who have served time in jail. The simple fact that these long-overdue changes passed both chambers by unanimous votes reflects the level of outrage by policymakers in both political parties and the need for reform. After DeSantis signs the bill into law, it will be illegal to place a pregnant inmate in restrictive housing unless extraordinary circumstances justify it. She must be visited at least once every 24 hours, kept in the least restrictive setting and given an intensive medical treatment plan - none of which took place in Tammy Jackson’s case. The bill includes new restrictions on body cavity searches of pregnant prisoners and prevents officers from using restraints on pregnant inmates if a medical professional requests it, and new rules will require correctional officers to document any extraordinary circumstances. If a prisoner misses her due date, she must be placed in an infirmary and be provided the same privileges as other inmates. The only exception provided for in the bill authorizes a pregnant prisoner to be involuntarily placed in restrictive housing if the corrections official, in consultation with the individual overseeing prenatal care and medical treatment at the correctional institution, determines that an extraordinary circumstance exists such that restrictive housing is necessary and that there are no less restrictive means available. According to a legislative analysis, four to 10 percent of women are pregnant when they go to jail or prison. Their health is often compromised by a lack of prenatal care, poor diet or untreated medical and psychiatric conditions. African-American women like Tammy Jackson are three to four times more likely to suffer pregnancy complications than white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheriff Tony, who was appointed by DeSantis last year, has said that his office and the jail health care provider, Wellpath, have expanded training to all staff members focusing on pregnant inmates, and that two employees were fired and three others received counseling and corrective action plans. According to The New York Times, based on an account provided by Jackson’s lawyers, the inmate was found by jail guards at 10 a.m. last April 10, clutching her newborn daughter. No pregnant woman should give birth alone, especially when she is in custody. And no pregnant woman should ever be placed in solitary confinement, anywhere. It is unsafe. More importantly, it is inhumane. Florida has among the highest incarceration rates in the country for women and men. The legislation will take effect on July 1. It is called the “Tammy Jackson Healthy Pregnancies for Incarcerated Women Act.” Ms. Jackson never wanted any notoriety and her anguished cries for help were callously ignored for too long. Far too late, her cause got the attention she deserved the night she lay alone and in excruciating pain on the cold, hard floor of a Broward jail.

"The Latest on the coronavirus  pandemic, which has infected more than 214,000 people and killed more than 8,700. The COVID-19 illness causes mild or moderate symptoms in most people, but severe symptoms are more likely in the elderly or those with existing health problems. More than 82,000 people have recovered so far, mostly in China. ___ U.S. President Donald Trump says he plans to invoke extraordinary powers to immediately turn back to Mexico anyone who crosses the border illegally. The president says at a White House briefing that he will announce the measure “very soon,” probably later Wednesday. Trump says he isn’t planning a full shutdown of the U.S. border with Mexico but that the powers he will invoke to respond to a health emergency give him “great latitude.” Asked about new restrictions on the Canadian border, the president says he only wants to allow travel that is deemed essential, such as movement related to the medical industry, the military or certain industries. He says some people go back and forth for leisure pursuits, such as going to restaurants, and he wants to end that kind of travel on a temporary basis. ___ Guatemala has airlifted 87 of its citizens who were trapped in Costa Rica and Colombia after it closed its borders to commercial traffic. The foreign ministry says all had their temperature taken and will have to home quarantine back home to avoid potentially spreading Also Wednesday, President Alejandro Giammattei asked lawmakers for a $1 billion budget package to stimulate the Central American nation’s economy. ___ Oregon Gov. Kate Brown says the state will open a temporary 250-bed hospital by Friday on the Oregon State Fairgrounds in Salem.  Oregon purchased the pop-up hospital several years ago for a crisis situation such as this, she said Wednesday. Meanwhile, Oregon officials are working to identify 1,000 temporary beds around the state and patients in hospitals who do not have the new coronavirus, and who are in recovery from other illnesses and procedures, will start to be moved to those beds, Brown said. The state has contracted with a private company for 20,000 test kits and the first batch of 5,000 should arrive soon, said Brown’s chief-of-staff, Nic Blosser. The tests will first be used on frontline healthcare workers, first responders and those living in community-style nursing homes. Brown did not directly address whether or not she would order a shelter-in-place order for the Portland metropolitan area similar to the one underway in San Francisco. ___ Poland’s biggest laboratory that is testing for coronavirus infections says it has suspended activity after one of its scientific employees tested positive for the virus. The employee was not involved in the diagnostic process.  The head of the PZH laboratory in Warsaw, Grzegorz Juszczyk said in a statement Wednesday that people who recently had contact with the employee are being submitted to a quarantine and are waiting for the results of their own tests.  Juszczyk said that three other laboratories in Warsaw are ensuring continuous testing, and there are other laboratories elsewhere in the country. The PZH laboratory will resume work as soon as possible, he said.  A nation of 38 million, Poland has confirmed 287 cases of infection with coronavirus. Five of the patients have died. ___ Portugal’s president is set to declare a state of emergency, granting authorities exceptional powers to help fight the spread of COVID-19. The measure allows the government to place temporary limits on civil liberties, such as freedom of movement and the right to protest, and grants it special powers, including requisitioning private property. The government can also fix prices and stipulate what goods are manufactured. The armed forces can be deployed to enforce the measures. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was due to announce the move in a nationally televised address Wednesday evening. The government and parliament have given their blessing. Portugal on Wednesday reported a total of 642 cases, 194 higher than the previous day, and two deaths. The country has close ties with its neighbor Spain, which is one of the countries most affected by the outbreak. ___ The U.S. Transportation Security Administration reports a ninth case of an airport security screening officer testing positive for the new coronavirus. The ageny said Tuesday that a checked baggage screener at Newark-Liberty International Airport in New Jersey is the most recent. The officer’s last shift was Saturday. The other officers who previously tested positive worked at airports in San Jose, California; Fort Lauderdale and Orlando in Florida; Cleveland and Atlanta. ___ Conservative Republican legislators in Kansas are moving to limit Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s power to address the coronavirus pandemic after she closed the state’s K-12 schools for the rest of the spring semester. Conservatives said Wednesday that Kelly’s action was an overreaction. Kansas has at least 18 confirmed coronavirus cases and one COVID-19-related death. Most infected people recover but some can develop serious problems. They included language from GOP conservatives in a resolution that would extend a state of emergency declared by Kelly last week to prevent her from invoking a state law giving the governor broad powers to act to “promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population.” And at the urging of conservative Republican Sen. Dennis Pyle, of Hiawatha, senators added a provision to prohibit Kelly from confiscating guns. The House must consider the language, but some Republicans there also grumbled about Kelly’s order to close schools ___ Britain is closing all its primary and secondary schools because of the new coronavirus, one of the last countries in Europe to do so. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says schools across England will close after Friday until further notice. The governments of Scotland and Wales have already announced that schools there will close Friday, and schools in Northern Ireland on Wednesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said closing schools is of “limited value” in slowing the spread of the virus but that now is the right time to do it. He said there would be measures to ensure that health care workers and other key staff who are parents can still go to work. The U.N. cultural organization, UNESCO, says that as of late Tuesday, over 850 million children and youth – roughly half of the world’s student population – has to stay away from schools and universities because of the pandemic. ___ Casinos throughout Nevada were closed Wednesday, along with other nonessential businesses, following under an order from Gov. Steve Sisolak. He urged residents to stay home to help curtail the spread of the new coronavirus. The last time casinos closed in Las Vegas was for John F. Kennedy’s funeral on Nov. 25, 1963. Michael Green, a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said he believes this is the first time all Nevada casinos have been closed statewide. On the Las Vegas Strip, vehicle traffic was busy as usual despite gambling having halted at midnight, but pedestrians were scarce. Large orange barricades were placed in front of driveways to the Wynn and Encore casinos, while gates blocked walkways and padlocks and entrances to a nearby shopping mall had been chained and padlocked. Across the street, a chain link fence had been placed in front of the Circus Circus resort. ___ German Chancellor Angela Merkel says not since World War II has the country faced a challenge like the current outbreak of the coronavirus. Merkel on Wednesday night made her first direct TV address to the nation in over 14 years in power, other than her annual New Year’s speech. She called on every person in Germany to help protect those who are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. “Let me tell you: This is serious. Take it seriously too,” Merkel said in her speech that was to be aired on several public and private TV stations starting at 19:15 local time (1818 GMT). An embargoed copy of her speech was given to news agencies for earlier release. Merkel, who is a physicist by training, said that while researchers were working under high pressure to develop a vaccine and medication to treat the new respiratory illness, currently, the slowdown of virus was the only to deal with it. “Germany has an excellent health system, perhaps one of the best in the world,” she said. “But our hospitals, too, would be completely overwhelmed if too many patients would be delivered in too short a time.” ___ China has sent medical supplies to France to help health workers dealing with patients infected by the coronavirus and in need of masks and other protective material. The Chinese Embassy in France tweeted on Wednesday that a batch of supplies has arrived. The supplies include face masks, medical gloves and protective suits. “United we will vanquish,” the tweet concluded. China has sent supplies to Italy, the hardest hit among European countries, and to Spain. France took early action to help China, sending 17 tons of similar supplies in mid-February to Wuhan, where the COVID-19 was first detected. What French officials called a “solidarity” shipment has taken some criticism recently in France, where masks are available with difficulty for the general population. French authorities ordered citizens into confinement this week in an effort to control the virus. As of Tuesday, France registered 7,730 positive cases and 175 deaths. ___ Hungary’s prime minister has announced a series of measures meant to protect jobs and ease the effects of the coronavirus epidemic on the country’s economy. Viktor Orban said Wednesday that employers’ payroll taxes would be eliminated until June 30 in sectors already hard hit by the crisis, including tourism, hotels, entertainment, sports and taxi services. Payroll taxes for employees in those sectors also will be cut significantly. Orban also announced that all existing personal and company loans will be exempt from making principal and interest payments until the end of the year, while interest rates on new consumption loans will be capped . Labor laws will be loosened so “employers and employees can more easily reach agreements,” Orban said. Hungary has 58 confirmed cases of people infected with the new virus, with only one death linked so far to COVID-19, a 75-year-old man who was being treated for pneumonia. ___ Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has announced a 100 billion Turkish lira (US $15.4 billion) relief package in a bid to mitigate the blow from the new coronavirus outbreak. The “Economic Stability Shield” package announced Wednesday includes delaying debt payments, assisting businesses by deferring tax and social security payments and increasing the lowest pensions. Erdogan also urged citizens to adhere to government guidance and to stay at home saying: “we can limit the period of home isolation to three weeks if everyone complies to the measures with sensibility.” Turkey has reported one COVID-19 death and 98 confirmed infections. The country has suspended flights from 20 countries, closed schools and universities and shut down bars, night clubs, cafes, cinemas and gyms among other measures to contain the virus’ spread. ___ Barring a miracle, Italy will surpass China in the number of coronavirus deaths in just one more day. On Wednesday, Italy saw a record new high in the numbers of infections and deaths reported, adding more than 4,200 new cases for a total of 35,713 infections. Another 475 people died, bringing Italy’s death toll to 2,978. China, where the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged late last year, has seen 3,241 deaths, most in the hard-hit central province of Hubei. Italy has an older population than China’s, but only has 60 million people to China’s 1.4 billion people. Medical experts say the new virus is killing people over 65 at a much higher rate than other age groups. ___ A 1,000-bed Navy hospital ship will deploy to New York City to relieve pressure on hospitals treating people with COVID-19.  The ship would accept non-coronavirus patients. The news came Wednesday as New York City-area hospitals are clearing out beds, setting up new spaces to triage patients and urging people with mild symptoms to consult health professionals by phone or video chat instead of flooding emergency rooms.  Those moves come in anticipation of a huge spike in coronavirus patients. Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned that demand for hospital beds could soon outstrip capacity by tens of thousands as the outbreak surges. Virus cases in the state topped 2,300 Wednesday, with at least 20 deaths. ___ Florida now has 314 people testing positive for COVID-19 and six deaths.  Its theme parks and bars and nightclubs and many beaches are closed. An exception Wednesday was Clearwater Beach near Tampa, which was open and packed beneath clear, sunny skies.  Most groups there did seem to be sitting at least six feet (2 meters) apart from other clusters of people, but Sarah Kelley, a St. Louis grocery store section manager, agreed that visiting the beach with her two teenage sons may not have been the best idea.  “It is a great festering Petri dish,” she said. — Coronavirus deaths in the U.S. mirror what’s been reported in other countries, with about 4 out of 5 deaths occurring in people 65 and older and no deaths in kids, according to a new federal report. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the findings on Wednesday, in a look at more than 4,200 U.S. cases reported from Feb. 12 to March 16. Officials had limited information, with data on the ages of about 2,500 of them. Drawing from available information, researchers found about a third of the reported cases were in people 65 and older, but retirement-age Americans made up the bulk of people who suffered severe illness. More than half of coronavirus patients admitted to hospital intensive care units were 65 and older, the CDC reported. No one 19 or under was admitted to an ICU, the CDC said. __ Iceland is aiming to test a higher proportion of its population for the new coronavirus than any other nation in an attempt to find out more about how the COVID-19 disease spreads. The North Atlantic nation, population 360,000, has 250 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with three hospitalizations and no deaths.  Reykjavik-based biopharmaceutical company deCODE Genetics has set up a testing facility capable of gathering 1,000 samples a day and hopes to test 14,000 people – about 4% of Iceland’s population. The company said of 3,700 people tested so far, 0.8% had the virus despite showing little or no symptoms of being ill.  Iceland has quarantined 2,500 people because of possible exposure to the virus. They have been tested and about 10% were found to be infected. Stefánsson said the difference in infection rates between the general population and those in quarantine showed the effectiveness of government’s efforts.  ___ Vice President Mike Pence has called on hospitals to delay all elective procedures across the country to help ensure medical capacity is focused on stemming the spread of the coronavirus. Hospital systems in hard-hit areas, including New York and Washington state, have already begun postponing elective surgeries as they anticipate a need for more hospital beds for people diagnosed with the virus. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he would sign an executive order to postpone all elective surgeries at New York City hospitals so doctors and nurses can focus on treating patients infected with the virus. Pence said the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator Seema Verma will soon be issue federal guidance on elective procedures. — President Donald Trump says he’ll invoke the Defense Production Act to marshal the private sector in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump also says the Department Housing and Urban Development is providing immediate relief to renters and homeowners by suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April.  More than two dozen Senate Democrats have been urging Trump to invoke the Korean War-era law to increase production of needed masks, ventilators and respirators. Use of the law will also help expand hospital capacity to combat the coronavirus. Trump announced at a White House briefing Wednesday that he will sign the papers to invoke the act later in the day. The U.S. has had 116 virus-related deaths and over 7,300 infections. ___ In an unprecedented move during peacetime, the French army has started evacuating critical coronavirus patients from eastern France, the country’s worst hit region by the pandemic. French Defense Minister Florence Parly said six patients were being transferred Wednesday on an Airbus military plane in order to ease the pressure on the local hospitals of Mulhouse and Colmar. They were being moved to military hospitals in southern France. The transfer is expected to be the first of several. In an address Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that a makeshift army hospital will be constructed shortly in eastern France. It will house around 30 intensive care beds. France is Europe’s third worst-hit country in terms of fatalities from COVID-19.

"PHOENIX (AP) - As government officials across the country warn about the dangers of the coronavirus, they’re doing so predominantly in English. They’re potentially not reaching the millions of Spanish speakers in the U.S. who aren’t proficient in English to make sure they know how to stay healthy during a global pandemic. Advocacy groups and Spanish-language media have stepped up to fill in the gaps as cities and states say they’re working to translate guidance about hand washing and the effects of closing schools and businesses into the second-most spoken language in the U.S.  In Arizona, where 30% of residents are Hispanic, the Department of Health Services website offers a page with coronavirus updates - but none of the information is in Spanish. The health department was still translating coronavirus updates, Director Cara Christ said Monday. By Wednesday, there was still no Spanish. No media briefings have been broadcast in Spanish, although health officials have done Spanish-language interviews with Hispanic media.  “This has been a rapidly evolving situation and so things update almost daily,” Christ said. “We are working on getting a lot of our hard materials translated into Spanish and working on getting Spanish in our social media.”  Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a civil rights organization, said he’s not surprised that some states are behind on Spanish-language messaging, especially those like Arizona, where immigrants and Hispanics have faced hostility from laws and raids meant to crack down on illegal immigration. He said Hispanic and immigrant communities already face barriers to health care, including fear of seeking treatment because of their immigration status.  “The lack of bilingual material sort of exacerbates some of those issues that create uneven access to information and services,” Saenz said.  To help, an advocacy group is providing workers at a day labor work center in Pasadena, California, with information in Spanish to help them reduce their risk of infection and be ready in case they get sick or the government orders a lockdown. The National Day Laborer Organizing Network also streamed a radio show on social media dedicated to the virus, addressing hygiene strategies, how to talk with children about the disease and the drastic drop in hirings the center has seen. “I prefer the information in Spanish because it is our language,” said Carlos, a day laborer who was getting information at the center and didn’t want to share his last name out of fear he would be targeted by immigration authorities. “They are advising us on how to act, and how to get ready to face this, especially those of us who have children, so that we don’t take this home because the children are out of school.” Spanish-language media outlet Noticias Telemundo says it’s adding a national weekday newscast focused on the coronavirus. It’s also expanding its morning show and midday newscast to include segments on the virus.  While states have started adding Spanish to their health department websites, it can be hard to find. A day after The Associated Press asked the New Mexico governor’s office about a lack of Spanish on the health department website, it’s Spanish-language site went live and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham tweeted about it in Spanish. A purple-highlighted banner atop the website’s main page has, in small letters, a link to Spanish updates.  The nation’s most Hispanic state also has had a Spanish educator and health official at every news conference to do an interviews with Spanish-language media.  The outreach to Spanish-speaking communities has been mixed. The federal government has done little, but the CDC does have coronavirus information available in Spanish on its website, although it is hard to find.  Critics say it’s taken too long to post updates in Spanish. For example, the CDC’s Spanish-language Twitter account hasn’t tweeted about the coronavirus, instead retweeting a message about the virus from the CDC Environment account Tuesday.  In Hispanic-heavy states like Florida, many news conferences held by state officials have been bilingual, and the state health department has Spanish-speaking agents available round the clock at its coronavirus call center, spokesman Alberto Moscoso said. Washington state, which has had the most deaths in the U.S., has information and news releases posted in both English and Spanish on its health department website. Health officials there are working with a translation firm and with independent translators to get the word out in over 40 languages, spokeswoman Kathleen Meehan said.  Meehan added that it’s the first time the state health department created a community engagement task force to address things like language barriers. And while government officials have had to communicate in other languages before, such as during wildfires, the virus outbreak is unprecedented, she said.  “Our messaging isn’t effective if people can’t understand it,” Meehan said.  In the California wine region of Sonoma County, officials are giving news updates in both languages, broadcasting them on Facebook Live.  And in El Paso, Texas, where roughly 80% of residents are Hispanic, authorities have conducted news conferences in both languages. Mayor Dee Margo posts updates in Spanish and English to his official Facebook page.  Raquel Terán, an Arizona lawmaker and longtime community activist, said she asked state officials two weeks ago whether information would be delivered in Spanish. Now, as the warnings ramp up - state officials have closed all schools and continue to urge people to stay home - messaging in more than just English is essential, Terán said.  She said the state should hire Spanish translators, noting that although not all Hispanics speak Spanish, many do.  The community wants “to hear a trusted voice,” Terán said. “They want the trusted messenger in Spanish. That’s the reality.” ___ Garcia Cano reported from Washington.

"President Trump challenged a journalist on Wednesday after she accused an unnamed White House staffer of describing the coronavirus as the “Kung flu.” PBS Newshour reporter Yamiche Alcindor told Mr. Trump that “at least one White House official” had used the term, and asked him if it was wrong. “I wonder who said that,” the president replied evenly. “Do you know who said that?” “I’m not sure the person’s name,” Ms. Alcindor answered. “Say the term again,” Mr. Trump demanded. “A person at the White House used the term ‘Kung flu,’” she repeated. “Kung flu?” Mr. Trump asked. “Kung flu,” she said. “Do you think the term is wrong? And do you think using the term ‘Chinese virus’ puts Asian Americans at risk, that people will target them?” “No, not at all,” the president said, addressing her second question. “I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There’s nothing not to agree [with].” Mr. Trump then turned to the assembled reporters and said, “Okay, how about last question?” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway chided reporters who asked her about an anonymous official allegedly using the term “Kung flu.” “Excuse me!” Mrs. Conway said. “Of course it’s wrong. But you can’t just make an accusation and not tell us who it is.” A Trump campaign official, Andrew Clark, tweeted after the briefing that he “cannot stress enough how tone deaf these questions sound to literally anyone outside the press briefing room.”  ",Trump spars with reporter over accusation that staffer called coronavirus 'Kung flu'," -

"The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday slammed the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying the president has sought to “downplay” the significance of the spread. Sen. Jack Reed argued that the U.S. is behind in its approach to combating COVID-19 and pointed to the president’s stated intention to invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) which the Rhode Island Democrat said should have already been put to use. “Instead of preparing and mobilizing for this pandemic, President Trump tried to downplay it,” Mr. Reed said in a statement. “As a result, America is not as ready as we should be.” He acknowledged that the administration has taken some steps necessary to coordinate an effective response, but we’ve “got to do more.” Mr. Trump said earlier on the day he is invoking the DPA in the fight against a coronavirus that, as of Tuesday evening, has impacted all 50 states and put the White House on a “wartime” footing. The Korean War-era law gives the president broad authority to “expedite and expand the supply of resources from the U.S. industrial base to support military, energy, space and homeland security programs,” according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency website. On Tuesday, Mr. Reed urged the president to invoke the DPA and mobilize the authorities permitted by the act to alleviate stresses on the healthcare system and respond to the pandemic. “Invoking the DPA is a step in the right direction that will enable the federal government to team up with the private sector to increase the availability of needed health supplies,” he said.

"Recent editorials of statewide and national interest from Pennsylvania’s newspapers: Sunshine week reminds citizens they have a right to know what officials are up to Harrisburg Patriot News/Pennlive.com March 13 Just in time for the nationwide observance of Sunshine Week, the Pennsylvania Legislature has given us an unequivocal reminder (no irony intended, just business as usual) of why we must keep the spotlight of public scrutiny trained unrelentingly on our government. Sunshine Week, March 15-21, sponsored by several news media organizations, calls attention to the importance of government openness and accountability, and reminds citizens of the laws that ensure public access: the Sunshine (open meetings) Act and the Pennsylvania Right to Know Act. But having laws to ensure openness doesn’t guarantee it-especially, it seems, in Pennsylvania. It takes constant vigilance by citizens and journalists. Recent bad behavior by self-anointed secrecy zealots in the Legislature reminds us of that. Two media organizations, The Caucus and Spotlight PA, requested records to uncover how the Pennsylvania Legislature-the country’s largest full-time legislature-spends $360 million a year in tax dollars. The officials’ response: The House provided expense records with many redactions. When the news organizations asked for additional records, the House continued to black out expense details. At first, Senate officials also blacked out expense details. But when the news organizations submitted a new request, officials took the unprecedented step of deletingthousands of expense explanations as though they’d never existed, without acknowledging they’d done so. The expense redactions and deletions provoked protest, not only from the media, but also from many legislators, for whom the arrogance and shamelessness of the move were too much. On March 5, the House relented. Officials restored many of the redacted expense details and said they would provide more information soon. The news organizations are still pursuing the complete Senate expense records. We don’t have room to include all the damning details here, but the redactions/deletions were little more than blatant attempts to skirt the Right to Know to hide what so far looks like totally innocuous information. For example, according to Spotlight PA, information initially blacked out on a $73.31 breakfast meeting during state budget negotiations had simply stated that staffers met with “Senate leadership” to discuss the “voting calendar for the week of 6/5/2017.” Trivial things are often covered up simply as a power exercise or worse, to inure us to larger future coverups. As PBS journalist Bill Moyers said, “Secrecy is the freedom zealots dream of … The secret government has no constitution. The rules it follows are the rules it makes up.” Pennsylvania lawmakers have long been “making it up,” by skirting the law requiring public access to information. The problem now readily apparent is that public officials who routinely operate outside the law undermine the credibility essential to enlisting public support and trust during crises such as the one we now face with coronavirus. That’s why “sunshine” in government matters. Online: https://bit.ly/2UeZbpa ___ Local dirt-track programs sent wrong message, should not have been held York Dispatch March 18 Look, we get it. No one likes to be cooped up inside for days on end, especially when the weather is nice. That’s especially true in times of crisis, when we are all in desperate need of distractions. The torrent of bad news, combined with the fact that we can’t leave our homes to get away from it, can certainly lead to anxiety and depression. Still, the prudent thing to do during the coronavirus pandemic is be overly cautious, not obstinately cavalier. That’s why the decisions of three area dirt tracks (Lincoln, Port Royal and Williams Grove speedways) to hold racing programs over the weekend were the wrong moves. Yes, the regional tracks had the right to race. At the time, there was no government mandate to ban racing programs. Early this week, however, Gov. Tom Wolf “strongly urged” the shuttering of all nonessential businesses. That would certainly include the dirt tracks, although Wolf has also said he would not force the tracks to shut down. Nevertheless, racing over the weekend sent the wrong message. Future racing would send an even worse message. Need for social distancing: Nearly all of our health experts are preaching about the absolute necessity of social distancing. That’s pretty hard to achieve when fans are sitting side by side in the grandstands while watching cars go roaring around a dirt track. In fact, Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that sporting events and other large gatherings of 50 or more be called off for the next eight weeks. There were certainly more than 50 people at each of the regional tracks. There were at least hundreds of folks at each of the facilities - maybe thousands. The arguments from the racing folks: We know the arguments that are coming from the folks who attended the races. It’s a free country and we had the right to go. The conronavirus outbreak hasn’t hit this region yet and has been overstated. We’re only endangering ourselves. Countering the arguments: They are right about the first point. It’s a free country and they had the right to go, but we really don’t know if the coronavirus has hit the region yet. Not everyone in the region who is sick has been tested. In fact, it’s very likely there are coronavirus victims in our midst and we just don’t know about them yet, and there will almost certainly be coronavirus victims detected here very soon. Finally, the folks at the track were not endangering just themselves. If they were infected with the coronavirus at the track, they would be exposing everyone they met after they left the track with the disease. That would most definitely include those nearest and dearest to those race fans - their friends and family members. That is simply not right. Your freedom to unencumbered assembly ends when you start putting the health of others at risk. Independent breed: Race-car fans and drivers are a hardy and independent sort. The drivers are certainly not risk-averse. And the fans and drivers definitely don’t like anyone telling them what to do. Many of the folks at the track probably feel that the extent of the outbreak has been vastly overstated and that we, as a nation, are in panic mode. That may very well be true, but in a situation such as this, we must err on the side of caution. Going against the tide in the sports world: The rest of the organized sports world seems to understand that. Nearly every national and local event was shut down over the weekend. That includes auto racing organizations such as NASCAR, IndyCar and the World of Outlaws. In fact, only five race tracks reportedly held programs nationally last weekend and three of them were in central Pennsylvania. The dirt-track fans in the stands this past weekend would likely look at that fact with pride - proof that they are unafraid of some pesky virus. They would be wrong. We should all be afraid and we should all be cautious.

An analysis of state responses to the crisis, by the financial services site WalletHub, found that Pennsylvania has the 21st-most aggressive program among the states. It’s an aggregate rank based on prevention and containment (22), reducing risk factors and quality of health care infrastructure (25), and limiting the financial impact (33). But the state is a laggard regarding funding for health care emergency preparedness, at 47th among the states in per-resident spending. That continues a long downward trend. Last July, a State Health Access Data Assistance Center analysis found that Pennsylvania ranked 45th among the states in health care spending per person, $13, through the end of 2017. The national average at that time was $36 per resident. It reached $13 per resident after a long, steady decline from 2005, when Pennsylvania spent $29 per resident on public health. (This year the state Department of Health received a modest budget increase, from $199 million to $203 million.) As the Wolf administration orchestrates its short-term response to the current crisis, it is not too early for lawmakers to commit themselves to making public health preparedness a higher priority. And for all the rhetoric about government priorities, the surest proof of those priorities is in the budget. Online: https://bit.ly/2xS2onj ___ Fare breaks are great, but SEPTA’s funding future still cloudy The Philadelphia Inquirer March 16 Mass transit advocates cheered last week when SEPTA announced a spending plan offering cheaper rides for many users of the system, which moves nearly half a million people daily around the Philadelphia region. As outlined in SEPTA’s proposed $1.5 billion budget for fiscal year 2021, the changes include: holding base fares at $2.50; making first transfers free for many riders; and cutting fares for kids between 5 and 11 years old. The new fare schedule aims to boost ridership as the project to revamp the 125-route bus network and its connections with subways, trolleys, and Regional Rail lines gets rolling this year. Given the 2019 PEW study’s finding that using SEPTA is often more expensive than transit in comparable cities, especially for low-income people, the agency’s focus on equity is admirable and necessary. SEPTA expects to make up the resulting $9 million annual revenue loss by cutting expenses elsewhere, without cutting service. But a far more significant budget concern looms: We’re less than two years away from the loss of $450 million in state funding for SEPTA that mostly comes from Pennsylvania Turnpike revenue, which is set to expire in 2022. That could put at risk SEPTA’s efforts to continue modernizing a 2,200-square-mile system that, flaws and all, is more essential to the economy of the city, the region, and the state than ever. SEPTA derives 37% of its revenue from fares. After decades of political wrangling that pitted Philadelphia-area elected officials against the rest of Pennsylvania, state legislatures in 2007 and 2012 wisely moved to stabilize operational and capital funding - though bashing SEPTA’s need for state subsidies has long been a tradition in Harrisburg. The 2012 legislation expires in 2022. Meaning that $450 million - an amount that’s helped double the agency’s capital budget - would have to come from the state’s general fund. This prospect is so unlikely that the transit agency and other stakeholders already are organized and lobbying to find alternatives. Among them: Fees for users of ride-sharing services like Uber, direct funding by the four suburban Pennsylvania counties served by SEPTA, congestion pricing, and other fees and taxes are under review by the group of stakeholders. The Southeast Partnership for Mobility, a three-agency transportation collaborative group, is officially agnostic about what proposals are most feasible. But the report it released last May cites options that would generate revenue through new taxes and fees. Such legislation also would authorize Philadelphia and the four counties to issue bonds to fund SEPTA capital improvements. Elected officials across Pennsylvania ought to recognize that capital improvements are not just essential for replacing antiquated infrastructure, such as the Crum Creek Viaduct in Delaware County. Modernizing the trolley system, redesigning the bus network, buying new rolling stock - including hybrid and electric buses - will help make SEPTA relevant for its ridership and, therefore, more likely to be economically sustainable. The improvements are an investment in capacity, and in an economic future that will depend on the mobility mass transit makes possible. When it comes to funding SEPTA, partisanship and parochialism ought to take a backseat. Online: https://bit.ly/33qrvJu ___ What are essential businesses in Pa.? Pittsburgh Tribune-Review March 17 What does “essential” mean? It’s a question everyone needs to ask after Gov. Tom Wolf’s announcement Monday that essential businesses in Pennsylvania need to close in response to the coronavirus pandemic. “We strongly urge nonessential businesses across the commonwealth to do their part by temporarily closing as we work to flatten the curve and protect the health and safety of all Pennsylvanians,” Secretary of Community and Economic Development Dennis Davin said in a statement released by the governor’s office. Of course, there are businesses that the state sees as essential. Health care is at the top of that list. The tech services that make all the remote work being done possible. Grocery stores and gas stations. Banking and trash collection and agriculture. That makes sense. If our world is a machine - like a car - then to keep it on the road, we need the absolute basics. The tires, the engine, the transmission, the brakes. But we shouldn’t think of our entire workforce in terms of “essential” and “nonessential.” We are about to see in stark terms exactly how necessary those less-urgently-necessary jobs are - both for the people who do them and the people who depend upon them. Within days, we will all probably be desperate for a pizza at our favorite local joint. A beer with friends. A movie with someone special. A concert so loud and crowded we feel the music more than we hear it. We will have stocked our homes with enough pasta and canned goods to last weeks, but will hunger to take our kids to the Carnegie Science Center. PNC Park may have a lot of empty seats over a normal summer, but as we approach what should be baseball season, people will start to think wistfully of ballpark hot dogs. No one has a nonessential job because our lives aren’t just about essentials. We need more than food, water, clothing and shelter. We need chipped ham and the Steelers and the morning paper and an evening glass of wine and birthday parties and holidays and other people to share it all. And that’s reflected in our economy. Closing businesses will hurt us all - not just the businesses locking their doors. It means that people who can’t pay their bills won’t pay their bills, which affects people in a domino chain that shows how essential all those nonessential businesses are. It isn’t going to be easy to just go with the stripped-down chassis of either our economy or our day-to-day lives. But it isn’t being done lightly or because it’s easy to strip out our morning coffee shop stop or cheering on the Penguins at a neighborhood sports bar. “We understand that businesses are an economic driver throughout Pennsylvania, and a temporary closure will be a financial and community disruptor. DCED is committed to working with the business community to provide helpful resources for financial assistance,” said Davin. It’s because the most essential part of our world and our economy are our people. We have to protect each other.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio often don’t see eye to eye — a trend that has spilled over to their respective responses to the coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Cuomo reiterated Wednesday that he is opposed to a strict “shelter in place” policy for New York cities and said the public should take a deep breath about  “rumors” such as people won’t be allowed to leave their homes. “That’s not going to happen,’” he said. Mr. de Blasio, meanwhile, said Wednesday that residents in his city should prepare for a “shelter in place” program while acknowledging that such a policy could only happen in concert with the state. “Get ready for the possibility,” Mr. de Blasio said on NBC. “It’s a decision we would only make with the state of New York, of course. “If we even get to shelter in place, we’re going to have to come up with huge new approaches to make sure that people have enough food and medicine, because they sure as hell don’t have income right now,” he said. The phrase is a bit nebulous, but San Francisco County and several other jurisdictions in California have adopted strict standards where people are generally restricted from leaving their homes except for essential services. Mr. Cuomo spoke about a scheme where food systems, health care systems and transportation services would be shut down. “It depends how you do it,” Mr. Cuomo said. “And you close down businesses when you do shelter in place.

"President Trump said his proposed $1 trillion economic rescue package for the coronavirus will “help everybody” in the country. “We have to help everybody,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. “It was nobody’s fault — certainly none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers, planes that had no passengers and cruise ships. They can’t be blamed for this. We want to keep those companies vibrant.” He said the administration is still looking at direct payments to most Americans. Under the proposal, checks of $1,000 or more could be sent out to people around April 6 and again around May 18. The cost to the government would be about $500 billion for the direct payments. “We’re talked about those numbers, and we’re also moving those numbers in both directions,” the president said, cautioning that no decisions have been made. The Treasury Department said the cash payouts would be means-tested, meaning the amounts would be based on income level and family size. Treasury’s written rescue plan calls for an airline industry bailout of $50 billion in secured loans to passenger and cargo carriers. Limits would be placed on executive pay increases until the loans were repaid. Another $150 billion would go to other affected industries in secured loans or loan guarantees. This group would likely include hotels and cruise lines. The plan also includes $300 billion for small-business interruption loans for companies with fewer than 500 employees. Recipients would have to keep paying all their employees for eight weeks from the date of the loan. The government would guarantee 100% of payroll for six weeks, capped at $1,540 per week per employee.  ",Trump says $1 trillion coronavirus relief package will 'help everybody'," -

"SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) - Police in Bulgaria say a well-known investigative journalist has been attacked by unknown assailants near his home in Sofia. Police said Wednesday that three men wearing masks used metal bars to beat Slavi Angelov, editor-in-chief of the weekly newspaper 168 Hours, and he was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. Angelov is known for his investigative reporting on political and environmental corruption issues. The assailants did not take any of Angelov’s possessions, and investigators are examining if the attack was linked to his reporting, police said. Other journalists and human rights groups called for a swift and thorough investigation. The media freedom representative for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Harlem Desir, said in a statement that Angelov was beaten unconscious and had a leg broken during the attack, which one of the masked assailants filmed.  “This is an unacceptable act of intimidation against the journalist, which could have ended in his death,” Desir said. “Such an attack against the press cannot be tolerated.” The assault took place as media freedom has been losing ground in Bulgaria, Desir said.

The reports about Mr. Sanders’ ending his bid spiked online Wednesday after the news website Axios sent out a breaking news alert that said he was suspending his campaign, which other outlets, including Fox Business, picked up. Axios later issued a correction and tweaked the headline to indicate that Mr. Sanders had suspended some Facebook ads. Following the results Tuesday, the Sanders campaign said the 78-year-old is reassuring his campaign.

"BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Legislation banning affirmative action for state agencies, state contracting and public education headed to the Idaho governor’s desk on Wednesday. The House voted 56-14 to approve the legislation that has already passed the Senate. The Senate amended the bill to avoid losing federal funding, meaning the House had to approve the amended version. The legislation adds a new section to laws that opponents say negates another section prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or age.  Backers say the measure is needed so that everybody will be treated equally. Opponents say Idaho has a history of discriminatory behavior against marginalized groups that persists, and the measure would allow that behavior to continue.

"SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) - A recent surge in white nationalism in the U.S. has led to a growing threat of violence by factions that embrace bloodshed and advocate for a race war, according to a report released Wednesday by an organization that tracks far-right extremists. The Southern Poverty Law Center’s annual report on extremist groups said its count of white nationalist groups has risen 55% over the past three years, from 100 in 2017 to 148 in 2018 to 155 in 2019. Many of these white nationalists are embracing “accelerationism,” a fringe philosophy that promotes mass violence to fuel society’s collapse, the law center said. “In their view, political activity is pointless, and escalating violence, on a broad scale, is the only way to bring down the pluralistic, democratic society they want to destroy,” its report says. The Montgomery, Alabama-based law center described another faction of U.S. white nationalism as “mainstreamers,” who often call themselves members of the “dissident right” and are trying to appeal to a wider audience. “Much of the movement’s energy lies in the growing accelerationist wing, which, for the most part, is organized in informal online communities rather than formal groups,” the report says. Over the past few months, the FBI has arrested a string of suspects linked to white supremacist groups, including The Base and Atomwaffen Division, that have advocated for violence and a race war. The man accused of attacking two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, and killing 51 people in March 2019 devoted a section of his manifesto to the concept of accelerationism. “There is little to suggest that the violence that has accompanied the surge in white nationalism in recent years will abate,” the report says. The total number of “hate groups” counted by the law center dropped by about 8%, from a record high of 1,020 in 2018 to 940 last year. But the law center said the decline “does not reflect a significant diminishment of the radical right” given an increased activity among white nationalist groups. The law center said Donald Trump’s first presidential campaign energized white nationalists “who saw him as an avatar of their grievances and their anxiety over the country’s demographic changes.” The conspiracy theory that white people are experiencing a “great replacement” by nonwhite populations is the most powerful force driving far-right extremism, according to the law center.  “Trump didn’t create the fear of nonwhite immigrants but rather harnessed it to win the White House in 2016 and continues to nurture it by fanning the flames of resentment within the most extreme elements of the Republican base,” the report says. White House spokesman Judd Deere said that, while the administration hasn’t seen the law center’s report, “President Trump has repeatedly condemned racism, bigotry, and violence of all forms and his policies have reduced violent crime and made communities safer.” Deere also said the law center is a “far-left smear organization that only wants to libel, slander, and defame this president with its lies.” “Their comments are disgusting, particularly while the president demonstrates unprecedented leadership to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Deere said in an email. In November, the law center reported on emails that White House senior adviser Stephen Miller sent to editors at far-right Breitbart News in 2015 and 2016. The emails revealed that Miller was ”steeped in white nationalist literature and ideas,” the law center says. “It’s clear that this administration continues to invite hate into the halls of power,” law center spokeswoman Lecia Brooks said Wednesday on a conference call with reporters. Critics have accused the law center of using overly broad criteria to compile its list of hate groups. Some groups on the list have unsuccessfully sued the law center over the designation. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., dismissed a lawsuit  that accused law center leaders of trying to financially destroy one of the organizations that it has labeled as a hate group, the Center for Immigration Studies. A federal judge in Virginia ruled that the First Amendment protected a charity tracking website’s use of the law center’s hate group labels. In 2018, however, the law center apologized to a London-based group, Quilliam, and its founder, Maajid Nawaz, and agreed to pay $3.4 million in an out-of-court settlement after labeling them as anti-Muslim extremists. The law center defines a hate group as an organization that “has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics” and vilifies others because of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.

"Despite Sen. Bernie Sanders‘ lackluster performance since Super Tuesday, the self-professed democratic socialist has beefed up his presence in Joe Biden’s boyhood home state of Pennsylvania. The Vermont lawmaker opened five offices in the key swing state and staffed them with about 20 staffers last week, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. The campaign acknowledged, though, that offices may be short-lived due to the spread of the coronavirus and the campaign’s transition to digital outreach through virtual rallies and town halls. The Pennsylvania primary is scheduled for April 28, but some states have been moving primary dates to June due to fears of increased transmission COVID-19 in crowded spaces. G. Terry Madonna, the director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College, said it’s unclear if Mr. Sanders will remain in the race given the extension of some primaries despite him lagging behind Mr. Biden by hundreds of delegates in the count towards the Democratic Party’s nomination. “I don’t know if Sanders looks at the change in the primary dates will have some long term meaning for him,” Mr. Madonna said, adding it is “hard to find a way in which he can win. You just can’t find a way.” Fernand Amandi, managing partner of the public opinion research and consulting firm Bendixen & Amandi, echoed Mr. Madonna’s take, noting Mr. Sanders stayed in the race in 2016 longer against Hillary Clinton because he was still winning primaries late in the game. “Bernie has no rationale to continue running whatsoever and he only invites greater scorn,” Mr. Amandi said. “He will get out of the race. The only question is when because every additional day and hour he stays in the race he prevents Joe Biden from formally being able to take control.” After losing the primaries in Illinois, Florida, and Arizona Tuesday, Mr. Sanders’s campaign has said it is re-assessing its efforts.

"The number of pro-life Democrats on Capitol Hill is dwindling. Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois became the latest casualty of the liberal push to remake the Democratic Party after Marie Newman declared victory over him in the state’s 3rd Congressional District primary race on Tuesday. It gave the far-left activists their first scalp of the 2020 election cycle and means the next Congress could have only three pro-life Democrats. Waleed Shahid, spokesman for Justice Democrats, a progressive group, celebrated Ms. Newman’s victory. “Lipinski opposed Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, abortion, and even opposed a $15 min wage up until 2018,” Mr. Shahid said on Twitter.  “He’s the third incumbent to lose to a @justicedems-backed primary challenger after @AOC and @AyannaPressley’s victories in 2018.” Mr. Lipinski, an eight-term member of Congress, had voted with President Trump 25% of the time, according to the running analysis of votes by FiveThirtyEight.com. Sens. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts were among the high-profile progressives who endorsed Ms. Newman, who tried and failed to defeat Mr. Lipinski in 2018. Pro-life groups lamented the outcome. “Congressman Lipinski has long been a profile in courage, bucking the sad trend of Democrat leaders vying to be the greatest advocate of abortion,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. The other pro-life House Democrats are Reps. Henry Cueller of Texas, who survived a liberal primary challenge earlier this month, Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Ben McAdams of Utah.

"The Senate passed the second coronavirus relief package ramping up benefits for workers hard hit by the economic aftershocks on Wednesday, sending it to the president’s desk for approval. The bill passed on a 90-8 vote. Before passage, the Senate defeated three amendments that would have sent the bill back to the House, which is currently out on recess. Democrats wanted to shore up paid leave benefits in the package, while Republicans were pushing for more support to small businesses under immense pressure to provide those benefits. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged his colleague’s concerns with the package but urged them to address those issues in a third economic bill that lawmakers are still working to craft. “In this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,” he said before the vote. The bill mandates free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone that does if they work for a company with a cap of 500 employees. It also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and children and bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. A corrected version passed the House Monday evening, tweaking paid leave provisions. Though there is still no official price tag on the house bill, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it will cost nearly $105 billion.  ",Senate passes second coronavirus relief package ," -

"Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld ended his long-shot primary challenge to President Trump on Wednesday, a day after Mr. Trump racked up enough delegates to officially clinch the 2020 Republican nomination. “While I am suspending my candidacy, I want to be clear that I am not suspending my commitment to our nation and to the democratic institutions that set us apart,” Mr. Weld said. Mr. Weld, the Libertarian Party’s 2016 vice presidential nominee, never posed a serious threat to Mr. Trump as the president cruised to easy wins in states where Republicans didn’t cancel or curtail their nominating contests. He was one of three prominent GOP primary challengers to Mr. Trump, though none of them could muster much momentum against the unquestioned leader of the Republican Party. Former Rep. Joe Walsh ended his bid in February, shortly after the Iowa caucuses. Former Rep. Mark Sanford pulled the plug on his campaign in November after announcing in September he would enter the race.

"President Trump challenged a journalist on Wednesday after she accused an unnamed White House staffer of describing the coronavirus as the “Kung flu.” PBS Newshour reporter Yamiche Alcindor told Mr. Trump that “at least one White House official” had used the term, and asked him if it was wrong. “I wonder who said that,” the president replied evenly. “Do you know who said that?” “I’m not sure the person’s name,” Ms. Alcindor answered. “Say the term again,” Mr. Trump demanded. “A person at the White House used the term ‘Kung flu,’” she repeated. “Kung flu?” Mr. Trump asked. “Kung flu,” she said. “Do you think the term is wrong? And do you think using the term ‘Chinese virus’ puts Asian Americans at risk, that people will target them?” “No, not at all,” the president said, addressing her second question. “I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There’s nothing not to agree [with].” Mr. Trump then turned to the assembled reporters and said, “Okay, how about last question?” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway chided reporters who asked her about an anonymous official allegedly using the term “Kung flu.” “Excuse me!” Mrs. Conway said. “Of course it’s wrong. But you can’t just make an accusation and not tell us who it is.” A Trump campaign official, Andrew Clark, tweeted after the briefing that he “cannot stress enough how tone deaf these questions sound to literally anyone outside the press briefing room.”  ",Trump spars with reporter over accusation that staffer called coronavirus 'Kung flu',"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/trump-spars-reporter-over-accusation-staffer-calle/,washington_times
"President Trump said his proposed $1 trillion economic rescue package for the coronavirus will “help everybody” in the country. “We have to help everybody,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. “It was nobody’s fault — certainly none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers, planes that had no passengers and cruise ships. They can’t be blamed for this. We want to keep those companies vibrant.” He said the administration is still looking at direct payments to most Americans. Under the proposal, checks of $1,000 or more could be sent out to people around April 6 and again around May 18. The cost to the government would be about $500 billion for the direct payments. “We’re talked about those numbers, and we’re also moving those numbers in both directions,” the president said, cautioning that no decisions have been made. The Treasury Department said the cash payouts would be means-tested, meaning the amounts would be based on income level and family size. Treasury’s written rescue plan calls for an airline industry bailout of $50 billion in secured loans to passenger and cargo carriers. Limits would be placed on executive pay increases until the loans were repaid. Another $150 billion would go to other affected industries in secured loans or loan guarantees. This group would likely include hotels and cruise lines. The plan also includes $300 billion for small-business interruption loans for companies with fewer than 500 employees. Recipients would have to keep paying all their employees for eight weeks from the date of the loan. The government would guarantee 100% of payroll for six weeks, capped at $1,540 per week per employee.

"President Trump’s attempted truce with the media over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak has ended. After several days of offering unusual praise of the media for covering him fairly, Mr. Trump on Wednesday blasted the press for coverage portraying him as taking the pandemic seriously too late. He also challenged a journalist after she accused an unnamed White House staffer of describing the coronavirus as the “kung flu,” and dismissed repeated questions from reporters of alleged racism. “The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!” Mr. Trump tweeted. “I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the ‘borders’ from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved.” On camera, Mr. Trump seemed to be trying not to take the bait when reporters repeatedly asked if he was being “racist” for calling the virus “the Chinese virus.” The virus originated in Wuhan, China. “It’s not racist at all,” Mr. Trump said. “It comes from China.” PBS Newshour reporter Yamiche Alcindor told Mr. Trump that “at least one White House official” had used the term, and asked him if it was wrong. “I wonder who said that,” the president replied evenly. “Do you know who said that?” “I’m not sure the person’s name,” Ms. Alcindor answered. “Say the term again,” Mr. Trump demanded. “A person at the White House used the term ‘kung flu,’” she repeated. “Kung flu?” Mr. Trump asked. “Kung flu,” she said. “Do you think the term is wrong? And do you think using the term ‘Chinese virus’ puts Asian Americans at risk, that people will target them?” “No, not at all,” the president said, addressing her second question. “I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There’s nothing not to agree [with].” Said one White House staffer, “Any leader in this situation would want to project calm. We have something huge that we’re dealing with right now. He’s pushing back [with the media] where necessary. It’s a balance.” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway chided reporters who asked her about an anonymous official allegedly using the term “kung flu.” “Excuse me!” Mrs. Conway said. “Of course it’s wrong. But you can’t just make an accusation and not tell us who it is.” A Trump campaign official, Andrew Clark, tweeted after the briefing that he “cannot stress enough how tone deaf these questions sound to literally anyone outside the press briefing room.” White House aides also expressed frustration with the media’s priorities. One staffer called the questions about racism “petty and counterproductive.” “This [calling it the ‘Wuhan virus’] is not something that the left media hasn’t used,” the aide said. The developments quickly ended what might have qualified as a brief era of good feelings for Mr. Trump with the media. On Tuesday, the president had sounded generally pleased with the press coverage of his response to the pandemic. “We’re all in this together, including you, and we want to see fair press,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “And I tell you what: Generally speaking, I think it’s been — it’s been a great thing to see.” On Monday, he said of the press, “I think a lot of the media actually has been very fair.  I think people are pulling together on this.” The White House aide said Mr. Trump had been “trying to get them [the media] to work with us.” Several aides have noted that even Democratic governors who have been openly hostile to Mr. Trump, and vice versa, such as Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, have been largely complimentary of the president and cooperative in the crisis. “Even these people, who are so politically divided most of the time, can come together,” an aide said. But with the media, the president seemed to be back at a combative square one. The last question at the president’s coronavirus briefing came from a journalist who told the president that even “before the pandemic, there were a lot of Americans that were already alienated. We saw depths of despair increasing through suicide and other things.” With those same despondent Americans now self-isolating from the virus, he asked Mr. Trump, what was his message to them? “To those Americans who are going through a lot, we love them, we’re with them and we will not let them down,” Mr. Trump said.

"The vaunted U.S. military-industrial machine is venturing into the unknown as the coronavirus continues its spread across the country, sector leaders said Wednesday, with the global pandemic threatening to slow down innovation and disrupt key supply chains. Amid grumbling from some in the private sector, Pentagon officials and military contractors insist they have been in daily communication as they seek ways to keep the industry fully up and running and to ensure the Defense Department has access to the equipment it needs to protect U.S. national security. Top Pentagon officials this week instituted daily meetings with industry leaders, and military officials told reporters Wednesday that so far the coronavirus has not caused major slowdowns or otherwise harmed  operations. But the industry is bracing for a worst-case scenario, one in which the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic — coupled with the military’s diversion of resources toward helping the federal and state governments cope with rising numbers of patients and demands on the country’s medical infrastructure — stretches into the summer and beyond. Boeing, which has both commercial and defense operations, this week came out in favor of an emergency government loan and subsidy program of “a minimum of $60 billion” for the aerospace manufacturing industry. Lockheed Martin, told the Pentagon this week it has had to shut down a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Japan factory where the F-35 fighter jet is assembled for at least a week because of virus fears. “The unknown — if you look at the stock market, if you look at earnings, innovation, all of those things, there’s just a feeling of unknown. We don’t know,” said retired Air Force Gen. Herbert “Hawk” J. Carlisle, now the president and CEO National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA). “My belief is in the next two to three weeks [if] we’re able to flatten the curve, and we’re making progress on a vaccine going forward, and medication, and we’ve handled it appropriately … I think it’ll take a while for the economy to recover, but that to me is less concerning,” he told The Washington Times in an interview. “If it’s 10 to 12 months, I think we as a nation are going to have to work hard. And that concerns me more.” While top defense industry contractors such as Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and others say they’re open for business while also taking steps to protect employees and stop the spread of the virus, Gen. Carlisle concedes the industry has already felt blowback. He said key industry symposiums, conferences and events — often the most fertile ground for companies to pitch ideas to military officials and brainstorm new projects — have been canceled or postponed. The Pentagon’s laser-like focus on the coronavirus also means that there’s likely to be fewer opportunities over the next few months for military leaders to spend time meeting with industry representatives on new proposals and initiatives. For Pentagon leaders, the potential consequences are already crystal clear.Ellen Lord, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, on Tuesday asked NDIA, the Aerospace Industries Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a host of other organizations to be part of a core team that will meet daily with the goal of keeping the supply chain up and running.Military officials say that so far there’s been limited impact. “Right now, to date, we’ve not seen a limitation that’s caused us to pause or affect operations in any way. But this is a concern going forward,” Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein told reporters at the Pentagon Wednesday. “Companies have got to figure out how to keep their [production] lines open with their own social distancing and their own procedures to protect their work force.” Indeed, defense firms say they’re instituting the same kinds of safeguards and social distancing protocols that have become commonplace across the U.S. over the past several weeks. “Employees with potential exposure are instructed to work remotely and self-quarantine. We have provided guidance to employees and their managers to accommodate flexible work schedules and alternative arrangements where possible,” Lockheed Martin spokesman Trent Perrotto told Defense News this week. “We continue to follow travel guidance from the U.S. government and other countries where we do business, and are limiting all other international and domestic travel unless necessary for business.” Gen. Carlisle said those policies are in place across the sector. But he also cautioned that teleworking is difficult if not impossible for employees working on sensitive or classified projects. Social distancing inside production facilities, he said, also could lead to slowdowns, especially if the rules remain in place for months. “They’re probably going to separate people with social distancing, which will slow down production lines,” Gen. Carlisle said. “Industry is working hard to do the right thing.”  ",Defense industry braces for unknown fallout from virus,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/defense-industry-braces-unknown-fallout-virus/,washington_times

However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus,” he said in a statement. The House finished up work early Saturday morning and sent lawmakers home, but Mr. Diaz-Balart said he self-quarantined in Washington to protect his wife back in Florida. She has pre-existing conditions that put her at high risk should she contract the virus. Mr. Diaz-Balart did not say whether he knew from whom he contracted the disease.

"Sens. Marco Rubio, chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, and Susan Collins proposed a $300 billion relief package Wednesday to aid small businesses. “The goal is to keep employees connected to their employers,” Mr. Rubio, Florida Republican, said. The plan, which is still being written out, would provide federally guaranteed loans through approved banks for about six to eight weeks for employers to use for payroll and other typical expenses to stay afloat. The loans could potentially be forgiven at the end of the period, Ms. Collins, Maine Republican, said, if the funds were used to sustain employees. “We want to make sure that businesses that would otherwise be thriving and doing well make it through this pandemic that we are enduring,” she said. “When this crisis is over we want those employees to be able to go back to work at those small businesses.” Many small businesses across the nation are being shuttered to help enforce the social distancing practices urged by health professionals. This proposal would be part of the “phase three” coronavirus economic stimulus package, which lawmakers across Capitol Hill are still working to put together. The second bill just cleared the Senate Wednesday afternoon, with many Republicans unhappy with the pressure the worker benefits put on small businesses. Republicans are simultaneously working on drafting proposals to get more cash to the American public and shore up health care resources. The White House is also pushing for aid to hard-hit sectors like the airline and cruise industries. Democrats, however, are calling for Republicans to include them in the talks now, rather than waiting for negotiations further in the process. “Secretary Mnuchin says he wants legislation passed by the end of the week. The McConnell process will not get us there,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said. Mr. Schumer called for at least $750 billion that would go towards shoring up hospital resources, affordability of coronavirus treatment, fund public transportation and emergency child care and pause payments on loans immediately. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants the third bill to expand on benefits for workers, including ensuring first responders and health workers have paid leave if they need it. She also wants refundable tax credits for self-employed and gig economy workers. Mr. Rubio and Ms. Collins, however, said they’re trying to bring in Democrats on this proposal in the early stages. They’re aiming to circulate a draft of the bill by Thursday. “There’s no reason this should be a partisan exercise,” Ms. Collins said. “In fact, I would say if we cannot come together in a bipartisan way to form a response to such a serious threat to our public health and our economy than shame on us.” The Senate has vowed not to leave Washington until the next package is constructed and passed.

"Multiple news organizations continue to peddle the convenient narrative that the public is turning against President Trump as the stock market plummets. A major pollster says otherwise. “Coronavirus pandemic has yet to impact views on Trump’s handling of economy as half of voters back Trump’s economic performance, matching precrisis numbers from January,” reports Eli Yokely, a political analyst for Morning Consult. “Last week’s turmoil in the stock market and growing concerns about the long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. economy have not shaken voters’ views on President Trump’s chief selling point as he faces reelection this fall.” And the numbers: “a new Morning Consult/Politico poll, conducted March 13-16, found that half of voters approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, statistically similar to findings from polls conducted in the first two months of the year. The figure exceeds his overall approval rating by 7 percentage points and is driven by positive sentiment among nearly 9 in 10 Republicans and a plurality of independents,” Mr. Yokely said. The survey also found Mr. Trump enjoying a 6-point advantage over his presumptive challenger, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden on jobs and the economy — priority issues for large majority of voters. HERE’S WHY TRUMP SAYS ‘CHINESE VIRUS’ Some timely observations from former U.S. Attorney Andrew C. McCarthy, who cites the “manufactured controversy” over President Trump’s use of the terms “Wuhan” or “Chinese” virus. Journalists and other critics who object to the terms are overlooking an important legal aspect of the matter, he says — and the phrase does not suggest a racist attitude. “Congress has vested the president with this authority when a threat to the security and public health of any part of the United States is sufficiently grave to warrant a federal response. In our constitutional system, there are certain situations and categories of activity that automatically trigger federal authority. Most prominent among these are foreign relations, foreign incursions, border security, and matters related to foreign commerce, as well as commerce between the states — which, obviously, may be impacted by foreign commerce,” writes Mr. McCarthy in The Hill. “Consequently, the origination of the virus in China and its transcontinental spread across the globe are highly relevant. They rationalize the president’s authority to address the emergency with Washington’s awesome resources,” Mr. McCarthy says. “Not only did history and common sense justify the administration (among others) in noting the origin of the Wuhan coronavirus. Doing so was a legal necessity if the imperative of federal support for beleaguered state governments was to be fulfilled,” he advises. HABITUAL: NEWS MEDIA REMAINS RELENTLESS And so it continues. Some members of the press — including CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash — have offered guarded praise of President Trump’s response to the coronavirus. Most news organizations, however, continue to criticize the president, even at such a pivotal time. A few scant headlines from the last 24 hours: “Trump’s instincts undermine U.S. response to COVID-19” (The Atlantic); “Trump’s new pandemic drumbeat: ‘Chinese virus’” (Politico); “This is the biggest blunder in presidential history” (The Washington Post); “Trump’s ‘Chinese virus’ tweets echo his Mexico insults — with similar results” (NBC News); and “David Plouffe on potential second Trump term: We may not survive it” (MSNBC). THANK A TRUCKER Not overlooked: #ThankaTrucker — A new hashtag has emerged to praise American truck drivers who remain on the roads during the coronavirus crisis. “Truckers are an important link keeping hospitals, grocery stores and everything in between supplied in spite of the virus. They are moms and dads, husbands and wives. They are some of the hardest working, patriotic people in the country moving virtually all of the goods,” tweeted Sen. Mike Enzi, Wyoming Republican. ‘Next time you see a trucker, thank her or him,” the lawmaker said. The American Trucking Association in a statement: “We urge shippers and receivers to treat them with the courtesy, dignity and respect they deserve. We call on government officials to provide them with the flexibility and resources they need to get the job done,” the organization said. “But there’s one thing all Americans can do right now: Thank a trucker. Especially during trying times like these. Because without them, the disruptions we’re experiencing would be something much, much worse.” POLLSTERS STEP UP Even pollsters are rising to the coronavirus challenge. Ipsos, a major global polling firm, has partnered with news organization Axios to produce a “COVID-19 pandemic weekly tracking poll” to offer some insight. “We expect next week’s poll will reflect the drastic changes in behavior, as the reality of the virus modifies our day-to-day life,” the poll analysis noted. The debut survey found that 49% of Americans don’t have very much trust — or no trust at all — in cable news to provide accurate information on COVID-19. Another 74% feel the same way about social media. Another 53%, however, trust the federal government for accurate information. In addition, 64% of respondents have stopped shaking hands with others, 51% have not visited friends or relatives and 43% skipped going out to eat. The Axios/Ipsos poll of 1,092 U.S. adults was conducted March 13-16. POLL DU JOUR • 48% of U.S. voters think Sen. Bernard Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden should “cancel upcoming campaign events for the Democratic presidential nomination”; 48% of Republicans, 45% of independents, 50% of Democrats agree. • 27% of voters overall think Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden “should continue campaigning for the presidential nomination”; 27% of Republicans, 26% of independents and 29% of Democrats agree. • 25% overall don’t know or have no opinion; 26% of Republicans, 30% of independents and 21% of Democrats agree.

"The Senate approved a $105 billion bill Wednesday to provide sick leave from the COVID-19 pandemic while the administration forged ahead with a $1.3 trillion plan to help out-of-work Americans and to rescue the cratering economy, as stocks sustained another massive sell-off that halted trading briefly for the fourth time in two weeks. The Senate voted 90-8 to send the measure, considered “phase two” of the government’s response, to the president’s desk. It provides free coronavirus testing, two weeks of paid sick and family leave, increased funding for Medicaid and food stamps, and increased unemployment insurance. The deal also frees up the Senate to address what is likely to become one of the costliest emergency spending packages in history, to bail out industries shuttered by the pandemic and put cash into Americans’ pockets quickly. The flurry of activity in Washington showed no signs of reassuring Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,338 points, or 6.3%, to close at 19,898, although the index was down more than 2,000 points earlier in the day. The S&P 500 fell 5.1% and at one point dropped more than 7% to trigger an automatic trading halt for the fourth time in two weeks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 4.7%. Oil prices dropped 24% to an 18-year low on fears of the pandemic. The New York Stock Exchange also announced Wednesday that it was closing its famed “pit,” temporarily suspending in-person trading and requiring all transactions to be electronic, starting Monday. “The decision to temporarily close the trading floors represents a precautionary step to protect the health and well-being of employees and the floor community in response to COVID-19,” Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which runs the exchange, said in a statement. Hoping to stem the rout in stocks, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin scheduled an appearance on Fox Business Network with host Maria Bartiromo for Thursday morning before the markets were to open. He was expected to provide an update on negotiations for speeding up congressional action on the bailout plan. As for the rest of the economy, President Trump said his administration’s proposed $1.3 trillion fiscal rescue package will “help everybody” in the country. It calls for two rounds of direct payments to most Americans, in April and May, based on their income. “We have to help everybody,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. “It was nobody’s fault — certainly none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers, planes that had no passengers and cruise ships. They can’t be blamed for this. We want to keep those companies vibrant.” The downturn was accelerating. Ford and General Motors announced they would close at least through the end of the month. Fiat Chrysler was expected to follow suit. With the unemployment rate at 3.5% in February, Mr. Trump addressed a reported comment by Mr. Mnuchin in a private meeting with Senate Republicans that failure to enact the mammoth government rescue plan could risk a rise in unemployment to 20%. “I don’t agree with that,” Mr. Trump said. “That’s an absolute, total, worst-case scenario. We’re nowhere near it.” Under the administration’s proposal, checks of $1,000 or more would be sent to people around April 6 and again around May 18. The cost to the Treasury would be about $500 billion. “We’ve talked about those numbers, and we’re also moving those numbers in both directions,” the president said, cautioning that no decisions had been made. The Treasury Department said the cash payouts would be means-tested, meaning the amounts would be based on income level and family size. Treasury’s written rescue plan calls for an airline industry bailout of $50 billion in secured loans to passenger and cargo carriers. Limits would be placed on executive pay increases until the loans are repaid. Another $150 billion would go to other affected industries in secured loans or loan guarantees. This group would likely include hotels and cruise lines. Bus companies also made a plea for help. The American Bus Association said its operators will likely lose $8 billion over the next five months as charter and tour bus business evaporates at their busiest time of the year. The bailout plan also includes $300 billion for small-business interruption loans for companies with fewer than 500 employees. Recipients would have to keep paying all their employees for eight weeks from the date of the loan. The government would guarantee 100% of payroll for six weeks, capped at $1,540 per week per employee. The proposal has yet to gain the approval of Senate Republicans, much less House Democrats. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who acknowledged the rapidly shifting sands of the economic downturn, said the bailout package could still grow in cost. “If it takes more than that, we will do more than that,” he said on Fox News. “During crises or wars, you have to sort of not worry about borrowing.” David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth, called it “a responsible plan to provide assistance to struggling industry by offering loans instead of blindly handing over billions in taxpayer dollars in government grants.” Some were calling on the White House to take even more drastic action. Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, urged the president to shut down the country for 30 days to contain the coronavirus. He said it’s the only option to rescue the economy. “What’s scaring the American people and corporate America now is the gradual rollout,” Mr. Ackman said on CNBC. “We need to shut it down now. … This is the only answer. America will end as we know it. I’m sorry to say so, unless we take this option.” Mr. Trump held several conference calls and meetings with affected workers and businesses, including nurses. Vice President Mike Pence praised the health care providers for their service and said their safety is “in the forefront of the president’s mind.” The president also held a call with the Business Roundtable, which represents major companies nationwide with 15 million workers. The group told Mr. Trump in a letter that the rescue plan will have “enormous costs,” but “failure to act boldly now will impose far greater costs to our country and our future.” The Department of Housing and Urban Development on Wednesday authorized the Federal Housing Administration to freeze all foreclosures and evictions for single-family homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages for the next 60 days. “Today’s actions will allow households who have an FHA-insured mortgage to meet the challenges of COVID-19 without fear of losing their homes, and help steady market concerns,” said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. Voting against the paid leave bill were eight Republicans: Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, James M. Inhofe and James Lankford of Oklahoma, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Tim Scott of South Carolina. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, acknowledged his colleagues’ concerns with the package but urged them to address those issues in the third, larger economic bill that lawmakers are still crafting. “In this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,” he said before the vote.

"Pro-life Democrats say their party’s full embrace of abortion rights has them feeling alienated and considering sitting out the November election. That feeling accelerated this week after far-left activists and pro-choice groups helped power Marie Newman to victory over Rep. Dan Lipinski — one of the few remaining pro-life Democrats in the House. Kirsten Day, executive director of Democrats for Life of America, said pro-life Democrats already a bad taste in their mouth after Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said every Democrat should be pro-choice and the likely presidential nominee, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, reversed his longtime support of the Hyde Amendment legislation that bars the use of taxpayer funding for most abortions. “There is going to be a number of pro-life Democrats who are not going to go out and vote for Joe Biden,” Ms. Day said. “They may not vote for Trump but they are not going to come out for Biden.” “He doesn’t have the courage that Dan Lipinski has. Dan was pro-life and he just never caved, no matter how he was treated by his party,” she said. “Contrast that with Joe Biden — one day he said ‘yes, he still supports the Hyde Amendment’ and 12 hours later he flip-flopped.” “Where is the courage there?” she said. Mr. Lipinski was a top target of the liberal activists and powerful outside groups — including pro-choice groups such as Planned Parenthood Action Fund, NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC, and EMILY’s List. Such far-left party champions as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sens. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts backed her bid. Pro-Newman groups spent over $1.5 million on race, funneling roughly $600,000 into attacks that painted Mr. Lipinski as, among other things, an anti-abortion extremist. The other pro-life Democrats in the House are Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas, Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Ben McAdams of Utah. The Newman win gave liberal activists their first ouster of the year, and a reason to celebrate in an otherwise underwhelming election cycle for their cause. They tried and failed to unseat Mr. Cuellar. They also watched Ms. Warren’s presidential campaign end and Mr. Sanders’s presidential aspirations now on life support. “This is a critical victory for the progressive movement in showing that voters are ready for a new generation of progressive leadership in the Democratic Party,” said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats. “This isn’t just a loss for one incumbent,” she said. “It’s a defeat for machine politics and big corporate donors who want to stop our movement for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and reproductive rights.” Mr. Lipinski had voted with President Trump 25% of the time, according to a running analysis of votes by FiveThirtyEight.com. Pro-life groups lamented the outcome. “Congressman Lipinski has long been a profile in courage, bucking the sad trend of Democrat leaders vying to be the greatest advocate of abortion,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List.

"JERUSALEM (AP) - With the Israeli government enacting a series of emergency measures to stem the spread of the new coronavirus, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing growing accusations that he is exploiting the crisis to entrench himself in power and undermining the country’s democratic foundations. Amid a wave of sweeping restrictions that have put Israel in near shutdown mode, Netanyahu has managed to postpone his own pending criminal trial, authorize unprecedented electronic surveillance of Israeli citizens and block parliament from pressing ahead with legislation aimed at pushing him from office. The moves, on the heels of the country’s third inconclusive election in less than a year and under the shadow of Netanyahu’s corruption indictment, sparked leading opposition figure Yair Lapid to tell Israeli citizens that they “no longer live in a democracy.” “There is no judicial branch in Israel. There is no legislative branch in Israel. There is only an unelected government that is headed by a person who lost the election. You can call that by a lot of names, it isn’t a democracy,” he said in a recorded video.  The new coronavirus has spread to more than 100 countries, infected more than 217,000 people worldwide and killed more than 8,700. For most people, it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. Israeli health officials have diagnosed over 400 coronavirus cases, roughly a quarter of them detected in the last 24 hours.  With the numbers quickly rising, authorities have issued a series of tough guidelines that have brought the country to a standstill. People have been instructed to stay home, tens of thousands are in home quarantine and foreigners have been banned from entering the country. Most controversially, the Israeli government instructed the shadowy Shin Bet internal security service to start deploying the agency’s phone surveillance technology to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus in Israel by tracking the moves of the infected.  Israel uses phone surveillance in the occupied Palestinian territories, saying it’s an important tool to prevent attacks on Israelis, but critics say it’s also aimed at maintaining tight control. The surveillance in Israel has sparked widespread criticism from lawmakers and civil rights groups. Opponents planned to file a Supreme Court challenge on Thursday. Many of the measures are not unique to Israel. In neighboring Jordan, King Abdullah II has shut the country’s court system and parliament, as part of an effort to stem the outbreak. Abdullah, who is not elected, appears to have won wide public support for his handling of the crisis. The British government plans to introduce a bill in Parliament on Thursday that will give authorities stronger powers to respond to the pandemic. Many of these are relatively uncontroversial - like allowing retired doctors to return to work without taking a hit on their pensions. But critics have raised questions about some proposals, including a move to give police and immigration officers “powers to detain people and put them in appropriate isolation facilities if necessary to protect public health.” The emergency legislation is due to have a two-year time limit, but opposition lawmakers want a shorter cut-off date. In Israel, Netanyahu has thrived in the crisis, delivering stern televised addresses to the nation each evening.  Presenting himself as the responsible adult steering the country through an unprecedented crisis, he has defended the tough steps, including the electronic surveillance, as measures that he has reluctantly been forced to impose to save lives while his opponents are focused on petty politics.  In a televised interview Wednesday, Netanyahu said that during his 11 years as prime minister, he had previously always refused to use surveillance on Israeli citizens. He said there would be “maximum oversight” to protect privacy concerns. “The last thing I will do is harm democracy,” he said. The liberal Haaretz daily responded Wednesday with a lead editorial titled “An Epidemic of Surveillance.” “Under the cover of the battle against the spread of the coronavirus, Interim Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concentrating more and more power in his hands, with neither balances nor supervision,” it wrote. “At this time of emergency, and in order to keep from sliding down the slippery slope, it is critical to maintain proportionality and oversight.” Following the March 2 election, Netanyahu has the support of only 58 lawmakers, leaving him three short of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset. Sixty-one lawmakers have come out in support of his opponent, Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz, while one refuses to endorse either side.  Backed by a narrow majority, Gantz, a former military chief, was tasked by Israel’s president this week to try to form a new government.  In the meantime, Netanyahu has used a series of executive orders and other tactics to push forward his agenda while preventing parliament from convening. The phone-surveillance plan was approved by the Cabinet in the middle of the night, without the traditional parliamentary oversight that is customary for such decisions.  Blue and White politician Gabi Ashkenazi, another former military chief who was supposed to oversee the committee, called Netanyahu’s move a “heist in the dead of night.”  Blue and White has also taken aim at Netanyahu and his Likud party for preventing the newly elected parliament from convening under the guise of virus-related restrictions on public gatherings.  On Wednesday, Parliament Speaker Yuli Edelstein, a member of Likud, abruptly adjourned the Knesset, freezing Blue and White’s plans to appoint new committees and advance legislation that could limit Netanyahu’s time in office. President Reuven Rivlin warned the country’s democratic system was being threatened. Netanyahu and Gantz held an emergency meeting this week to discuss the possibility of establishing a unity government to end the prolonged political paralysis. But progress appeared unlikely as they continued to bicker. Earlier this week, Netanyahu’s hand-picked justice minister, in the middle of the night, declared a state of emergency in the court system a day before Netanyahu’s trial was to begin. The decree, citing the coronavirus crisis, postponed Netanyahu’s trial until May. In his TV interview, Netanyahu lashed back at his critics. “While I manage the war against the coronavirus and the fight for saving the lives of citizens of Israel,” he said, ”they are only planning how to depose a prime minister.” Netanyahu critics have suggested that the crisis landed on the prime minister’s lap at just the right time. “The coronavirus will pass at some point or another,” commentator Ben Caspit wrote in Maariv. “After we bury our dead, we are also going to have to administer last rites to our democracy.” ____ Follow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London and Omar Akour in Amman contributed to this report.

"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Iran’s top leader will pardon 10,000 more prisoners in an apparent effort to combat the coronavirus, state TV reported Thursday.  As part of steps to curb the spread of the new virus that has killed more than 1,100 people in Iran, the country has already released 85,000 prisoners on temporary leave.  Separately, the United Arab Emirates added to its list of people barred from entering all residents who are currently abroad. The decision impacts people whose homes, children, bank accounts and livelihoods are in the country, but who were traveling or outside the country. The ban goes into effect at mid-day Thursday for at least two weeks. Only Emirati citizens are allowed to return. The UAE, which is home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has 113 confirmed cases of the virus. It announced it was suspending all new labor permits, including those for drivers and domestic workers, until “further notice.”  The UAE is unique in that only about 10% of its population, or about 1 million people, are Emirati citizens. The other 90% are foreign residents who fuel its economy and keep the country running. They hold the vast majority of jobs in construction, transportation, hospitality, sales, medicine, education and other key sectors. The Middle East has some 20,000 cases of the virus, with most in Iran or originating from Iran.  For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. To encourage people to stay at home in Iran, Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour wrote on social media that the virus infects 50 Iranians on average every single hour and that “one dies every 10 minutes .” “Make smart decisions about travel, visits and meetings,” he wrote on Twitter, as highways remained crowded with people traveling to see family ahead of the Iranian New Year on Friday. State TV quoted judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili as saying that 10,000 prisoners - among them an unknown number of inmates whose cases are political and related to activism or speech - would be granted amnesty under a decree by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the occasion of the new year, called Nowruz. Occasionally Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, pardons prisoners. Last year, he pardoned more than 50,000 on the 40th anniversary of 1979 Islamic Revolution. Western nations have urged Iran to release dual nationals and others, alleging they are used as bargaining chips in negotiations. Among those temporarily freed was Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, an Iranian-British dual national long held on internationally criticized charges. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the charitable Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in 2016 on charges of trying to topple the government while traveling with her toddler daughter. In Pakistan, shrines of Sufi saints in the capital Islamabad and elsewhere were closed. Visits to museums, archaeological and tourist sites were banned as the number of cases of coronavirus jumped to 301, mostly among pilgrims returning from Iran.  Two people who were tested positive upon their return from Saudi Arabia and Dubai became the first victims of the virus in Pakistan when they died Wednesday in the northwest.  ___ Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The wife of Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that she’s facing the same problems as millions of other Californians who are dealing with empty store shelves, closed schools and home confinement as social distancing measures take hold to slow the spread of the coronavirus. “One rose amidst all of this - family dinners and no late night homework stress,” tweeted Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who has four young children. “And nice to not have kids shuffling home late from sports and activities. And yes, unfortunately the thorn - we run out of toilet paper, paper towels, and Kleenex tomorrow. I wish people had not hoarded.” Her remarks were met with scorn. Several critics responded with the famous line attributed to Marie Antoinette: “Let them eat cake!” “Yes, lovely isn’t it?,” replied another. “Shame about grandma’s hideous death, but we got some pajama time with the kiddos!” “And having to step over the homeless on your way to search for toilet paper must be an added stress for you,” said another respondent, who added an eye-rolling emoji. “Poor darling!” said another tweet. “Maybe you can send the state patrol out to appropriate some from the peasants.” Eleven Northern California counties and the Southern California city of Palm Springs have told residents to stay home, except to buy groceries, visit the doctor or do anything deemed essential. Virtually all schools around the state have closed classrooms for several weeks, and Gov. Newsom has said that they may need to remain shut for the rest of the school year. Newsom also has encouraged people 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions to stay indoors. He’s also called for the shutdown of bars, movie theaters, gyms and other gathering places, and for restaurants to only serve food to go - restrictions already in place in Los Angeles and several other major cities.

The group told Mr. Trump in a letter that the rescue plan will have “enormous costs,” but “failure to act boldly now will impose far greater costs to our country and our future.” The Department of Housing and Urban Development on Wednesday authorized the Federal Housing Administration to freeze all foreclosures and evictions for single-family homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages for the next 60 days. “Today’s actions will allow households who have an FHA-insured mortgage to meet the challenges of COVID-19 without fear of losing their homes, and help steady market concerns,” said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. Voting against the paid leave bill were eight Republicans: Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, James M. Inhofe and James Lankford of Oklahoma, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Tim Scott of South Carolina. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, acknowledged his colleagues’ concerns with the package but urged them to address those issues in the third, larger economic bill that lawmakers are still crafting. “In this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,” he said before the vote.

"BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Legislation that would compensate the wrongly convicted headed to the governor’s desk on Wednesday. The House voted 64-1 to approve the amended measure from the Senate that would pay $60,000 a year for wrongful incarceration and $75,000 per year on death row. Backers say the state needs to take responsibility when an innocent person is incarcerated. Idaho is one of 15 states that doesn’t compensate people sent to prison for crimes they didn’t commit. Idaho has several notable cases including Christopher Tapp. He was convicted of rape and murder following the 1996 death of Angie Dodge. He was released in 2017, and DNA evidence cleared him in 2019. Brian Leigh Dripps was arrested on DNA evidence last year and is charged with rape and murder in Dodge’s death. Another former inmate who could benefit from the legislation is Charles Fain.  Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder in 1983 following the death of 9-year-old Daralyn Johnson. In 1984 he was sentenced to death.  But DNA evidence not available at the time of the conviction later cleared him, and he was released in 2001. Johnson’s killer hasn’t been identified. The bill’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Doug Ricks, said six former inmates could benefit from the measure.

"The 2020 presidential race is the tale of two campaigns. First came the time before coronavirus — B.C., if you will — and then everything P.V., or post-virus. In B.C., President Trump was riding an economic boom and watching his approval ratings surge as a fractious Democratic field of opponents debated how far to tilt into socialism. Oddsmakers gave the president better-than-even chances of winning in November. Then the virus infected the political debate, the stock market shed 30% of its value and Mr. Trump stumbled through an Oval Office address that failed to calm things, sending his job approval ratings tumbling. And Democrats quickly settled their socialism debate, rallying around former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. Political analysts studying the race say there’s no way to predict what happens now. The only certainty P.V. is chaos. John J. Pitney Jr., a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College who’s written post-mortems on the last three presidential elections, said in the days before the virus he had given Mr. Trump “a decent chance at reelection.” “Now that a recession seems very likely, the advantage shifts to Biden,” he told The Washington Times. “The magnitude of a recession effect is hard to reckon. There have been very few presidential elections with economic conditions as dire as they are now.” Brian J. Gaines at the University of Illinois agreed the tanking economy deprives Mr. Trump of his best argument for re-election, but said there is also a tendency for voters to rally around a president at a time of crisis. “Whether the sense of crisis prevails for months and, if so, whether there is a rally that either carries on or dissipates is hard to guess,” he said. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College, said Mr. Trump had been nearing the 48% job performance mark, and no president has failed to get re-elected with that number. Now, however, he’s tumbled to about 44% when current polls are averaged. “I don’t think there’s any doubt we’re going to have one. The question is how deep is it, how long is it going to last, and is there sufficient recovery by the fall?” Mr. Madonna said. “It doesn’t matter whether you caused it or not … A president rises and falls on the economy.” But the uncertainties are huge. Candidates are canceling rallies and turning to online events to reach voters. Fundraising could look dramatically different. Turnout in the primaries is already being reshaped by COVID-19. “The virus is creating such havoc that I think all forecasts are up in the air,” Mr. Gaines said. “I hope that the weird quasi-curfew spring is a distant memory by November, but it seems likely that life will not be back to normal in all ways by then.” Before the virus struck, Mr. Biden was telling voters he would be able to put together the old Obama voter coalition that captured the White House in the 2008 and 2012 elections. But polling suggests his voters in a head-to-head match-up with Mr. Trump look more like Hillary Clinton’s 2016 coalition, which powered her to a 3 million vote lead in the popular vote — but which was too concentrated in coastal states, denying her the win where it counts, in the Electoral College. Mr. Biden has made new strides in wealthier voters. Those with annual incomes above $100,000 used to tend GOP, but in 2016 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump tied, according to exit polling. Now, Mr. Biden holds a lead, according to a set of new polls this month by The Economist/YouGov. A gender gap remains — Mr. Trump holds a slim lead among men, while Mr. Biden holds a wider advantage among women — and it gives Mr. Biden a lead in YouGov’s head-to-head match-ups. Mr. Biden has also eaten into the white vote totals Mr. Trump posted four years ago, though black and Hispanic voters are more skeptical of him at this point than they were of Mrs. Clinton in 2016, and far more skeptical than they were of Mr. Obama in 2012. Mr. Pitney said that the economic distress could help limit some of that shift, with Mr. Trump’s support among Hispanics weighed down. The president also faces some more fundamental demographic headwinds with older voters, who are a reliable GOP bock. Mortality rates mean a significant number of those who backed him in 2016 won’t be voting for him this year, even as the pool of younger voters, who are overwhelmingly Democratic, is restocked. In Florida, for example, Mr. Trump faces a net loss of more than 70,000 senior citizen voters, while Democrats are looking at a net gain of more than 150,000 young voters. That combines for a total net of more than 220,000 voters for Democrats, or about double Mr. Trump’s margin of victory in the state in 2016. None of that accounts for Mr. Trump being able to win over Clinton voters, or turn out new voters who didn’t cast ballots last time. Or the reverse could happen, with 2016 Trump voters fleeing him, and Democrats tapping voters who couldn’t pull the lever for Mrs. Clinton, but don’t mind Mr. Biden. But the same mortality math in Florida applies to other key states such as Pennsylvania, where Mr. Trump may cede about 45,000 votes due to demographics at the upper and lower ages — about equal to his margin of victory in the state last time. Analysts say they expect this year’s race to come down to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida — each of which Mr. Trump carried in 2016.

"NEW YORK — Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson says he felt a “moral obligation” to meet with President Donald Trump and warn him personally about the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. Carlson told Vanity Fair that “I didn’t feel it was my role” but was convinced by his wife to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on March 7. Two nights later on his Fox show, he issued a pointed warning to viewers to prepare for the coming storm. It speaks to both Fox News’ influence with the president and his supporters that a cable news host was able to contact the White House and successfully request the two-hour meeting. Carlson drove to the president’s resort from his Florida home, ironically on the day some guests at Mar-a-Lago were exposed to the virus. He declined a request to speak to The Associated Press about it on Wednesday, and the White House said it would not comment on a private meeting. Carlson had sounded the alarm about the coronavirus on his show earlier than this month. On Jan. 28, he criticized the media for spending more time on the impeachment trial than the virus and, on Feb. 3, told viewers that “you should be concerned.” Yet his blunt March 9 commentary was eye-opening, particularly in how it contrasted with attitudes expressed by some Fox colleagues. At the same time as he was talking, Trish Regan on the sister Fox Business Network was denouncing the “coronavirus impeachment scam,” suggesting the stories were an attempt to attack the president. Four days later, Fox shelved her show. “People you know will get sick,” Carlson said that night. “Some may die. This is real. That’s the point of this script - to tell you that.” Carlson said the nation’s leaders haven’t helped citizens take it seriously, criticizing liberals for saying it was racist to refer to “The Chinese Coronavirus” - words displayed on the screen behind him. “If we’re being honest, the other side has not been especially helpful, either,” Carlson said. “People you trust - people you probably voted for - have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem. It’s just partisan politics, they say, calm down. In the end this is just like the flu and people die of that every year.” It’s not, he said, noting that the death rate for the coronavirus was much higher. He named no names. His fellow Fox News host, Sean Hannity, has repeatedly brought up seasonal flu in connection with the coronavirus, to the point where Dr. Anthony Fauci implored him last week not to ignore the new disease’s lethality. Most people who get the coronavirus have only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. Fox confirmed that Carlson has not been tested for the disease and hasn’t experienced any symptoms. Carlson told Vanity Fair that he told Trump “exactly what I’ve said on TV, that this could be really bad.” He hasn’t talked about his meeting on television and wanted to keep it a secret, although it was revealed in a story by The New York Times. After weeks of trying to downplay the risk of the coronavirus, Trump has taken a more urgent tone in recent days and led daily briefings with federal leaders about developments. “I think a lot of people around him, and I mean broadly around him - particularly Republican members on Capitol Hill, in leadership, too - were determined to pretend this wasn’t happening,” he told the magazine. “I felt I had to do it, even though I suspected on some level it would probably hurt me if I did it.” Carlson said it’s hard to tell a straightforward story at a time people see most everything through a partisan or ideological lens. Polls have shown Democrats to be more concerned about the coronavirus than Republicans. “It’s hard to get people’s attention if you know you’re saying something that they suspect is political propaganda,” he said. “It’s something people have worried about for a long time - what if there’s a crisis, and no one will believe the coverage? Well, okay, that’s where we are.” He said a lot of people are to blame for that, “including probably me.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"A group of Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee raised “serious concerns” Wednesday about Americans abroad who are struggling to return to the U.S. amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the nine Democratic senators requested the department “step up” efforts to assist the U.S. nationals in returning home after receiving reports that some Americans have been unable to book flights or get in contact with U.S. embassies. “Providing support and assistance to Americans abroad and ensuring their safety and well-being are among the Department’s most fundamental responsibilities,” the senators wrote, citing concerns with Americans in Honduras, Morocco, Peru and Tunisia who have recently reported difficulties in obtaining support from American embassies and consulates. Committee Ranking Member Bob Menendez of New Jersey, along with Sens. Ben Cardin of Maryland, Chris Coons of Delaware, Tom Udall of New Mexico, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Cory Booker of New Jersey, urged Mr. Pompeo to explain efforts being made by the department to bring the Americans home. The letter comes amid reports that the State Department is cautioning Americans to not rely on the U.S. government to arrange travel back home. “Americans overseas should have full confidence that the State Department will support them when abroad and facilitate their efforts to return to the United States if they are seeking to evacuate from areas affected by COVID-19,” the senators added. “We recognize these are extraordinary times for the nation and the world. Yet this crisis calls for creative measures.”  ",Senate Dems raise 'serious concerns' about Americans stuck abroad amid coronavirus outbreak,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/senate-dems-raise-serious-concerns-about-americans/,washington_times
"PHOENIX (AP) - Osvaldo Salas speaks a little English, but not proficiently. The suburban Phoenix man relies on Spanish-language TV and friends and family for information on the coronavirus because state and local officials haven’t posted any updates online in Spanish even as the global pandemic widens.  “Unfortunately, here in Arizona, they turn their backs on Hispanic people,” Salas, a restaurant cook, said in Spanish. “Here, many of us speak Spanish, thousands of us, and unfortunately sometimes they put us to the side.” As government officials across the country warn about the dangers of the coronavirus, they’re doing so predominantly in English. They’re potentially not reaching the millions of Spanish speakers in the U.S. who aren’t proficient in English to make sure they know how to stay healthy. Advocacy groups and Spanish-language media have stepped up to fill in the gaps as cities and states say they’re working to translate guidance about hand washing and the effects of closing schools and businesses into the second-most spoken language in the U.S. Univision was also dedicating more airtime to the coronavirus. In Arizona, where 30% of residents are Hispanic, the Department of Health Services has a webpage with coronavirus updates - but none of the information is in Spanish. The health department was still translating coronavirus updates, Director Cara Christ said Monday. By Wednesday, there was still no Spanish and the department didn’t respond to a request for comment on Salas’ concerns. No media briefings have been broadcast in Spanish, although health officials have done Spanish-language interviews with Hispanic media.  “This has been a rapidly evolving situation and so things update almost daily,” Christ said. “We are working on getting a lot of our hard materials translated into Spanish and working on getting Spanish in our social media.”  Salas, who’s his family’s primary breadwinner, said he’s worried about feeding his wife and four children, one of whom has a rare genetic disorder that requires full-time care. He says his restaurant is closing and he’s heard on the news that some shuttered school districts are still handing out free meals, but he has no idea if theirs is one of them because there’s been no outreach.  Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a civil rights organization, said he’s not surprised that some states are behind on Spanish-language messaging, especially those like Arizona, where immigrants and Hispanics have faced hostility from laws and raids meant to crack down on illegal immigration. He said Hispanic and immigrant communities already face barriers to health care, including fear of seeking treatment because of their immigration status.  “The lack of bilingual material sort of exacerbates some of those issues that create uneven access to information and services,” Saenz said.  To help, an advocacy group is providing workers at a day labor work center in Pasadena, California, with information in Spanish to help them reduce their risk of infection and be ready in case they get sick or the government orders a lockdown. The National Day Laborer Organizing Network also streamed a radio show on social media, addressing hygiene strategies, how to talk with children about the virus and the drastic drop in hirings the center has seen. “I prefer the information in Spanish because it is our language,” said Carlos, a day laborer who was getting information at the center and didn’t want to share his last name out of fear he would be targeted by immigration authorities. “They are advising us on how to act, and how to get ready to face this, especially those of us who have children, so that we don’t take this home because the children are out of school.” Spanish-language media outlet Noticias Telemundo says it’s adding a national weekday newscast focused on the coronavirus. It’s also expanding its morning show and midday newscast to include segments on the virus.  The outreach to Spanish-speaking communities has been mixed.  The federal government has done little, but the CDC has coronavirus information available in Spanish on its website, although it is hard to find. Critics say it’s taken too long to post updates in Spanish. For example, the CDC’s Spanish-language Twitter account hasn’t tweeted about the coronavirus, instead retweeting a message about the virus from the CDC Environment account Tuesday.  In Hispanic-heavy states like Florida, many news conferences held by state officials have been bilingual, and the Florida health department has Spanish-speaking agents available round the clock at its coronavirus call center, spokesman Alberto Moscoso said. In New Mexico, a day after The Associated Press asked the governor’s office about a lack of Spanish on the health department website, it’s Spanish-language site went live - though it’s difficult to find - and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham tweeted about it in Spanish. A purple-highlighted banner atop the main page has, in small letters, a link to Spanish updates. The nation’s most Hispanic state also has had a Spanish educator and health official at every news conference to do an interviews with Spanish-language media.  Washington state, which has had the most deaths in the U.S., has information and news releases posted in both English and Spanish on its health department website. Health officials are working with a translation firm and with independent translators to get the word out in over 40 languages, spokeswoman Kathleen Meehan said.  Meehan added that it’s the first time the state health department created a community engagement task force to address things like language barriers. And while government officials have had to communicate in other languages before, such as during wildfires, the virus outbreak is unprecedented, she said.  “Our messaging isn’t effective if people can’t understand it,” Meehan said.  In the California wine region of Sonoma County, officials are giving news updates in both languages, broadcasting them on Facebook Live.  And in El Paso, Texas, where roughly 80% of residents are Hispanic, authorities have conducted news conferences in both languages. Mayor Dee Margo posts updates in Spanish and English to his official Facebook page.  Raquel Terán, an Arizona lawmaker and longtime community activist, said she asked state officials two weeks ago whether information would be delivered in Spanish. Now, as the warnings ramp up - state officials have closed all schools and continue to urge people to stay home - messaging in more than just English is essential, Terán said.  She said the state should hire Spanish translators, noting that although not all Hispanics speak Spanish, many do.  The community wants “to hear a trusted voice,” Terán said. “They want the trusted messenger in Spanish. That’s the reality.” ___ Garcia Cano reported from Washington.

"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Iran’s top leader will pardon 10,000 more prisoners in an apparent effort to combat the coronavirus, state TV reported Thursday.  As part of steps to curb the spread of the new virus that has killed more than 1,100 people in Iran, the country has already released 85,000 prisoners on temporary leave.  Separately, the United Arab Emirates added to its list of people barred from entering all residents who are currently abroad. The decision impacts people whose homes, children, bank accounts and livelihoods are in the country, but who were traveling or outside the country. The ban goes into effect at mid-day Thursday for at least two weeks. Only Emirati citizens are allowed to return. The UAE, which is home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has 113 confirmed cases of the virus. It announced it was suspending all new labor permits, including those for drivers and domestic workers, until “further notice.”  The UAE is unique in that only about 10% of its population, or about 1 million people, are Emirati citizens. The other 90% are foreign residents who fuel its economy and keep the country running. They hold the vast majority of jobs in construction, transportation, hospitality, sales, medicine, education and other key sectors. The Middle East has some 20,000 cases of the virus, with most in Iran or originating from Iran.  For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. To encourage people to stay at home in Iran, Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour wrote on social media that the virus infects 50 Iranians on average every single hour and that “one dies every 10 minutes .” “Make smart decisions about travel, visits and meetings,” he wrote on Twitter, as highways remained crowded with people traveling to see family ahead of the Iranian New Year on Friday. State TV quoted judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili as saying that 10,000 prisoners - among them an unknown number of inmates whose cases are political and related to activism or speech - would be granted amnesty under a decree by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the occasion of the new year, called Nowruz. Occasionally Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, pardons prisoners. Last year, he pardoned more than 50,000 on the 40th anniversary of 1979 Islamic Revolution. Western nations have urged Iran to release dual nationals and others, alleging they are used as bargaining chips in negotiations. Among those temporarily freed was Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, an Iranian-British dual national long held on internationally criticized charges. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the charitable Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in 2016 on charges of trying to topple the government while traveling with her toddler daughter. In Lebanon, the last commercial flight arrived in Beirut’s international airport from Istanbul late Wednesday just before a lockdown went into effect at midnight for the next two weeks. The government shut down the airport, seaports and borders and ordered citizens to stay home as the small country of nearly 5 million people grappled with containing the virus. Lebanon has recorded four deaths and 133 cases infected cases. Most private businesses, restaurants and Lebanese government institutions were also ordered shut, leaving only bakeries, supermarkets and pharmacies open, as well as some banks. In Pakistan, shrines of Sufi saints in the capital Islamabad and elsewhere were closed. Visits to museums, archaeological and tourist sites were banned as the number of cases of coronavirus jumped to 301, mostly among pilgrims returning from Iran.  Two people who were tested positive upon their return from Saudi Arabia and Dubai became the first victims of the virus in Pakistan when they died Wednesday in the northwest.  ___ Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

"Rep. Ben McAdams, who announced on Wednesday that he tested positive for the coronavirus, on Thursday said Congress should consider allowing for remote voting amid the expanding outbreak. “I think there’s value, outside of the national emergency that we’re in, [in] having members of Congress come together and talk about bills before they vote on them,” the Utah Democrat said on NBC’s “Today” program. “But perhaps under a state of a declared national emergency that’s something that should be available to the Congress.” “It does place a limit on the ability of Congress to get stuff done,” he said. “Right now, I don’t think it approaches the level of having a quorum, but certainly where we [limit] social gatherings to more than 10, it’s something we should think about with Congress having 435 members and gathering for votes.” Mr. McAdams said he was feeling pretty bad but that he was getting by. He said a doctor initially said his symptoms of a fever and cough didn’t justify testing, but on Monday evening his symptoms took a turn for the worse. “I had a temperature of about 103. … My lungs were really constricted — [it] felt like I had a belt around my chest,” Mr. McAdams said. The doctor then said it made sense for the congressman to get tested, and he did so at a local clinic. Mr. McAdams said the House physician said anyone who had close contact with him from Friday onward “should be concerned and should probably take precaution[s].” “There aren’t a lot of members with whom I had close contact,” he said.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont on Wednesday made clear that he didn’t want to entertain questions about a potential time frame for his ending his presidential campaign, saying he’s dealing with the expanding coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Sanders’ campaign had forcefully denied a report Wednesday that said he was suspending his campaign, after a string of losses has given former Vice President Joseph R. Biden an almost insurmountable lead in delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Asked about his “time frame,” Mr. Sanders said: “Stop with this. I’m dealing with a f–ing global crisis. You know? We’re dealing with it and you’re asking me these questions.” “Right now I’m trying to do my best to make sure that we don’t have an economic meltdown and that people don’t die. Is that enough to you? To keep you busy for today?” he told reporters. Mr. Biden has 1,180 delegates and Mr. Sanders has 885, according to the latest tally from The Associated Press. Mr. Sanders’ team did say Wednesday that the senator would be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign and that his immediate focus would be on the COVID-19 outbreak. Mr. Biden cruised to wins in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday to build on his delegate lead.

"JERUSALEM (AP) - With the Israeli government enacting a series of emergency measures to stem the spread of the new coronavirus, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing growing accusations that he is exploiting the crisis to entrench himself in power and undermining the country’s democratic foundations. Amid a wave of sweeping restrictions that have put Israel in near shutdown mode, Netanyahu has managed to postpone his own pending criminal trial, authorize unprecedented electronic surveillance of Israeli citizens and block parliament from pressing ahead with legislation aimed at pushing him from office. The moves, on the heels of the country’s third inconclusive election in less than a year and under the shadow of Netanyahu’s corruption indictment, sparked leading opposition figure Yair Lapid to tell Israeli citizens that they “no longer live in a democracy.” “There is no judicial branch in Israel. There is no legislative branch in Israel. There is only an unelected government that is headed by a person who lost the election. You can call that by a lot of names, it isn’t a democracy,” he said in a recorded video.  Amid growing anger toward Netanyahu, police on Thursday blocked two convoys of cars from reaching the Knesset, or parliament, where activists planned to protest against the government moves.  Police stopped dozens of cars on a major highway as they made their way to Jerusalem, calling it an “illegal protest.” They also stopped dozens of cars inside Jerusalem from approaching the Knesset. Many of the cars hoisted black flags alongside Israeli flags and honked in protest. “With dictatorship we die,” read one poster. The new coronavirus has spread to more than 100 countries, infected more than 217,000 people worldwide and killed more than 8,700. For most people, it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. Israeli health officials have diagnosed over 400 coronavirus cases, roughly a quarter of them detected in the last 24 hours.  With the numbers quickly rising, authorities have issued a series of tough guidelines that have brought the country to a standstill. People have been instructed to stay home, tens of thousands are in home quarantine and foreigners have been banned from entering the country. Most controversially, the Israeli government instructed the shadowy Shin Bet internal security service to start deploying the agency’s phone surveillance technology to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus in Israel by tracking the moves of the infected.  Israel uses phone surveillance in the occupied Palestinian territories, saying it’s an important tool to prevent attacks on Israelis, but critics say it’s also aimed at maintaining tight control. The surveillance in Israel has sparked widespread criticism from lawmakers and civil rights groups. Opponents planned to file a Supreme Court challenge on Thursday. Many of the measures are not unique to Israel. In neighboring Jordan, King Abdullah II has shut the country’s court system and parliament, as part of an effort to stem the outbreak. Abdullah, who is not elected, appears to have won wide public support for his handling of the crisis. The British government plans to introduce a bill in Parliament on Thursday that will give authorities stronger powers to respond to the pandemic. Many of these are relatively uncontroversial - like allowing retired doctors to return to work without taking a hit on their pensions. But critics have raised questions about some proposals, including a move to give police and immigration officers “powers to detain people and put them in appropriate isolation facilities if necessary to protect public health.” The emergency legislation is due to have a two-year time limit, but opposition lawmakers want a shorter cut-off date. In Israel, Netanyahu has thrived in the crisis, delivering stern televised addresses to the nation each evening.  Presenting himself as the responsible adult steering the country through an unprecedented crisis, he has defended the tough steps, including the electronic surveillance, as measures that he has reluctantly been forced to impose to save lives while his opponents are focused on petty politics.  In a televised interview Wednesday, Netanyahu said that during his 11 years as prime minister, he had previously always refused to use surveillance on Israeli citizens. He said there would be “maximum oversight” to protect privacy concerns. “The last thing I will do is harm democracy,” he said. The liberal Haaretz daily responded Wednesday with a lead editorial titled “An Epidemic of Surveillance.” “Under the cover of the battle against the spread of the coronavirus, Interim Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concentrating more and more power in his hands, with neither balances nor supervision,” it wrote. “At this time of emergency, and in order to keep from sliding down the slippery slope, it is critical to maintain proportionality and oversight.” Following the March 2 election, Netanyahu has the support of only 58 lawmakers, leaving him three short of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset. Sixty-one lawmakers have come out in support of his opponent, Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz, while one refuses to endorse either side.  Backed by a narrow majority, Gantz, a former military chief, was tasked by Israel’s president this week to try to form a new government.  In the meantime, Netanyahu has used a series of executive orders and other tactics to push forward his agenda while preventing parliament from convening. The phone-surveillance plan was approved by the Cabinet in the middle of the night, without the traditional parliamentary oversight that is customary for such decisions.  Blue and White politician Gabi Ashkenazi, another former military chief who was supposed to oversee the committee, called Netanyahu’s move a “heist in the dead of night.”  Blue and White has also taken aim at Netanyahu and his Likud party for preventing the newly elected parliament from convening under the guise of virus-related restrictions on public gatherings.  On Wednesday, Parliament Speaker Yuli Edelstein, a member of Likud, abruptly adjourned the Knesset, freezing Blue and White’s plans to appoint new committees and advance legislation that could limit Netanyahu’s time in office. President Reuven Rivlin warned the country’s democratic system was being threatened. Netanyahu and Gantz held an emergency meeting this week to discuss the possibility of establishing a unity government to end the prolonged political paralysis. But progress appeared unlikely as they continued to bicker. Earlier this week, Netanyahu’s hand-picked justice minister, in the middle of the night, declared a state of emergency in the court system a day before Netanyahu’s trial was to begin. The decree, citing the coronavirus crisis, postponed Netanyahu’s trial until May. In his TV interview, Netanyahu lashed back at his critics. “While I manage the war against the coronavirus and the fight for saving the lives of citizens of Israel,” he said, ”they are only planning how to depose a prime minister.” Netanyahu critics have suggested that the crisis landed on the prime minister’s lap at just the right time. “The coronavirus will pass at some point or another,” commentator Ben Caspit wrote in Maariv. “After we bury our dead, we are also going to have to administer last rites to our democracy.” ____ Follow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London and Omar Akour in Amman contributed to this report.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The wife of Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that she’s facing the same problems as millions of other Californians who are dealing with empty store shelves, closed schools and home confinement as social distancing measures take hold to slow the spread of the coronavirus. “One rose amidst all of this — family dinners and no late night homework stress,” tweeted Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who has four young children. “And nice to not have kids shuffling home late from sports and activities. And yes, unfortunately the thorn - we run out of toilet paper, paper towels, and Kleenex tomorrow. I wish people had not hoarded.” Her remarks were met with scorn. Several critics responded with the famous line attributed to Marie Antoinette: “Let them eat cake!” “Yes, lovely isn’t it?” replied another. “Shame about grandma’s hideous death, but we got some pajama time with the kiddos!” “And having to step over the homeless on your way to search for toilet paper must be an added stress for you,” said another respondent, who added an eye-rolling emoji. “Poor darling!” said another tweet. “Maybe you can send the state patrol out to appropriate some from the peasants.” Eleven Northern California counties and the Southern California city of Palm Springs have told residents to stay home, except to buy groceries, visit the doctor or do anything deemed essential. Virtually all schools around the state have closed classrooms for several weeks, and Gov. Newsom has said that they may need to remain shut for the rest of the school year. Newsom also has encouraged people 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions to stay indoors. He’s also called for the shutdown of bars, movie theaters, gyms and other gathering places, and for restaurants to only serve food to go — restrictions already in place in Los Angeles and several other major cities.

"NEW YORK — Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson says he felt a “moral obligation” to meet with President Donald Trump and warn him personally about the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. Carlson told Vanity Fair that “I didn’t feel it was my role” but was convinced by his wife to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on March 7. Two nights later on his Fox show, he issued a pointed warning to viewers to prepare for the coming storm. It speaks to both Fox News’ influence with the president and his supporters that a cable news host was able to contact the White House and successfully request the two-hour meeting. Carlson drove to the president’s resort from his Florida home, ironically on the day some guests at Mar-a-Lago were exposed to the virus. He declined a request to speak to The Associated Press about it on Wednesday, and the White House said it would not comment on a private meeting. Carlson had sounded the alarm about the coronavirus on his show earlier than this month. On Jan. 28, he criticized the media for spending more time on the impeachment trial than the virus and, on Feb. 3, told viewers that “you should be concerned.” Yet his blunt March 9 commentary was eye-opening, particularly in how it contrasted with attitudes expressed by some Fox colleagues. At the same time as he was talking, Trish Regan on the sister Fox Business Network was denouncing the “coronavirus impeachment scam,” suggesting the stories were an attempt to attack the president. Four days later, Fox shelved her show. “People you know will get sick,” Carlson said that night. “Some may die. This is real. That’s the point of this script — to tell you that.” Carlson said the nation’s leaders haven’t helped citizens take it seriously, criticizing liberals for saying it was racist to refer to “The Chinese Coronavirus” - words displayed on the screen behind him. “If we’re being honest, the other side has not been especially helpful, either,” Carlson said. “People you trust — people you probably voted for — have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem. It’s just partisan politics, they say, calm down. In the end this is just like the flu and people die of that every year.” It’s not, he said, noting that the death rate for the coronavirus was much higher. He named no names. His fellow Fox News host, Sean Hannity, has repeatedly brought up seasonal flu in connection with the coronavirus, to the point where Dr. Anthony Fauci implored him last week not to ignore the new disease’s lethality. Most people who get the coronavirus have only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. Fox confirmed that Carlson has not been tested for the disease and hasn’t experienced any symptoms. Carlson told Vanity Fair that he told Trump “exactly what I’ve said on TV, that this could be really bad.” He hasn’t talked about his meeting on television and wanted to keep it a secret, although it was revealed in a story by The New York Times. After weeks of trying to downplay the risk of the coronavirus, Trump has taken a more urgent tone in recent days and led daily briefings with federal leaders about developments. “I think a lot of people around him, and I mean broadly around him - particularly Republican members on Capitol Hill, in leadership, too - were determined to pretend this wasn’t happening,” he told the magazine. “I felt I had to do it, even though I suspected on some level it would probably hurt me if I did it.” Carlson said it’s hard to tell a straightforward story at a time people see most everything through a partisan or ideological lens. Polls have shown Democrats to be more concerned about the coronavirus than Republicans. “It’s hard to get people’s attention if you know you’re saying something that they suspect is political propaganda,” he said. “It’s something people have worried about for a long time — what if there’s a crisis, and no one will believe the coverage? Well, OK, that’s where we are.” He said a lot of people are to blame for that, “including probably me.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on Thursday said he thinks Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin is open to expanded unemployment insurance benefits in the next tranche of federal spending to deal with the expanding coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Schumer, who said he hoped to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Thursday to talk about a path forward, said he wants to “massively expand unemployment insurance.” “You get full salary, you get it quickly, the application process is very, very simple, and it goes for a long period of time,” Mr. Schumer, New York Democrat, said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” He said he spoke to Mr. Mnuchin about it this week to stress the importance. “He seemed very open to it. I was very glad about that,” the senator said. But Mr. Schumer also said Mr. Mnuchin has something of a “Wall Street view.” “I don’t, and we’re going to have to make sure that is curbed, his view, in what we propose. But we got to move forward. We got to come together and move forward,” he said. Mr. Schumer also said Democrats will push for boosts in worker pay, paid sick and family leave, and expanded hospital capacity. President Trump on Wednesday signed into law a $105 billion bill that expands paid sick leave, allows for free coronavirus testing and boosts unemployment insurance. The administration is now eyeing a trillion dollar-plus plan to try to boost an economy that’s being ravaged by COVID-19, the diseased caused by the novel coronavirus.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday said President Trump must use a Korean War-era law to procure hospital gear immediately instead of waiting for the coronavirus crisis to worsen, saying there is “not a day to lose.” The California Democrat said the Defense Production Act is the right tool to rush much-needed ventilators, diagnostic tests, masks and other personal protective equipment to health workers who might be overrun and ill-equipped for the pandemic. The 1950 act gives the president broad powers to procure materials from private industries. “Right now, shortages of critical medical and personal protective equipment are harming our ability to fight the coronavirus epidemic, endangering frontline workers and making it harder to care for those who fall ill,” Mrs. Pelosi said. “The president must immediately use the powers of the Defense Production Act to mass-produce and coordinate distribution of these critical supplies before the need worsens and the shortages become even more dire.” Mr. Trump signed an executive order that paves the way for his invocation of the act, though he later tweeted that he will only use it in the worst-case scenarios, so “hopefully there will be no need.” Democrats who urged the president to invoke the Defense Production Act a week ago say the need is there. “There is not a day to lose,” Mrs. Pelosi said. “We must put more testing, more protective equipment and more ventilators into the hands of our frontline workers immediately.” The coronavirus causes a disease, COVID-19, which is mild in some but can cause several respiratory distress and death. It has infected more than 9,400 people in the U.S. and killed at least 150, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

"LONDON (AP) - An independent report sharply criticized Britain’s Conservative government on Thursday for the way it treated long-term U.K. residents who were wrongly caught up in a government drive to reduce illegal immigration. The report said the U.K. Home Office exhibited “institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness” towards the issue of race and the history of the mostly Caribbean immigrants involved that are “consistent with some definitions of institutional racism.” Those affected belong to the “Windrush generation,” named for the ship Empire Windrush, which in 1948 brought hundreds of Caribbean immigrants to Britain. The country was then seeking nurses, railway workers and others to help it rebuild after the devastation of World War II.  They and subsequent Caribbean migrants came from British colonies or ex-colonies and had an automatic right to settle in the U.K. But some became ensnared by tough new rules introduced beginning in 2012 that were intended to make Britain a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants.  In recent years, some of them, now elderly, were refused medical care or threatened with deportation because they could not produce paperwork proving their right to reside in the U.K. Some were even deported. Lead author Wendy Williams, a lawyer and former inspector of police, said “members of the Windrush generation and their children have been poorly served by this country. “They had every right to be here and should never have been caught in the immigration net,” she said. Home Secretary Priti Patel apologized to those caught up in the scandal, who endured “insensitive treatment by the very country they called home.” “There is nothing that I can say today which will undo the pain, the suffering and the misery inflicted upon the Windrush generation,” she told lawmakers in the House of Commons. “What I can do is say that on behalf of this and successive governments, I am truly sorry for the actions that spanned decades and I’m sorry that people’s trust has been betrayed.” Legal Windrush migrants had been denied housing, jobs or medical treatment because of requirements that landlords, employers and doctors in the U.K. check people’s immigration status. Others were told by the government that they were in Britain illegally and had to leave.  The scandal drew in former Prime Minister Theresa May, who was home secretary when the “hostile environment” policy was introduced. May apologized Thursday and said the government had to take heed of the report’s findings. “This generation came here, they were British, they were here legally, they worked to build our country and they should not have been treated in this way,” she said. Among 30 recommendations, Williams argued for a review of the hostile environment policy and said the Home Office should establish a race advisory board. A compensation scheme has been set up for with an estimated budget of at least 200 million pounds ($229 million). But campaigners have criticized the “paltry” number of people who have so far received payments and called the process “slow and onerous.” David Lammy, a lawmaker from the main opposition Labour Party whose parents came to Britain from Guyana, said in light of the coronavirus pandemic it was “hard to imagine” a worse time for this report to be published.  “For the sake of all those black British citizens who were deported, detained, made homeless, jobless, denied healthcare housing and welfare by their own government, we cannot allow this news to be buried,” he said in a tweet. ___ Follow all AP stories about British politics and Brexit negotiations at https://apnews.com/Brexit  ",UK government slammed for failing its Windrush immigrants,"Thursday, March 19, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/19/uk-government-slammed-for-failing-its-windrush-imm/,washington_times
"HOUSTON (AP) - A man died by apparent suicide at one of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s family detention centers, according to a legal group that was representing him.  The group, RAICES, did not identify the man, and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement late Wednesday, RAICES said it was representing the man while he was detained at the Karnes County Residential Center in South Texas. His death on Wednesday was the ninth to occur in ICE custody since the start of the governmental fiscal year in October, exceeding the eight deaths that occurred in the prior year.  It comes as advocates have called on ICE to reduce its detainee population and its operations to arrest migrants in the U.S. without authorization amid the coronavirus outbreak. ICE said Wednesday that it would scale back enforcement to detain “public safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds.”  “We anticipate that this won’t be the last death at Karnes unless ICE immediately releases all those detained at this detention center and in custody around the country,” Lucia Allain, a spokeswoman for RAICES, said in a statement. “A dirty and cramped detention center in the face of a pandemic is unsafe and inhumane.” In sworn legal declarations the group released Tuesday, two migrants reported getting sick from the drinking water they are provided at Karnes, which had 680 people in detention last week. Another migrant said detainees are denied access to hand sanitizer. They are instead told to use body wash in the showers to clean their hands at all times. ICE said in a statement that the facility has hand soap dispensers that are checked twice daily and detained migrants are “encouraged” to report any shortages. The agency also said it provides free water, milk, and juice.  Already, illnesses spread quickly in Karnes and other detention centers, said Andrea Meza, director of family detention services for RAICES. “When you’re there, all the kids are coughing,” she said. “Everybody has a runny nose and a sore throat and diarrhea.”  ",Man dies by apparent suicide in ICE family detention center,"Thursday, March 19, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/19/man-dies-by-apparent-suicide-in-ice-family-detenti/,washington_times
"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - After questioning the seriousness of COVID-19, defying his own health ministry’s recommendations and denouncing a “certain hysteria,” Brazil’s president is now projecting himself as leading the nation’s response to the coronavirus crisis in what has become one of the biggest challenges to his presidency.  President Jair Bolsonaro provoked the ire of many Brazilians and even former political allies with his blasé attitude to the global pandemic and insistence on shaking supporters’ hands at a protest. One of Brazil’s most popular news sites, UOL, reported Bolsonaro had suggested the Chinese government caused the coronavirus outbreak - a claim later voiced publicly by his son, a lawmaker. China’s embassy rebuffed the allegations, saying on Twitter they were “extremely irresponsible.” While countries around Latin America and the world have closed borders, quarantined millions, canceled international flights, and shut down schools, Brazil has done none of these things, except for closing a stretch of its vast border with Venezuela. Flights continue in and out of the country. No lockdowns have been ordered and state governments and municipalities have taken the lead in telling people to stay home. “Coronavirus in Brazil is acting as a kind of catalyst, channeling all this discontent and accelerating the process” against Bolsonaro, said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at the Insper University in Sao Paulo. “When he came out to the streets for the protests, he made a very big, very serious mistake. Now he is trying to regain control.”  Faced with a growing backlash, a concerned-looking Bolsonaro, flanked by many of his ministers, on Wednesday gave his first press conference on the coronavirus at Brazil’s presidential palace. During the two-hour event, Bolsonaro said he would redouble efforts to fight COVID-19, but did not announce any new measures. For the first time since the outbreak, he thanked lawmakers for their efforts and called on them to approve a “state of calamity,” which would allow the government to spend more than the annual budget allows, with funds going toward health and job preservation. But the press conference conveyed mixed messages about how to deal with the pandemic. While vowing to fight the outbreak, he sat shoulder-to-shoulder with his ministers in a violation of the social distancing prescribed by international authorities. Government officials wore white masks, but several of them, including Bolsonaro, removed them repeatedly when speaking. “As the head of the executive I have to be in the front lines with my people,” Brazil’s president said. “Don’t be surprised if you see me entering a crowded bar in Sao Paulo, a ferry from Niteroi to Rio or in a bus in Belo Horizonte.” Critics say Bolsonaro’s about-face on the virus follows U.S. President Donald Trump’s example. But for many, it is too little, too late. Brazil’s president had until recently remained largely absent from press conferences, leaving them to ministers or top health officials. Over the weekend, he was seen meeting and shaking hands with a group of supporters. His decision to come into physical contact with the crowd while awaiting final results of his second COVID-19 test contradicted the recommendations his health minister previously issued about avoiding large gatherings. “How does a man who is possibly infected go into the middle of a crowd?” Janaina Paschoal told fellow lawmakers in Sao Paulo’s legislature. “This man has to leave the Presidency of the Republic, let (vice-president Hamilton) Mourão, who understands matters of defense, lead the nation.” Paschoal, a conservative who was once in the running to be Bolsonaro’s vice-president, had criticized the president but never before demanded he step down. Multiple members of Bolsonaro’s administration have contracted the coronavirus. His top national security adviser, Gen. Augusto Heleno, confirmed Tuesday he tested positive after attending a recent trip to the U.S. along with Bolsonaro. According to online news site G1, more than a dozen members of a delegation who met with President Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago have also received positive test results. So far more than 400 people have been infected in Brazil, and four have died, with officials expecting that number to rise significantly in the coming days. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority recover. Lawmaker Alexandre Frota, another close ally turned critic, said Monday he has prepared an impeachment request he will send to congress. Bolsonaro maintains a strained relationship with the speaker of the lower house, Rodrigo Maia, but it is unlikely congress would consider an impeachment request amid the crisis. Even his intellectual guru, Olavo de Carvalho, a conservative Brazilian writer who lives in the U.S., posted a Facebook message suggesting Bolsonaro was on the wrong course and poorly advised. “From the beginning of his term I told the president he should disarm his enemies before trying to solve any ‘national problem.’ He did the opposite,” Carvalho wrote. “I am sorry. Now it may be too late to react.” On Tuesday and Wednesday night, Brazilians in cities including Sao Paulo, Rio and Brasilia protested Bolsonaro in one of the few ways possible at a time of social distancing: leaning from their windows and banging pots and pans. Some shouted “Bolsonaro out!”  On his official Twitter account, Bolsonaro complained the media had failed to communicate a counter pots-and-pans protest in favor of his administration, which took place a half hour later. That demonstration wasn’t nearly as loud or as long, and participants were shouted at by those in neighboring buildings. –– AP reporter Mauricio Savarese contributed to this report from Sao Paulo and David Biller from Rio.

"The average family of four will receive $3,000 from the government next month under the economic relief plan proposed by the White House to counter the coronavirus pandemic. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Thursday the direct payments in April would include $1,000 per adult and $500 per child. He said the checks would go out three weeks after Congress approves the plan. A second round of payments would go out in May if the president hasn’t lifted his national disaster declaration. “We’ve told the House and the Senate we need to get this done quickly,” Mr. Mnuchin told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “This needs to be done by the beginning of next week.” Senate Republicans are working with the White House on the package, which is expected to total about $1.3 trillion. It includes guaranteed loans for small businesses and affected industries such as airlines. Mr. Mnuchin said he also has been conferring this week with Democratic leaders. The House isn’t in session this week, and plans to convene next week. President Trump on Wednesday night signed emergency legislation that provides more than $100 billion for free coronavirus testing, expanded unemployment insurance, paid sick and family leave and expanded food security programs. Mr. Mnuchin didn’t reject a suggestion by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow that the government is considering asking corporations for equity stakes in return for aid from taxpayers. “We’re looking at making secured loans on market terms,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “We’ll see whether that includes equity or doesn’t include equity. We’re not going to force things on people, but people who need liquidity, we’re going to make sure that the taxpayers are compensated fairly.” The Treasury secretary, citing action by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Agency to suspend foreclosures and evictions, urged private banks to follow suit. “My expectation is … the banks will follow,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “We do not want to be foreclosing on people during this 90-day period.” HUD said Wednesday it will suspend foreclosures and evictions for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration until the end of April, a move that will affect about 8.1 million mortgages. The Federal Housing Finance Agency also ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the companies behind about half of all mortgages in the nation, to suspend foreclosures and evictions for any single-family mortgages for at least 60 days.

"A group of “pop-up” super PACs successfully concealed nearly $24 million in spending between last month’s Nevada caucuses and the March 17 primaries, according to a new analysis from the Center for Responsive Politics’ OpenSecrets.org. Super PACs are required by law to disclose their donors, but by carefully timing their launch and quickly spending their war chest just before an election, they can skirt disclosing donors until after election day, leading campaign-finance watchers to tag them as “pop-up” operations. The Center for Responsive Politics found ‘at least’ 11 different groups deploying this method in presidential, Senate, and House races leading into the March 17 primaries. “The current reporting rules were crafted more than four decades ago, when committee treasurers typed their reports with typewriters and mailed their disclosures to the [Federal Election Commission],” wrote Karl Evers-Hillstrom at the Center for Responsive Politics. “Now, campaigns and outside groups maintain electronic databases of their contributions and spending, making it easy to file reports quickly. But the rules have not been updated to keep up with technological changes.” Persist PAC, a super PAC supporting Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s now-defunct presidential campaign, accounted for $14.8 million of the nearly $24 million tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics. Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s since-shuttered presidential campaign benefited from the practice as well, with Kitchen Table Conversation spending $2.7 million and using similar methods, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Some groups that comply with disclosure requirements by filing reports on a monthly basis rather than in pre-primary reports will not need to reveal their February donors until Friday.

"Ford O’Connell, a Republican candidate running in southwest Florida to replace retiring GOP Rep. Francis Rooney, suspended his campaign Thursday due to the spread of COVID-19, making it too difficult to run a thorough campaign. “After much thought and careful consideration, it is with a heavy heart I announce that I have decided to withdraw my candidacy for the FL-19 U.S. congressional seat,” Mr. O’Connell announced in a press release. The Republican strategist said lives are at stake during the global pandemic, which weighed on his decision. “As a result of the Chinese coronavirus outbreak, we cannot run the type of campaign we wanted to run; one where we go to local events and meetings, schools and libraries, museums and restaurants, and speak to voters and hear about the issues that matter to them, where we get our message out face-to-face with citizens at the grassroots level through an exchange of ideas, having real conversations that matter, rather than in 30-second TV ads,” he said. “Public safety is paramount, and an election where voters’ health may be endangered to run a campaign by, for, and of the people is not one in which I can in good conscience continue,” Mr. O’Connell added. He said he will donate a portion of his campaign funds to the American Red Cross and the Harry Chapin Food Bank of Southwest Florida. His move comes days after a 24-year-old Christy McLaughlin entered the field, also running on a pro-Trump platform. Florida state Reps. Heather Fitzenhagen and Dane Eagle are also competing for the seat. The primary for Florida’s 19th Congressional District is scheduled for August.

"The top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday condemned China’s recent move to expel 13 American journalists in response to a new visa limit imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese state-owned media in the U.S. In a letter to the ambassador of the People’s Republic of China, Cui Tiankai, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas slammed what he called “ill-advised and dangerous” actions and called on the Chinese government to reverse the decision banning the journalists. “By attempting to silence our journalists, you are serving only to build up their resolve to expose the truth; the truth you continue to obfuscate,” he wrote. “What the Foreign Ministry may believe is a projection of the CCP’s strength, is viewed in Washington and around the world as the actions of an insecure regime afraid of accountability and sunlight.” The ranking member warned the journalist’s expulsion will have harsh implications on “one of the world’s most important bilateral relationships and undermining global security,” pointing to China’s initial efforts to downplay the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement earlier Thursday accusing the United States of “discrimination and politically-motivated oppression” against Chinese media outlets. Mr. McCaul defended the U.S.’s visa limits and said the move seeks to “reasonably limit operations by China’s propaganda agencies in the United States.” “They did not limit legitimate news organizations ability to operate and were long overdue,” he continued, adding praise of the State Department’s move.

"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii on Thursday pulled the plug on her presidential campaign and endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. “Today, I’m suspending my presidential campaign and offering my full support to Vice President Joe Biden in his quest to bring our country together,” Ms. Gabbard said. Ms. Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran, had run on a staunchly anti-interventionist platform and consistently warned against the destabilizing effects of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East. But her bid failed to gain traction in what had once been a crowded 2020 Democratic field. She won two delegates based on her performance in the American Samoa caucuses, but in recent contests was finishing behind candidates who had already suspended their campaigns. Ms. Gabbard’s exit means that Mr. Biden and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont are the only two major Democratic contenders still actively seeking the nomination. She said after Tuesday’s primary results, “it’s clear” that primary voters have picked Mr. Biden to be the candidate who will take on President Trump. Mr. Biden is on the cusp of putting Mr. Sanders away after racking up comfortable wins in Florida, Illinois and Arizona this week. “Although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know that he has a good heart, and he’s motivated by his love for our country and the American people,” Ms. Gabbard said. She said she was grateful to have called Mr. Biden’s late son Beau, who like Ms. Gabbard served in the National Guard, a friend. Ms. Gabbard said she extended “best wishes” to Mr. Sanders, his team and his supporters. “I have such a great appreciation for Senator Sanders’ love for our country and the American people and his sincere desire to improve the lives of all Americans,” she said. Ms. Gabbard had resigned her post as a Democratic National Committee vice chair in 2016 to endorse Mr. Sanders over Hillary Clinton in that year’s Democratic presidential primary contest. She called on Americans to come together in the face of the coronavirus threat in the way the country did after 9/11. “It is once again time, as Americans and as neighbors in this global community, that we stand together … and work hand in hand to defeat this new enemy — the coronavirus,” she said. Ms. Gabbard had said in October that she wouldn’t seek reelection to the House, which raises questions about her future plans. Her failed run did elevate her profile nationally as she earned a reputation as a maverick Democrat willing to defy her party. Ms. Gabbard frequently criticized the DNC and the metrics the party used to determine which candidates qualified for the debate stages. She has irked Democrats with such criticisms, as well as with her quizzical relationship with leaders such as Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. The congresswoman broke with her party to vote “present” in December on the two articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump. Ms. Gabbard also sued Mrs. Clinton earlier this year, saying the former secretary of state defamed her by calling her a “Russian asset” in a podcast interview last year. In a court filing last week, Mrs. Clinton’s legal team moved to dismiss the case and suggested that Ms. Gabbard was doing it for publicity. “This lawsuit — which seeks $100 million in damages for a single passing remark made by Secretary Clinton in a 40-minute podcast interview about the 2020 election — is an effort by Rep. Gabbard to silence her political critics while making political headlines,” they said.  ","Tulsi Gabbard ends presidential campaign, backs Joe Biden"," -

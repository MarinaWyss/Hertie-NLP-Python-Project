"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic-controlled House, with President Trump’s support, early Saturday passed a bill to provide free testing for the coronavirus, as well as paid sick and family leave, strengthened unemployment insurance and increased food aid to ease the hardship on families. The vote was 363-40. The legislation will be taken up by the Senate next week. It would require paid leave for workers who contract the virus or who care for those who do and additional food aid for the poor and senior citizens. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, it causes more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus. The legislation includes: FREE CORONAVIRUS TESTING It requires private health insurance plans to provide free coronavirus testing and waives cost-sharing rules for testing provided to people covered by Medicare, Medicaid and federal retirement programs. Another $1 billion is provided to test people without health insurance. It boosts federal matching funds to state Medicaid programs by 6.2% to ease the financial strain on states. PAID SICK/FAMILY LEAVE It establishes a temporary coronavirus-related sick leave benefit paid by employers with fewer than 500 workers. Workers with the coronavirus would receive 100% or their wages if they have the coronavirus or are self-isolating and two-thirds of their pay when caring for family members. The benefit would expire in January 2021. It also permits 12 weeks of job-protected family or medical leave at two-thirds pay, though the first 14 days of the extended leave would be unpaid. In both cases, businesses would be reimbursed by the federal government through a refundable tax credit. FOOD AID It provides $1.3 billion in emergency food aid for low-income pregnant women and their young children, senior citizens and food banks. It allows states to provide food stamps to make up for lost school lunch benefits if their children are kept home from school and directs $100 million of the funds to U.S. territories. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak are already eligible for unemployment benefits, but the legislation provides $1 billion for additional caseloads and administrative costs to encourage temporarily furloughed workers to obtain unemployment benefits. PROTECTION FOR FIRST RESPONDERS The Occupational Safety and Health Administration would be required to issue a temporary rule requiring increased protections against the coronavirus.

"The federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., granted a request by House Democrats Friday to rehear cases over testimony from former White House Counsel Don McGahn and funds for President Trump’s border wall. Both cases are scheduled to be argued before the full circuit court on April 28. Democratic lawmakers in Congress have argued the president violated federal law by reallocating more than $8 billion from the Department of Defense to build the border wall. They also claim Mr. Trump abused his authority by denying the lawmakers from receiving testimony from Mr. McGahn during the impeachment inquiry.

"The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is calling on the Trump administration to “admit” that its ongoing pressure campaign against Iran is not working. The comments from Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, came just days after Iranian-backed military group Kata’ib Hezbollah launched an attack on a base north of Baghdad that killed two U.S. service members and one British soldier and wounded 14 others. The U.S. responded Thursday evening with airstrikes on five of the group’s weapons storage facilities that the Pentagon says “will degrade Kata’ib Hezbollah’s ability to conduct future strikes.” In a statement Friday evening, Mr. Menendez, the ranking member of the committee, said “that in attributing Wednesday’s attacks to Iranian-backed militia groups, the Trump Administration must admit its efforts to deter Iranian aggression are failing and American service members are paying the ultimate sacrifice.” The escalation in tension between Washington and Tehran quickly resurfaced just as the House approved a war powers resolution aimed at limiting the president’s authority to use force against Iran without explicit congressional approval. The bill — while expected to be vetoed by President Trump — “directs the President to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces for hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran or any part of its government or military, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force against Iran.” Mr. Menendez highlighted the bipartisan support for the resolution that allowed it to be approved by the Republican-held Senate and said this majority “has made clear it does not support an unnecessary war with Iran.”  ",Menendez calls on Trump to admit Iranian deterrence efforts are failing,"Friday, March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/13/menendez-calls-on-trump-to-admit-iranian-deterrenc/,washington_times
"In his quest to regain a Senate seat he once held, Jeff Sessions may have lost the endorsement he most coveted — the president’s — but he is racking up stamps of approval from many players in the conservative establishment. On Friday, the National Rifle Association backed Mr. Sessions’ bid to return to the Senate, an uphill fight in which the former attorney general trailed one time Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville in the March 3 primary. The two are now heading into a March 31 Republican runoff. The NRA’s backing came just two days after President Trump gave Mr. Tuberville his enthusiastic endorsement, driving a final stake through any pretension Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions maintained a political alliance or friendship. In Mr. Trump’s eyes, Mr. Sessions committed an unforgivable betrayal when, shortly after he got the attorney general position, he recused himself from the investigation into fraudulent charges the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. That led to the appointment of a special prosecutor who packed his office with supporters of Hillary Clinton and generally haunted the first three years of the Trump administration. No evidence of collusion was ever found. Nevertheless, the Sessions campaign has crafted itself as Trump loyalists, all behind a conservative lawmaker who could advance the president’s agenda better than a political neophyte and Alabama carpetbagger like Mr. Tuberville. “Powerful, well-funded national forces are bent on destroying our right to keep and bear arms,” Mr. Sessions said. “Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are working day and night to gut the Second Amendment. I have fought Schumer and Pelosi on this issue, and I have won, and I will do so again when I return to the Senate. “Alabama cannot afford to send an untested, unproven, weak-kneed greenhorn to the Senate who will get run over by Schumer and Pelosi,” Mr. Sessions added. Jason Ouimet, who heads the NRA’s Political Victory Fund, said endorsing Mr. Sessions was an easy choice. “Based on your strong leadership on Second Amendment issues as a U.S. senator and U.S. attorney general, you have earned the highest attainable rating, an A+ from NRA-PVF,” Mr. Ouimet said in the announcement. The winner of the Tuberville-Sessions runoff will face Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in November. Mr. Jones, who rode to office on a tide of out-of-state money in a 2017 special election to replace Mr. Sessions, is rated the most vulnerable senate incumbent by most political analysts. The myriad endorsements Mr. Sessions has collected reflect how the conservative establishment trusts him after he spent decades in Washington as a rock-ribbed Republican. Earlier this week, Mr. Sessions garnered support from the Eagle Forum PAC, which joined the endorsements from the Family Research Council PAC, the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, the Alabama Forestry Association and several conservative luminaries in the Yellowhammer state. But the establishment’s muscle may be hard pressed to push Mr. Sessions over the hurdle of Mr. Trump’s endorsement of his opponent, and the fact the March 3 primary saw a plurality of voters prefer either Mr. Tuberville or Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne who finished third.

"Count Sen. Bernie Sanders among the people who think President Trump should get tested for the coronavirus. During a press conference in Burlington, Vt., Mr. Sanders was asked whether Mr. Trump should get tested and release those results after reportedly  being around people who have been diagnosed with the virus. “I would,” Mr. Sanders said. “To the best of my knowledge I have not been in proximity to somebody who had the virus. If I knew that I was, I would get tested, and I think that holds true for the president.” During a press conference at The White House Friday, Mr. Trump said he sees no reason for that to happen because he has not exhibited symptoms of COVID-19.

"President Trump declared a national emergency to deal with the new coronavirus that’s swept the globe and hit the U.S., saying states will get federal money and face fewer obstacles in testing and caring for patients. “Two very big words,” Mr. Trump said from the White House Rose Garden. “No resource will be spared, nothing whatsoever.” The designation will invoke the Stafford Act and extend up to $50 billion in aid to states and municipalities. He also ordered states to activate emergency-operation plans. Mr. Trump said he is temporarily waiving interest on student loans held by federal entities and that he directed the Department of Energy to buy up oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Also, his administration will give hospitals and health centers the flexibility to see patients from afar through telehealth and waive certain licensing requirements, so doctors can’t help areas that need them. He’s also waiving restrictions that limit the number of hospital beds in each facility or the length of a patient’s stay. Mr. Trump also revealed he plans to be tested for the virus.

"The White House reached a sweeping agreement with congressional Democrats late Friday on a bill to provide relief to workers hurt by the coronavirus outbreak. “We are proud to have reached  an agreement with the Administration to resolve outstanding challenges,  and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act,”  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to her colleagues. After some last-minute wrangling, President Trump tweeted his support for the measure shortly before 9 p.m., clearing the way for a bipartisan vote. “This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers,” Mr. Trump said. “I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt.” He added, “I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES! I will always put the health and well-being of American families FIRST. Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!” Mrs. Pelosi had a dozen conversations with Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin throughout the day as they negotiated the details. The package includes free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured; two  weeks of guaranteed paid sick leave, as well as increased family leave;  increased spending on  unemployment benefits; more money to provide  school lunches to students whose schools are closed; and an increase in  Medicaid funding. Mr. Trump had been pushing for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year, but Democrats opposed it. Getting the White House’s approval means the Republican-controlled Senate would likely approve the measure sometime next week. Lawmakers are planning to take up an even larger emergency response bill on the coronavirus in the weeks ahead. Congress has already approved an $8.3 billion measure to help states with their initial emergency health care responses.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont said the coronavirus crisis is exposing gaps in the nation’s “cruel” and “dysfunctional” health care system that leaves millions of people without coverage when they need it most and millions of others more susceptible to contracting the virus. Mr. Sanders said the virus is helping the public come to grips with the fact that it is time to make fundamental changes to the economy and health care system that lifts up the working-class, calling for paid family leave, overhauled trade deals and a guarantee of health coverage. “In my view, the most cost-effective way to reform our dysfunctional and cruel system is to move to a Medicare for All single-payer health care system and I think in the midst of this crisis more and more Americans understand the truth of that,” Mr. Sanders said at a press conference in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont. “It is nearly impossible to believe that anyone can still think it is acceptable to continue with a health care system that leaves tens of millions of people uninsured.” “The cruelty and absurdity of that view is more obvious in the midst of this crisis,” he said. “Let’s be clear, the lack of health care and affordable medicine does not only threaten the health and well-being of the uninsured, it impacts everyone who comes in contact with them. In fact, what this crisis is beginning to teach us is that we are only as safe as the least insured person in America.” Fears over the virus have changed the contours of the 2020 presidential race, with Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden taking the advice of health officials and deciding against holding campaign rallies and events with large numbers of people. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden are set to appear in their first one-on-one debate Sunday. Citing concerns over coronavirus, the Democratic National Committee and the event sponsors, CNN and Univision, announced the debate would be moved from Phoenix to Washington, D.C., and that there would be no live audience. Consequently, Mr. Sanders has relied on getting his message out at press conferences this week that have been streamed online and picked up by cable news networks. On Friday, Mr. Sanders said public health officials, doctors, and scientists should lead the response to the virus  - not politicians. The federal government must dramatically increase the availability of test kits, intensive care units, and doctors and medical personnel needed to combat the virus, while making sure the frontline workers are protected, he said. Mr. Sanders said the nation must take stock of the mistakes the government has made responding to the virus and what moves can be made to the federal government to make sure people are better equipped to face future challenges. Mr. Sanders drove home the point that he expects support for universal health care to increase and lamented how the nation’s trade deals have sent jobs overseas and made the nation reliant on foreign countries such as China for the supplies it needs to combat this sort of crisis. “People who are sick today, who woke up with symptoms of the coronavirus are saying, ‘You know I feel sick, but I can’t afford to go to a doctor,’ and when somebody is not treated for the virus, somebody who is unable to afford to go to that doctor, that means that the infection can spread to many others, putting us at risk,” Mr. Sanders said. “Now the lack of health insurance for many millions of people threatens other people as well.”  ","America ‘only as safe as the least insured person,’ Sanders says regarding coronavirus emergency","Friday, March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-only-safe-least-insured-bernie-sanders/,washington_times
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats will vote later Friday on a coronavirus relief package, with or without the support of the White House. “The American people expect and deserve a coordinated, science-based and whole-of-government response to keep them and their loved ones safe,” Mrs. Pelosi said at the Capitol. But she didn’t answer a reporter’s question about whether President Trump supports the bill. The president wants a cut in payroll taxes through the end of the year; Democrats haven’t included it in the measure. Mr. Trump said later that the White House was still negotiating with Democrats, but he wasn’t pleased with the bill. “We just don’t think they’re giving enough,” the president said. “They’re not doing what’s right for the country. We thought we had something, but all of a sudden they didn’t agree to certain things they had agreed to.” The package would make coronavirus testing free for everyone who needs it, allow for two weeks of paid sick leave and provide unemployment insurance for furloughed workers. “We can only defeat this outbreak if we have an accurate determination of its scale and scope, so that we can pursue the precise science-based response that is necessary to put families first,” Mrs. Pelosi said. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin has been negotiating nearly round the clock with Mrs. Pelosi on the bill. They spoke eight times on Friday alone.

"NEW ORLEANS — Louisiana postponed its scheduled presidential primary by two months Friday in response to the ongoing coronavirus health crisis, officials said.Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced the primary, slated to be held on April 4, will now be June 20.Mr. Ardoin is expected to provide more details at a press conference later Friday. While major professional and college sports events, along with many college campuses, have shut down, Louisiana is the first political event to be postponed because of the virus. The state had 33 presumptive cases of coronavirus as of Friday morning, with the biggest cluster of those — 23 — being New Orleans. Many of Louisiana’s Election Day commissioners are 65 or older, and to date the coronavirus has been most lethal to the elderly. In addition, 32 polling locations are in nursing homes of senior facilities, according to the secretary of state’s office. “This decision has been made out of an absolute abundance of caution for Louisiana’s voters, voting officials and the general public as a whole,” Mr. Ardoin said. The primary was formally switched when Mr. Ardoin’s request to move it to June 20 was approved by Gov. John Bel Edwards. Although it does not appear to have moved voting days because of health scares in the past, Louisiana has altered its election schedule because of major hurricanes and natural disasters, officials said.

"Sen. Bob Casey took a shot at the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus, saying Americans would have better luck purchasing a semi-automatic rifle than they would tracking down a test kit for the virus. “Right now in America, it is easier to get an AR-15 than a test kit for COVID-19,” the Pennsylvania Democrat said on Twitter. President Trump and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been widely-criticized for being too slow to react to the spread of the infection. On Friday, Mr. Trump has shifted the blame for the shortage of test kits onto the Obama administration and the CDC, arguing they left the nation unprepared for this sort of outbreak. A week ago, Mr. Trump said that, “Anyone who wants a test can get a test” and Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said there is “no testing kit shortage.” Democrats on Capitol Hill have vehemently disagreed.

"The coronavirus has started to infect more and more political ads — particularly attacks targeting Republicans on health care. Advertising Analytics, an independent ad tracking firm, highlighted the recent uptick in coronavirus-related ads in its weekly recap, pointing out that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was the first to run a pair of COVID-19-related television spots in his short-lived 2020 campaign, and outside groups aligned with Democrats have since followed in his footsteps. Fair Fight Action, a voting rights group created by former Georgia state Rep. Stacey Abrams, has accused Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who defeated Ms. Abrams in the state’s 2018 gubernatorial race, of seeking to “blow up” programs that “keep Georgia Safe.” “Kemp is proposing blowing up our criminal justice system, cutting millions of dollars, blowing up job training programs, blowing up mental health services blowing up health care funding for every Georgia county as coronavirus hits our state,” the narrator says in the ad. Sen. Steve Daines, Republican Montana, was the target of a coronavirus-inspired attack ad from Protect Our Care, a liberal health care group that advocates for Obamacare. “Too many Montana families go to sleep at night worried about health care — coverage, costs, now the fear of coronavirus,” the narrator says in the ad. “That doesn’t worry. Steve Daines.” The Health Care Education Project, meanwhile, is accusing President Trump in an ad of trying to cut health care that people will need to protect themselves from the virus. “Now Trump wants billions more health care cuts when we need it most,” the narrator says over a screenshot of Mr. Trump and a news headline “CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK.” It then pivots to a video clip from a press conference in which New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says, “There has to be a play where you don’t play politics.” “It has to end somewhere, and it should end with health care,” the Democrat says.

"The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee moved forward with a subpoena against a lobbying shop for records relating to the work former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s son, Hunter, did for a Ukrainian energy firm. The committee suddenly shifted its attention to Blue Star Strategies earlier this week instead of its former consultant, Andrii Telizhenko, who turned to conservative talk radio to make his case. Sen. Ron Johnson, committee chairman, notified his Democratic colleagues on Thursday that he was sending a subpoena to Blue Star for records of its work on behalf of Burisma Holdings, the firm connected to Hunter Biden. Mr. Johnson’s letter indicates he also wants Blue Star’s CEO and chief operating officer to testify before his committee. Lawmakers were expected to vote in committee on Wednesday to issue a subpoena to Mr. Telizhenko, but Mr. Johnson abruptly shifted course to focus directly on Blue Star itself. Mr. Johnson has reiterated the decision was made based upon the suggestion of “both Democrat and Republican members of our committee.” Mr. Telizhenko still wants to have his voice heard, and appeared on conservative radio host Glenn Beck’s program on Thursday. Mr. Telizhenko said he did not want to speak about Blue Star until he felt threatened and heard that if Mr. Biden wins the presidency Mr. Telizhenko may no longer be welcome in the United States. “I have emails, communications, with Blue Star Strategies throughout the time I worked for them, before and after, that I wanted to share with the Senate, which is relevant for the investigation,” Mr. Telizhenko told Glenn Beck. “There’s no Russia collusion here, it’s just documents.” Mr. Telizhenko said his information is covered by a nondisclosure agreement, which is why he cannot voluntarily turn his information over to the Senate in the absence of the issuance of a subpoena. No hearing has yet been scheduled for the testimony of Blue Star executives.

"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who had dinner with President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence last weekend, said Friday his second test for the coronavirus was negative. Mr. Bolsonaro made the announcement on his Facebook page after a major daily newspaper in Brazil reported that his first test was positive. His son Eduardo, a lawmaker who was also on the trip, told Fox News that his father’s initial test was positive. Eduardo Bolsonaro tweeted Thursday that Mr. Bolsonaro was tested but was “not exhibiting any symptoms of the disease.” The populist Brazilian leader has developed a bond with Mr. Trump and met with the president Saturday at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Mr. Bolsonaro’s top press aide, who also attended the meetings with Mr. Trump, also has tested positive for the virus. The White House said Thursday that Mr. Trump hasn’t been tested, and the president said he was not concerned about being in close proximity to someone with the virus. Mr. Bolsonaro was wearing a surgical mask Thursday while carrying out his official duties in Brazil.

"House Majority Whip James Clyburn said he considers President Trump to be a racist and that the U.S. “could very well go the way of Germany in the 1930s,” Axios reported Friday. Mr. Clyburn, South Carolina Democrat, made the remarks in a recent interview scheduled to air this weekend on the “Axios on HBO” cable program, the news site reported. “I used to wonder, how could the people of Germany allow Hitler to exist? But with each passing day, I’m beginning to understand how. And that’s why I’m trying to sound the alarm,” Mr. Clyburn said in an excerpt released ahead of the episode airing. The third-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives and one of the most influential congressmen on Capitol Hill, Mr. Clyburn has been frequently critical of Mr. Trump and his policies as president. Mr. Clyburn endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden right before South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary. The congressman has also previously drawn parallels between Mr. Trump and former Nazi leader Adolf Hitler on more than one occasion. “Having studied history and having taught history, I can only equate one period of time with what we are experiencing now and that was what was going on in Germany around 1934 right after the 1932 elections when Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor,” Mr. Clyburn said during a CNN interview in January 2018. “When I see and hear and experience what’s going on in the country today, I think back to that time, and I really believe that we as Americans had better get a handle on things. If we don’t, we could very well see ourselves going the way of Germany,” he said at the time. More recently, Mr. Clyburn reiterated that warning while speaking to NBC News last March. “Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor of Germany. And he went about the business of discrediting institutions to the point that people bought into” it,” Mr. Clyburn said last year. “Nobody would have believed it now. But swastikas hung in churches throughout Germany. We had better be very careful.” The full version of the recent interview with Mr. Clyburn will air Sunday on HBO, Axios reported.

"PHOENIX (AP) - Maria Chavira, a senior administrator in the Diocese of Phoenix, says Spanish-speaking Catholic parishes in her area are “bursting at the seams” and celebrates the emergence of Hispanics as the largest ethnic component of the church nationwide. Throughout the Southwest, where the surge has been dramatic, Roman Catholic leaders are excited by the possibilities - and well aware of daunting challenges.  Hispanics now account for 40% of all U.S. Catholics, and a solid majority of school-age Catholics. Yet Hispanic Americans are strikingly underrepresented in Catholic schools and in the priesthood - accounting for less than 19% of Catholic school enrollment and only about 3% of U.S.-based priests.  In the Phoenix diocese, there are than 700,000 Hispanics out of a total of 1.2 million Catholics. Yet out of more than 200 priests, Catholic researchers counted only seven American-born Hispanics.  Extensive efforts are under way to narrow the demographic gaps. They have been highlighted in a nearly completed four-year study  by U.S. Catholic bishops seeking to strengthen the church’s engagement with Hispanics.  ”We have a lot of opportunities,” said Chavira, who oversees the Hispanic Mission Office and other departments in the Phoenix diocese. “There may be a little turbulence ahead, but we’re going to make it.”  Chavira is among more than two dozen Catholic leaders and activists who shared their thoughts about the Hispanic Catholic phenomenon with The Associated Press, some in telephone interviews and others face-to-face during a reporting trip to Arizona and Texas’ Rio Grande Valley.  Evidence of the change can be seen each December, when thousands of Hispanic Catholics dance and march in downtown Phoenix to celebrate Our Lady of Guadalupe. It can be seen in fast-growing, heavily Hispanic communities in Phoenix’s western suburbs.  Nationwide, more than 1,200 Catholic schools have closed in the past decade, usually under financial stress. Yet in the suburb of Avondale, enrollment is surging at a handsome new Catholic high school.  The school, named for Pope John Paul II, opened in 2018. About 70% of its 220 students are Hispanic; plans call for rapid expansion to accommodate an enrollment of 1,000.  “We’re serving people who’ve been underserved in this nation,” said the principal, Sister Mary Jordan Hoover. “These young people are trying to learn to be the next teachers, the next administrators, writers, doctors. They’re dreaming big.”  The hopefulness contrasts with circumstances in some other regions. Hundreds of parishes have closed in the Northeast and Midwest. The clergy sex abuse scandal has forced more than 20 dioceses across the U.S. into bankruptcy since 2004, most recently in the Northeast. The scandals haven’t spared the Southwest. The dioceses in Tucson, Arizona, and in Santa Fe and Gallup, New Mexico, are among those that declared bankruptcy. But in states along the Mexico border, past scandals don’t diminish the excitement over a future Hispanic-accented Catholic church. More than 400 new parishes have opened since 1970 in the border states, and many Hispanic Catholics were elated by the recent election of Mexican-born Los Angeles Archbishop José Gómez as the first Hispanic president of the bishops’ conference.  “It’s the tale of two churches,” said Hosffman Ospino, a professor of Hispanic ministry at Boston College. “In Boston, I see a Catholicism that’s very reserved. In the Southwest it’s very public, very expressive.”  A major challenge for the Catholic hierarchy: persuading more Hispanic young men to become priests.  An example of that challenge: 30-year-old Diego Piña Lopez of Tucson. He’s devoted his life to the Catholic tenet of supporting the dignity of all people, including asylum seekers who visit Casa Alitas, the Catholic-run shelter in Tucson where he works.  Growing up, he sometimes considered becoming a priest, but opted instead to pursue graduate degrees in social work and public health. Why not the priesthood? “I wanted to have a family,” he said.  By the latest count of the bishops’ conference, there are about 37,300 U.S.-based priests. Among them are roughly 3,000 Hispanics - more than 2,000 of them foreign-born.  One problem, said Ospino, is that Hispanics in the U.S. have lagged behind other groups in regard to college-level education, limiting the pool of young men qualified for seminary.  But even as the second and third generations of many Hispanic immigrant families do pursue higher education, other factors are at play.  “With those generations, there’s extremely heavy pressure to think more about economic success than the glory of God,” said Daniel Flores, bishop of Brownsville, Texas. “We need to teach them the concept of service, rather than you need to earn as much as you can.”  Overall enrollment in Catholic schools in the U.S. has plummeted in recent decades, from more than 5.2 million in the 1960s to about 1.73 million this year. Of the current students, only 18.5% are Hispanic.  Experts cite several reasons. Many Hispanics in the U.S. come from Latin American countries where private schools, including Catholic ones, are viewed as bastions of the wealthy. With tuition averaging more than $5,000 for elementary grades and $10,000 for high school, Catholic education in the U.S. seems unaffordable to many families. And many Catholic schools are losing students to charter schools which are able to access government funds for their operations.  All these factors are present in the Brownsville, diocese, where Catholic school enrollment has dropped sharply in recent years in the face of tougher competition from charter and public schools.  One of the elementary schools fighting to maintain its enrollment is St. Mary’s Catholic School. Its principal, Ana Gomez, says 95% of her 350 students are Hispanic. She’s been able to keep enrollment stable with strategies taught by the Latino Enrollment Initiative, a program based at Notre Dame University. Tactics include ensuring that schools are culturally in sync with Hispanic families, and helping parents fit tuition into their budgets. About 80 St. Mary’s students now get some financial aid, Gomez said.  While the Hispanic population in the U.S. is sure to grow, the extent of the Catholic Church’s hold on them is uncertain. Last year, the Pew Research Center reported that U.S. Hispanics are no longer a majority-Catholic group, with 47% of them calling themselves Catholic, down from 57% in 2009. The number identifying as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” increased from 16% to 23%; those identifying as Protestant rose from 23% to 26%.  Melba Salazar-Lucio, a professor and migrant-rights activist in Brownsville, says today’s Catholic Church seems too rigid for many Hispanics. Her mother no longer attends church, she said, and her three grown children are no longer practicing Catholics.  “There are other denominations - they have more music, younger pastors who are more accepting of people’s ways,” Salazar-Lucio said. “The Catholic church is not going to be changing with the times.”  At a migrant outreach center in Nogales, Mexico, abutting the Arizona border, Jesuit priest Sean Carroll ministers every day to asylum seekers who dream of joining the ranks of Hispanic Catholics in the U.S.  “They are bringing their culture, their gifts,” he said. “The challenge for the church is to be open to receiving those gifts. How do we get them to see themselves as leaders? How do we get them to feel at home?”  ___  Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

"BAGHDAD (AP) - At the once bustling hub of the largest anti-government protest movement in Iraq’s modern history, crowds have dwindled, and donation boxes have sprouted up. Loudspeakers resound with calls by activists for funds to keep their hard-fought revolution alive.  The six-month-old movement has faced one setback after another, from the shifting positions of a mercurial Shiite cleric to an apathetic political class and, now, fears over an outbreak of the coronavirus  that Iraq’s decrepit health system has struggled to contain, with nearly 93 confirmed cases and nine deaths.  Where once Baghdad’s Tahrir Square had seen thousands every day, now only a few hundred protesters turn up. Morale has been dampened among young Iraqis who first took to the streets on Oct. 1 to decry rampant government corruption, poor services and unemployment.  Protesters have found it difficult to revive the strength of their leaderless movement after scoring victories early on, like pressuring lawmakers to pass a key electoral reform bill and forcing former Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi to step down. Assassinations, abductions and threats targeting prominent protesters have contributed to blunting the momentum.  A looming economic crisis linked to the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing political dysfunction could eventually bring a new jolt that inspires Iraqis back to the streets. But for the moment, the movement is looking at what went wrong. The difficulties of recent months caused the poles of authority among protesters to shift from the capital to the south, while some say shunning any form of central leadership was a mistake. In Tahrir Square, a group of young men recently shared a hookah pipe under a tarp by a tunnel replete with the wall art of their revolution. Together, they embodied the spirit that first brought many into Iraq’s central squares to protest. Marwan Ali, 23, had attended university to study communication but could only find work as a barber after graduation. Mohammed Abbas, 19, didn’t bother pursuing a higher education, convinced it wouldn’t secure a job. So in October he picked up a banner and joined the movement.  Hussein al-Hind, 22, was a teenager when he heeded a call by Iraq’s top Shiite cleric to take up arms and defeat the Islamic State group with what would later become the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Forces. He soon became disenchanted as his one-time war heroes joined the ranks of the political class by running in the May 2018 election.  The young men have also suffered the violence that has met the movement. Al-Hind showed off two bullet wounds from clashes with riot police; Abbas was detained by police for three days early on in the demonstrations; Ali’s family has received messages from unknown groups threatening his life.  Now, the future of their hard-fought protest movement depends on the ability of these youth to keep to the streets. When the conversation turned to the state of their movement, Marwan Ali took a moment’s pause.  “We are disappointed,” he said. Asked why he was still coming to Tahrir, he said, “This isn’t about the homeland anymore, we are here for the blood of our martyrs.” Over 500 people have been killed since October under fire by security forces who have used live ammunition, tear gas and recently pellet guns to disperse crowds.  In nearby Khilani Square, clashes still rage between a core group of protesters and security, with at least two demonstrators dead last week.  The movement was dealt a blow in January after radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who also heads a major political bloc, withdrew support after elites selected a prime minister candidate he backed, Mohammed Allawi. Al-Sadr’s reversal instilled a climate of fear in the square as militiamen affiliated with his group, which once protected protest sites, intimidated demonstrators who refused to back Allawi, activists said. Allawi has since withdrawn from the post. “We were tools in al-Sadr’s game,” said Kamal Jaban, an activist.  It was an eventuality that activists said they wanted to avoid when al-Sadr’s followers first joined the movement.  As early as November, protesters bristled at the question of leadership and were quick to diminish the credibility of those making claims of authority over them. They tore down stages built by political parties in protest plazas, fearing the fate of previous grassroots movements that fizzled out when co-opted by political actors.  Three months since, protesters said in hindsight the lack of core leadership had hobbled their movement, enabling figures like al-Sadr to do exactly what they had feared.  “There is no one to represent us, put pressure on the government,” said Ali, under the tarp in Tahrir.  Al-Sadr’s move also diminished Tahrir Square’s status as the central voice of the movement. Activists started looking to Haboubi Square in the southern city of Nasiriya for orders. Nasiriya’s protesters have been resilient against infiltration by political parties, partly due to support from local tribes.  In hindsight, said Ali, this weakened the movement.  “Tahrir Square became tainted with al-Sadr supporters,” he explained. “At first Nasiriya was listening to us, now we listen to them.”  It was Nasiriya that gave political elites a deadline to make progress on protester demands, prompting an escalation in demonstrations across the country. Later, calls from the southern city led protesters in Baghdad to block the strategic Mohammed al-Qassim highway. When Haboubi Square raised the image of activist Alaa Rikabi as their choice for prime minister, Tahrir did the same.  Other protesters said fatigue from months on the street was taking a toll as donations for food and supplies were running short and temperatures dropped over the winter. “Weak turnout was expected some time ago because the protesters who have been here for five months are tired, sleeping in cold and far from wor¬¬k, their families and school,” said Murtada Emad, a protester and university student at Babil College of Basic Education. “I left school, but my family is pressuring me to go back.” By February, protesters were marginalized as political bickering over Allawi’s government formation ignored the core demands of the street. Allawi withdrew as prime minister-designate on March 1 after failing to secure parliamentary support for his Cabinet.  Back in Tahrir, Ali Jumaili, 22, said all hope was not lost.  “Every day, I sit on the sidewalk with my friends and weep because of the weakening demonstrations,” he said. “The revolution will repeat itself with more vigor in the future.”  ",Iraq's protesters struggle to keep waning movement going,"Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/iraqs-protesters-struggle-to-keep-waning-movement-/,washington_times
"BEIJING (AP) - Courtney Huang fell in love with the U.S. as a nursing student in Texas. She ended up staying 13 years and wants to become a U.S. citizen. But Huang now finds her job, future, and dreams of citizenship on the line since the Trump administration barred entry last month to non-U.S. citizens and residents flying in from China over the coronavirus outbreak. With crucial deadlines looming, her plans look increasingly at risk. “I’m really scared,” Huang said. “I have a lot there. If I don’t go back, it’s just going to be very difficult.” The U.S. suspended visa processing in China on Feb. 3, citing limited staffing during the virus outbreak. No deadline extensions have been announced and it’s not known when the suspension will be lifted. That’s put hundreds of Chinese citizens applying for U.S. work visas in limbo, fretting as their jobs look increasingly at risk. Huang had returned to China to see her parents over the Lunar New Year holiday in late January. She had recently landed a new job in California and her work visa was on the verge of approval when the American Consulate in Shanghai announced it was returning everyone’s passports. After weeks of fretting and weighing her options at her parent’s home in eastern China, Huang flew to Thailand. She now plans to wait out a mandated 14-day self-quarantine before seeing if she can get her visa from the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok. Though Huang was born and raised in China, her whole life is now in Oakland, California, where she has an apartment, car, friends and job. With her Christian faith and gregarious, outspoken manner, the U.S. feels like home. “I feel like I fit in better there. Free speech, free religion,” Huang said. Clean air, better career opportunities for women and a liberal social environment were also draws, she added. Huang obtained a nursing degree in Texas, then a master’s degree in bioengineering from U.C. Berkeley. She’s on the verge of completing an M.B.A., with an eye toward settling permanently. Now, Huang is concerned those plans could fall apart. Though her new employers, a company that provides clinical support for physicians, are understanding, Huang worries that as the months go by, there’s a possibility she may lose her job - and with it, her right to work in the U.S. Like Huang, Kevin Yang, a Chinese doctoral student researching immunology at an American university, is also reconsidering his options. After moving to the U.s. eight years ago, Yang has returned home each winter holiday and had his student visa renewed without a hitch. This year, though, Yang became one of many Chinese citizens caught up in the brutal tussle between Beijing and Washington over trade and technology. When Yang applied for a visa in December, the State Department told him it was being delayed while they investigated his background for ties to the Chinese government. American officials have in recent years grown alarmed over the alleged theft of U.S. technology by China, casting a cloud of suspicion on Chinese citizens like Yang who work in the sciences. Told the check would take four weeks, Yang changed his flights and prepared to stay longer. Then in late January, the Chinese government began locking down whole cities to contain the virus. Soon after, Trump announced the U.S. travel ban. Yang got his passport back in the mail with no visa. American officials told Yang’s academic adviser that since Yang no longer had a visa, they could no longer pay his stipend or fund his research with federal grant money. Hospital surveys that Yang said he spent “thousands of dollars and thousands of hours” over two years to set up were now in peril, something he described as a crushing blow. “Maybe it’s time for me to start thinking about an alternative career,” Yang said, mulling the possibility he won’t be able to finish his Ph.D. “It’s like restarting my life.” Discouraging high-skilled foreigners from immigrating could undermine the U.S. economy and its global prominence, said Anastasia Tonello, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Nearly 2.5 million Chinese were in the U.S. as of 2018, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, and most are significantly better educated than the average American. China is also the main source of foreign students enrolled in U.S. higher education. While health and safety are legitimate concerns, blanket travel bans aren’t the answer, Tonello said. “I just don’t think this was thought through,” she said. “These are just such broad strokes and can cause so much damage.” The U.S. isn’t the only country currently restricting entry from China. Travelers face restrictions across the globe, from neighboring North Korea to far-flung New Zealand, Somalia, and Guatemala. Australia, a major destination for Chinese students and immigrants, also has banned arrivals and stopped issuing visas. Such restrictions have been loudly criticized by China’s Foreign Ministry, though Beijing frequently singles out the United States. Yang and Huang both say they understand why a travel ban could help contain the virus. But they say the U.S. halt on new visas - with no deadline extensions or other accommodations - is frustrating and unreasonable. Even more frustrating for Huang is the sense that the U.S. is trying to bar her from coming back. “I’m not being respected. I work in the states as a talent; I pay my taxes diligently,” Huang said. “This just makes me feel like, ‘Oh, maybe I’m just not welcome in the states.’” Even for Chinese with visas, the clock is ticking. Tom, a programmer from the epicenter of the outbreak, the city of Wuhan, had just obtained a master’s degree in computer science from Emory University in Georgia. He has a U.S. visa but got stuck in Wuhan after the city was quarantined. Under American law, foreign students have 90 days after graduation to start new jobs if they want to stay and work in the U.S. If Tom is still trapped in Wuhan by May, he’ll lose both his new job at Amazon and his chance to work in America altogether. “I’d have to start all over again,” Tom said, declining to provide his last name for fear it could affect his visa and career prospects. “I just worry every day about whether I can go back to America.” Tom says his family spent around $70,000 to send him to Emory for a shot at a better life in the U.S. He didn’t want to work in China, deterred by the Chinese tech industry’s notoriously-long hours, popularly known as “996” –9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. U.S. officials told him there was nothing he could do.  “We just want some help or advice,” Tom said. “Please don’t ignore us, it’s something completely out of our control. That’s the worst thing.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"PHOENIX (AP) - The U.S. government says a new rule disqualifying more people from green cards if they use government benefits will not apply to immigrants with coronavirus or virus symptoms if they seek care.  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said late Friday that seeking treatment or preventive services won’t affect someone’s immigration status under the new, highly criticized public charge rule, which took effect last month and which punishes immigrants who need public assistance.  The agency acknowledged that some immigrants may fear seeking care in the wake of the virus, saying that it “will neither consider testing, treatment, nor preventative care” related to the virus in determining someone’s eligibility for permanent residency. It said that those who can’t work or attend school and must rely on public benefits during the duration of the virus outbreak and recovery can later explain and provide documentation and that it will be taken into consideration.  The announcement came after lawmakers and advocacy groups urged the government to suspend the rule during the coronavirus outbreak. Advocates say they have been fielding panicked calls from immigrants who are worried about the impact on their status if they seek health care.  Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles, said her group and others held a news conference urging immigrants to seek care if needed and reminding them that their health, and the health of their families, is most important.  “People are wondering about their vulnerability both in terms of disease but their vulnerability in terms of immigration status, in terms of being discovered,” she said. Salas said she doesn’t fully trust the Trump administration but feels confident that state, county and local authorities will support immigrants who come forward to seek the health care they need, regardless of their immigration status. Advocates have long derided the public charge rule, which punishes immigrants who are in the country legally and who are allowed to access some benefits, such as food stamps, for their American-born children.  As the coronavirus began to spread more widely in the U.S., supporters and lawmakers cautioned it could be detrimental to public health if some immigrants were too afraid to seek care.  Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights Boston, said his organization got a request for legal support from a woman who worked in hospitality industry in Chelsea, Massachusetts. The woman said her work schedule is in flux, and she doesn’t have a steady income. She wanted to apply for food stamps for her 9-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, but was too afraid. Now, with her son’s school closing down indefinitely, she was even more concerned.  “There is a tremendous reluctance, even among immigrant parents raising U.S. citizen children. There is a lot of fear surrounding the public charge rule, especially because immigration courts have remained open, creating a strong impression that removal proceedings trumps public health concerns,” Espinoza-Madrigal said.  On Thursday, Democratic lawmakers pressured Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, to suspend or disregard the rule during the virus outbreak. Cuccinelli said the public health exemptions written into the rule already addressed that issue.  U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, said the rule scares away people from seeking care, posing a public health risk for everyone. She tweeted after the new statement on Friday: “This is a huge win for immigrants, public health AND everyone!” ___ Associated Press reporter Amy Taxin contributed to this report   ",US: Immigrants can seek coronavirus care without fear,"Friday, March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/13/us-immigrants-can-seek-coronavirus-care-without-fe/,washington_times
"WASHINGTON (AP) - Seattle’s immigration court will close down as the nation continues to grapple with managing the coronavirus pandemic, and several other large immigration courts will postpone certain hearings for immigrants who are not detained that often involve large groups.  The court in Seattle was temporarily shut down earlier this week over a report of a second-hand exposure to the virus and will remain shut until April 10. Seattle is among the areas hardest hit so far, with a cluster of deaths and dozens sickened. The number of cases in the U.S. was put at around 1,700 Friday, with about 50 deaths. But by some estimates, at least 14,000 people might be infected. According to a statement obtained by The Associated Press from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which manages the immigration court system, other courts will remain open where the virus has struck, including Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Newark, New Jersey, and Sacramento, California. But “master calendar” dates for those who are not detained will be postponed. Those hearings can include dozens of people in a single courtroom. “The agency continues to evaluate the dynamic situation nationwide and will make decisions for each location as more information becomes available,” according to the statement from EOIR, which is a division of the U.S. Department of Justice.  There are 68 immigration courts nationwide; the others will operate as scheduled but officials with EOIR said they are evaluating and will adjust as needed.                  The U.S. immigration courts  are dealing with a massive backlog of 1 million cases. There have been some delays of trials among the nation’s criminal courts, and some states have closed courtrooms as the virus spreads.  There have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the immigration system, but it’s not clear how frequently tests are being performed, if at all. There is often movement between detention facilities at the border, where some migrants enter the U.S. sick, and throughout the immigration system that has put employees on edge.  A union representing immigration judges has called for a temporary halt to the “master calendar” hearings. On Thursday, Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the head of the union, wrote to the leadership of EOIR asking for more measures be put in place to protect judges and employees.  “In the absence of uniform guidance, some immigration judges have attempted to implement their own risk mitigation strategies,” she wrote. “However, these efforts have been frustrated by a time-consuming bureaucratic process that is simply not sufficient in the current circumstances.” Tabbador also called the postponements in six cities “wholly inadequate to address the public health risk” and called on EOIR “to shut down all of these large group hearings in all immigration courts across the country.” In El Paso, Texas, some guards work shifts at both the long-term detention center and the public courts where people are not detained. On Friday, guards were seen interacting with two dozen migrants for a mass hearing in the non-detained court, which sits on the 7th floor of a building that also has public offices for the IRS and other federal agencies.  The migrants have been required to live in Mexico while they apply for asylum. They sleep in a network of shelters in Ciudad Juarez, along with migrants from other countries and other continents.  Separately on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it would temporarily suspend social visits at all of its detention facilities across the U.S. Officials said there were no detainees in ICE custody who had confirmed cases of COVID-19 and said canceling visitation was precautionary to “further safeguard those in our care.” ICE holds more than 37,888 immigrants in more than 130 facilities, including local jails and prisons. But unlike other detention centers, have wide discretion on who can be released while their cases wind through the courts.  The federal Bureau of Prisons also shut down visitation; inmates at all 122 federal correctional facilities across the country will no longer be allowed visits from family, friends or attorneys for the next 30 days. ___ Associated Press Writer Cedar Attanasio contributed to this report from El Paso, Texas.

"DETROIT (AP) - An expected guilty plea to corruption charges by former United Auto Workers President Gary Jones has been delayed due to the coronavirus and traveling concerns. Jones was to appear in federal court in Detroit on Thursday. He’s accused of conspiring with UAW cronies to embezzle more than $1 million. Defense attorney Bruce Maffeo told The Detroit News that he asked for - and received - a two-week delay and that the guilty plea now will come on April 2. Maffeo is from New York.

Some officials took kickbacks from union contractors. Jones was president for about 1 1/2 years until quitting under a cloud in November. The government said union money was spent on golf, cigars, spas, high-end lodging and liquor. Jones‘ alleged scheme goes back years to his time as the leader of a UAW regional office near St. Louis.

"LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) - Slovenia’s new, right-leaning government was sworn in on Friday, pledging stronger efforts to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. The 90-member parliament voted 52-31 to approve a coalition government led by Prime Minister Janez Jansa, leader of the anti-immigrant Slovenian Democratic Party and an ally of Hungary’s hardline Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Jansa, 61, promised a more concerted effort to contain the spread of the disease, criticizing the previous government which declared an epidemic on Thursday. The outgoing government “flunked the test in recent days,” Jansa said. “What was coming was underestimated and reactions were chaotic,” the official STA news agency quoted Jansa as saying.  Slovenia reported 141 cases of infections on Friday, with a surge of 45 new confirmed cases in less than 24 hours in the Alpine country of 2 million people that borders Italy, the focus of Europe’s coronavirus crisis.  Jansa’s predecessor, Prime Minister Marjan Sarec, was a rare liberal head of government in Central and Eastern Europe. He announced he was stepping down in January, citing lack of support for his minority government.  Sarec, a former actor and comedian, had called for an early election, but his two former coalition partners instead agreed to form a new government with Jansa.  Jansa served twice as the prime minister in the past. He was convicted of corruption in a verdict that was later overturned by Slovenia’s top court, before turning harshly anti-immigrant ahead of the 2018 election that followed the mass influx of migrants into Europe in 2015-16. Jansa’s SDS won the most votes in the 2018 parliamentary election, but other groups in parliament initially refused to cooperate with the party because of its right-wing policies. Analysts in Slovenia say Jansa somewhat has toned down his rhetoric to position himself as an acceptable political figure.

"CHICAGO (AP) — Joe Biden held a town hall in Illinois — or at least  tried to — from 800 miles away in Delaware. Bernie Sanders is staging  daily news conferences from Vermont, instead of his usual rallies around  the country with thousands of supporters. The global coronavirus pandemic has sent the 2020 presidential campaign into a virtual phase. Big rallies and handshakes are out. Virtual phone banks and town  halls are the new normal. Political parties and groups are canceling  in-person gatherings. States holding primaries in coming weeks have urged more voters to  cast ballots by mail and extended hours for early voting centers in an  effort to avoid election day crowds. On Friday, Louisiana’s governor  said he planned to postpone his state’s April 4  primary to June. The Biden campaign scrapped plans for a Chicago rally ahead of  Illinois’ Tuesday primary due to warnings from public and health  officials against large gatherings. Instead, the Democratic front-runner  was supposed to take questions Friday in a virtual town hall via  Facebook live. But it was a rocky start. The livestream started after Biden had  begun speaking, cutting off his introduction, and at one point Biden -  holding a cell phone in his hand - turned and walked partially off  camera, so viewers could no longer see his face. The stream lasted less  than five minutes before wrapping up, with the campaign apologizing for  “technical difficulties.” “I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the  connections,” Biden said after answering a question about protecting  endangered species. “There’s a lot more to say but I’ve already probably  said too much to you.” Sanders, Biden’s rival for the Democratic nomination, has been  holding daily press briefings from his home state, where he has blasted  President Donald Trump and his administration’s response to the virus.  Biden did the same in an address Thursday. Speaking to reporters Friday, Sanders was subdued - the emotional  opposite of the big rallies that have helped fuel his support at the  polls. He drew over 10,000 people at a Chicago rally on Saturday, before  officials starting warning against large events. Sanders said his team  has mastered the use of internet campaigning, livestreaming almost all  of its events already. COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and  cough, for most people. It can cause more severe illness, including  pneumonia, for some people, especially older adults and those with  existing health problems. Most people recover from it. Those with mild  illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness  may take three to six weeks to recover, according to the World Health  Organization. With the coronavirus causing a sea change in presidential  campaigning, candidates and their supporters worry that the virtual  events won’t have the same impact. “We do more rallies than anybody else, and (they’re) often very well  attended. I love to do them,” Sanders told reporters at a hotel in his  home state of Vermont. “This coronavirus has obviously impacted our  ability to communicate with people in the traditional way that we do.  That’s hurting.” In Chicago, Biden volunteer Lally Doerrer was preparing to have a few  other supporters over to her home Friday to watch the virtual town  hall. The retiree finished an online MBA program a few years ago and  said it helped familiarize her with technology like virtual classrooms  and the potential for it to reach many more people than a rally. And  while she believes canceling large gatherings is the right thing to do,  she doesn’t think the virtual events will have the same impact as when  people come together in person. “There is a common physical element that comes from being face to  face, or better yet marching side by side, and that’s what is lost in  this,” Doerrer said. At Biden headquarters, Friday is the last day before the campaign  moves to a work-at-home model for everyone, from the most senior  advisers to the newest organizer. The policy extends to field offices around the country, as well —  just as the campaign was looking to build out the campaign toward a  potential general election matchup against President Donald Trump. Trump  himself has canceled rallies, for now. Biden advisers are reluctant to talk about what the coming weeks may  look like, mostly because they don’t know. They’ve not announced a  public schedule beyond Friday’s town hall and a similar event in Miami  on Monday, both replacing scheduled rallies ahead of Tuesday primaries. If anything, those events are tryouts for a new style, while aides  continue monitoring public health advisories from the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention. In a staff memo, Anita Dunn, Biden’s top strategist, and Jen O’Malley  Dillon, his new campaign manager, said that as of Thursday, that  guidance still suggests that “small gatherings are safe,” as long as no  exposed persons participate. “We will continue to hold smaller events  like roundtables, house parties and press statements,” besides the  virtual events. It’s not the first time this election cycle that candidates have had  to get creative about reaching voters. Stuck in Washington for Trump’s  impeachment trial in the weeks before the kickoff Iowa caucuses, Sens.  Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar held telephone town halls with Iowa  voters, and Sanders held nightly online chats where he spoke to  supporters via live stream, offering updates on the impeachment trial  and his campaign. Klobuchar, who said over 12,000 Iowa voters participated in one of  her telephone town halls, also spoke via phone to voters in New  Hampshire, the second state to vote. Warren held similar calls with  voters in New Hampshire and South Carolina ahead of those states’  primaries, as she campaigned elsewhere. She suggested later while  campaigning in person that she’d reached thousands of voters that way,  but her campaign never released figures on how many people actually  dialed in. Biden has held at least one virtual fundraiser, a rather uneventful  telephone gathering on Dec. 5, when he called in and essentially  delivered a modified version of a stump speech that he’s since  overhauled. Last week, he called in to a fundraiser being held at a  private residence in northern Virginia. Donors heard in person from  former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who’s endorsed Biden, and Steve  Ricchetti, one of his closest and longest-serving advisers, before the  former vice president called in. ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

"ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) - The Michigan Supreme Court has accepted a case involving the University of Michigan and the papers of a man considered to be an influential voice in anti-immigration matters. Dr. John Tanton of Petoskey donated 25 boxes of papers to the university, but 11 boxes were to remain closed until 2035. Those terms now are in question. The Michigan appeals court last year said the closed records are public documents under the Freedom of Information Act because they’re being held by a campus library as an “official function.” It’s a key phrase in state law.  The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the months ahead. Tanton died in July at age 85, days after the appeals court decision. He had a key role in forming Federation for American Immigration Reform. The lawsuit was filed by Hassan Ahmad, an attorney in McLean, Virginia.

"PITTSBURGH (AP) - The soothing voice that transports listeners to faraway places is still there. Visitors to the famed Nationality Rooms inside the University of Pittsburgh’s Cathedral of Learning can still hear E. Maxine Bruhns, 96, pay tribute to the countries and cultures of immigrants who helped shape Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. They simply have to flip an audio switch. Narrations that she researched and wrote for nearly all of the 31 classrooms, each intended to represent those nations before Pitt’s 1787 founding, are part of the legacy of a West Virginia native who spent more than half a century as Nationality Rooms director before retiring this year, citing health issues. Her departure means that for the first time in 54 years, a new director will be sought for the rooms whose rich wood, stained glass, colorful artifacts and other furnishings are of museum quality, yet serve as modern-day classrooms for Pitt students. Creating an updated job description for the woman who supervised it all could be tough given the web of duties that Ms. Bruhns embraced - from greeting world dignitaries and fundraising, to crawling around in a hard hat during maintenance inspections. Throughout her tenure, the rooms had no greater fan or fierce protector, said Maryann Sivak, assistant to the director. “They were her children,” she said. “People would ask her which one was her favorite, and she would say ‘They’re all my favorites.’” Ms. Bruhns was not available to be interviewed for this story. In a farewell to the campus published in the Nationality Rooms newsletter, she referenced health setbacks but focused more on her beloved rooms and a worldview influenced by a period starting in the 1940s when she lived and traveled through Europe, Africa and Asia with her husband, Fred C. Bruhns, who later taught at Pitt. Mr. Bruhns, who worked in refugee resettlement, died in 2006 at age 90. “In 15 years, we never stayed more than two years in any one place. I survived all of these different moves with no tragedies and learning not to hate but always appreciating the culture in which I was living,” Ms. Bruhns wrote. “I brought that back with me and found this marvelous job …” Globally minded Each room - Russian, Hungarian, German, Swedish, Ukrainian, Israeli, Norwegian, African, English, Philippine and others - is distinctive, built with donations from immigrant communities proud of what their sweat in the Pittsburgh steel mills and elsewhere achieved. About 25,000 visitors a year pay to tour the rooms on the first and third floors of the 42-story Cathedral, the tallest classroom building in the Western Hemisphere. Those patrons (adults pay $4 and youths $2) are in addition to others who poke their heads into the rooms during the semester while classes are in session. University officials said they hope by summer to identify a successor for Ms. Bruhns. That person will need to embrace the digital age, while safeguarding the authenticity of a landmark whose oldest rooms date to 1938. “We want someone who is global in mind, but also someone who can understand Pittsburgh and its history and knows what these Nationality Rooms have meant,” said Ariel Armony, vice provost for global affairs and director of the University Center for International Studies. Ms. Bruhns was decades ahead of many in embracing international study, he said. She immersed herself in the cultures of each room - the festivals and the personalities tied to them - knowing that a strong presence within each ethnic community solidified their bond with the university. She never got used to the computer, said staff, who would print out emails for her. Around the cathedral, she was a force far larger than her 5-foot-4, 100-pound frame - not shy about letting everyone know what needed to get done and not above a little colorful language for effect. Her complex travels took her to 83 countries, many with her husband. They left her with some simple truths. “She’d always say, ‘We all came from someplace,’ ” said Ms. Sivak. “She accepted the fact that we all come with our own customs and cultures and they’re all different, and yet we’re able to be accepted into this country. “Everyone felt she was on their side.” The voice of the rooms Ms. Bruhns’s soft, in-room recorded narrations resemble the practiced speech of a museum guide. They blend history, geography, culture and architecture into mini-lectures, with references to Christianity and Noah’s Ark in one room and Mecca and Muhammad in another. “You have entered the Armenian nationality Room through a doorway which tells more of the story of these remarkable people …” her voice informs those standing inside the 21st Nationality Room, later adding: “The stone arch is carved with grapes and pomegranate. These fruits, so prevalent in the area, are symbolic of a fertile land.” In another room, as strains of the bandura are heard behind her, the narration tells visitors they, in effect, are in the reception room of an Eastern European home from the 18th century. “The importance of hospitality to Ukrainians is reflected in their proverb: ‘When a guest enters the house, God enters the home.’” Ms. Bruhns steadfastly steered the rooms clear of politics and protected their historical accuracy, said Michael Walter, the rooms’ tour coordinator. As the Soviet Union dissolved, some encouraged renaming the Czechoslovak room the Czech-Slovak room, but she said that was out of line with the room’s history. Yet she also advocated for a Ukrainian room, though at the time, it was a state within the Soviet Union and not a sovereign nation. Appealing to immigrants On a research campus where clout is wielded by surgeons, scientists and executives with tongue-twisting titles, Ms. Bruhns drew her authority from a different place. Said Mr. Walter, “She talked to everyone.” Born in 1924 as E. Maxine Moose, she grew up 100 miles or so south of Pittsburgh in Grafton, W.Va., owned a pit bull, raised chickens and two piglets that her mother won in a hog-calling contest at a 4-H Club, according to co-workers. As she grew, so did Pitt’s massive Cathedral of Learning, an Indiana limestone structure symbolizing the university’s reach. It was commissioned three years before her birth and built between 1926 and 1936. Then-Chancellor John Bowman, who promoted the Cathedral, sought to harness the enthusiasm of immigrant mill workers by establishing classrooms that would honor their traditions and inspire their children to seek a college education. That idea became the Nationality Rooms. Staff say Ms. Bruhns has always worn her rural roots with pride, often calling herself a “by-gosh hillbilly.” She was an insatiably curious traveler and passionate voice for global scholarship at Pitt, a commuter campus in the 1960s beginning to realize its global aspirations. But her spontaneity was never far away. One day she greeted young 4-H Club members from Westmoreland County with a hog call in the Cathedral’s Commons Room. On the building’s third floor, just past the Armenian and Swiss rooms, two wall display cases are filled with artifacts and memories from her travels - many before she arrived at Pitt. Some are beautiful, if obscure, like the Mende mask from Sierra Leone, and the white oak plate and vessel from 20th century Ukraine, crockery made from a tree sacred to Ukrainians. Other mementos leap out: the photo of Ms. Bruhns standing with Dr. Albert Schweitzer, the theologian, humanitarian and physician of the early 20th century, with whom she spent 36 hours in 1964 while on the west coast of Africa. She and her late husband hopscotched the globe before arriving at Pitt in 1965. During that time, Ms. Bruhns learned to speak French “well,” German “with cute little mistakes,” and “conversational” Arabic, Farsi and Greek, she told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2006. She knew “basic” Italian and Cambodian and “emergency” Spanish and Chinese, she said. The couple ventured to Austria shortly after World War II to resettle war refugees, she said in the interview. Then it was off to Beirut, where the Ohio State University alumna finished a master’s degree and her husband examined the Palestinian refugee crisis. They were in South Vietnam in 1955 to help refugees fleeing from the north. Then there was Cambodia, and later, Iran during the reign of the shah. “We were supposed to go to Baghdad, but they had just killed the king, so they sent us to Tehran,” she said. Dalai Lama to Khrushchev At Pitt, her tenure dating nearly to the Cuban missile crisis generated colorful experiences and stories, from rice she shared with co-workers that had been blessed by the Dalai Lama and given to her during a visit to Oakland, to recollections of a tour of the Nationality Rooms by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, several years before she began her job. “He didn’t like the Russian room because it didn’t have any symbols of his beliefs,” she told the Post-Gazette in 2007. “They took him up to the Early American room and he said, ‘Now this is a Russian room.’ It had a big fireplace, a wooden floor, big, heavy wooden beams and a carved table.” Yet her most colorful stories may be the recorded room descriptions themselves, like that of the Syria-Lebanon Room, originally a library in a fine Damascus home dating to 1782. “Linden-paneled walls and ceiling are decorated with Gesso painting, in which a mixture of chalk and glue is applied by brush in intricate relief then painted and overlaid with silver and gold leaf.’’ The images may be why Ms. Bruhns was at peace telling an interviewer in 2006 that she doesn’t need to travel much anymore. “You can go around the world in about a week just from the people you speak to and the cultural events that go on in this building,” she said. “It’s never boring here.” ___ Online: https://bit.ly/2IA38iJ ___ Information from: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, http://www.post-gazette.com  ","Nationality Rooms director retires, but her voice lives on","Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/nationality-rooms-director-retires-but-her-voice-l/,washington_times
"President Trump isn’t getting tested for the coronavirus after all. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said in a memo released shortly before midnight Friday that the president would not be tested, nor would he self-quarantine, despite having interactions with at least two infected people from the Brazilian delegation last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The president’s interactions with the infected people were “low risk,” Dr. Conley wrote. “The president’s exposure to the first individual was extremely limited (photograph, handshake), and though he spent more time in closer proximity to the second case, all interactions occurred before any symptom onset,” he wrote. “Testing for Covid-19 is not currently indicated.” During a press conference on Friday, Mr. Trump said he “most likely” would be tested for the virus soon.

"Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, indicated his opposition Saturday to the coronavirus relief bill supported by President Trump and approved by the House of Representatives. Mr. Johnson, the chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, voiced concerns about the Families First Coronavirus Response Act being considered on Capitol Hill. In a statement, Mr. Johnson criticized language in the legislation that would require government employers and companies with fewer than 500 people on their payroll to provide paid sick leave to workers who contract COVID-19, the infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. “Although mandating that all employers must pay for sick leave might sound good, we need to consider the unintended consequences of this legislation. I fear that rather than offering a workable solution, the House bill will exacerbate the problem by forcing small businesses to pay wages they cannot afford and ‘helping’ them go further into debt,” said Mr. Johnson. “I hope the Senate will approach this with a level head and pass a bill that does more good than harm — or, if it won’t, pass nothing at all,” he said in the statement. “The president and states already have adequate authority and funding to address the current situation.” The Democratic-led House voted 363-40 early Saturday to pass the coronavirus relief bill, putting it on path to be considered next by the Senate where Republicans maintain a majority. Every House Democrat and most Republicans in the House voted to pass the bill, although Mr. Johnson is hardly the only Wisconsinite to raise objections. Each of the state’s Republican congressmen — U.S. Reps. Mike Gallagher, Glenn Grothman, Jim Sensenbrenner and Bryan Steil — were among the 40 lawmakers who voted against the bill Saturday, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted. President Trump announced his support for the bill Friday, saying on Twitter that he encourages “all Republicans and Democrat to come together and VOTE YES” and that he looks forward to signing the bill as soon as possible. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said during a press conference Saturday that 2,226 domestic cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the U.S. Around 50 people have died after contracting the disease, Mr. Trump said at the press conference.

"Republicans and Democrats linked arms early Saturday morning and pushed a massive coronavirus relief package through the House, calling it a down payment on the kinds of assistance Americans are going to need as the epidemic sweeps the country, The bill now heads to the Senate where GOP leaders said they’ll study it over the weekend, with an eye toward votes next week. House lawmakers brushed aside worries about the price tag and voted on the bill without knowing a cost, saying the virus is an unprecedented threat that must be dealt with no matter what the damage to the budget. The new bill has the government pick up the tab for coronavirus testing, pumps money into food assistance and unemployment programs and pays for sick leave so those who contract COVID-19, or who have to take off to care for someone who did, will be compensated. “Democrats worked tirelessly with the Trump administration and with Republicans in the House and Senate to ensure this is a truly bipartisan bill,” said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer. Mr. Trump also praised the bipartisanship. “Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats,” he said on Twitter. “Bill really pulled together. Nice to see!” House members voted just after midnight on Saturday, capping a few days of feverish negotiations. The House had first been slated to vote Thursday, and then Friday, on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s version of a bill. But she negotiated changes with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and the final result won overwhelming support from both sides, 363-40. Every Democrat who voted backed the bill, while the “No” votes came from conservative Republicans. The chamber’s lone independent voted “present.” More than two dozen lawmakers missed the vote, including several who are in self-quarantine after coming into contact with someone who later tested positive for the virus. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said he expects the bill will have wide support in his chamber, too. But first the Senate must figure out how to get beyond a surveillance bill that’s the pending business on the floor. The emergency virus bill does not include President Trump’s demand for a payroll tax cut, nor other economic stimulus measures. Mrs. Pelosi said they’ll look at stimulus measures in a future bill, which won’t be as rushed as this one. The bill that did pass focuses on addressing needs amid massive public institution closures. A major selling point of the bill was getting food out into communities for children who rely on free meals at schools, which have been shuttered for weeks to try to control virus spread. The bill also suspends work requirements for those who apply for food stamps, and pumps money into state Medicaid programs, so they can handle an influx of patients. All sides agreed the biggest aspect of the bill was promoting testing, so public health officials can get a better sense for the extent of the virus.

"Vice President Mike Pence told White House staffers on Saturday to use “social distancing” and to “avoid physical contact” to protect themselves and their colleagues from the coronavirus. In a staff-wide email, Mr. Pence cited “additional cases throughout the National Capital Region” in urging they take proper precautions. “As an employee aboard the White House Complex, we have an additional duty to protect the health of our Executive Branch and those working with us,” the vice president said. He noted that healthcare experts on the task force he’s leading advise the following steps to reduce transmission and illness: President Trump said Saturday that he has been tested for the coronavirus and is awaiting the results. The president, who also shook hands with several guests at a press conference on Friday, acknowledged it’s a hard habit to break. “It’s sort of a natural reflex, and we’re all getting out of it,” Mr. Trump said. “All of us have that problem. We’re all getting out of that, shaking hands. It’s not a great thing to be doing right now. People are thinking about it more and more, we have to think about it, it’s important.” The White House also has begun taking the temperatures of everyone who could come in close proximity to the president and the vice president. Mr. Pence’s email noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “recommends home-quarantine only for those who have had close (within 6 feet) prolonged (>10 minutes) contact with a symptomatic (cough, fever, etc.) COVID-19 patient, or their respiratory droplets.” “This excludes casual, limited interactions such as handshakes, photographs, etc.,” he wrote. “If you interacted with an individual when they are without symptoms (asymptomatic), but whom subsequently receives a positive test, the risk of you becoming infected from that interaction is considered LOW. You do not require testing, nor home isolation.  Active social distancing would be appropriate.”  ",Pence urges White House staffers to 'avoid physical contact' and use social distancing,"Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/pence-urges-white-house-staffers-avoid-physical-co/,washington_times

"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Misdemeanor, traffic and petty offense cases in federal court have been postponed in the Eastern District of Virginia in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The district also has suspended all non-case related events, tours and other gatherings in courthouses, including naturalization ceremonies. Chief Judge Mark S. Davis said in a special order posted Thursday that there have been confirmed or presumptive cases of coronavirus within the Alexandria, Richmond and Norfolk divisions of the court. He also said there have been reports of people scheduled to appear in court who are under self-quarantine based on possible exposure. The order says the cases will be continued through April 30. New dates will be reset without the need to file any motions. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that the delays caused by the continuances will be excluded from requirements of the Speedy Trial Act. “In exceptional circumstances, any judge in the Court may make a case-specific exception to the District-wide continuance if the parties and counsel agree that there is a valid case-specific reason to proceed with a hearing,” the order says. No changes have been made to civil or criminal felony dockets. The courthouses and clerks’ offices remain open.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez urged young New Yorkers on Saturday to stop crowding into bars and restaurants amid the coronavirus outbreak because they might be spreading the pathogen even if they feel OK. The bartender-turned-congresswoman tweeted about the need for “social distancing” amid evidence people in urban areas, including the popular 14th Street area of D.C., aren’t heeding calls to stay at least six feet away from others to avoid spreading the viral disease, COVID-19. “To everyone in NYC but ESPECIALLY healthy people & people under 40 (bc from what I’m observing that’s who needs to hear this again): PLEASE stop crowding bars, restaurants, and public spaces right now. Eat your meals at home,” the progressive first-term House Democrat wrote. “If you are healthy, you could be spreading COVID.” By “crowded,” she meant any place where you could not stand at least six feet away from another person. Andy Slavitt, the former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama, echoed that advice, saying the tribulations in hard-hit Italy should serve as a warning. “What are mayors, governors & their staffs reporting? That people are jamming the bars,” Mr. Slavitt tweeted. “I get it. Home from work. Cooped up. Crisis mentality. We need to let steam off. Shared experience. But stop that. All the bars & restaurants are closed now across Europe.” As people stay home, however, workers who cannot telework or rely on tips will take a major financial hit. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said Washington needs to step in to provide relief, including a universal basic income. “The need for social distancing from restaurants only underscores the need for relief for tipped workers, freelancers, shift workers, etc.” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote. “Tax credits & unemployment insurance does not help many of these workers — that’s a huge segment of our economy. We need emergency UBI, now.” The coronavirus was discovered in China in December and has sicken more than 150,000 people around the world, while killing over 5,700. The U.S. has recorded nearly 2,500 cases and about 50 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - A group of sheriffs is suing Illinois to halt a 2017 law that bans police from detaining people based on their immigration status without a court-ordered warrant. The lawsuit states that the Illinois Trust Act interferes with law enforcement’s ability to respond to detainers issued by the U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement. The detainers require police to keep custody of prisoners who are in the U.S. illegally for up to two days.  The lawsuit was filed Monday by sheriffs from McHenry, Ogle, Stephenson and Kankakee counties. It names Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul as a defendant.  “This language requires Illinois law enforcement officers to comply with an immigration detainer they receive from those federal officers tasked with carrying out national immigration policy,” the lawsuit states. “Immigration detainers notify law enforcement officials that DHS (the Department of Homeland Security) has found probable cause that the person subject to the request is a removable alien.” The sheriffs said the act has exposed them and their offices to litigation over the years, as three of the four  have been sued for allegedly violating the statute. The Illinois Sheriffs’ Association said last month that some violent felons who had faced deportation are instead being released after their prison terms end as a result of a policy change by Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration. The sheriffs’ concerns came just days after President Donald Trump’s administration announced the unusual step of dispatching Customs and Border Patrol Agents to Chicago and other “sanctuary cities” that have set up impediments to enforcement. The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigrant Justice Center called the lawsuit “a thinly veiled attempt to justify ongoing violations of the law.”  “Under the Trust Act, Illinois simply requires that federal immigration officials provide a judicial warrant, like would be expected for any other arrest, before local law enforcement are permitted to honor an immigration detainer,” the groups said. “Nothing about the Trust Act is unconstitutional. It simply doesn’t comport with the way in which these four sheriffs want to conduct their work. Law enforcement in Illinois cannot pick and choose which laws they follow and which they do not.” The Trust Act, which the General Assembly approved, was  signed into law by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. Critics argued that it turned Illinois into a sanctuary state, which Rauner and other supporters denied.

"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - When New Mexico law enforcement agents carrying Glock pistols and AR-15 rifles enter homes in predawn raids these days, they sometimes find themselves outgunned by the crooks. That’s not the only troubling trend. Violent offenders are getting younger, often recruited by older career criminals who know that under the state or federal laws they face stiffer sentences if caught. And suspects aren’t only wearing bulletproof vests, they are selling them on the streets. Such is the state of violent crime in the Albuquerque metro area and elsewhere in New Mexico as an FBI-led violent crime task force begins its second year on the streets. Over the past 10 months, nearly 100 people have been arrested and 76 firearms confiscated by task force agents who work 16 to 18 hours a day and carry active caseloads of up to 80 each. As proof of its success - and the continuing criminal hold on New Mexico - the special force of FBI agents, New Mexico State Police, Albuquerque Police Department detectives and Bernalillo County Sheriff’s deputies is set to nearly double in size, said FBI violent crimes division supervisor Percy Giles. Eight new task force officers, including one from the state probation/parole office, will join the 11 other members – who include four APD detectives, one from the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department and a total of three positions from State Police. “It’s basically a force multiplier for us, and it’s going to give us additional resources to do the things we need to do at a faster rate,” Giles said. The new boost in federal funding for the effort “is a testament to all the partnerships and the work we’ve been seeing. …” Most of those arrested are prosecuted federally, where conviction rates are “extremely high,” Giles said. FBI Special Agent Bryan Acee, coordinator of the task force, told the Journal his team puts a “priority” on targeting “that dedicated career offender” who has violent crime and/or drug trafficking convictions. Giles added that “in working with our state and local partners, we’re also looking for the individuals who are creating the violent acts on the streets.” Even if they aren’t considered career criminals or don’t have long rap sheets of convictions, they might be targeted “based on intelligence that we’re seeing on the ground.” But the work is getting more dangerous. Over the past year, Acee said, task force members have seen an increase in high capacity magazines for pistols and rifles and the use of AR-15 pistols, which can be concealed. “We’re seeing a lot of the AR-15 pistols, which is essentially an AR-15 rifle (with the butt stock removed), the same rifle the FBI is carrying when they’re entering a house.” He said the team is also coming across an increase in Glock pistols, “there again, by the coincidence, the same gun we carry.” But there’s a difference in the firepower. Agents carry Glocks with magazines that hold 15 rounds. Offenders are now using high capacity 30- and 50-round magazines that can be inserted into Glock pistols. And Acee said the team is starting to see Glock full-automatic selector switches. “So you can have a Glock pistol, with a 50-round magazine, then you can insert a device at the back of the Glock which converts it into a machine gun, or fully automatic. “Simply stated, a regular squad of FBI agents going into a home, we’re carrying that Glock pistol. We’re carrying the AR-15. They have more firepower than we have going into the house.” Giles said the task force is seeing more targets with bulletproof vests. “If we are in a firefight, that basically makes things equal, because we have bulletproof vests, too. That emboldens them to potentially do harm to law enforcement. …” In one recent case, Matthew “Goat” Martinez, a member of the Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico prison gang, was out on the streets selling bulletproof vests. Undercover task force agents bought four of the vests from him before arresting him. Martinez was later convicted of possession of heroin with intent to distribute. Last month, the task force arrested Manuel Bolivar after a predawn raid in Southwest Albuquerque. They found 3 pounds of methamphetamine, almost $16,000 in cash, five pistols and two rifles, 96 blue fentanyl tablets, 155 packaged strips of suboxone and a bulletproof vest, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition. And they recovered a selector switch to allow a Glock 9mm pistol to be fired as a fully automatic firearm. Bolivar is 21 years old. “One of the trends that we’ve been seeing is, and that’s also with the gangs as well as the violent actors, is they’re becoming younger and younger,” Giles said. “The older guys tend to have more of a criminal history, more convictions, and the word is getting out on the techniques that we’re using … the more convictions you have, the higher your criminal points are on the federal side, which means more prison time if convicted. “So they’re sending juveniles to do their dirty work for them.” One task force member, the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department, had this to say about the effort: “Sheriff Manuel Gonzales believes that our partnership with Federal agencies is critical to assist in keeping our community, children, families and businesses safe. The additional staffing complements our previous crime fighting efforts and will also assist in stronger prosecution of the violent offenders.” Giles and Acee said the involvement of state and local agencies is invaluable. Task force members with state or local jurisdiction can often arrest an offender on state charges, while federal agents look at federal crimes that might be filed. Or, Acee said, in the case of an offender who is a felon suspected of committing a homicide with a firearm, “that APD detective on our task force can charge the offender with being a felon in possession of the firearms (in the federal courts) and we can run with that case while the state continues to investigate the homicide.” The result often is getting the offender off the streets. Giles said roughly 60% of the cases investigated by the task force are “proactive.” Offenders targeted typically have a criminal history and are suspected in other violent crimes. For example, Casiano Coronel at age 21 was charged as a habitual offender in state District Court in 2018. Last April, he pleaded no contest to aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer, aggravated DWI, child abuse and receiving or transferring a stolen motor vehicle. State District Judge Daniel Ramczyk of Albuqueque released Coronel on his personal recognizance and referred him to comply with “Youth Adult Court,” pending further resolution. But months later, Coronel became a suspect in a shooting under investigation and the violent crime task force opened a “proactive case” on him. In late June, the task force requested its probation and parole partners put Coronel on GPS monitoring, and he was placed under task force surveillance. Within days, Coronel cut off his ankle monitor and tried to carjack an undercover APD detective, who killed Coronel in a shootout. According to news reports, the detective was conducting surveillance. Giles said the case underscores why the task force is also requesting its own federal prosecutor. “We need to execute things in a swift manner, because these are dangerous individuals we are targeting. They’re dangerous for the community. They’re dangerous for law enforcement, so a swift apprehension is most preferred.”  ",New Mexico authorities eye tactic changes amid violent crime,"Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/new-mexico-authorities-eye-tactic-changes-amid-vio/,washington_times
"MOSCOW (AP) - Police in the Russian capital have detained dozens of people at a protest against political repression outside the headquarters of the Federal Security Service. The OVD-Info group that monitors arrests at demonstrations in Russia said 49 people were detained on Saturday. It was not immediately clear what charges would be filed. The detentions came as people stood in line to take part in a single picket protest. Russian law allows lone picketers without prior permission. Rotating single pickets, in which each person stands for a short period before giving way to the next, is a frequent strategy. The security service is the main successor to the Soviet KGB and its headquarters building on Lubyanka Square has strong symbolic resonance.

"IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - Amid growing concern about the expensive incentives promised to Amazon to land its new headquarters, Kentucky lawmakers considered a bill to shield its largest city’s failed pitch from public scrutiny. To open government advocates, the effort to hide Louisville’s bid was an outrage that soon got worse: A House committee approved the bill with an amendment barring residents outside Kentucky from obtaining public records on any subject. Labeled a “wrecking ball” to the public records law, the bill stalled last March amid opposition. But opponents are anxiously waiting to learn whether a similar measure will be introduced again. “I fear that something’s going to drop and it’s not going to be good,” said Amye Besenhaver of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition. Advocates like her in all 50 states are getting a new tool to help identify legislation like the Amazon bill that affect the public’s right to know - and give a glimpse of what’s happening across the country. The National Freedom of Information Coalition is launching a bill tracker that aims to find, in real-time, all pieces of legislation that affect government transparency in state legislatures. On its website, the coalition is releasing dashboards of pending or recent legislation in all states for Sunshine Week, an annual celebration of open government that runs from March 15-21. One goal is to alert the public quickly so advocates can try to stop anti-transparency bills from becoming law or from spreading to other states. Another is to allow journalists and researchers to spot trends, ranging from efforts to expunge more court cases from the public record to preventing out-of-state residents from seeking documents. In Kentucky’s case, the tool could have helped flag the Amazon secrecy bill as well as legislation in states like Tennessee and Kansas to require more, not less, transparency around economic development incentives. Daniel Bevarly, the coalition’s executive director, said tracking such bills is challenging because only a few states, such as Florida and Maine, require such legislation to state up-front that they would affect government transparency. The number of reporters covering statehouses also has dropped significantly in recent years, meaning there are fewer eyes watching legislative action. Anti-transparency provisions are often buried deep in legislation, some of which may be about unrelated topics, Bevarly said. The new program could act as an early alarm system that blocks poorly written bills from becoming laws. “Hopefully when we are tracking this, lawmakers will have a better idea that they are under close scrutiny by the public,” said Bevarly, whose group has state and regional affiliates representing 37 states. The program uses software from Quorum, a Washington D.C.-based technology company, that scrapes the raw text of bills from all 50 state legislative websites once or more a day. That information goes into a database where key search terms can be used to identify a bill’s potential relevance to a group or an industry. Quorum has previously launched bill-tracking efforts for groups such as the Sierra Club, which has credited the program with helping mobilize its response to legislation that would ban protests around critical infrastructures such as pipelines. The National Freedom of Information Coalition conducted a pilot program with Quorum on all 142,000 state bills introduced in 2019. It found that 13.6 percent of those, or more than 19,000, contained transparency-related search terms that the coalition wanted to track, including phrases such as “public record,” “open meeting” and “body camera.” In a report on the pilot program in January, the coalition said that volume of bills was “too great” and turned up some that were extraneous. The coalition said the tracker would be more successful in the future as its members refine search terms and tailor them to each state. Eventually, the program could use machine learning to further inform its tracking and output. Quorum co-founder and CEO Alex Wirth noted that most, but not all, of the coalition’s state affiliates tracked legislation and their methods for doing so varied greatly. He said his company is helping centralize that information “so that every state can be alerted when there is a piece of legislation.” “That is the big value and the breakthrough, and the next step on that journey will be making that available to all of their coalition members and the general public,” he said. Coalition outreach manager Kelsey Ryan, who helped investigate secrecy in Kansas government  when she was with the Kansas City Star, said the dashboard isn’t perfect yet but will allow for a “more analytical and thorough method for finding transparency-related bills.” “This is particularly true for states like my home state of Kansas, where legislators have a history of doing ‘gut-and-go’ bills - passing bills before the public ever has a chance to find out what the bill is about,” she said in an email. Besenhaver, the Kentucky advocate, said she tracks legislation “the old-fashioned way” by reviewing the text of proposed bills. But she said her approach is not exhaustive and it takes good luck not to miss any potentially important provisions. The Kentucky bill was introduced in February 2019 amid a pending lawsuit filed by the Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper seeking records about the city’s unsuccessful bid for Amazon’s “HQ2” project. The bill would have shielded all records related to “proposed economic development incentives not accepted” by businesses. Dozens of cities and states offered Amazon tax breaks and other incentives worth hundreds of millions of dollars or more for the project, which ultimately went to Arlington, Virginia. Amazon abandoned its plan to build a second location in New York City after opposition from residents and politicians. Some government agencies that did not land the project have sought to keep their bids secret, with varying degrees of success. In August, the Kentucky Court of Appeals ordered the Louisville Metro Government to release its records to the newspaper, but the ruling remains on appeal. “It’s pretty clear they were going to make some extreme concessions to try to bring Amazon in,” Besenhaver said. “The public needs to know that.”  ",Legislative tracker sounds alarm on anti-transparency bills,"Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/legislative-tracker-sounds-alarm-on-anti-transpare/,washington_times

Any journalist, news organization or First Amendment group will be able to search and download the information for research purposes or to create their own, more detailed tracking system.

"WASHINGTON — As the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates return to the debate stage, their party, the stakes, and the world look much different than in their last meeting less than three weeks ago. The fast-moving coronavirus was something of an afterthought in that debate; now the escalating crisis is likely to dominate Sunday’s contest. Rising infections in the United States and around the world have prompted a dramatic slowdown of global travel, upended financial markets, and raised questions about President Donald Trump’s ability to lead the nation through a prolonged period of uncertainty. Just two Democrats - former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - remain to make the case that they are best-positioned to challenge Trump in November. Five other candidates who joined them on stage in the Feb. 25 debate in South Carolina have dropped out, with many rallying behind Biden’s surging candidacy. For both Biden and Sanders, the debate is a moment to display their leadership skills in front of what could be one of the largest audiences of the primary. They’ll aim to draw a contrast with Trump, but also with each other, arguing that they have the right experience, temperament and policy prescriptions to lead the nation through a crisis. “Moments like these don’t come around often in campaigns and this is a perfect opportunity to show millions that you have what it takes,” said Robert Gibbs, former White House press secretary and campaign adviser to President Barack Obama. “They must show voters they are the answer to what is missing right now by being calm, honest, ready to lead and empathetic.” The coronavirus crisis rapidly upended plans for Sunday’s debate. First, the Democratic National Committee announced that it would hold the contest without a live audience. Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel. One of the moderators had to withdraw because of potential exposure to a person who tested positive for coronavirus. It is Biden who will step on stage as the front-runner, a distinction that seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago. After disappointing showings in the early contests, Biden roared back with a commanding victory in South Carolina and has continued to rack up wins across the country, winning broad and diverse coalitions of voters. Moderate Democratic leaders, including former rivals Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, have rallied behind his candidacy and voters have done the same. Advisers say Biden will aim in Sunday’s debate to show voters who backed Sanders or other liberal candidates that they have a home in his campaign. In one overture to liberals, Biden announced his support for a bankruptcy plan championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who ended her campaign earlier this month and has yet to endorse. In a virtual town hall on Friday, Biden said his support for Warren’s proposal, which aims to simplify the bankruptcy process, is “one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on.” Biden holds a solid lead over Sanders in the all-important delegate race, and a strong showing in Tuesday’s primary contests could effectively guarantee his nomination. Four big states will be up for grabs: Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and Florida, a perennial general election battleground where Biden appears to have an edge over Sanders. After a strong start, the race has moved rapidly away from Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist with a loyal following among young voters and liberals. But he’s failed to expand his appeal, particularly among black voters, and his calls for a sweeping political and economic revolution have also fallen flat with suburban voters. Sanders is facing some pressure from within the Democratic Party to step aside and allow Biden take Trump on one-on-one. Several Democratic groups that were waiting to endorse until after the primary have consolidated around Biden, including super PAC Priorities USA. Sanders’ advisers say he is a realist about his current standing and the difficulty of the path ahead. Yet the senator is pledging to grill Biden in Sunday’s debate on his plans for tackling college debt, for his past support of the Iraq war and for his backing of multilateral trade agreements. “I’m going to ask Joe Biden, I mean Joe is part of the establishment for a very long time, ‘Joe, what role have you played in trying to make sure that we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?” Sanders said Saturday during an online “fireside chat” with supporters. Yet it’s unclear if the issues Sanders is aiming to highlight will resonate with voters at a time when much of the nation’s focus has shifted to the growing toll of the coronavirus and put a spotlight on the need for presidential leadership. Schools and businesses across the country are closed, and many hospitals and clinics are struggling to obtain tests for the coronavirus. For Biden, the outbreak of a global pandemic has been a moment to bolster the central argument of his candidacy: that his eight years as vice president give him the experience, as well as the relationships in Washington and around the world, that are needed in the Oval Office during turbulent times. With campaign rallies halted because of warnings against large gatherings, Biden delivered a speech in front of reporters and advisers on his proposal for combating coronavirus, including guaranteeing free testing. Sanders’ later announced his own speech, which focused largely on advocating for his call to overhaul the nation’s health insurance system and replace it with a Medicare for All program. After Sunday’s debate, it’s unclear where the candidates and the campaign go from here. Neither Biden or Sanders has announced any public rallies for next week or given any indication of when they may be able to appear in person for voters again. ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC  ","Coronavirus crisis presents 'perfect opportunity' for Biden, Bernie"," -

"JERUSALEM (AP) - A Jerusalem district court announced on Sunday that it was postponing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s criminal trial for two months because of restrictions arising from the outbreak of the coronavirus. Netanyahu was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday to face charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in connection to a series of scandals. But following the emergency health measures the government enacted restricting the gathering of people in public places, the court announced that it was pushing back the hearing until May 24. Netanyahu is accused of receiving expensive gifts from wealthy friends and offering to exchange favors with powerful media moguls. The long-ruling Israeli leader denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a media-orchestrated witch hunt. Netanyahu’s lawyers had previously appealed for a delay, saying they needed more time to review evidence. But it was swiftly rejected on ground that the March 17 hearing was a procedural reading of the charges only and the defendant’s response was not needed. But after Netanyahu announced a new series of coronavirus-related restriction late Saturday, including the barring of gathering more than 10 people, the justice ministry announced a state of emergency in the courts as well. The virus has spread to more than 100 countries and infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,700. In Israel, some 200 people have been infected with no casualties yet, as severe measures seem to have proven effective thus far. Netanyahu’s legal troubles stood at the center of Israel’s third national election in less than a year. Like elections last April and September, the March 2 vote also ended inconclusively. Netanyahu’s opponent, Benny Gantz, refuses to sit with him in government and has been looking to push for legislation in the incoming parliament that would bar anyone indicted for a crime being able to lead a government - in effect disqualifying Netanyahu from leading the country. But the coronavirus crisis has raised calls for an emergency unity government instead.

"MADRID — Spain’s government said Saturday that the wife of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has tested positive for the new coronavirus. It said Begoña Gómez and the prime minister are in good health and following the instructions of medical authorities at their residence in La Moncloa Palace in Madrid, the government seat. Two ministers of Sánchez’s Cabinet, the minister of equality and the minister of regional affairs, had already tested positive earlier this week. The government said both are in good health as well. The others member of the Cabinet have tested negative. The government informed the media of Gómez’s infection shortly after Sánchez gave a nationally televised address to announce a battery of measures his government will take to combat the pandemic during a two-week state of emergency. Prior to the address, Sánchez presided at a seven-hour Cabinet meeting that was attended by all the ministers except for the two who had tested positive. Health authorities said Saturday that coronavirus infections have reached 5,753 people in Spain, half of them in Madrid, since the first case was detected in late January.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Saturday he had the power to fire or demote Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, adding new fuel to his long-running animus toward the central bank’s leader at a moment when the economy was at risk of edging into recession. Trump told reporters that he wasn’t considering firing Powell, but reiterated his frustration with the chairman. The comments were particularly striking because they came as the coronavirus pandemic shook the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst week since October 2008. In just a few weeks, U.S. stocks have lost all the gains made during 2019. “I have the right to do that or the right to remove him as chairman,” Trump said Saturday at a news conference called to provide an update on the administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. “He has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.” No Fed chairman has ever been removed by a president. The law creating the Fed says its officials and those of other independent agencies can be “removed for cause” by a president. While that issue has never arisen in regard to a Fed official, the courts ruled decades ago that “for cause” meant more than a policy disagreement. Powell announced earlier this month a half-point interest rate cut that shrank the Fed’s key rate to a range of just 1% to 1.25%. It marked the first time the central bank has cut rates between scheduled policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis. And it’s the steepest rate cut the Fed has made since then. Yet, the president continued to complain that he was “not happy with the Fed” because it was “following” and “we should be leading.” The president pointed to lower interest rates set by the central banks in Japan and Germany as proof that Powell had not been aggressive enough in bolstering the U.S. economy. Economists, however, say the lower rates reflect the weaker economic outlooks than the U.S. economy. Trump said he’s made no decision, but suggested he could simply remove him as chairman. Powell’s four-year term ends in February 2022, and his term as a member of the Board of Governors expires January 2028. “I have the right to also take him and put him in a regular position and put somebody else in charge. And I haven’t made any decisions on that,” the president said.  ",Trump threatens Fed chairman as coronavirus roils markets," -

"NEW YORK — As schools across the U.S. shut down in hopes of helping to fight the coronavirus, New York City officials are arguing just the opposite: They’re keeping the nation’s largest school system open to ensure that health and emergency workers aren’t tied down with kids at home. But teachers, many parents and some health experts say the city is making a grave mistake by continuing to call more than 1.1 million children to public schools even as it calls for “social distancing” elsewhere to stem the virus’ spread. While many families elsewhere in the country spent Saturday making hasty plans for an unexpected school shutdown, New Yorkers debated the city’s decision. “You’re not going to have a functioning health care system if the folks in the medical field, the doctors, the nurses, the techs, everyone has to stay home with their kids,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on MSNBC. Parent Anna Gold didn’t see it his way. “It would be a hardship if they closed the schools, but I think it’s a necessary one we need to take in the space of this emergency,” said Anna Gold, who pulled her third-grader and kindergartner out of public schools in Brooklyn on Friday and plans to keep them home next week. Another parent, Dori Kleinman, said she wishes the mayor would allow individual schools to make a decision about whether to close. “I don’t want my children at risk,” she said. New York City became a big outlier as other major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Boston, and several states decided to shutter schools for a week or more. New York health care workers’ unions said the city shouldn’t close schools without a plan to care for the children of those staffing hospital wards. The unions and city officials fear that even New York’s massive health care system could be quickly overwhelmed by a surge in serious cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “If it’s apparent it’s the safe thing, then it must be done, but it’s going to have a big impact on nurses,” said Eileen Toback, executive director of the New York Professional Nurses Union, which represents nurses at Manhattan’s Lenox Hill Hospital. “They’re on the front lines. They need to be here in shifts. They’re single mothers or single fathers sometimes, so they don’t have many backups, and the hospital is 24/7.” In a column in The New York Times, three teaches from Stuyvesant High pressured de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo to close the schools, and develop a plan to feed students that depend on school meals. The teachers describe a lengthy journey for some to and from school that puts students, their relatives and educators at risk. “No amount of hand washing and extra cleaning can prevent our thousands of students and hundreds of faculty and staff members from transmitting germs as they move in and out of classrooms for 10 periods a day,” Samantha Daves, Maura Dwyer and Annie Thoms wrote. De Blasio, a Democrat, has not ruled out closing schools eventually and said city officials would continue a day-by-day examination. But he has noted that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that while there can be reasons to shut schools, it’s not clear that closures will make more difference than other measures, such as hand-washing and isolating the sick. But Dr. Dena Grayson, a researcher and infectious disease expert who works in the private sector, called de Blasio’s decision so far to keep schools open “incredibly foolish.” “The virus will spread like wildfire among the children. They get infected, and they can spread that virus easily to older people who are at a much higher risk,” she said. The city has confirmed coronavirus cases in at least two public school students and at least one teacher. Their schools have been closed for cleaning but are expected to reopen. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover, but the outbreak has caused more than 5,000 deaths worldwide. Teachers’ unions are pressing de Blasio to close the schools, saying they’re worried for their students’ families, their own and New Yorkers at large. “To have 1.1 million students and countless employees crisscrossing the city, it feels to me beyond irresponsible,” says Derek Stampone, who teaches physics and computer science at a Manhattan high school where only about 2/3 of students showed up Friday, a dropoff echoed in the system as a whole. Stampone found himself spending much of Friday’s classes talking about the virus and such prevention tips as hand-washing. “I can see the anxiety in the room,” he said. So did social studies teacher Elise Ritter, who works at a different Manhattan high school that happens to focus on emergency management. The students who did attend, she said, were “really looking around and saying, ‘Why are we still here?’” Many live with grandparents and worry about them contracting the virus, she said. Teachers suggest the city could find ways to provide child care for health care workers - and supply food to the hundreds of thousands of poor students who depend on school meals - without keeping the entire school system open. De Blasio has said that any alternative would recreate the problem that closing schools would seek to solve: People congregating. Cuomo, a Democrat, said school closings remain “purely a local decision” unless a student tests positive, in which case a school must be closed for cleaning. “The closing of schools is a significant trade-off of benefits and burdens,” he said Saturday in a conference call with reporters. “If you close the schools, there are people who will not show up for work the next day. The public education system is also a day care, in many ways.” __ Associated Press reporters Adam Geller and Vanessa Alvarez contributed to this report.

Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel. One of the moderators had to withdraw because of potential exposure to a person who tested positive for coronavirus. It is Biden who will step on stage as the front-runner, a distinction that seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago. After disappointing showings in the early contests, Biden roared back with a commanding victory in South Carolina and has continued to rack up wins across the country, winning broad and diverse coalitions of voters. Moderate Democratic leaders, including former rivals Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, have rallied behind his candidacy and voters have done the same. Advisers say Biden will aim in Sunday’s debate to show voters who backed Sanders or other liberal candidates that they have a home in his campaign. In one overture to liberals, Biden announced his support for a bankruptcy plan championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who ended her campaign earlier this month and has yet to endorse. In a virtual town hall on Friday, Biden said his support for Warren’s proposal, which aims to simplify the bankruptcy process, is “one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on.” Biden holds a solid lead over Sanders in the all-important delegate race, and a strong showing in Tuesday’s primary contests could effectively guarantee his nomination. Four big states will be up for grabs: Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and Florida, a perennial general election battleground where Biden appears to have an edge over Sanders. After a strong start, the race has moved rapidly away from Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist with a loyal following among young voters and liberals. But he’s failed to expand his appeal, particularly among black voters, and his calls for a sweeping political and economic revolution have also fallen flat with suburban voters. Sanders is facing some pressure from within the Democratic Party to step aside and allow Biden take Trump on one-on-one. Several Democratic groups that were waiting to endorse until after the primary have consolidated around Biden, including super PAC Priorities USA. Sanders‘ advisers say he is a realist about his current standing and the difficulty of the path ahead. Yet the senator is pledging to grill Biden in Sunday’s debate on his plans for tackling college debt, for his past support of the Iraq war and for his backing of multilateral trade agreements. “I’m going to ask Joe Biden, I mean Joe is part of the establishment for a very long time, ‘Joe, what role have you played in trying to make sure that we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?” Sanders said Saturday during an online “fireside chat” with supporters. Yet it’s unclear if the issues Sanders is aiming to highlight will resonate with voters at a time when much of the nation’s focus has shifted to the growing toll of the coronavirus and put a spotlight on the need for presidential leadership. Schools and businesses across the country are closed, and many hospitals and clinics are struggling to obtain tests for the coronavirus. For Biden, the outbreak of a global pandemic has been a moment to bolster the central argument of his candidacy: that his eight years as vice president give him the experience, as well as the relationships in Washington and around the world, that are needed in the Oval Office during turbulent times. With campaign rallies halted because of warnings against large gatherings, Biden delivered a speech in front of reporters and advisers on his proposal for combating coronavirus, including guaranteeing free testing. Sanders‘ later announced his own speech, which focused largely on advocating for his call to overhaul the nation’s health insurance system and replace it with a Medicare for All program. After Sunday’s debate, it’s unclear where the candidates and the campaign go from here. Neither Biden or Sanders has announced any public rallies for next week or given any indication of when they may be able to appear in person for voters again. ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC  ","Coronavirus crisis presents 'perfect opportunity' for Biden, Bernie","Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/democratic-debate-coronavirus-crisis-presents-perf/,washington_times
"JERUSALEM (AP) - A Jerusalem district court announced on Sunday that it was postponing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s criminal trial for two months because of restrictions arising from the outbreak of the coronavirus. Netanyahu was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday to face charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in connection to a series of scandals. But following the emergency health measures the government enacted restricting the gathering of people in public places, the court announced that it was pushing back the hearing until May 24. Netanyahu is accused of receiving expensive gifts from wealthy friends and offering to exchange favors with powerful media moguls. The long-ruling Israeli leader denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a media-orchestrated witch hunt. Netanyahu’s lawyers had previously appealed for a delay, saying they needed more time to review evidence. But it was swiftly rejected on the grounds that the March 17 hearing was a procedural reading of the charges only and that the defendant’s response was not needed. But after Netanyahu announced a new series of coronavirus-related restrictions late Saturday, including the barring of gatherings of more than 10 people, the justice ministry announced a state of emergency in the courts as well. Much of the country ground to a standstill Sunday, with schools, malls and places of entertainment shut down. Employees were encouraged to work from home and strict restrictions have been placed on personal interactions. The virus has spread to more than 100 countries, infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,700. In Israel, some 200 people have been infected with no casualties yet, as severe measures seem to have proven effective so far. Netanyahu’s legal troubles stood at the center of Israel’s recent parliamentary election, the third such vote in less than a year. As previous elections last April and September, the March 2 vote also ended inconclusively. Netanyahu’s opponent, Benny Gantz, refuses to sit with him in the government and has been looking to push for legislation in the incoming parliament that would bar anyone indicted for a crime from leading a government - in effect disqualifying Netanyahu from remaining prime minister. But the coronavirus crisis has raised calls for an emergency unity government instead. Netanyahu formally extended an offer Sunday to Gantz to join a government aimed at at halting the spread of the virus, suggesting two frameworks, including one that would see an alternating leadership between them over the course of four years. “The state of Israel needs it. The people of Israel expect it,” Netanyahu said. But Gantz’s centrist Blue and White party seems to consider the outreach yet another ruse after what has been an extremely acrimonious campaign that included unfounded smears against Gantz. “Netanyahu, let’s not manipulate the public. If you’re interested in unity, why postpone your trial at 1 a.m. and send an ‘emergency unity’ outline to the press, rather than sending your negotiating team to a meeting,” Gantz responded on Twitter. “As opposed to you, I will continue to support every appropriate governmental measure, leaving political considerations aside. When you get serious, we can talk.” His fellow party leader and former military chief Moshe Yaalon was even more blunt, comparing Netanyahu’s conduct to that of Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “Whoever criticized us for warning against Israel turning into Erdogan’s Turkey should internalize the cynical exploitation of the corona crisis for the political needs of a man standing before trial,” he said. The anti-Netanyahu forces in the new incoming parliament command a 62-58 majority but are deeply divided among themselves, and appear unlikely to unite to form an alternative government. Against the backdrop of the public health scare, Israel’s president began a series of consultations Sunday with all the elected parties to determine who to tap as prime minister-designate. It typically goes to the leader of the largest party, which in this case would be Netanyahu, but could also go to Gantz if he secures more recommendations from lawmakers.  Given the circumstances, President Reuven Rivlin has implored for a power-sharing unity deal. “Anyone who has watched the news in recent days understands that this is a time of trial, and that these are not regular consultations,” he said. “We must now deal with forming a government as soon as possible … at this complex time.” If the deadlock continues, Israel could see itself heading toward a fourth straight election, which experts say would have disastrous effects on the public’s confidence in their elected officials and electoral system - regardless of the corona crisis.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Sunday that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are already in talks for a third coronavirus bill. On ABC’s “This Week,” Mr. Mnuchin explained that this latest package will be a stimulus bill targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as specific industries that have been hit hard by the virus, including the airline and cruise industries. “We will use whatever tools we have and whatever tools we don’t have we will go to Congress on a bipartisan basis and get more tools,” he said. “We’re in the second inning of nine innings.” Just after midnight on Saturday, the House passed a massive relief package to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers. It mandated free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone that does. The bill also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and school kids. It also bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. “This bill was very important in getting workers money in their pockets, people that have to be home,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The bill passed without lawmakers knowing exactly how much it will cost. This came after Congress passed an $8.3 billion bill to get more resources to state and local health officials. Mr. Mnuchin said he would also ask Congress to help the Federal Reserve have more resources to help the economy weather the virus. However, he would not comment on President Trump’s frustration with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. On Saturday, the president told reporters he had the power to fire or demote Mr. Powell, reiterating his frustrations at what he sees as a slow response. The Fed recently cut rates, now at historic lows, and offered $1.5 trillion in loans to banks. “I’m not going to make comments on that. It would be inappropriate for me as Treasury secretary,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The markets plummeted last week, but recovered somewhat on Saturday, which Mr. Mnuchin credits to the president’s national address Friday and the bipartisan bill.

"Dr. Antony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, urged Americans to shut down more aggressively as the coronavirus spreads. On MSNBC’s “Meet the Press” Mr. Fauci endorsed a 14-day “national shutdown” to help slow down the virus. He explained that he has brought it up with the administration, which is generally open to his ideas. “I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,” he said. On ABC’s “This Week” the doctor explained that lockdowns helped China and South Korea fight the rapid spread of the disease in their countries. China, he said, has reached its peak and is starting to see number of cases drop, whereas South Korea has flatlined. However, he warned that while its hard to predict exactly how long the virus will be a threat, the U.S. should prepare for this to last for several weeks or a few months. “What we should be doing is absolutely much much different. Not business as usual. Just chill down,” he said on ABC. Across the nation, public schools and events are being shut down as states and local officials try to contain the virus.

"VIENNA, Va. (AP) - Everything was in place: the silver kiddush cup beside the rolled-up Torah. The ceremonial candle, brushing braided challah. Twin boxes of Streit’s matzot, unopened. But this wasn’t a hushed synagogue readying for the holidays. It was a Northern Virginia high school - loud, growing louder as class let out one Tuesday last month. Jacob Book, 16, adjusted his kippah and stepped forward to face two dozen students, none of whom he knew, at James Madison High School, which he does not attend. He pointed to three friends standing beside him, behind the table with the challah. “We are here to talk about our lives as Jewish teens,” Book said, “to you.” He cleared his throat. “Other teens.” The afternoon in Vienna, Va., marked the 25th time this school year that Jewish students walked into Washington-area classrooms, gymnasiums or auditoriums - during or after class - to spend an hour explaining their faith to non-Jewish peers. The visits take place through Student to Student, an adaptation of a decades-old Missouri program that the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of Greater Washington brought to the District last school year in a bid to combat a massive spike in anti-Semitic bullying. Washington-area schools have suffered a spate of swastika-filled graffiti in recent months - and incidents of anti-Semitic harassment in K-12 schools nationwide quadrupled between 2015 and 2017, according to a study conducted by the Anti-Defamation League. At the same time, some express concern that awareness of the Holocaust may be diminishing. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that Americans 65 and older displayed slightly greater knowledge of the genocide than did younger generations. “We’re seeing a literal epidemic of anti-Semitism,” said Ron Halber, executive director of JCRC. “It has to be fought.” Trump’s executive order on campus anti-Semitism draws praise, concern During trips, Jewish high school students - belonging to Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist traditions - discuss topics such as how they celebrate Shabbat, which Jewish holiday is most important (“It’s not Hanukkah,” Book said to surprise) and the Holocaust. Then, they take questions from the adolescent audience, some of whom, said program director Sara Winkelman, have never met a Jewish person. “It’s like Judaism 101,” Winkelman said. “But from your peers - and that humanizes it.” The need to “humanize Judaism,” Halber said, also spurred JCRC to begin pushing for a law to improve Holocaust education in Virginia about the same time it introduced Student to Student. JCRC’s legislative lobbying found success last month when the Virginia General Assembly passed a bill that forms a committee to revise how the state teaches students about the Holocaust, genocide and slavery. The legislation awaits the signature of Gov. Ralph Northam (D), whose spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky declined to say whether he plans to sign it. Yarmosky promised the governor will “carefully review” the legislation and said Northam “is committed to ensuring a safe, tolerant and inclusive school environment.” Schools throughout the nation are struggling to handle the outbreak of anti-Semitic harassment, experts said, and to ensure students graduate with a solid grasp of the Holocaust. In many places, Jewish groups are stepping in to help, said Barbara S. Burstin, a University of Pittsburgh lecturer who teaches on the Holocaust and the American Jewish experience. Often, that assistance has involved lobbying for bills similar to the one just passed in Virginia, Burstin said. Twelve states require Holocaust education by law - a number that jumped over the past few years, Burstin said, largely attributable to the efforts of Jewish organizations and Holocaust centers. School officials in Maryland strengthen requirements for Holocaust education Virginia is one of the 12, though Halber says its required lessons - listed in a state Education Department handout that says students should know the Holocaust is “prejudice . . . taken to the extreme” - lack gravity and detail. Education Department spokesman Charles Pyle noted “the department supports” the JCRC-backed bill, meant to make the state’s offerings more comprehensive. “This push for Holocaust education has been ongoing - but getting students to talk to students?” Burstin said. “Huh. Wow! I’ve never heard of anything like that before.” Inside James Madison High, Sam Nunez, 17, listened with arms folded across his Virginia Tech sweatshirt as the four presenters shifted the conversation to food. After sharing their favorites (matzoh ball soup was on three of four lists), the teens summarized Jewish dietary rules and rituals. Rachel Friedman, 16, raised a blue plastic pack of Oreos: These, she said, are kosher, meaning the cookies were prepared in accordance with Jewish culinary precepts. Those rules stipulate that Jews cannot eat pork or mix dairy products and meat, Friedman said. “Also, no shellfish,” she said. “So no shrimp and no lobster.” Nunez, increasingly agitated, could hold back no longer. “Ever?” he interrupted, uncrossing his arms, and most of the room giggled. Afterward, Nunez said the presentation taught him “new things about Judaism.” He knows some Jewish students at school, he said, but would never have thought to ask about their religion. This is the power of Student to Student, said Rori Picker Neiss, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of St. Louis, which originated the program. The St. Louis JCRC, inspired by an initiative that brought Israeli Jewish teenagers to talk to their American counterparts, launched Student to Student with six presenters in 1992. Popular from the start, it grew rapidly: Today, the Missouri program involves roughly 120 Jewish teens and reaches 4,000 non-Jewish teens each year, Picker Neiss said. It has also proved effective at fighting hatred - in yearly surveys conducted by the St. Louis JCRC, teachers reported that, after a Student to Student visit, their classrooms saw reductions in anti-Semitic bullying. Still, no one thought of extending the program beyond St. Louis, Picker Neiss said, until the recent national surge in anti-Semitism. Fueled by anxiety - and two grants totaling $30,000 from a Jewish nonprofit - her organization collaborated with Jewish groups and schools to launch Student to Student in Chicago, Indianapolis, Des Moines and the D.C. area. The ambition, Picker Neiss said, is to spread Student to Student to all 50 states. “An adult comes, and teens’ eyes glaze over,” she said. “But when they can interact with one another, they just perk up right away.” The program falls within a long tradition of “what you might call Jewish-American public relations campaigns,” said Hasia R. Diner, a professor at New York University who studies American Jewish history. The campaigns, often waged by faith leaders or activist groups in response to upswells in anti-Semitism, sent Jewish adults into libraries or churches to explain their religion to non-Jews. One came in the 1920s, amid heightened activity of the Ku Klux Klan, Diner said, another during Adolf Hitler’s ascent to power in the 1930s, still another during the 1950s. In the 1980s, Holocaust survivors began traveling the country to share their experiences in concentration camps - although that effort is ending, as survivors die or grow too old to continue. There is “no real sense” of the efficacy of these initiatives, Diner said. Today’s landscape of anti-Semitic harassment, she noted, may suggest they were in vain. “But I’m glad to know of Student to Student,” she said. “Teaching people how wrong their prejudices are, catching them young, with the young . . . maybe that works.” The stint at James Madison was Book’s third time participating in a Student to Student presentation. He often wonders, afterward, how his words affected fellow high school students. Most seem curious, Book said, eager to learn. One response he will never forget. At a presentation last month, Book began by telling the audience that he is Orthodox and attends a private, all-Jewish school in Rockville, Md. He joined Student to Student, he said, because he believes hatred will subside if Jews and non-Jews get to know each other. Near the hour’s end, a student raised her hand. “She asked me, why do I go to a Jewish school if I’m so interested in teaching about Judaism?” Book said. “Why am I keeping myself in the bubble?” Book did not know what to say. The silence stretched, so he blurted that it’s nice to be around people who “share the same morals” - but that, Book felt, was not quite right. He has thought more, since. He still doesn’t know the answer.

"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Turkish and Russian troops began joint patrols Sunday on a key highway in northwestern Syria, Turkey’s Defense Ministry said, while both the Russian government and Syrian opposition activists said the patrols were shortened because of protests.  Patrols on the highway known as the M4, which runs east-west through Idlib province, are part of a cease-fire agreement between Turkey and Russia signed earlier this month. The cease-fire ended an escalation in fighting that saw the Turkish military in rare direct conflict with Syrian government troops. The vital highway, which runs through northern Syria from the Mediterranean to the Iraqi border, has been partially closed since 2012. Work has been underway over the past days to refurbish it for traffic. Some sections of the M4 remain under rebel control, unlike the  north-south M5 highway, which Syrian forces completely recaptured in the latest offensive. For the past three days, residents along rebel-held parts of the M4 have protested in rejection of Russian troops patrolling the road because of Moscow’s strong support to Syrian government forces.  “The first Turkish-Russian united land patrol was carried out on the M4 highway in Idlib with the involvement of land and air elements,” Turkey’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Turkey and Russia carried out their first joint patrol mission along the M4 highway Sunday adding that “the patrols’ route was shortened” after militants used women and children to block the way. The Defense Ministry’s statement was carried by state-run news agency Tass. Ankara has been given additional time to ensure the safety of troops taking part in joint patrols, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Syrian opposition activists said residents blocked the highway with burning tires near the village of Nairab on the southern edge of Idlib in rejection to patrols by “Russian occupation forces.” The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor with activists on the ground in Syria, said the joint patrols were not successful as they moved a short distance west of the government held town of Saraqeb before being stopped by the protests.  It added that jihadi groups have threatened to attack Russian forces on the highway. Idlib is mostly controlled by al-Qaida-linked militants.  Ankara backs some of the opposition groups in Idlib, the fighters’ final stronghold against the Russian-backed forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Some 60 Turkish soldiers have been killed in Idlib since the start of February as Syrian troops carried out a ground and air offensive into the province that began in early December. The assault killed hundreds of civilians and sent 1 million fleeing towards the Turkish border. Russian officials visited Ankara last week to hammer out the cease-fire. After four days of talks, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkey hoped the deal would prove to be permanent. Turkey and Russia already conduct joint military patrols elsewhere in Syria. Following an agreement that halted Turkey’s attack on Kurdish forces in October, soldiers from the two countries monitor an area of northeast Syria along the Turkish border.

"With many houses of worship shuttered around the country, President Trump proclaimed Sunday a national day of prayer for all Americans affected by the coronavirus pandemic and for the national response efforts. He said Americans must remember that “no problem is too big for God to handle.” Mr. Trump urged people “of all faiths and religious traditions and backgrounds to offer prayers for all those affected, including people who have suffered harm or lost loved ones.” “As we continue to face the unique challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, millions of Americans are unable to gather in their churches, temples, synagogues, mosques, and other houses of worship,” the president said in a proclamation. “But in this time we must not cease asking God for added wisdom, comfort, and strength, and we must especially pray for those who have suffered harm or who have lost loved ones.” He said, “In our times of greatest need, Americans have always turned to prayer to help guide us through trials and periods of uncertainty.  I ask you to join me in a day of prayer for all people who have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and to pray for God’s healing hand to be placed on the people of our nation.” “We should all take to heart the holy words found in 1 Peter 5:7:  ‘Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you,’” the president’s proclamation said. “Let us pray that all those affected by the virus will feel the presence of our Lord’s protection and love during this time.  With God’s help, we will overcome this threat.” Mr. Trump declared a national emergency on Friday, freeing up about $50 billion in federal aid to combat the virus in states and localities. “I now encourage all Americans to pray for those on the front lines of the response, especially our nation’s outstanding medical professionals and public health officials who are working tirelessly to protect all of us from the coronavirus and treat patients who are infected; all of our courageous first responders, National Guard, and dedicated individuals who are working to ensure the health and safety of our communities; and our Federal, State, and local leaders,” the proclamation said. “We are confident that He will provide them with the wisdom they need to make difficult decisions and take decisive actions to protect Americans all across the country.  As we come to our Father in prayer, we remember the words found in Psalm 91:  ‘He is my refuge and my fortress:  my God; in him will I trust.’” The proclamation continued, “As we unite in prayer, we are reminded that there is no burden too heavy for God to lift or for this country to bear with His help. Luke 1:37 promises that ‘For with God nothing shall be impossible,’ and those words are just as true today as they have ever been.” “As one Nation under God, we are greater than the hardships we face, and through prayer and acts of compassion and love, we will rise to this challenge and emerge stronger and more united than ever before,” he said. “May God bless each of you, and may God bless the United States of America.”  ",Trump proclaims national day of prayer for Americans affected by coronavirus,"Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/donald-trump-proclaims-national-day-prayer-america/,washington_times
"Though it was certain to come at some point, Joe Biden picked up a big endorsement Saturday when the country’s largest union — the National Education Association — backed his presidential bid. The NEA and the American Federation of Teachers, the powerful teachers’ unions, are rock solid Democrats and in the general election back that party’s candidate. But prior to the NEA’s announcement they had waffled a bit, telling members that either Mr. Biden or Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders had their support. Since Mr. Biden cruised to an impressive victory in the Michigan primary and others last Tuesday, however, it has become clear his lead in delegates makes him the overwhelming favorite to clinch the Democratic nomination this summer. “Biden is the tireless advocate for public education and is the partner that students and educators need now in the White House,” NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia said in a statement. Thus far in 2020, Mr. Sanders has been the biggest recipient of NEA cash, according to OpenSecrets.com, which puts his total of $18,734 well ahead of Mr. Biden’s $7,595. The NEA endorsement means Mr. Biden can now finish the primary season with the union’s considerable muscle and deep pockets behind his campaign. In the 2016 presidential election year, the NEA showered $11.14 million on politics, and among direct contributions to candidates 84% — $2.88 million — of its giving went to Democrats, according to Open Secrets.

"MADRID — Spain’s government said Saturday that the wife of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has tested positive for the new coronavirus. It said Begoña Gómez and the prime minister are in good health and following the instructions of medical authorities at their residence in La Moncloa Palace in Madrid, the government seat. Two ministers of Sánchez’s Cabinet, the minister of equality and the minister of regional affairs, had already tested positive earlier this week. The government said both are in good health as well. The others member of the Cabinet have tested negative. The government informed the media of Gómez’s infection shortly after Sánchez gave a nationally televised address to announce a battery of measures his government will take to combat the pandemic during a two-week state of emergency. Prior to the address, Sánchez presided at a seven-hour Cabinet meeting that was attended by all the ministers except for the two who had tested positive. Health authorities said Saturday that coronavirus infections have reached 5,753 people in Spain, half of them in Madrid, since the first case was detected in late January.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Saturday he had the power to fire or demote Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, adding new fuel to his long-running animus toward the central bank’s leader at a moment when the economy was at risk of edging into recession. Trump told reporters that he wasn’t considering firing Powell, but reiterated his frustration with the chairman. The comments were particularly striking because they came as the coronavirus pandemic shook the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst week since October 2008. In just a few weeks, U.S. stocks have lost all the gains made during 2019. “I have the right to do that or the right to remove him as chairman,” Trump said Saturday at a news conference called to provide an update on the administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. “He has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.” No Fed chairman has ever been removed by a president. The law creating the Fed says its officials and those of other independent agencies can be “removed for cause” by a president. While that issue has never arisen in regard to a Fed official, the courts ruled decades ago that “for cause” meant more than a policy disagreement. Powell announced earlier this month a half-point interest rate cut that shrank the Fed’s key rate to a range of just 1% to 1.25%. It marked the first time the central bank has cut rates between scheduled policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis. And it’s the steepest rate cut the Fed has made since then. Yet, the president continued to complain that he was “not happy with the Fed” because it was “following” and “we should be leading.” The president pointed to lower interest rates set by the central banks in Japan and Germany as proof that Powell had not been aggressive enough in bolstering the U.S. economy. Economists, however, say the lower rates reflect the weaker economic outlooks than the U.S. economy. Trump said he’s made no decision, but suggested he could simply remove him as chairman. Powell’s four-year term ends in February 2022, and his term as a member of the Board of Governors expires January 2028. “I have the right to also take him and put him in a regular position and put somebody else in charge. And I haven’t made any decisions on that,” the president said.

"NEW YORK — As schools across the U.S. shut down in hopes of helping to fight the coronavirus, New York City officials are arguing just the opposite: They’re keeping the nation’s largest school system open to ensure that health and emergency workers aren’t tied down with kids at home. But teachers, many parents and some health experts say the city is making a grave mistake by continuing to call more than 1.1 million children to public schools even as it calls for “social distancing” elsewhere to stem the virus’ spread. While many families elsewhere in the country spent Saturday making hasty plans for an unexpected school shutdown, New Yorkers debated the city’s decision. “You’re not going to have a functioning health care system if the folks in the medical field, the doctors, the nurses, the techs, everyone has to stay home with their kids,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on MSNBC. Parent Anna Gold didn’t see it his way. “It would be a hardship if they closed the schools, but I think it’s a necessary one we need to take in the space of this emergency,” said Anna Gold, who pulled her third-grader and kindergartner out of public schools in Brooklyn on Friday and plans to keep them home next week. Another parent, Dori Kleinman, said she wishes the mayor would allow individual schools to make a decision about whether to close. “I don’t want my children at risk,” she said. New York City became a big outlier as other major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Boston, and several states decided to shutter schools for a week or more. New York health care workers’ unions said the city shouldn’t close schools without a plan to care for the children of those staffing hospital wards. The unions and city officials fear that even New York’s massive health care system could be quickly overwhelmed by a surge in serious cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “If it’s apparent it’s the safe thing, then it must be done, but it’s going to have a big impact on nurses,” said Eileen Toback, executive director of the New York Professional Nurses Union, which represents nurses at Manhattan’s Lenox Hill Hospital. “They’re on the front lines. They need to be here in shifts. They’re single mothers or single fathers sometimes, so they don’t have many backups, and the hospital is 24/7.” In a column in The New York Times, three teaches from Stuyvesant High pressured de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo to close the schools, and develop a plan to feed students that depend on school meals. The teachers describe a lengthy journey for some to and from school that puts students, their relatives and educators at risk. “No amount of hand washing and extra cleaning can prevent our thousands of students and hundreds of faculty and staff members from transmitting germs as they move in and out of classrooms for 10 periods a day,” Samantha Daves, Maura Dwyer and Annie Thoms wrote. De Blasio, a Democrat, has not ruled out closing schools eventually and said city officials would continue a day-by-day examination. But he has noted that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that while there can be reasons to shut schools, it’s not clear that closures will make more difference than other measures, such as hand-washing and isolating the sick. But Dr. Dena Grayson, a researcher and infectious disease expert who works in the private sector, called de Blasio’s decision so far to keep schools open “incredibly foolish.” “The virus will spread like wildfire among the children. They get infected, and they can spread that virus easily to older people who are at a much higher risk,” she said. The city has confirmed coronavirus cases in at least two public school students and at least one teacher. Their schools have been closed for cleaning but are expected to reopen. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover, but the outbreak has caused more than 5,000 deaths worldwide. Teachers’ unions are pressing de Blasio to close the schools, saying they’re worried for their students’ families, their own and New Yorkers at large. “To have 1.1 million students and countless employees crisscrossing the city, it feels to me beyond irresponsible,” says Derek Stampone, who teaches physics and computer science at a Manhattan high school where only about 2/3 of students showed up Friday, a dropoff echoed in the system as a whole. Stampone found himself spending much of Friday’s classes talking about the virus and such prevention tips as hand-washing. “I can see the anxiety in the room,” he said. So did social studies teacher Elise Ritter, who works at a different Manhattan high school that happens to focus on emergency management. The students who did attend, she said, were “really looking around and saying, ‘Why are we still here?’” Many live with grandparents and worry about them contracting the virus, she said. Teachers suggest the city could find ways to provide child care for health care workers - and supply food to the hundreds of thousands of poor students who depend on school meals - without keeping the entire school system open. De Blasio has said that any alternative would recreate the problem that closing schools would seek to solve: People congregating. Cuomo, a Democrat, said school closings remain “purely a local decision” unless a student tests positive, in which case a school must be closed for cleaning. “The closing of schools is a significant trade-off of benefits and burdens,” he said Saturday in a conference call with reporters. “If you close the schools, there are people who will not show up for work the next day. The public education system is also a day care, in many ways.” __ Associated Press reporters Adam Geller and Vanessa Alvarez contributed to this report.

"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo — States across the U.S. are allocating hundreds of millions of dollars to respond to the coronavirus, even as the U.S. government prepares to send billions more their way. Many states have built up sizable stockpiles in their “rainy day” funds during several robust years of tax collections. Some governors and state lawmakers now are tapping into those savings for emergency expenses. Others are looking to set aside even more in reserve, fearing the economic uncertainties stemming from the coronavirus could send tax revenues into a tailspin. “Forget the closure on Broadway - the loss of revenue to the state government, right now, is incalculable,” said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. He pulled the curtain on Broadway theaters this past week while banning gatherings of 500 or more people. President Donald Trump said Friday that he would free up as much as $50 billion for state and local governments as he declared the virus pandemic a national emergency. Many governors also have declared emergencies, giving themselves greater flexibility to spend money and waive regulations as needed. “All the resources we can have on hand - to make sure if things get worse - we want,” said Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, while announcing a state of emergency just hours after the president did so. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. State and local public health agencies have been on the front lines of the response, monitoring and testing those suspected of having the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease. Costs are mounting for staff time and medical supplies. But states also are bracing for a potential ripple effect on their revenues. The cancellation of major sporting and entertainment events could mean less tax revenue from tourists and local residents. Directives to work and study at home instead of at offices, schools and colleges could mean less revenue from fuel taxes and public transit fares. And if some employees can’t go to work, that could put a damper on state income and withholding taxes while driving up spending for public welfare programs such as unemployment insurance and state Medicaid health care programs. “It definitely has the potential to have a significant impact on state budgets - both on the spending and revenue side,” said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers. “One positive, if you want to use that word, is that this is coming after a period where states have seen strong revenue growth for the past couple of years … and have been able to increase the size of their rainy day funds and reserves,” Sigritz added. Across all states last fiscal year, the median rainy day fund balance equaled 7.6% of general fund expenditures. That’s a record high that was way up from a 1.6% share of general fund expenditures in the 2010 fiscal year, according to the budget officers group. In Washington state, which has seen the greatest number of U.S. coronavirus deaths, lawmakers this past week approved a budget that draws $200 million from the state’s rainy day fund. Of that, $175 million is to go to the public health system with the rest going to a special unemployment fund for affected businesses and workers. “The urgency of this is clear, the demand for action is clear, and we’ll stretch this as far as we can and we’ll find some way to finance more if we have to,” said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat. While tapping the emergency fund, Washington state lawmakers also pared back some proposed spending, allowing the state’s reserves to continue to grow in case the coronavirus causes more budgetary hardships. Georgia lawmakers this past week approved shifting $100 million from the state’s $2.8 billion of reserves into a governor’s emergency fund for the coronavirus. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, signed legislation allowing the state to tap up to $50 million from its rainy day fund. The spread of the coronavirus has coincided with crunch time in some state legislatures. Florida lawmakers, for example, extended their 60-day session that was scheduled to end Friday while working on a budget plan that has been complicated by the coronavirus outbreak. Concern about the economy has prompted budget writers to consider adding hundreds of millions of additional dollars to the state’s reserves to help offset any potential shortfalls. Some states where legislatures already had wrapped up budgets are now scrambling to account for the coronavirus costs. New Mexico lawmakers adjourned Feb. 20. This past week, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed about $150 million in infrastructure spending as coronavirus concerns caused world oil prices to plunge. The oil sector is a mainstay of the New Mexico economy. The cuts included nearly $50 million for local transportation projects plus funding for a rural water system, a preschool and senior center at Native American communities, and improvements at district courts. ___ Associated Press writers Jeff Amy in Atlanta; Bobby Caina Calvan in Tallahassee, Florida; Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington; Morgan Lee in Sante Fe, New Mexico; and Marina Villeneuve in Albany, New York, contributed to this report.

"TRENTON, N.J. — Officials are considering a statewide curfew to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Sunday morning. Hoboken already implemented one - from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. - starting Monday. Murphy was asked about curfews and also self-quarantine after Teaneck Mayor Mohammed Hameeduddin called for a citywide self-quarantine for the Bergen County town hit hard by COVID-19. “We’re not there at a statewide level on either of those steps, but we could be,” Murphy said on WBLS-FM 107.5. “The curfew is probably, of the two, is probably the more immediate one under consideration.” Murphy on Saturday night announced the second death in the state from coronavirus, a woman in her 50s who was being cared for at CentraState Medical Center in Monmouth County. Earlier, he had announced 19 new positive cases, bringing the statewide total to 69. More than a third of the COVID-19 cases - 25 - are in Bergen County, with 10 in Middlesex County, according to the state Department of Health website. The New Jersey Department of Corrections said its suspending visits for the next 30 days as of Saturday evening. Murphy said earlier that the state is preparing for closing schools statewide, though he stopped short of taking that step. He said it’s a matter of when, not if, they close. Education officials said some 354 districts, or roughly half, in the state have closed already. ___ HOBOKEN CURFEW Hours after announcing that gyms, health clubs, day cares and movie theaters would join the list of closures in Hoboken, Mayor Ravi S. Bhalla announced the forthcoming curfew and additional restrictions. The citywide curfew that begins Monday will be in effect from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. and requires all residents to remain in their homes, barring emergencies. People who are required to report to work are exempted. To further limit gatherings, the city’s Office of Emergency Management will not permit restaurants and bars to serve food within their premises. Bars that don’t serve food will be shut down, effective Sunday at 11 a.m. Any establishment that serves food will be allowed to conduct takeout and delivery service. Bhalla said that, as he was writing the statement, he received a call from the city’s police chief notifying him of a bar fight in downtown Hoboken. One person fell in and out of consciousness and police waited more than 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive because of the number of service calls emergency services have received. He said the incident illustrated how bar operations “can trigger calls for service that are delayed in part because of this public health crisis.” ___ COURTS SUSPENSION The chief justice of New Jersey’s court system announced a two-week suspension of municipal court sessions to mitigate public exposure to the coronavirus. Chief Justice Stuart Rabner said Saturday that individuals scheduled to appear through March 27 before a municipal court to contest a traffic or parking ticket or for a minor local ordinance violation should await notice of a new court date. Municipal courts will continue to handle some things such as applications for temporary restraining orders, hearings in which a defendant has been detained and matters that implicate public safety. Filings and payments will continue to be accepted except where a municipality has closed the municipal court building. Rabner earlier announced an indefinite suspension in all new jury trials, criminal and civil, in New Jersey due to the coronavirus outbreak. The order Thursday said jury trials already underway will continue and grand jury proceedings will continue pending further communication with county prosecutors and the state attorney general. ___ DRIVER’S LICENSES AND REGISTRATIONS State officials announced a two-month extension of expiration dates for driver’s licenses as well as vehicle registrations and inspection stickers. Murphy and Sue Fulton, chief administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, said the extensions apply to driver licenses expiring in March, April, and May; to registrations expiring in March, April, and May; and for inspection stickers expiring in March, April, and May. ___ CASES For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. ___ • The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Sunday that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are already in talks for a third coronavirus bill. On ABC’s “This Week,” Mr. Mnuchin explained that this latest package will be a stimulus bill targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as specific industries that have been hit hard by the virus, including the airline and cruise industries. “We will use whatever tools we have and whatever tools we don’t have we will go to Congress on a bipartisan basis and get more tools,” he said. “We’re in the second inning of nine innings.” Just after midnight on Saturday, the House passed a massive relief package to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers. It mandated free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone that does. The bill also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and school kids. It also bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. “This bill was very important in getting workers money in their pockets, people that have to be home,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The bill passed without lawmakers knowing exactly how much it will cost. This came after Congress passed an $8.3 billion bill to get more resources to state and local health officials. Mr. Mnuchin said he would also ask Congress to help the Federal Reserve have more resources to help the economy weather the virus. However, he would not comment on President Trump’s frustration with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. On Saturday, the president told reporters he had the power to fire or demote Mr. Powell, reiterating his frustrations at what he sees as a slow response. The Fed recently cut rates, now at historic lows, and offered $1.5 trillion in loans to banks. “I’m not going to make comments on that. It would be inappropriate for me as Treasury secretary,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The markets plummeted last week, but recovered somewhat on Saturday, which Mr. Mnuchin credits to the president’s national address Friday and the bipartisan bill.

"A former staffer in House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff’s office has tested positive for coronavirus. “We consulted with the House Attending physician and will be acting on their recommendations. Medical professionals believe that my former staff member likely contracted the virus after leaving the office, but we will still be taking additional precautions over the next few days,” the California Democrat said in a statement. The staffer left Mr. Schiff’s office 10 days ago. Mr. Schiff had already suspended public events in his district this coming week-long recess and ordered his staff to work from home before they found out about the sick staffer. Several outlets are reporting that the staffer is Daniel Goldman, who helped Mr. Schiff throughout the impeachment investigation as his top legal aide. Mr. Goldman spent the last week detailing on Twitter the difficultly he had trying to get a test for the coronavirus. Let’s be very clear: unless you have pneumonia and traveled to one of 5 high-risk countries recently, you can NOT get a #COVID19 test in New York City. If you, like me, have a fever and a headache (but tested negative for the flu), you are unable to rule out #COVID19. Shameful. Last week, a senate staffer working for Sen. Maria Cantwell also tested positive, prompting her D.C. office to close as they worked to sanitize the workspace. Across Capitol Hill, several lawmakers have already gone into self-quarantine after coming into contact with individuals who contracted the disease.

"Republican Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said Sunday that schools in his state could remain closed for the rest of the year. “You know, this may not peak until the latter part of April or May. So we’ve informed the superintendents, while we’ve closed schools for three weeks, that the odds are this is going to go on a lot longer and it would not surprise me at all if schools did not open again this year,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Ohio is one of several states across the country that have moved to shut down public schools in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Many universities as well have closed campuses and moved to online classes. Earlier this week, Mr. DeWine said, based on models and what he’s heard from experts, there are likely 100,000 undiagnosed cases of coronavirus in the state, and cases were likely to double every six days. The point of that was to illustrate to people that we have a lot of people walking around Ohio who are positive who haven’t been tested.

WHO is coordinating global response and has sent teams inside China to learn how the virulent bug sprouted and infected over 80,000 Chinese, by far the world’s most by country. Zhao Lijan, spokesperson and deputy director general of the Foreign Ministry information department, shifted virus blame to America on Twitter. “What are the names of the hospitals?

The that the deadly SARS, also a coronavirus,  was traced to bats fancied by the region’s diners. China’s Western critics have blamed the virus’s fast spread on the communism regime’s secrecy.

"A top member of the White House task force on combating the spread of coronavirus says the administration has “not seriously discussed” restricting travel within the United States. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, said on ABC’s “This Week” that the idea of domestic travel restrictions have come up during administration deliberations but such action is unlikely “right now or in the immediate future.” Fauci’s comments come a day after President Donald Trump told reporters that he was considering imposing restrictions on travel within the U.S. to areas hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The president said Saturday he was also adding the United Kingdom and Ireland to a list of countries that would face sweeping travel restrictions over the next 30 days. Last week, Trump announced a temporary suspension of travel into the U.S. for foreigners who had recently spent time in the 26-nation Schengen area, the European Union’s border-free travel zone.

"The Senate will convene Monday amid coronavirus panic with an eye toward “swiftly” voting on the massive relief package that cleared the House early Saturday morning, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday night. The Kentucky Republican, in a statement, implicitly rejected calls to send the Senate home and pass the coronavirus bill through an abbreviated process. He said they still have work to finish not only on the virus, but also on a bill to extend the government’s secret surveillance capabilities. House lawmakers, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, approved legislation that would boost food assistance for those struggling during the virus crisis, would give an infusion of cash to the unemployment program and to state Medicaid funds so they can treat those who contract COVID-19, and would give companies means to pay workers forced to take off because of the virus. Mr. McConnell called those first steps, and said he and his troops are already working on other legislation to bolster the economy amid a coronavirus downturn. “This new disease is challenging our great nation in unfamiliar ways. But we have overcome far greater challenges before,” he said. “Those of us in elected office — at all levels — must continue to put partisanship aside and focus on our common work to serve the common good.” The House went home for a week vacation after passing its bill Saturday. The Senate’s second-ranking Democrat on Sunday said he and his colleagues should also stay home, and said the House bill could pass by “unanimous consent” — which would take agreement of all senators. Sen. Richard Durbin, Illinois Democrat, said making lawmakers travel back to Washington puts them at risk. “Set an example for America, Senator McConnell.  Think about our staff, their families, and our constituents, as well as your Senate colleagues,” he said. The Senate had planned a vacation to match the House, but Mr. McConnell last week canceled it after calls from Republicans to stay in session to try to help the government manage the coronavirus crisis. Mr. McConnell pointed out that they still have the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act renewal bill to deal with. That bill is currently the pending business on the floor, and it must be surmounted before the chamber can turn to the House coronavirus legislation.

The power struggle created an awkward moment in which Mr. Nadler canceled the markup of his own bill just minutes before it was scheduled. FISA allows U.S. intelligence agencies to meet with judges behind closed doors and explain why spying is needed without anyone to question their evidence. The process has come under scrutiny since revelations last year confirmed that the FBI abused FISA to surveil Trump campaign figure Carter Page as part of its probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Liberal civil libertarians and conservative defenders of President Trump united in an attempt to curb the government’s powers with FISA reforms. Instead, Mr. Schiff, at the urging of the intelligence community, pushed for smaller tweaks to the law. As a result, the House passed a bill that few lawmakers liked, that advocacy groups on the left and the right condemned, and that Mr. Trump hinted he would veto. Three critical FISA provisions lapsed when the Senate failed to take action Friday on the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and Trump ally, urged swift passage of the House bill, but a Republican faction also pressing for a Trump veto blocked a quick vote. Senate Republican leaders aim to pass the House bill this time and hope the president won’t veto it. Sean Vitka, policy counsel for the left-leaning Demand Progress, slammed the House’s reform measures as “an insult to Americans.” “This bill fails to address the innumerable famously well-documented problems with recent and ongoing FISA surveillance,” he said. The Senate is poised to take up the House bill Monday, one day after three critical FISA provisions lapsed. The Senate’s fiercest civil liberties defenders are urging their colleagues to reject the legislation. Those who followed the FISA fight say Mr. Schiff’s interference may have cost a chance at meaningful reform. “Schiff was fairly careful to keep his hands clean publicly from meddling in that process, but what everyone behind the scenes was saying is that he in some ways had ownership of the final results of this process,” said Josh Withrow, senior policy analyst for FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. “He made it clear that nothing would be allowed to pass that the [intelligence committee] hadn’t signed off on first.” Rep. Zoe Lofgren, California Democrat, pointed a finger at Mr. Schiff after a markup hearing was canceled because leadership opposed amendments she planned to attach to the FISA bill. She told Politico that whenever there was a chance to overhaul FISA, regardless of which party proposed the change, the intelligence committee chairman scuttled it. Spokesmen for Mr. Schiff did not acknowledge requests for comment from The Washington Times. Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, rejected the idea that Mr. Schiff’s involvement in a bill outside of his committee had sunk the chance for FISA reform. He said staff from multiple committees, along with the Justice Department, had a hand in crafting the bill. “There were all types of elements at play,” he told The Times. “You are negotiating with everyone. That’s why it took forever over the last several days.” Though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed that Mr. Schiff’s refusal to concede the administration a talking point on the Page warrant was a factor in his go-small approach to reforms, they said the main issue was pressure from the intelligence community to keep the status quo. The National Security Agency, the CIA, the FBI and other agencies said their powers were necessary to keep the U.S. safe. Even Attorney General William P. Barr, a fierce critic of the Page warrant and an ally of Mr. Trump, surprisingly went against the president by lobbying Republicans for a clean renewal of the FISA provisions. He praised the House bill after it passed. “The establishment intelligence community was generally on the same page the whole time,” said former Rep. Dan Glickman, Kansas Democrat and a former intelligence committee chairman. “It doesn’t surprise me that Schiff would be inclined to support the intelligence community’s agenda.” Mr. Glickman said that after years of criticism by Mr. Trump and Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and the panel’s previous chairman, it is not surprising that the intelligence community and Mr. Schiff would look out for each other. “They’ve been browbeaten by the president for a long time now with him saying he knows more than they do and disregarding their raw intelligence,” he said. “I think in many respects the Democrats treated them more fairly than the president. Schiff has a better relationship with the intelligence community, certainly more than Nunes.” Mr. Vitka said the ability of the intelligence committee to control other members of Congress is “very unique and dangerous to the privacy of all people in the United States.” Civil liberties hawks, who viewed Mr. Nadler as one of their staunchest allies in Congress, said they were surprised he was rolled by Mr. Schiff. Mr. Nadler relentlessly opposed the Patriot Act and championed additional FISA reforms during a similar fight in 2015, but he sputtered to defend his committee’s bill last week. “It greatly increases civil liberties protections. Not as much as I would want … but it’s what we could get,” he said tepidly when urging his colleagues to support the legislation. “Chairman Nadler as an individual has consistently supported good civil liberties amendments, and he has already said he doesn’t think this bill goes far enough,” Mr. Vitka said. “The issue here was how much he was pressured to give up control to the intelligence committee, which has always been the primary obstacle in passing surveillance reform in the House.” Mr. Schiff wouldn’t have been able to bring Mr. Nadler to heel without the backing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, according to Capitol Hill insiders. The speaker last year repeatedly rebuffed Mr. Nadler’s push to begin the impeachment process. When she ultimately relented, she appointed Mr. Schiff to lead the proceedings. “Schiff has the ear of the speaker,” said Mr. Withrow, the FreedomWorks analyst. “Nadler is a weak chairman. I’m not saying it to knock the guy, but If you watch his hearings, he doesn’t have command of the committee a chairman should have. Schiff played that to his advantage.” The Senate on Monday will try to figure out what to do with the FISA bill. It does have some support among Republican leadership, including Mr. McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, but it has detractors in both parties, too. Sen. Mike Lee, Utah Republican, demanded a 45-day extension Thursday so senators could hammer out a better deal. Richard Burr, North Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, denied the plea. Mr. Vitka said he expects an intense battle in the Senate this week. “There are maybe 20 to 25 Republican senators who are willing to go along with whatever Burr and McConnell tell them to do,” he said. “Thankfully, people like Sen. Lee make it clear there are members, on both sides of the aisle, who will fight hard against this fake reform bill.”  ",Schiff protects intel ‘status quo’ power by sinking wide-reaching FISA reform: Source,"Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/adam-schiff-fisa-reform-intervention-protects-fbi-/,washington_times

"The Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step Sunday of cutting interest rates to zero and launching a massive emergency $700 billion quantitative easing program to protect the economy from the impact of the coronavirus, while Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi began work on a third relief bill to help U.S. businesses and workers. As restaurants, taverns, schools and some major companies closed across the country, the Fed announced it was lowering its prime lending rate to 0% to 0.25%, the second major cut in two weeks. Combined with the new easing program, it was the largest one-day action the central bank has ever taken. “The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,” the central bank said in a statement. “The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.” President Trump said the move was “really good news.” “It’s really great for our country,” the president told reporters at the White House. “I think people in the [stock] market should be very thrilled.” Still, stock futures fell Sunday after the Fed’s action, indicating more losses loom on Monday. Major stock indexes have plummeted more than 20% in the past two weeks from their highs in mid-February, largely on concerns about the economic impact of the virus. Stocks bounced back nearly 10% on Friday, bolstered by Mr. Trump’s announcement of a national emergency and steps to speed testing and aid to states. The dramatic action by the Fed emphasized the threat to the U.S. economy from the coronavirus outbreak. The central bank had just reduced the prime lending rate by 0.5% two weeks ago, and last week it injected $1.5 trillion into the bond market. The rate is a benchmark for short-term lending for financial institutions and is a guide to many consumer rates from car loans to mortgages. Reserve requirements at banks also were eased, and the Fed said it is coordinating with foreign banks to enhance dollar liquidity in Japan, Britain, Europe, Canada and Switzerland. Mr. Trump had been imploring the Fed to cut rates further to keep the U.S. economy competitive with other nations whose central banks have been cutting their rates deeper. In the coming months, the Fed said it will purchase at least $700 billion more in bonds as part of its new quantitative easing to ensure enough money in the economy. The majority of it, about $500 billion, will be U.S. Treasury bonds. The rest will be mortgage-backed securities. “The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,” the Fed said in a statement. Mr. Mnuchin and Mrs. Pelosi are already talking about a third coronavirus bill, even as their second bipartisan legislative response to the outbreak awaits action in the Senate. The next package will be a stimulus bill targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as specific industries that have been hit hard by the virus, the secretary explained. “We will use whatever tools we have and whatever tools we don’t have we will go to Congress on a bipartisan basis and get more tools,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “We’re in the second inning of nine innings.” Its predecessor, however, still needs to get to the president’s desk. After a feverish 48 hours of negotiations, the House passed a massive relief package to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers just after midnight on Saturday. It mandated free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment-insurance programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone who does if they’re at a company with less than 500 employees. The bill also shores up food programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and schoolchildren, and bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. “This bill was very important in getting workers money in their pockets, people that have to be home,” Mr. Mnuchin said on ABC’s “This Week.” To help small businesses, the Treasury Department announced that those companies will be able to get deposits they gave the IRS and get a cash advance from the agency. This came just about a week after Congress passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion bill to get more resources to state and local health officials. And on Friday, President Trump declared a national emergency, freeing up about $50 billion in aid for states and localities to combat the virus. “I think there’s a lot of bipartisan support. We hope they pass this bill. If not, we’ll work with the center on whatever minor changes we need,” Mr. Mnuchin said on Fox News. The Senate, which left for the weekend on Thursday as plans for quick passage in the House fell apart, will be in on Monday, which will be the soonest the chamber could vote on the bill depending on what, if any, changes are made. At least one senator, though, is suggesting that the Senate doesn’t come back in at all this week. On Sunday, Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, called for the chamber to stay on recess and pass the bill on a unanimous consent vote — which can be derailed by just one objection — and allow those who object have it noted in the official record. He argued that doing otherwise would put senators and their staffers at risk of catching the virus unnecessarily. “We have been warned to limit unnecessary travel and gathering in large groups. Senators and staff are working to serve their states locally as best they can, and with unanimous consent for these measures there is no valid reason to force extra travel this week,” he said in a statement. However, the fact that lawmakers passed this latest legislative fix without a price tag, made it nearly impossible to push through the Senate on a unanimous basis. The chamber also needs to pass a bill to reauthorize and reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, parts of which expired Sunday. Both Mr. Mnuchin and Mrs. Pelosi said they will start working on the next package this week. The secretary wants the bill to specifically help sectors like the airline, tourism and cruise industries. Mr. Mnuchin defended the strategy, saying it wasn’t like the auto and banking bailouts that were spurred by the recession in the early 2000’s. “If you’re providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you’re taking collateral and you have security, that’s not a bailout,” he said on Fox News. “To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted — again, our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted.” The total cost of the bailouts from the financial crisis of 2008-09 was $498 billion, according to an analysis last year by Deborah J. Lucas, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Golub Center for Finance and Policy. Mr. Trump has repeated floated a payroll tax as another means to help alleviate some of the economic fallout of the virus, but it’s failed to capture any enthusiasm from anyone on Capitol Hill, least of all Democratic leadership. The Fed had been scheduled to hold a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 17-18. In Sunday’s action, the central bank also slashed the rate of emergency lending at the discount window for banks by 125 basis points, to 0.25%, and lengthened loan terms to 90 days. The Fed said the purchases under its new quantitive easing would begin Monday with a $40 billion installment. The Fed’s action cuts rates to a new range of 0% to 0.25%, from 1% to 1.25%. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester was the only “no” vote, preferring to set rates at 0.5% to 0.75%.

"WASHINGTON — The White House is putting in place new measures starting Monday to protect President Donald Trump and his staff during the coronavirus outbreak, including taking the temperature of anyone who enters the complex, from visitors to members of the press corps. This would expand on screenings the White House began on Saturday for anyone who gets close to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration response to the virus. “In order to keep the entire White House complex safe and healthy, beginning Monday morning, temperature checks will be conducted on everyone who enters campus,” spokesman Judd Deere said. “As was announced over the weekend, additional temperature checks will be conducted on individuals who are in close contact with the president and vice president throughout the day.” Press corps members are also taking steps, independent of the White House, to limit their exposure. The White House on Saturday began taking the temperature of reporters attending a coronavirus briefing led by Trump and Pence. One reporter with a temperature of 100.4 degrees was denied entry to the briefing room. Temperature checks were conducted before Sunday’s briefing, too. Trump has had contact with individuals who later tested positive for coronavirus, including the press aide for Brazil’s president, but the president initially refused to be tested. On Saturday Trump said he had taken the test in response to questions at a Friday news conference. The White House doctor reported late Saturday that the test came back negative. Trump, 73, would be considered at risk because of his age. Other precautionary steps the White House is taking: pausing its internship and volunteer programs, canceling public tours and canceling large events through the end of March. The White House also has closed its Navy Mess Dining Room, where many staffers get daily meals. The White House also has encouraged staffers to follow guidelines for telework issued by the Office of Management and Budget. The White House Correspondents’ Association also has taken steps to limit the number of journalists who are in the briefing room on a daily basis, starting with television crews. Television networks have agreed to “pool” camera coverage of the briefing room, the WHCA board said in a statement Sunday. That means just one crew will cover briefings and share footage with all the other networks, instead of having multiple crews covering the same event. That system was in place for Sunday’s coronavirus briefing. “This is an important first step for us, but we all agree more action is needed to protect our members and the integrity of the press pool covering the president,” the board said. Members are also being asked to leave every other seat in the briefing room empty to practice the “social distancing” that public health officials are impressing upon all Americans. They are also being asked to not stand in the aisles during briefings and to monitor such events remotely, if possible.

"The Supreme Court’s 2018 Janus decision was a landmark in labor law, but now the namesake in the case would like the justices to go further. The high court ruled in Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees that public-sector employees cannot be forced to pay union dues because it violates their First Amendment rights. Mark Janus, a former Illinois state employee, asked the justices last week to consider his petition to claw back the dues he paid unwillingly for years before he won his case. “The Supreme Court agreed that the union taking money from nonmembers was wrong, but the union still has the money it illegally garnished from my paycheck,” he said in a statement. “It’s time for AFSCME to give me back the money they wrongfully took.” Mr. Janus has lost his reimbursement argument at the district court level and before the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel ruled against him last year. He also lost before that appeals court in the original Janus case, only to have the high court overturn its decision. Now, he’s hoping that track repeats itself, said Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which represents Mr. Janus. “It was a huge victory in 2018 and what we’re now asking the Supreme Court is to help Mark get his money back,” Mr. Mix said. “If there was a violation of his First Amendment rights, and Janus ruled there was, then he ought to get relief and that is what this is about.” AFSCME, again the defendant in Mr. Janus’ case, did not respond to a request for comment, but Mr. Mix said the union has successfully employed “a good faith” defense, arguing it was legal at the time it took a portion of Mr. Janus’ paycheck for dues. “It’s true that we haven’t had a whole lot of success thus far,” Mr. Mix said. “But Supreme Court rulings are considered ‘black letter law,’ in that it is considered statutes should have always been that way.” Although labor experts expected the Janus decision to damage the finances of public-sector labor unions, the unions insist they have thrived in its aftermath, managing to hold on to most of their members and in some cases expand their rolls or raise dues. The Janus decision does not apply to private-sector unions, although the Supreme Court has ruled that members can receive a refund on the portion of compulsory dues that unions spend on political activity. Given that public-sector employees are paid by taxpayers and negotiate with public officials, all of their activity is inherently political, the majority of the Supreme Court ruled in Janus. A clawback of Mr. Janus’ past dues would be a game-changer, Mr. Mix said. The money at stake for Mr. Janus is small — about $3,000, which his lawyers say represents the amount “AFSCME seized from his paycheck without his permission from March 23, 2013, to June 27, 2018, representing the two-year statute of limitations from the date his case started in March 2015 through the Supreme Court’s 2018 decision in his favor.” The principle, however, is enormous as the Janus decision affected an estimated 5 million public employees. “Another favorable ruling in the case could have a massive impact, setting a federal precedent that would be controlling in dozens of other cases seeking refunds of dues taken unlawfully by public-sector union bosses,” said the National Right to Work Foundation. Mr. Mix said he is involved in or is aware of two class-action suits centered on union dues — one in California and the other in Ohio — that could affect more than 80,000 workers. About 30 post-Janus cases are in various stages of federal litigation, he said.

"Country music icon Charlie Daniels is plenty riled after leaning that China is the source for many antibiotics, generic medications and prescription drugs vital to Americans — a situation now in sharp focus following the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent national emergency. “The United States of America depending on any other nation for anything as critical as medicine is downright dumb and an ever-present threat to national security,” Mr. Daniels writes in an op-ed published by CNSNews.com. “There is a lesson to be learned here. Over the years, high tax rates caused American businesses to outsource so much manufacturing to China, our economies have become so entwined, and we’ve made so much money off the cheap Chinese labor that we have basically turned a blind eye to what our enabling of an oppressive communist government has accomplished for China,” Mr. Daniels said. “The Chinese military grows in strength and threat every day, using the enormous profits from Sino-American trade deals to maintain the largest standing army in the world. It’s time for America to adopt an ‘If we use it here, we should produce it here’ attitude,” he continued. “For the first time in modern times, thanks to the common sense and foresight of President Donald Trump, America is energy-independent and our economy no longer has to depend on the largesse of Saudi Arabia or any other nation who hates our guts. Now it’s time for America to bring it all back home. If we use it here, it should be made here,” Mr. Daniels concludes. MEDIA REMAINS IN ATTACK MODE News organizations hostile to President Trump remain in attack mode despite the coronavirus national emergency, and at a time when many Americans could use helpful news, straight talk and unbiased perspectives. Just a few very recent headlines: “The Trump presidency is over” (The Atlantic); “Tracking Trump’s false or misleading coronavirus claims” (The Washington Post); “Fact Check: Trump’s claims about his response to the coronavirus” (The New York Times); and “Donald Trump’s Sunday: An online church service, Twitter attacks” (USA Today). DOCTORS: THE TRUST FACTOR Only about one-third of Americans trust “elected officials.” But doctors? A new Pew Research Center analysis finds that 74% of the public give physicians a big thumbs up. Every group agrees with this, for once. “There were no significant partisan differences in views of doctors: Around three-quarters of both Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (73%) as well as Republicans and GOP leaners (77%) expressed a mostly positive opinion of medical doctors. This differs notably from the public’s evaluations of other societal institutions, especially the news media, where attitudes are deeply polarized along partisan lines,” the analysis said. The partisan gaps can be huge: 76% of Democrats give the press a positive review, compared to 30% of Republicans. FOR THE LEXICON “The Thin White Line.” Timely new phrase coined by Breitbart columnist James O. Pinkerton, referring to EMTs, paramedics and nurses. “So now maybe we should know a little bit more about the emergency and health professionals who will be charged with our care should we be stricken with corona-related medical misfortune,” Mr. Pinkerton writes. “We might call them the ‘Thin White Line,’ referring to their white coats, as a variation on the ‘Thin Red Line’ of British military history, and the ‘Thin Blue Line’ of American policing. These workers typically don’t get paid all that much; they are givers, not takers. That is, they give health and order, and take just a tiny fraction of what Wall Street Masters of the Universe pay themselves,” the columnist says. GREENLAND OFFICIALS: ‘STAY AWAY’ At 836,330 square miles, it’s the largest island on the planet, 81% of it is covered by ice and it is currently a territory of Denmark. That would be Greenland, home to 55,992 people and now one of the few places on Earth which has not been invaded by coronavirus. Yet. Officials on Greenland want to keep it that way. “We would like to tell our guests to stay home if you are considering traveling to Greenland right now,” Bjorn Tegner Bay, chief of Greenland’s police force, said in a Friday press conference. In recent years, cruise ships have frequented Greenland’s shores, guests eager to experience “a primordial place ruled by ancient ice,” this according to Quark Expeditions, which offers a Greenland itinerary. Air traffic also is a regular occurrence. “A plane from Denmark arrives every day, and there are often planes from Iceland. In recent days, we’ve seen planes land with passengers who were under suspicion of being infected,” said an urgent public announcement from the nation’s four opposition political parties: Inuit Ataqatigit, Partii Naleraq, Samarbejdspartiet and Atassut. Officials fear the health-care system will be “overwhelmed,” says a report from Arctic Today, which notes that Queen Ingrid’s Hospital in the capital of Nuuk has 130 beds — and room for only four patients in its intensive care unit. “We have had no guarantee from the Danish health authorities, but our expectation is that people in Greenland and the Faroe Islands would have as much right to care as people in Denmark, in the event we see people seriously affected by the coronavirus,” Henrik L. Hansen, Greenland’s chief medical officer, told Arctic Today. As of Sunday, meanwhile, Denmark had 827 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and Iceland, Greenland’s nearest neighbor, 161.

"President Trump said Sunday he is “strongly” considering a complete pardon for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI two years ago. “So now it is reported that, after destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has ‘lost’ the records of General Michael Flynn,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!” Typically, the president sidesteps the issue when he’s asked about a possible pardon for Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with the then-Russian ambassador to the U.S. after the 2016 election. But he asked a federal court in January to withdraw his guilty plea, citing prosecutorial misconduct. One form of misconduct that Flynn attorney Sidney Powell has publicly alleged is that the original notes from the FBI’s first interview with Flynn have gone missing. Attorney General William P. Barr has appointed an outside prosecutor, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri Jeffrey Jensen, to review the case.  Flynn was scheduled to be sentenced last month but the hearing was postponed indefinitely.

"A former staffer in House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff’s office has tested positive for coronavirus. “We consulted with the House Attending physician and will be acting on their recommendations. Medical professionals believe that my former staff member likely contracted the virus after leaving the office, but we will still be taking additional precautions over the next few days,” the California Democrat said in a statement. The staffer left Mr. Schiff’s office 10 days ago. Mr. Schiff had already suspended public events in his district this coming week-long recess and ordered his staff to work from home before they found out about the sick staffer. The staffer appears to be Daniel Goldman, who helped Mr. Schiff throughout the impeachment investigation as his top legal aide. His last day as a member of Mr. Schiff’s staff was March 6. He confirmed on Twitter that he had tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday. Mr. Goldman spent the last week detailing on Twitter the difficultly he had trying to get a test for the coronavirus. Let’s be very clear: unless you have pneumonia and traveled to one of 5 high-risk countries recently, you can NOT get a #COVID19 test in New York City. If you, like me, have a fever and a headache (but tested negative for the flu), you are unable to rule out #COVID19. Shameful. Last week, a senate staffer working for Sen. Maria Cantwell also tested positive, prompting her D.C. office to close as they worked to sanitize the workspace.

"Rep. Ayanna Pressley is calling for the compassionate release of some federal prisoners who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic. During an appearance Saturday on MSNBC, the Massachusetts Democrat and “Squad” member told host Al Sharpton that prisons “are an ecosystem in  a petri dish for the spreading of this pandemic.” “I’m just advocating to make sure that when we are talking about  those that are most vulnerable — our low-income residents and citizens,  those experiencing homelessness, our seniors — that we are also including  the incarcerated men and women who are certainly amongst one of the  most vulnerable populations,” Ms. Pressley said. “And given the crowding and overpopulating  in our prisons for a confluence of other reasons … are an ecosystem in  a petri dish for the spreading of this pandemic, which is why I  partnered with my colleagues, Reps. [Nydia] Velasquez, [Alexandria]  Ocasio-Cortez, and [Rashida] Tlaib, to lobby the Bureau of Prisons to  use their full power and to communicate guidance for how we will contain  and mitigate this epidemic behind the wall,” she continued. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) on Friday released its immediate plans to address the COVID-19 outbreak, including suspending all social visits for 30 days and curtailing legal visits, as well as giving prisoners extra phone time and suspending inmate transfers between prisons. Ms. Pressley said the BOP’s announcement was “woefully inadequate” and that the agency should use its authority to exact clemency, commutations and compassionate release. “I think now would be the time to commute some sentences, to exact  clemency and to take care of our most vulnerable,” she said. “Ten percent of those that are  incarcerated are over the age of 60 and already have an underlying  condition. We should be using compassionate release.”  ",Rep.

"The owner of seven Capitol Hill restaurants is defying Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s order to limit seating and close bars due to the coronavirus, saying “we will not bow down to pressure from the mayor’s office or any group for that matter who covertly is attempting to shut us down.” The Hill Restaurant Group, which operates the Hawk ‘N Dove tavern, Finn’s, Lola’s and several others, said it fully understands the gravity of the coronavirus outbreak. But it added in a statement, “We fully support our employees and our patrons. It is not our burden to bear nor is it our staff’s burden to bear.” “All HRG restaurants will continue to operate as normal and we encourage our fellow industry folks to do the same,” the owners said. The mayor tweeted at the restaurant group, “While I recognize that all of us have been stressed beyond our immediate understanding of how coronavirus has so quickly upended our daily lives and personal and business existence — you must comply with the DC Health notice.” The mayor on Sunday ordered licensed nightclubs to shut down operations, and all eating and drinking establishments to eliminate bar seating. There are also restrictions on the number of patrons who can sit at tables at restaurants. The restaurant group’s announcement drew a strong reaction on social media, with some people saying they would no longer patronize those restaurants. David Zipper, a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, tweeted, “I invite fellow Washingtonians to join me in never again visiting any restaurant owned by Hill Restaurant Group.”  ",Capitol Hill restaurant group defies mayor's order to close bars,"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/capitol-hill-restaurant-group-defies-mayors-order-/,washington_times
"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden holds a 20-point lead over Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont in Arizona, according to a poll released on Monday ahead of Tuesday’s presidential primary contest. Mr. Biden was the top choice of 51% of likely Democratic primary voters, followed by Mr. Sanders at 31% and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 1%, according to the Monmouth University poll. “Biden has a strong advantage going into the primary. This is because much of his support has already been banked in the early vote,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. “The closure of many polling places due to COVID-19 means it is uncertain how many voters who planned to vote on Tuesday will actually show up.” Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders squared off in their first one-on-one debate on Sunday evening in Washington, D.C. The debate had been moved from Phoenix due to coronavirus concerns. Maricopa County is planning to close about 80 polling locations on Tuesday because of the coronavirus outbreak. The county recorder also planned to mail ballots to registered Democrats who haven’t voted yet, though a judge quashed that plan late last week after Attorney General Mark Brnovich took legal action. Mr. Biden held a 3-point, 46% to 43% lead over President Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up in Arizona in the poll, while Mr. Trump held a 1-point, 44% to 43% lead over Mr. Sanders. “Impressions of the Democratic nominee will shift once the general election campaign gets under way, but Biden would start off by putting Arizona within reach,” Mr. Murray said. Democrat Mark Kelly also held a 6-point, 50% to 44% lead over Republican Sen. Martha McSally in a hypothetical November match-up in what will be one the most closely-watched U.S. Senate races in the country. Top elections officials from Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio issued a joint statement on Friday saying they are confident that voters can “safely and securely” cast ballots in Tuesday’s primaries. Still, Louisiana and Georgia recently announced they were pushing off their presidential primaries due to the coronavirus outbreak. Louisiana is pushing its April 4 primary to June 20, and Georgia’s March 24 primary has been rescheduled for May 19. The Democratic Party of Puerto Rico also said over the weekend that it would seek to delay the March 29 presidential primary. The Monmouth poll of 847 registered voters was taken from March 11-14 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. The subset of 373 likely Democratic primary voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.1 percentage points.

"The U.S. faced mounting pressure Sunday to mimic Europe and stop crowded bars and public spaces as Americans from coast to coast become sick with worry and the new coronavirus that is taxing the nation’s hospitals, economy and political leaders at an unprecedented scale. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Sunday said organizers should postpone or cancel events that consist of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks — an aggressive marker that would upend mass gatherings in the U.S. It said events of any size should include hand washing and proper distancing while recognizing the vulnerability of certain groups to the coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. It said the guidance does not apply to the day-to-day operations of schools, colleges or businesses, though it was unclear why. “This recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus,” the CDC said. “This recommendation is not intended to supersede the advice of local public health officials.” Indeed, some of them may go further. Governors in Illinois and Ohio said they are exploring ways to lock down bars and restaurants, and the nation’s top authority on infectious diseases endorsed a 14-day “national shutdown” to slow the outbreak as young people jammed into bars in New York City, the District of Columbia and elsewhere.

"Joseph R. Biden said Sunday that Americans staring at the  coronavirus crisis are “looking for results, not a revolution,” as he  painted himself as a middle option between an incompetent President  Trump and a too-radical Sen. Bernard Sanders, who sees the epidemic as  the reason to adopt a government-run health care system. Mr. Biden said he would set up hundreds  of drive-through testing sites across the country, would call out the  military to stand up emergency hospitals and hold meetings to decide  whether to declare a quarantine and to figure out a long-term economic  stimulus. But he said Americans need to be assured  the government has them covered for all their needs right now, in what  sounded like a limited test-drive of Mr. Sanders‘ own health care plans. “This is like in a war, and in a war you  do whatever needs to be done to take care of your people,” Mr. Biden  said. “Everything you need in terms of dealing with this crisis needs to  be free.” He was facing off one-on-one against Mr. Sanders in a debate in Washington ahead of primaries in four more states Tuesday. The two men settled on one thing: that Mr. Trump has not handled the crisis well. “Shut this president up right now,  because he is undermining the doctors and scientists,” Mr. Sanders said  about Mr. Trump’s public remarks and tweeting. “It is unacceptable for  him to be blabbering with unfactual information, which is confusing the  general public.” The senator from Vermont said the  American health care system isn’t prepared to handle COVID-19, and it’s  proof that it’s time for his “Medicare for All” health care plan. “We’re spending so much money, and yet we  are not even prepared for this pandemic. How come we don’t have enough  doctors? How come hospitals in rural areas are shutting down?” he said. He blamed corporate greed and said the answer is to take it out of the equation. Mr. Biden countered: “You have a single-payer system in Italy. It doesn’t work there.” Mr. Biden also announced that if he  becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, he will pick a woman as his  running mate. Mr. Sanders said “in all likelihood” he would, too. Democratic Party leaders were hoping for a  show of unity between the two remaining major candidates. Instead, the  debate was peppered with pointed exchanges. Mr. Sanders pointed to Mr. Biden’s votes  against gay rights in the 1990s, his support for a restriction on  abortion funding, backing legislation that would have cut Social  Security, and voting for a 2005 bankruptcy bill as evidence that Mr.  Biden is not the liberal champion the country needs. Mr. Sanders also said Mr. Biden’s climate change plans fall short. “I know your heart is in the right place,  but this requires dramatic, bold action. We have got to take on the  fossil fuel industry,” he said. “Your plan does not do that.” Mr. Biden acknowledged that he has moved  toward Mr. Sanders‘ stances in many areas. He said he has apologized for  his vote for the Defense of Marriage Act and noted that he was the  first major figure in the Obama administration to call for legal  recognition of same-sex marriage. He also said he has changed on the  abortion funding question and his vote for the Iraq War was a mistake —  but only because he believed President George W. Bush. But he said the country’s not ready to go full Sanders right now. “People are looking for results; they are not looking for a revolution,” Mr. Biden said. There were points of agreement in areas  such as immigration. Both men said they would severely curtail  enforcement inside the U.S. Mr. Sanders said he would end “raids” on  illegal immigrants, and Mr. Biden affirmed his vow for a 100-day  no-deportation period, and after that only those with felonies on their  records would be deported. That would carve almost all the estimated 11  million illegal immigrants out of any fear of removal. Both men said that doesn’t mean open borders. Mr. Sanders called that “a total lie.” Mr. Biden has been surging since the last  debate just ahead of the South Carolina primary, winning at least 15 of  the last 21 state contests, including several states that Mr. Sanders  carried over Hillary Clinton four years ago. His stunning success on Super Tuesday,  and the stumblings of former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg,  cleared out the field and left Mr. Biden the choice of the party’s  less-liberal wing. That has consolidated the vote behind Mr. Biden, who now holds a solid lead in the delegate count over Mr. Sanders. The senator, watching his second bid for  Democratic nomination falter, delivered a speech last week laying out  his plans for this debate. He said he would pressure Mr. Biden to stake  out positions on a plethora of “progressive” issues. The strategy appeared aimed at defining  the candidates’ differences and giving the former vice president a  political road map for how to connect with the far-left voters who have  rallied behind Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden took the first steps Sunday  before the debate. He announced he had updated his higher education  agenda to include tuition-free public college for students from families  with incomes lower than $125,000. Tuition-free college and his Medicare for All health care plan are the centerpieces of Mr. Sanders‘ democratic socialist agenda. Mr. Sanders welcomed the backing but questioned the late change. “This is a little about leadership,” he said. “Glad you’re coming around now.” Mr. Biden also announced that he was  adopting the bankruptcy plan of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out  of the presidential race this month but maintains credibility among  liberal voters. Ms. Warren’s plan, which Mr. Biden now embraces, would  make it easier for people to claim bankruptcy and allow them to shield  some assets in the process. The embrace was a makeup call for Mr.  Biden, who has taken fire for his vote in 2005 for a bankruptcy bill  that irks liberal Democrats. To win the nomination, a candidate must collect 1,991 delegates. Mr. Biden appears poised to expand his  lead Tuesday when voters in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio have  their say. Polls show Mr. Biden with double-digit leads over Mr. Sanders  in each of those states. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden greeted each  other Sunday night with an elbow bump rather than a handshake, and both  men assured the debate moderators that they wash their hands frequently  amid the coronavirus outbreak. The debate was relocated from Phoenix to Washington, and the live audience was scrapped. COVID-19 has led to more than 50 deaths,  upending people’s daily lives and leaving the presidential contenders to  navigate unknown political waters at a pinnacle moment in the campaign. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll  found that 60% of Americans think the worst of the epidemic is yet to  come. Democrats are far more concerned about the virus than other  voters, making the candidates’ handling of it a major campaign issue. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have canceled  mass rallies and headed online for virtual town halls and fundraisers,  fireside chats and an increasing number of press conferences. Mr. Sanders has penciled in a virtual rally Monday that is set to include musical acts.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders isn’t a fan of Joseph R. Biden’s plan to address climate change, saying it is mind boggling that the former vice president is not rallying behind bolder ideas such as his push to ban fracking. During their first one-on-one debate Sunday in Washington, Mr. Sanders said Mr. Biden’s vision for confronting the “world-shaking event” falls woefully short. “I know your heart is in the right place, but this requires dramatic bold action, we  have got to take on the fossil fuel industry,” he said. “Your plan does not do that.” Mr. Biden defended his plan, countering that he would provide no more subsidies to the fossil fuel industry and would bar drilling on federal lands and offshore. He also said that he doesn’t support any “new fracking.” Mr. Sanders said he doesn’t understand why fracking is allowed to continue in the United States, and that it is time to “take on the fossil fuel industry.” “What Joe is saying goes nowhere near enough,” Mr. Sanders said. Mr. Sanders said Mr. Biden’s desire to reenter the Paris Accord is useful, but it is not enough -  sparking a chuckle from Mr. Biden. “If you are laughing Joe then you are missing the point,” Mr. Sanders said. “This is an existential crisis.” “I am talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,” Mr. Sanders said. “I’m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet.”  ",'Nowhere near enough': Sanders blasts Biden's climate change plan,"Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-blasts-joe-biden-climate-change-pla/,washington_times

I would pick a woman to be my vice president.” Asked whether he would pick a woman as well, Mr. Sanders said he could also go that route. “In all likelihood I will,” Mr. Sanders said. “For me it is not just nominating a woman, it is making sure we have a progressive woman, and there are progressive women out there.” “So my very strong tendency is to move in that direction,” he said.

"Democrats’ top two presidential candidates declared Sunday that they will halt key aspects of immigration enforcement as soon as they take the White House, and promised to work to legalize most of those here illegally. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden affirmed his plan for a 100-day halt to all deportations. “No one, no one will be deported at all,” he said at a debate with Sen. Bernard Sanders. After the 100-day period he said he would only deport those with felonies on their record, effectively carving almost all illegal immigrants out of danger of deportation. Mr. Biden also refuted the Obama administration’s policy of cracking down on sanctuary cities, saying flatly that he would not ask local authorities to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, said he would stop “raids” by ICE — apparently referring to the at-large arrests the agency says it has to make particularly in sanctuary communities, where local prisons and jails refuse help in arresting criminals. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders insisted their plans don’t mean “open borders.” “That is a total lie,” Mr. Sanders said. The two candidates called for surging immigration judges to the border, saying illegal immigrants should be met with a legal process and released, not detained.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders said he is happy that Joseph R.

The Vermonter said he took hard voters when it mattered most, and staked out positions that were once unpopular, but have become so in vogue that people that Mr. Biden has finally come around. “What leadership is about is about going forward when it is not popular,” Mr. Sanders said. “When it is an idea that you get criticized for.” Mr. Sanders said that he voted against, and Mr. Biden voted for, the Defense of Marriage Act, the bankruptcy bill, the war in Iraq, trade deals that he says have hurt the economy, and the Hyde Amendment. “It takes courage sometimes to do the right thing,” Mr. Sanders said.  “The people of America know my record.

"Joseph R. Biden  and Sen. Bernard Sanders clashed in the Democratic presidential debate over the 2008 bailout of Wall Street, with the former vice president arguing that the nation would have sunk into a depression if the Obama administration didn’t act. Mr. Sanders said that he voted against the bailout package because he didn’t want to reward the “illegal behavior” of people on Wall Street. ‘Had those banks gone under all those people that Bernie says he cares about would be in deep trouble - deep, deep trouble,” Mr. Biden said. “All those little folks. They would have gone out of business. They would have found themselves in the position of losing everything they had in that bank - whether it was $10, $300 or a savings account.” Mr. Sanders said that at the time he felt the bailout should have been funded with a surtax on the nation’s most wealthy citizens. “We need to stabilize the economy, but we can’t repeat what we did in 2008,” he said. “Joe voted for that, I voted against it because we have to do more than save the banks or the oil companies. Our job right now is to tell every working person in this country, no matter what your income is, you are not going to suffer.” The disagreement underscored the divide between Mr. Biden’s push for short-term fixes and Mr. Sanders‘ call for long-term systematic change.

Bernard Sanders as the two remaining major candidates for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Sanders said his “Medicare for All” health plan would guarantee illegal immigrants get health care, so they could show up at clinics for testing and care. And he said he would halt at-large immigration enforcement altogether so illegal immigrants wouldn’t be afraid to show up.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders said Sunday that the first step to solving the coronavirus epidemic is to silence President Trump, who he said is undermining the doctors trying to give good advice. “Shut this president up right now,” Mr. Sanders said as he kicked off a two-man debate with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden in the Democratic presidential contest. Mr. Biden also blamed Mr. Trump for a slow response, saying he should have accepted the World Health Organization’s offer of testing kits, instead of waiting for the U.S. to develop its own. The two men were debating at the CNN studios in Washington set far apart from each other on stage and from the moderators, as if to underscore the social distancing recommendations from doctors. Mr. Biden said the solution to the virus is to set up drive-through coronavirus testing and task the military with standing up emergency hospitals to prepare for a health emergency. Mr. Sanders said the virus is the latest proof that his Medicare for All health plan is needed, saying a guarantee that nobody would have to pay for anything related to the virus would be reassuring. Mr. Biden countered that a single-payer system isn’t working in Italy, though he said when it comes to the virus Americans shouldn’t have to pay for any coronavirus care — effectively calling for a limited Medicare for All. “The national criss says we’re responding. It’s all free. You don’t have to pay for a thing,” Mr. Biden said. “We’re at war with the virus.” Mr. Sanders said 30,000 people in the U.S. died last year because they couldn’t afford treatment. “I think that’s a crisis,” he said.

"When North Carolina courts issue warrants to search homes or private property during criminal investigations, records of that process are supposed to be public with rare exceptions. But an examination by a dozen North Carolina news outlets found state courts typically don’t track how often they keep these records secret. And although they contend that sealing search warrants is uncommon, many clerks, district attorneys and judges can’t say how often it happens. The statewide project coincided with  Sunshine Week, a national celebration each March of open government  and the public’s right to know. Journalists requested records and surveyed court officials in 30 counties – rural and urban, wealthy and less prosperous – and found inconsistent approaches to sealing search warrants that persist nearly a decade after an effort to standardize the process and make it more transparent. Brooks Fuller, director of the N.C. Open Government Coalition and assistant journalism professor at Elon University, said it’s sometimes necessary to seal records. “However, it is critical for the public to have a sense of how often and in what types of cases judges seal records from public view,” Fuller said.  North Carolina law dictates that once a warrant is executed and returned to the court, anyone - whether it’s a reporter, a suspect or an interested citizen - should be able to access it, unless a judge seals it. Investigators are required to get a warrant from the courts in most cases before conducting a search. They must explain what they’re looking for and demonstrate probable cause. Making the warrant public, says Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman, acts as a check on the incredible authority of the state. “The public has the right and needs to have the ability to review the exercise of that authority,” Freeman said. District attorneys say they must meet a high bar in the rare instances that a judge seals a search warrant.  Temporarily sealing a search warrant can be necessary, prosecutors say, when investigators need time to build their cases before tipping off suspects.  In Rockingham County, Superior Court Judge Stanley L. Allen said he hasn’t signed many orders to seal information, though doing so can help law enforcement conduct searches or protect the identity of an undercover police officer. In some cases, he said, a seal is used “so the bad guys won’t find out about it.” In Johnston County, District Attorney Susan Doyle said that, to her knowledge, her office had only filed one motion to seal in 2019 – and that was to protect victims and witnesses in a gang-related case with four co-defendants. “We rarely file any motions to seal,” Doyle said. “However, that is a tool that becomes necessary when the safety of victims and witnesses is at stake.” Franklin County Clerk of Superior Court Patricia Chastain estimates that judges there seal between one and two warrants per year, on average.  District Attorney Greg Newman, the chief prosecutor for Henderson, Polk and Transylvania counties, said the rare instances in which he seeks a seal most often deal with victims through the Department of Social Services.  “There’s no one just agreeing to seal records for no good reason,” Newman said.  And in Mecklenburg County, Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Bob Bell said he couldn’t remember the last search warrant he put under seal. “It’s anything but routine,” Bell said. Still, court officials in almost all of the 30 counties surveyed said they had no way to track sealed warrants or provide a specific number, Statewide, the N.C. Administrative Office of the Courts “has no application that tracks the issue of sealed search warrants,” spokeswoman Sharon Gladwell said. Wake County is an exception. Every sealed warrant is logged, noting the case, the date the order was signed and when the seal expires. That order was revised and refined following a 2008 dispute between the district attorney and news outlets over sealed search warrants in a high-profile murder case. The North Carolina Court of Appeals ruled that while temporary seals were justifiable, trial courts should not withhold public records from public inspection unless it is in the interest of the “proper and fair administration of justice” or where “the openness ordinarily required of our government will be more harmful than beneficial.”  In Mecklenburg County, motions to seal search warrants occur in a hearing unannounced to the public. Once in place, a seal is rarely removed. According to county data, slightly more than 2 percent of about 4,200 warrants were sealed in 2018 and 2019. No other counties surveyed by reporters were able to point to any similar tracking system.  ___ This story was reported by Jonathan Drew, of The Associated Press; Kate Martin, of Carolina Public Press; Doug Miller and Michael Gordon, of The Charlotte Observer; Chris Day and Julian Eure, of The Daily Advance; Paul Woolverton, of The Fayetteville Observer; Josh Shaffer, of The News & Observer; Amelia Harper, of the Rocky Mount Telegram; Ann McAdams and Brandon Wissbaum, of WECT-TV; Jenn Emert, of WLOS-TV; Tyler Dukes, of WRAL-TV; and Jason deBruyn, of WUNC.

"Republican Sen. Mitt Romney proposed Monday giving a $1,000 handout to every American adult in an attempt to help the U.S. economy weather the coronavirus which is devastating markets. The money is intended to “help fill the gaps” for Americans who are starting to have issues with their paychecks and bills. The senator sees it as an additional step to the House-passed coronavirus bill that includes free testing, paid sick leave and solidifies unemployment benefits. “We also urgently need to build on this legislation with additional action to help families and small businesses meet their short-term financial obligations, ease the financial burden on students entering the workforce, and protect health workers on the front lines and their patients by improving telehealth services,” Mr. Romney, Utah Republican, said in a statement. The idea of giving $1,000 to every American adult was first made popular by ex-presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Hawaii Democrat Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a candidate in the Democratic primary race, introduced a bill with a similar proposal in the House last week. The stipend is just one of the suggestions Mr. Romney floated. He also called for bridge grants from the Small Business Association for small companies that expect a 50% revenue loss because of the virus. For students, Mr. Romney calls for loan payments to be suspended as well as student fees and grants next year to take into account last-minute expenses on travel, housing and storage students incurred as universities and colleges shut down. Mr. Romney also wants the government to foot the bill for private insurance companies to cover the cost of telehealth services related to the coronavirus.

"The second coronavirus relief package was on its way Monday night to the Senate for final passage as lawmakers in the Capitol tried to balance their responsibilities for leading the country against rapidly escalating health risks. The House passed an updated version of its bill Monday, including technical changes that nearly derailed the process after objections from Rep. Louie Gohmert. The Texas Republican said he was concerned about the last-minute tweaks and was unhappy about passing such a large and expensive bill on such short notice. “I will not give my consent without first reading these very serious changes that will hopefully minimize bankruptcies caused by the virus rather than causing more,” Mr. Gohmert said, before ultimately standing down. Now both the original bill and the updated version, which reportedly includes new language to aid small businesses, will head to the Senate where they both need to pass before heading to President Trump’s desk. The president said earlier Monday even more changes could be made to the legislation now that it’s in the Senate. “They’re [the Senate] working to only enhance it and make it better and it make fair for everybody,” he said. “We may go back and forth a bit with the House on it but both will be in a very positive fashion.” Earlier Monday, some lawmakers were skeptical of the relief package’s chances in the Senate. On Fox News, Sen. Tom Cotton said the bipartisan bill didn’t yet have the votes. “I don’t think the House bill is going to pass as written for one basic problem — it doesn’t go far enough and it doesn’t go fast enough,” the Arkansas Republican said. But four top administration officials, including National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, came up to Capitol Hill to meet with senators late Monday. After the closed-door meeting, Mr. Mnuchin emerged and told reporters he expects the package to move through the Senate on Tuesday. The bill initially passed the House on a 363-40 vote just after midnight on Saturday, after a feverish 48 hours of negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin. The bill also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and children and bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. With the legislation passed the House and headed to the Senate, lawmakers are already talking about getting started on a third coronavirus bill — this time, Republicans are pushing to give an economic break to hard hit sectors, like the airline and cruise ship industries. The trouble the House has with the challenge to unanimous consent shows the difficultly Congress has in legislating during the coronavirus. Members — many of whom are older and more vulnerable to the virus — need to come in to vote, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended suspending events of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. The president on Monday tightened that restriction further: no events for 10 or more people. The new health guidelines prompted the Senates’ health committee to cancel its scheduled hearing on the coronavirus response this week. Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, advised members to cancel plans to come back to Capitol Hill on Monday and did not have a firm fly-in date. Members will have 24-hours notice if they need to return to D.C. for votes. Leadership is also considering new policies to try and limit how many members are in the chamber at a time. Meanwhile, the Senate canceled its recess this week in order to pass the coronavirus bill and FISA reauthorization.  ",House passes coronavirus bill after Gohmert reverses objection,"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/house-passes-coronavirus-bill-after-louis-gohmert-/,washington_times
"The Senate on Monday agreed to pass a temporary extension of three expired national security tools so it could spend more time debating a broad overhaul of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The stopgap measure, which extends the national security tools controlled by FISA for 77 days, passed without intervening action or debate. It also gives senators more time to focus on a multibillion dollar House coronavirus package as public pressure mounts for government action. “We have the next two months to build consensus around important reforms and help everybody — Democrats and Republicans — with joining that effort,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy, Vermont Democrat. The last-minute deal also avoids a potential veto of a House-passed bill by President Trump, who tweeted his displeasure with that proposal. Senators were set to reauthorize fully the critical national security tools controlled by FISA, which lapsed Sunday after a contentious debate in the House last week. Civil liberties advocates who had opposed the House measure praised the stopgap agreement. “The deal secured by bipartisan group of senators ensures that there will be debate on amendments that will protect Americans’ civil liberties,” said Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs for FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. Senators were set to take up a House bill that was approved last week with a bipartisan 278-136 vote. The House bill fully reauthorized the critical national security tools controlled by FISA, which lapsed Sunday. Upon its arrival in the Senate, the bill was quickly condemned by civil liberties hawks, including Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Opponents insisted the legislation didn’t do enough to curb government surveillance, insisting on more sweeping reforms. Both Mr. Lee and Mr. Paul had demanded a substantial overhaul of FISA since revelations confirmed last year the FBI had abused its surveillance powers to monitor Trump campaign figure Carter Page as part of its Russian election interference probe. “We know that the law itself as a whole is subject to abuse and at moments like this, when these provisions are expiring, it’s appropriate for us to take a broader look at overhauling the legal framework in which FISA operates,” Mr. Lee said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other leadership figures had expressed support for the House bill. The Kentucky Republican touted the bill’s privacy protections and warned delaying passage could threaten national security. Mr. McConnell said the reform bill “strikes a key balance.” “It reauthorizes the tools which our national security requires while also imposing a number of new reforms, which basic accountability demands,” he said. Urging passage of the stopgap measure Monday, Mr. McConnell said the three expired FISA provisions needed to be back online immediately. “Hostile foreign intelligence surveillances — whether Chinese, Russian or Iranian — still seek to conduct operations within our borders, to recruit assets and agents among our population,” he said. “These threats will not wait around if the United States delays restocking the toolbox and so the Senate should not wait to act.” The three expired FISA provisions extended by the legislation eliminate the need for separate warrants to wiretap multiple cell phones; allow authorities to monitor “lone wolf” threats who don’t have formal ties to terrorist organizations; and collect business records. House-passed reforms to the FISA process that will be considered later include enhanced penalties for those who abuse the process for political purposes, increased accountability to Congress, transcripts of court proceedings, and a one-time historical review off FISA court rulings since 1979. Mr. Trump warned last week that he could veto the bill until the origins of the Russian probe, which described as an “attempted coup” are investigated. “Many Republican senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what that led to, and happened with the illegal, attempted ‘coup’ of the duly elected President of the United States and others,” the president tweeted. Attorney General William Barr had expressed his support for the House bill and encouraged senators of both parties to vote yes on it. Mr. Barr, a fierce critic of the Page warrant, surprisingly went against the president lobbying for the minor FISA reforms. “The bill contains an array of new requirements and compliance provisions that will protect against abuse and misuse in the future while ensuring that this critical tool is available when appropriate to protect the safety of the American people,” he said.

"When it comes to starting from scratch to fight a rapidly spreading global pandemic of a heretofore unknown disease, Ambassador Deborah Birx has been there. The White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator, Dr. Birx cut her teeth in public health with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, starting her career in immunology in 1985 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and rising to head the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR] in 2014. In naming her to the administration’s coronavirus task force last month, Vice President Mike Pence described her as a “world-renowned global health official and physician,” and that’s no exaggeration, according to others in the field. Dr. Birx, 63, is “absolutely the right person” to lead the Trump administration’s COVID-19 response, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, professor of infections diseases at the Emory University School of Medicine, who called PEPFAR “the most successful global health program ever.” “I would give money to see a meeting between her and [President] Trump,” said Dr. del Rio. “She won’t stay quiet when she has something to say. She’s a tough lady. If anyone can talk truth to power, it’s her.” At the daily White House press conferences on the coronavirus, Dr. Birx frequently draws comparisons between HIV/AIDS and the fast-spreading virus causing pneumonia-like symptoms that has killed more than 6,500 worldwide since emerging last year in Wuhan, China. “We had another silent epidemic: HIV,” she said at Monday’s briefing. “I just want to recognize, the HIV epidemic was solved by the community, the HIV advocates and activists who stood up when no one was listening and got everyone’s attention. We’re asking that same sense of community to come together and stand up against this virus.” The HIV/AIDS epidemic hit home for her in 1983. Immediately after the birth of her older daughter, her obstetrician ordered a blood transfusion, but she refused it based on her knowledge of the mysterious new infection that appeared to have contaminated the nation’s blood supply. Former Secretary of State John Kerry told the story at her April 2014 swearing-in as ambassador-at large and U.S. global AIDS coordinator, according to the Vote Smart transcript. “And literally, just before she passed out from pain, Debbi screamed, ‘Do not let them give me blood,’” Mr. Kerry said. “Her husband refused the transfusion, and it is a mighty good thing that he did. Because the hospital learned later that that the blood of her blood type — that they would have used — was contaminated with HIV.” The White House Coronavirus Task Force will benefit from Dr. Birx’s ability to “do things when there’s no infrastructure and no program,” said Dr. del Rio, an investigator with the Emory Center for AIDS Research. “I’ve never heard her say, we can’t do that. It’s always, we can do that,” he said. Millennials ‘will stop this virus’ An Army physician, she reached the rank of colonel before retiring from the military, helping lead the influential RV 144 HIV vaccine trial and winning two U.S. Meritorious Service Medals and the Legion of Merit Award, as cited in her State Department biography. Dr. Birx “has repeatedly demonstrated her unparalleled ability to control infectious diseases and is extremely well positioned to develop an effective plan to address COVID-19 in the United States of America,” said UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima in a Feb. 29 statement. The elderly, infirm and immuno-compromised have been identified as the most susceptible to the coronavirus, but Dr. Birx on Monday described millennials as “the core group that will stop this virus.” “Now why do I think the millennials are the key? Because they’re the ones that are out and about,” she said. “And they’re the most likely to be in social gatherings, and they’re the most likely to be the least symptomatic. And I think we’ve always heard about the greatest generation — we’re protecting the greatest generation right now, and the children of the greatest generation, and I think the millennials can help us tremendously.” Another reason: Millennials are adept at communicating with each other without being in each other’s presence. “They need to communicate with each other,” Dr. Birx said. “Public health people like myself don’t always come out with compelling and exciting messages that a 25-35-year-old may find interesting and something they would take to heart, but millennials can speak to one another about how important it is in this moment to protect all of the people.” Questions have been raised about the task force’s divided leadership, given that Mr. Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also oversee the panel, but Dr. Birx has played an increasingly visible role in fielding public-health questions at press briefings. She has a history with the panel’s other experts. On Monday, she deferred to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on a question about how long the virus can live on hard surfaces. “He was my mentor so I’m going to have to let him speak,” she said with a grin. Dr. Birx graduated from Houghton College and the Hershey School of Medicine at Pennsylvania State University. She has two daughters, Danielle and Devynn. Other task force members include U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Robert O’Brien, assistant to the president for national security affairs; Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun.

"Sen. Rand Paul says Uncle Sam should hold off on collecting taxes for a few months — and waive fees — as Americans attempt to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. The Kentucky Republican’s proposal elicited a wave of feedback Monday as the COVID-19 outbreak continued to disrupt and redefine daily life throughout the world. “Today I’m calling on the IRS to move our tax filing deadline from April 15 to July 15, and to waive any interest and fees for late payment,” Mr. Paul tweeted. “This will allow those who owe money not to have to send it during our current situation.” A sampling of the reactions include: Mr. Paul’s suggestion comes after an $8.3 billion coronavirus package passed Congress last week and as officials on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue were working on relief packages measured in the hundreds of billions. “Good teamwork between  Republicans & Democrats as the House passes  the big CoronaVirus  Relief Bill,” President Trump tweeted Saturday. “People really pulled together. Nice to  see!” Today I’m calling on the IRS to move our tax filing deadline from April 15 to July 15, and to waive any interest and fees for late payment.

"As chief of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, Vice President Mike Pence has upped his profile plenty on the public radar. Mr. Pence is also getting good reviews. “He’s a daily, consistent presence on the airwaves. He provides useful info rather than random digressions. He leans on health and medical experts — both at public events and behind the scenes,” write Axios co-founders Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei, in a review of this uncommon surge. It is his “presidential moment,” they say. “Pence, 60, a likely contender for the Republican nomination in 2024, has become one of the most praised administration officials during the virus crisis,” they note. Tech author Scott Galloway said the vice president had done a “reasonably good job” while Politico media columnist Jack Shafer said Mr. Pence “acted less like the ‘coronavirus czar’ and more like a good old-fashioned White House press secretary. He was calm. He was direct. He was polite in face of shouted, competing questions.” Mr. Pence’s chief of staff Marc Short tells Axios that the vice president “has an understanding of what people are looking for” — facts that are “straightforward, not alarmist.” “Most importantly, Pence seems on the level. The more Americans see of him, the more likely they are to believe what the administration says about this crisis, provided that Pence’s statements about the pandemic hold up over time,” advises Paul Mirengoff, a columnist at Powerline.com. REASSURING NEWS “Sixty-two percent of U.S. adults assess the strength of U.S. national defense as being ‘about right,’ two points off the record-high 64% from 1990. About twice as many say U.S. defense is not strong enough (25%) as say it is stronger than it needs to be (12%),” reports Gallup analyst Jeffrey M. Jones, who adds that the majority of Americans are also comfortable with the amount of military spending. “At a time when Americans are relatively satisfied with the strength of the U.S. military and the amount of military spending, 58% say the U.S. is No. 1 in the world militarily,” writes Mr. Jones.

As public alarm grows over the coronavirus health emergency, one veteran columnist has a simple panacea which could at least get the nation through the next month: Neutralize the bitter sparring between Democrats and President Trump. “It’s time to do something about our national divide. A 30-day political cease-fire is reasonable and doable. We must take a break from the hate,” writes New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin. “A month would be a good cooling-off period to allow the public-health emergency to take its rightful place at the top of the agenda without the distraction of personal sniping, which is especially demoralizing these days. In this environment, each attack smacks of pettiness and politics-as-usual. Partisanship has an important role in our enduring experiment with self-government, but not now. Now is the time for a united America to mobilize against a lethal scourge,” he continues. “A 30-day cease-fire would allow the entire nation to focus on saving lives and preventing further disaster to the economy and jobs. There would be plenty of time later to resume the political hostilities before the November election,” Mr. Goodwin advises. “An agreement would be nice, but isn’t necessary. All they need do is start behaving as Americans first and partisans second.” BORDERING ON INSANITY In the wake of the pared-down Democratic presidential field, one GOP official has a reminder. “Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are leading the Democrat Party’s charge for open borders. And they’re sounding like the same person: Biden has promised to end illegal immigration detention ‘across the board,’ and to not deport illegal immigrants who have committed felony-like offenses,” points out Steve Guest, rapid response communications director for the Republican National Committee. “Bernie backs a moratorium on all deportations of illegal immigrants in the U.S. and says that it is not ‘appropriate’ to deport illegal immigrants not following law in the U.S. And both Biden and Bernie support government health care for illegal immigrants. Bottom Line: While Bernie and Biden push for plans that would make the border crisis worse, President Trump’s deal with Mexico has achieved results,” Mr. Guest advises, citing a single Associated Press headline regarding the outcome of Mr. Trump’s productive call to Mexico to help with the illegal immigration challenge: “AP exclusive: Border apprehensions drop for eight straight months.” HELPFUL DIVERSION “Just because coronavirus has you avoiding public spaces doesn’t mean you can’t get cultured from home,” reports Fast Company analyst Lilly Smith, who shares all the details. “Google Arts & Culture has partnered with over 2,500 museums and galleries around the world, including Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum, London’s National Gallery, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

"Rep. Louie Gohmert could block the House’ final passage of the bipartisan coronavirus relief package Monday over concerns about last-minute updates to the bill. The House was set to make technical changes to the package on Monday before passing on a unanimous consent rule, which can be derailed by just one member. “I will not give my consent without first reading these very serious changes that will hopefully minimize bankruptcies caused by the virus rather than causing more,” Mr. Gohmert, Texas Republican, said in a statement. Mr. Gohmert said he has spoken to both House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and President Trump about his concerns. “My constituents did not elect the California delegation to represent them, they elected me — and that’s what I am trying to do,” he said. After a feverish 48 hours of negotiations, the House passed a massive relief package just after midnight Saturday to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers. It mandates free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those who contract the virus or need to care for someone that does if they’re at a company with fewer than 500 employees. The bill also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, such the elderly and schoolchildren and bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, who helped craft the White House-approved package with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, acknowledged Sunday there were technical changes that needed to be made before it even reached the Senate. He said he was speaking with senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, on Saturday about the bill. “We are hearing feedback that certain small businesses are concerned about the burden of this,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “I think there’s a lot of bipartisan support. We hope they pass this bill. If not, we’ll work with the center on whatever minor changes we need.” The Senate will take up the House bill once handed over and is working in the meantime to pass FISA reauthorization and reform after it lapsed Sunday.

"President Trump implored Americans Monday to avoid groups of 10 or more and enjoy takeout instead of stepping foot in restaurants, bars and food courts for the next 15 days, as the U.S. tries to avoid the fate of China or Italy in the fight against the coronavirus. His guidelines, which rely on public cooperation, say Americans should avoid discretionary travel and stay home if they are sick. Mr. Trump also wants everyone to learn or work at home, where possible, to disrupt chains of transmission. “We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it,” Mr. Trump said. It’s a sudden shift in tone from Mr. Trump, who in late February predicted the U.S. would tackle all of its cases swiftly. He now says the outbreak may last well into the summer. The White House guidelines are stiffer than ones the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released less than 24 hours earlier and come as governors and mayors enforce mandatory rules, such as shuttering schools, delaying primary voting and ordering restaurants, gyms and theaters to close outright. San Francisco and six area counties took the most stringent measures to date, saying residents can only leave home for necessities for the next three weeks, starting Tuesday. The lockdown applies to San Francisco, Marin, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa counties and the city of Berkeley. The federal, state and local moves reflect a more urgent phase in the fight against the coronavirus that’s sickened more than 4,000 in the U.S. and killed over 70, although nationwide testing is just getting started. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It infected tens of thousands in the surrounding Hubei Province before the epidemic shifted to other nations. It’s now spreading on six continents, particularly Europe. Authorities in Italy and Spain have locked down their entire populations, except for trips to work or grocery stores. France joined them on Monday. “We are at war,” French President Emmanuel Macron told the nation. Mr. Trump said he is not considering a nationwide lockdown because parts of the country aren’t seeing widespread transmission. “At this point, they shouldn’t worry,” Mr. Trump said. “We may look at certain areas, certain hotspots. We’ll be looking at that.” Mr. Trump said parts of New York, notably the suburb of New Rochelle, should be “tamped down even more” after Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, ordered a mile-wide lockdown in the town because of rapid transmission. Earlier Monday, Mr. Cuomo suggested the administration was at fault for not being explicit about quarantine measures. He said a patchwork of state-by-state rules is unworkable. “If the federal government isn’t going to do what it should do, then the states have to try their best,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference in Albany. He also called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to step in and retrofit buildings like college dorms and surplus property to function as hospitals in his state. He said there are 50,000 hospital beds and 3,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds in New York, and they might be overwhelmed. “You look at any of these projections and you see that coming,” he told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Mr. Trump said he told governors Monday to get things like ventilators through their own supply chains if they can get them faster than the federal government. In some ways, the press conference marked a pivot for Mr. Trump, as he highlighted health measures and the virus itself, instead of the financial fallout and Wall Street. He said markets would take care of themselves, and that airlines losing revenue would be taken care of at a later date. “We have an invisible enemy, we have a problem a month ago nobody thought about,” Mr. Trump said. “This is a bad one. This is bad in the sense of it’s so contagious. Sort of record-setting type contagion. My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything will fall into place.” Yet Mr. Trump continued to buck responsibility for hiccups in the response. He said he’d rate his efforts “a 10,” though a lack of testing has been an embarrassing blind spot in the U.S. response. Administration officials said they are entering a “new phase” of testing that taps commercial labs and makes it more available, with some areas opening drive-through service. The World Health Organization on Monday said testing is one of the most critical parts of the fight. “The most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate,” WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said. “You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.” The U.S. made progress in another critical area Monday — the race for a vaccine to the new coronavirus. The National Institutes of Health said it administered an investigational vaccine to a person as it kickstarts a phase-one trial at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. Scientists plan to enroll 45 healthy adults ages 18 to 55 and try out various dosages of the vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1273. It was developed by scientists at the infectious-disease arm of the National Institutes of Health and biotech company Moderna, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with [the new coronavirus] is an urgent public health priority,” said Anthony S. Fauci, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.” The vaccine model uses what’s known as messenger RNA and has shown promise in animal studies, but hasn’t been used on humans. This trial will test various dosages of the investigation vaccine. There is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19, and scientists say it could take a year to a year and a half before there is a shot for widespread use. While the world waits for an antidote, officials are imploring Americans to disrupt the spread of the disease through “social distancing,” in which people stay home when possible or six feet apart in public. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pushed to delay in-person voting from Tuesday to early June, saying it couldn’t in good conscience expose poll workers or invite crowds to its primary election. “I’m making this recommendation because we must also look out for our poll workers,” the Republican tweeted. “I believe when we look back on this, we’ll be happy we did this. The votes that have already been cast will still be counted — and this recommendation would allow others to vote in the future.” Governors across the northeast, meanwhile, decided to temporarily shutter bars, theaters and other public places late Monday, saying a lack of federal direction and public indifference to local transmission gave them no choice. Mr. Hogan defended his sweeping measures, saying he couldn’t afford to wait. “While these measures may seem extreme, if we do not take them now, it could be too late,” the governor said. Cancelations also rolled across official Washington on Monday. First Lady Melania Trump said Monday she decided to scrap the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on April 13 out of an “abundance of caution.” “The health and safety of all Americans must be the first priority, especially right now,” said First Lady Melania Trump. “I deeply regret this cancellation, but we need to make difficult decisions in the short-term to ensure a healthy country for the long-term.” The Supreme Court announced Monday it would postpone its next sitting for oral arguments due to the COVID-19 spread, saying it would look at the calendar to reschedule at a later time. The court was expected to hear cases from March 23 through April 1 but decided to put off the challenges for now. “The Court will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances,” a spokesperson announced in a press release. Some of the most eyed cases that were scheduled during that period were disputes over Congress’s authority to subpoena banking documents and other private financial records from Mr. Trump’s businesses, as well as a challenge over the validity of a subpoena out of New York to obtain the president’s tax returns. The justices were also set to hear a case involving Google, which weighs the issue of copyright protection. There was also a First Amendment dispute scheduled to be argued involving employment discrimination cases brought against religious employers. Moving the hearings is quite rare, though it has happened in the past. The court postponed arguments in 1918 during the Spanish flu epidemic. The press release also noted calendars at the court were changed in August 1793 and in 1798 over yellow fever. • Alex Swoyer contributed to this report.

"Voters like the idea of making legal immigrants pay their own way, and they are also keen on letting people sue sanctuary cities for crimes committed by illegal immigrants — both parts of President Trump’s immigration agenda — according to surprising polling numbers from Harvard University. Nearly four in five voters like the idea of an “immigration halt” with the coronavirus becoming a pandemic. Less popular is the move by a number of Democrat-led states such as New York to issue driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. Only about one-third of voters polled said people in the country without authorization should be allowed to apply for a license. The results of the Harvard Center for American Political Studies/Harris Poll suggest that Mr. Trump’s immigration policies have strong backing among the public at large, even though they are derided as racist or unfair in Washington and among Democratic leaders. “This should definitely be a warning, especially to Biden because he’s going to be the nominee, that going too far left is a real danger for him,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director at the Center for Immigration Studies. “I’m not even sure what he was thinking last night. He’s got the nomination. Why cater to the most radical anti-borders elements in his party?” Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, in a debate Sunday with Sen. Bernard Sanders, his chief opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, proposed shutting down all deportations for 100 days and then deporting only illegal immigrants with further felonies on their records. He also said he will cancel immigration detention for people awaiting court hearings if he wins the White House. He flatly said local police should not cooperate in turning over illegal immigrants to federal immigration authorities. “Xenophobia is a disease,” said Mr. Biden, condemning what he called “this demonization and divisiveness coming from the Trump administration on immigration.” The Harvard/Harris poll found immigration policy to be the second most important issue for voters, behind health care and ahead of terrorism and national security. When it comes to Mr. Trump, 49% said they approved of the president’s handling of immigration. That is at the high range of the past few years, with Harvard/Harris showing approval hovering between 44% and 49%. During his State of the Union address this year, Mr. Trump called for punishing sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal officials by allowing people victimized by illegal immigrants to sue the sanctuaries for damages. That idea earns 55% support, according to Harvard/Harris, though the pollsters asked the question without mentioning that Mr. Trump supports it. The same was true with a question on whether the government should deny green cards to immigrants who are likely to end up on the public dole. The Trump administration this year implemented a rule to do just that, and the Harvard/Harris poll said 60% support it — again, without Mr. Trump’s name attached to it. Immigrant rights activists have labeled that policy racist. They say it will hinder poor migrants from developing nations in Africa trying to achieve the American dream and reward those from richer nations in Europe. Mr. Krikorian said asking without the president’s name meant the pollsters were able to find Americans’ views without any Trump bias. He said there are probably people who would be hawkish on immigration, such as opposing sanctuary cities, though they dislike Mr. Trump. If told the president backed a crackdown, they might have a different answer to the polling question. “Because Trump’s name isn’t on there, people were giving answers based on what they actually thought policy should be rather than what is associated with the president,” he said. The Washington Times reached out to several immigrant rights activists about the numbers. They either didn’t respond or declined to tackle the questions. Mr. Trump has tied immigration to the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis, and the polling suggests Americans agree. A stunning 79% told the pollsters that an “immigration halt” should be imposed if the outbreak grows into a pandemic. On the other side of the ledger, voters resoundingly rejected the idea of issuing driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants, with 65% opposed and just 35% in favor. Immigration activists argue that illegal immigrants are on the roads anyway, and it makes more sense to license them and require them to have insurance. Fourteen states plus the District of Columbia have moved to grant licenses to those in the country without authorization, according to the National Council of State Legislatures. New York became the latest to offer licenses in December with its Green Light law. New Jersey will become the 15th state when its law takes effect in June.

"Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said late Monday that the state department of health will order polls to be closed on Tuesday as a “health emergency,” hours after a judge declined to delay the state’s March 17 presidential primary at the behest of Mr. DeWine. Mr. DeWine, a Republican, said that to conduct an election Tuesday would force poll workers and voters to place themselves “at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus.” He tweeted that Dr. Amy Acton, who heads the Ohio Department of Health, “will order the polls closed as a health emergency.” “While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State @FrankLaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,” Mr. DeWine said. Dr. Acton signed a three-page order saying that all polling locations in the state would be closed “to avoid an imminent threat with a high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19 with a significant risk of substantial harm to a large number of people in the general population.” The order said she had authority under Ohio code to “make special orders…for preventing the spread of contagious or infectious diseases.” The action came hours after Franklin County Judge Richard Frye denied a motion to push in-person voting to June 2 amid concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, saying such a move could set a terrible precedent. After the ruling, Mr. DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a joint statement saying that given the circumstances, “it simply isn’t possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by Ohioans.” “They mustn’t be forced to choose between their health and exercising their constitutional rights,” the statement said. Earlier in the day, Judge Frye had said that decision wasn’t his to make, saying he was “very reluctant” to “say well, we’ll have a judge in Columbus rewrite the election code, reset the election for some arbitrary date in the future and upset the apple cart in a terrible precedent.” Mr. DeWine spoke as voters in Ohio, Arizona, Florida, and Illinois were preparing to head to the polls to cast their ballots in a race that has been upended by concerns over the coronavirus that is changing the daily lives of millions of Americans. President Trump, who said on Monday that Americans should avoid gatherings of more than 10 people for the next 15 days as part of the coronavirus response, said postponing elections is a state matter but that he generally isn’t a fan. “I think postponing elections is not a very good thing,” Mr. Trump said. “They have lots of room in a lot of the electoral places … I think postponing is unnecessary.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday that elections can be done in a way that protects people. “We’ve limited access to the assisted living facilities in some of the areas where we may have vulnerable folks,” Mr. DeSantis said. “But at the same time, when you go and cancel that, the signal that that sends is somehow we’re paralyzed. And I don’t think that’s the case. I think we’re taking prudent steps.” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said Monday that officials understand voters might be apprehensive, but the election would proceed as planned. “This decision was not made lightly, and what it all comes down to is — that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,” Ms. Hobbs said. “The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this will become.” A spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections likewise said the state primary was proceeding as planned, saying the elections team has been working with public health officials and has made every effort to keep voters up to date on polling place location changes. Dan Kovats, executive director of the Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association, said Illinois has done a good job encouraging early voting and voting by mail over the last few cycles. “I believe we will have everything in place to ensure a legitimate primary election,” Mr. Kovats said. He said his group, in concert with the state Democratic Party, launched a large-scale texting program Monday morning to inform voters of changes in their polling locations and that he thought more than 300 precincts have had such changes. Officials in all four states already had been struggling to convince poll workers to show up and grappling with polling locations getting cut back or changed amid the escalating outbreak. Before Mr. Trump’s announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had issued guidance late Sunday recommending that the public avoid gatherings of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. In Florida, some local officials had already said they were short of where they wanted to be in terms of attracting enough workers to man the polls Tuesday in light of COVID-19. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, Florida Democrat, said Monday the state should have followed Ohio’s lead and pushed back its Tuesday election as well. “We need to protect the rights of all our citizens to safely have their voices heard,” Ms. Mucarsel-Powell tweeted, as she also expressed concern about reports of a lack of mail ballots in South Dade County. In Arizona, Maricopa County was planning to close dozens of polling locations because of COVID-19. “The closure of many polling places due to COVID-19 means it is uncertain how many voters who planned to vote on Tuesday will actually show up,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday his state will push its primary from May 19 to June 23, become the latest state leader to announce such a change. Louisiana and Georgia have already postponed their primaries that had been scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, and the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico said it was going to push for a delay in its March 29 primary.

"The Republican primary for the Kansas Senate seat has become uglier as Kris Kobach has emerged as the front-runner to succeed retiring Sen. Pat Roberts. The conservative Club for Growth has mounted a new advertising campaign attacking rival candidate Rep. Roger Marshall over his alleged poor treatment of female patients as a doctor. Mr. Kobach, Kansas’ former secretary of state, is a longtime ally of President Trump, but many Republicans are worried he would lose the Senate race, as he lost his gubernatorial bid in 2018. Mr. Kobach held a double-digit percentage point lead on Mr. Marshall, his nearest competitor, in a February McLaughlin & Associates poll. The free-market advocacy group is spending about $33,000 on a print and digital ad campaign accusing Mr. Marshall of “poor treatment of women” as an obstetrician/gynecologist. The anti-Marshall ads ran in several newspapers with large circulations in the state, including the Kansas City Star, Topeka Capital Journal and Wichita Eagle. “Online public reviews of [Mr. Marshall‘s] dealings with patients suggest his treatment of women was not received positively in far too many instances,” the print ad reads above quotations branding the candidate as “arrogant” and “insensitive.” “Are these reports accurate? What’s the truth? What was your — or your loved one’s — experience with Dr. Marshall?” The digital effort includes RogerMarshallTruth.com, which features criticism from women posted anonymously. The Club for Growth is soliciting other women to come forward with negative stories about Mr. Marshall. “Several of Dr. Marshall’s patients have raised important concerns about their treatment while under his care,” David McIntosh, Club for Growth Action president, said in a statement. “We think Kansas voters deserve to hear what these women have said, and if other women have similar stories, we hope they speak out as well.” Mr. Marshall’s campaign said he would ignore the attack ads and focus on talking with Kansans about “real issues.” “Slinging amateur garbage from a D.C. office during a national pandemic isn’t surprising coming from these losers,” said Brent Robertson, Marshall campaign spokesman, in a statement. “While we understand that they have a 2016 campaign grudge, they put the Senate majority at risk by doing the dirty work of fellow loser Kris Kobach.” The group is not the only one attacking Mr. Marshall’s candidacy. Free Forever PAC has spent $70,000 to air ads on Fox News opposing Mr. Marshall, according to the Kansas City Star. The group, which is bankrolled by billionaire Peter Thiel, is also running ads on Facebook criticizing Mr. Marshall as an unreliable supporter of Mr. Trump because of his previous support for former Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s failed 2016 presidential bid. While Mr. Kobach has a reliable supporter in Mr. Thiel, he has far fewer friends in the Republican Party establishment. The Club for Growth is not supporting Mr. Kobach’s bid and has not endorsed a candidate. The National Republican Senatorial Committee said in July that Mr. Kobach’s candidacy would “simultaneously put President Trump’s presidency and [the] Senate majority at risk.” No Democrat has won a Senate seat in Kansas since the 1930s, but the food fight on the right has proven useful for Democrats looking to expand the map of targeted states in November. State Sen. Barbara Bollier, a retired physician, is the Democratic front-runner to compete for the open seat. A former Republican who switched parties and identifies herself a “pragmatic Democrat,” she figures to make health care and the coronavirus crisis a central aspect of the campaign. The Club for Growth declined to say whether it had discussed the race with potential candidates and said its interviews are “confidential.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a former Kansas congressman, has reportedly ruled out running for the seat.

"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden has been declared the winner of last week’s Democratic presidential primary in Washington state, giving him victories in five out of six states that voted March 10. After nearly a week of counting votes, the former vice president on Monday held onto a small lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that turned out to be insurmountable. Washington was a state that Sanders had been hoping to win. In 2016, he won more than two-thirds of the delegates from the Washington caucuses over Hillary Clinton. Of the state’s 89 pledged delegates, only 31 are allocated based on the statewide result. The remaining 58 are determined based on the results of the state’s 10 congressional districts, and those results might not be calculated until the election is certified by the secretary of state’s office, which could be as late as March 27. Biden won four other states last Tuesday: Missouri, Mississippi, Michigan and Idaho. Sanders won North Dakota. In Washington, Democrats used he vote-by-mail presidential primary – moved up this year from May – for the first time to allocate delegates instead of the smaller caucuses used in previous years. Four states – Arizona, Ohio, Illinois and Florida – are scheduled to hold primaries on Tuesday.

"The Justice Department filed a motion Monday to dismiss charges against Concord Management and Consulting, a Russian company accused of bankrolling schemes to meddle in the 2016 election. Federal prosecutors said in a court filing that pursuing the case could expose American law-enforcement methods they’d prefer to keep under wraps. “The risk of exposure to law enforcement’s tools and techniques, and the post-indictment change in the proof available at trial, the balance of equities has shifted,” they wrote. “It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution.” Concord had been using the case as a means to gather intelligence about how the United States combats foreign election interference, the prosecutors alleged. “Concord has been eager and aggressive in using the judicial system to gather information about how the United States detects and prevents foreign election interference,” the filing said. It is a stunning reversal that just weeks before the case was set to head to trial. Concord Management was among 13 Russian individuals and two companies charged in 2018 by former special counsel Robert Mueller. The government said they used social media to sow discord and spread disinformation to undermine the 2016 election. Concord Management, owned by Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, is accused of bankrolling a Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency. It was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. Mr. Prigozhin was nicknamed “Putin’s Chef” for his close relationship with the Russian president. Although others ignored the charges, Concord fought Mr. Mueller’s team in court. But instead of defending itself, Concord used the case as a means to obtain secret information about how the government detected the purported meddling. Prosecutors worried about sharing in discovery a trove of documents with Concord that detailed government sources and methods. Fears that Concord will make the information public were raised by prosecutors in earlier court filings. Several non-classified documents that prosecutors turned over to Concord’s defense team ended up on a website last fall, angering the Justice Department. All told, more than a thousand files were posted on the website, prosecutors said. At the time, the documents were even promoted on a newly-created Twitter account hyping the material as access to Mr. Mueller’s secret database. Prosecutors said Monday such tricks made the case run counter to the government’s interests, especially given its limited ability to punish a Russian corporation. “The government has concluded that further proceedings as to Concord, a Russian company with no presence in the United States and exposure to a meaningful punishment in the event of a conviction, promotes neither the interests of justice nor the nation’s security,” they wrote.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department is moving to drop charges against two Russian companies that were accused of funding a social media campaign to sway American public opinion during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Prosecutors said they concluded that a trial, against a corporate defendant with no presence in the United States and no prospect of meaningful punishment even if convicted, would likely expose sensitive law enforcement tools and techniques, “potentially undermining their effectiveness.” Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering were among three companies and 13 individuals charged in 2018 by special counsel Robert Mueller in a conspiracy to spread disinformation on social media during the 2016 presidential race. The effort was aimed at dividing American public opinion and sowing discord in the electorate, officials said.  The case was one of the signature indictments from Mueller’s two-year Russia investigation. Together with a separate case against Russian government hackers accused of breaking into Democratic email accounts, it revealed a sweeping Russian effort to influence, or interfere in, the race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Concord was the sole defendant in the case to enter an appearance in Washington’s federal court and contest the allegations. The case had been set for trial next month, making the government’s filing all the more abrupt. Concord is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as “Putin’s chef” for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been hit with U.S. sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 election and is charged alongside his company in the indictment brought by Mueller. The company, with the help of a high-powered law firm, filed a series of motions over the last two years, including to dismiss charges and to exclude certain evidence from the case.  In January 2019, prosecutors alleged that confidential material from the Russia investigation, which had been handed over to defense attorneys for Concord, was altered and disseminated as part of a disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the special counsel’s Russia investigation. The files surfaced online in a link posted by a pro-Russia Twitter account. But the Justice Department stopped short of accusing Concord of leaking the material. Still, prosecutors argued that the company’s request to have sensitive new evidence sent to Russia “unreasonably risks the national security interests of the United States.”  Some of the court appearances in the case have been unusually contentious, with the federal judge overseeing it chastising a lawyer for Concord, Eric Dubelier, for references in court filings to Looney Tunes and the 1978 raunchy comedy “Animal House” to criticize the Mueller investigation. “I’ll say it plain and simply: Knock it off,” U.S District Judge Dabney Friedrich told Dubelier at a January 2019 court appearance. Dubelier, who has referred to the case as involving a “made up” crime, has made allegations of prosecutorial misconduct and even once accused the judge of bias. The judge rejected the allegation. But with the case approaching trial, prosecutors said they had to weigh the risk of potentially exposing sensitive national security information against the benefits of continuing with the case against a company that likely wouldn’t face any significant punishment in the U.S.  In the court filing on Monday, prosecutors said Concord had been “eager and aggressive in using the judicial system to gather information about how the United States detects and prevents foreign election interference.”  “In short, Concord has demonstrated its intent to reap the benefits of the Court’s jurisdiction while positioning itself to evade any real obligations or responsibility,” prosecutors wrote. “It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution.”  Concord Catering did not have attorneys appear in court, but prosecutors said they would seek to drop charges against that company as well because it too was controlled by Prigozhin and “based on the likelihood that its approach to litigation would be the same as Concord.” Prosecutors vowed to continue to pursue their case against the 13 Russians who were named in Mueller’s indictment, along with the troll farm that Concord was alleged to have funded, the Internet Research Agency.

"An Ohio judge on Monday denied a motion to push in-person voting in the state’s presidential primary past March 17, after Gov. Mike DeWine had said earlier in the day he was advocating a delay because of concerns over the expanding coronavirus outbreak. Franklin County Judge Richard Frye said he was “very reluctant” to “have a judge in Columbus rewrite the election code, reset the election for some arbitrary date in the future and upset the apple cart in a terrible precedent.” Pending any potential appeal, the ruling means that Ohio’s presidential primary is on for Tuesday despite Mr. DeWine’s last-minute overture. Judge Frye said there are too many factors to balance in the “uncharted territory” of taking things away from the legislature and elected statewide officials and throwing things to “a common pleas court judge in Columbus with 12 hours to go until the election.” Mr. DeWine had acknowledged earlier in the day that he couldn’t unilaterally move the election, but had expressed hope that a judge would grant a favorable ruling to a legal petition. “We cannot conduct this election, in-person voting, for 13 hours…and conform to [federal] guidelines,” Mr. DeWine said. “It is therefore my recommendation…that voting be extended until June 2nd.”  ",Judge rejects Ohio bid to delay primary,"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/judge-richard-frye-rejects-ohio-primary-delay/,washington_times
"WASHINGTON (AP) -  The U.S. Senate has voted to extend, rather than tweak, three surveillance powers that federal law enforcement officials use to fight terrorists, passing the bill back to an absent House and throwing the future of the authorities in doubt.  The 75-day extension pushes off the debate over the surveillance tools as Congress attempts to deal with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. It is not yet clear whether the House will accept the temporary extension of the surveillance powers, which lapsed on Sunday. The House last week passed a compromise bill negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy that would renew the authorities and impose new restrictions. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed the measure, but longtime skeptics of the surveillance tools in the Senate blocked a quick passage.  The House legislation would update the three expiring surveillance provisions, including one that permits the FBI to obtain court orders to collect business records on subjects in national security investigations. Another, known as the “roving wiretap” provision, permits surveillance on subjects even after they’ve changed phones. The third allows agents to monitor subjects who don’t have ties to international terrorism organizations.  The legislation would scale back some current authorities, such as the government’s access to certain records. It would also attempt to put stronger checks on some surveillance measures and make the process more transparent.  The compromise reflects angst in both parties about the way the surveillance powers have been used, but also a reluctance to strip those powers from the government’s arsenal. Republicans and Democrats in the House broadly agreed that they did not want civil liberties sacrificed in efforts to thwart terrorism and other crimes.  It is unclear whether the House will vote on the Senate extension, which would make no changes to the authorities during the 75 days. A Democratic aide said that House leadership was discussing how to move forward, as the House is on recess and has no set date for returning.  The Senate passed the extension by voice vote Monday after days of negotiations between McConnell and Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. The chamber had originally been scheduled to take a procedural vote to move forward on the House legislation, a step that would have set up final passage for later in the week. It’s not clear whether McConnell had enough votes for the House bill to pass.  McConnell said Monday evening that the Senate would eventually consider the House bill and several amendments, conceding to the demands from the three senators. The amendments would impose restrictions beyond the House bill on the government’s ability to surveil and gather information on Americans.  Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., speaking on the floor for McConnell, objected to that same deal last week, saying the Senate should pass the House bill. But there appeared to be more urgency to put off the surveillance issue Monday as coronavirus cases spiked in the United States and the economic damage mounted.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders emerged from the 2016 election and his strong challenge to eventual nominee Hillary Clinton believing the Democratic Party was at a tipping point, ready for his brand of democratic socialism. It’s increasingly apparent that he misread the voters. After a couple of early wins, Mr. Sanders has fallen on tough times in the Democratic primary, watching former Vice President Joseph R. Biden rocket past him, both in terms of state wins and the chase for delegates. Mr. Biden is poised for another big night Tuesday as voters in Arizona, Florida and Illinois vote in the Democratic primary — all states where Mr. Sanders trails badly in polling. Ohio is also slated to hold its primary, though the governor petitioned a court Monday for a postponement amid coronavirus fears. Analysts said it’s not that primary voters are rejecting Mr. Sanders‘ ideas, but they have a different goal in mind right now than policies like Medicare for All. “There is a great concern among Democrats about ensuring that Donald Trump is a one-term president and I think the Democratic establishment, and the media, has done a good job educating voters that if your goal is to beat Trump, Sanders is the candidate who is probably the least likely to help you achieve that goal,” said Mark P. Jones, political science professor at Rice University in Houston. Even voters who might agree with Mr. Sanders on policy see him as a tougher candidate for the party to sell to the nation. “That is certainly the case in Texas, where even many very progressive Democrats view Sanders as a nightmare for their broader goals of turning Texas purple, flipping the Texas House, having a seat at the redistricting table in 2021 and removing Donald Trump from The White House,” Mr. Jones said. It’s apparently the case in places like Michigan, where Mr. Sanders won the 2016 primary by scoring big in rural areas and overcoming Mrs. Clinton’s lead in Detroit. For liberal activists, that was proof that white working class voters were more excited about rallying behind the Sanders‘ revolution than they were in getting behind Mrs. Clinton’s more “moderate” vision. Last week, though, Mr. Biden easily carried the state — including the rural areas. “Bernie was making the fatal assumption that all of the 40 something percent of the vote that he got in the [2016] primary was favorable to his brand of progressivism,” said John Couvillon, a pollster. “I think the bigger question was how much of that was a visceral reaction to Hillary Clinton because what happened in Michigan didn’t just end in the primary. It continued on to the general election when Donald Trump upset Hillary Clinton there.” Mr. Sanders 2020 rejection in Michigan came even though 57% of primary voters told exit polling they backed Mr. Sanders‘ marquee idea of a “Medicare for All” government-run health care system. That also was true in states from Mississippi to Maine, where strong majorities said they liked Medicare for All — but rejected Mr. Sanders in favor of Mr. Biden. Nina Turner, national co-chair for the Sanders‘ campaign, described the trend as “the damnedest thing.” “It really doesn’t make sense. The world is really upside down,” Ms. Turner said. “The senator worked so hard for what four years ago seemed like it was impossible — for his vision for this country to be in the mainstream. And now his vision for the country is mainstream, and people are voting the other way.” “The forces of the status quo have been effective in portraying the two-term vice president as a pillar and really villainizing the senator,” she said. Meanwhile, Neil Sroka, spokesman for the progressive PAC Democracy for America, agreed that Mr. Sanders‘ benefited from running against Mrs. Clinton, but disagreed with the notion that his camp learned the wrong lessons of 2016. “No, we read it right,” Mr. Sroka said. “What has become clear is that, because of the media environment and because of elite opinion, a lot of voters have voted in this race as pundits, most have put punditry ahead of passion and ultimately made a decision essentially rooted in fear of re-electing Donald Trump more than in their preferred vision of the future.” On the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders acknowledges he’s losing the electability debate, even as he says he’s won on the ideas. “I cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said, ‘I like what your campaign stands for, I agree with what your campaign stands for, but I am going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,’” Mr. Sanders said at a press conference in Vermont last week. “We have heard that statement all over the country.” “Needless to say, I disagree with that assertion,” he said. He says that to beat Mr. Trump, the Democratic nominee must tap into new voters, reaching record turnout. He predicted that would happen in the primaries — but to a large extent, it has not. While Mr. Sanders has outperformed Mr. Biden among younger voters, they’ve not surged in turnout, according to exit polling. In just one state, Iowa, have they accounted for a larger share of the Democratic primary vote than they did in 2016. Meanwhile, 11 of the states where exit polling was conducted have seen a spike in the percentage of older people that turned out. That has been good news for Mr. Biden, who has been far and away the top choice of greying voters.

"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on China’s Communist Party to halt disinformation spread by propaganda outlets claiming the novel coronavirus was first spread in China by the U.S. Army. Mr. Pompeo made the comments in a phone call Monday to Yang Jiechi, director of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the Communist Party of China. The secretary “conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,” according to a statement issued by the State Department. “The secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat.” Mr. Yang, according to state-run Chinese television, told Mr. Pompeo that any attempt to smear China for its efforts to counter the coronavirus “will not succeed,” Reuters reported. The Chinese senior diplomat also threatened unspecified retaliation about what he said were efforts by U.S. politicians to denigrate China’s efforts to fight the virus. The exchange is the latest in Washington and Beijing’s growing war of words about the virus. White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien had harsh criticism in remarks last week to The Heritage Foundation for China’s early handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Mr. O’Brien said that instead of using best practices for handling new diseases, “this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up.” Doctors who sought to disclose the virus were imprisoned or silenced, he added. “It probably cost the world community two months to respond, and those two months … could have dramatically curtailed what happened in China and what is now happening across the world,” he said. First hints of disinformation Zhong Nanshan, a senior Chinese government scientist, first hinted in a late February press conference that the virus may not have originated in China. Last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian promoted the conspiracy theory on Twitter by saying the virus was brought to China by the U.S. Army. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” Mr. Zhao tweeted. He urged people to read an article in a Canadian publication known for spreading Russian disinformation that claimed the Army had spread the virus in China. “Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” China’s ambassador to South Africa retweeted the post and called it “more evidence” that the virus was “not so-called ‘made in China.’” Some U.S. lawmakers have urged the Trump administration to launch a more aggressive campaign to counter Beijing’s narrative. Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, denounced what he called a “shameless new chapter in China’s cynical campaign to control its own image.” “America has worked to assist all countries — China very much included — suffering from this pandemic,” he said in an op-ed on Breitbart.com. “But we cannot stand by as Beijing’s lies result in economic decline and in lives threatened across the world.” Chinese officials initially said the virus originated from a wild food market in Wuhan. However, some of the first people who contracted the flulike disease were not associated with the Wuhan seafood market that was thought to be the source. Health researchers believe the virus originated in bats, jumped to another wild animal and then spread to humans. Wuhan, however, is the location of China’s sole high-security biological research lab that is known to study coronaviruses, leading to speculation that the virus may have escaped from the laboratory through an infected worker or a lab animal sold to the market. Uneven response Prior to Mr. Pompeo’s statement, the State Department privately dressed down Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai over suspected disinformation efforts related to the pandemic. David Stillwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs delivered a diplomatic protest Friday, and Mr. Cui was later shown leaving the department in a video that went viral. President Trump, who has said the pandemic was caused by a “foreign virus,” has also sought to play down the controversy. He told reporters, “I did read one article, but I don’t think that article was representative — certainly not of my conversations with President Xi — and they know where it came from. We all know where it came from.” Lea Gabrielle, director of the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which is charged with countering foreign disinformation, told The Washington Times on Sunday that the Chinese are “engaged in an all-out aggressive campaign to try to reshape the global narrative around the coronavirus, essentially to the degree of trying to provide an alternate reality of what has actually happened since December.” She offered no specifics but said China’s propaganda efforts have “caused us to have to react with a full-spectrum activation of our own public messaging and diplomatic engagement, and really just having to push access to fact-based information by our own communicators so they’re able to counter these false narratives with local audiences.” Michael Pillsbury, a China analyst with the Hudson Institute and unofficial adviser to President Trump, said the Chinese were using disinformation techniques learned from the Soviet Union during the Cold War, including a false report uncovered by U.S. officials claiming that the U.S. Army created AIDS, he said. “There’s a social science theory that if you get your story out first, you get that first impression,” Mr. Pillsbury said on Fox News. “That’s what the Chinese seem to be doing.” Mr. Pillsbury said China is also pushing the argument that it is “racist” to call the coronavirus the Chinese virus or the Wuhan virus. “They’ve also gone further by telling stories that there were American soldiers [in China] for a competition, creating doubt about our motives,” Mr. Pillsbury said. Spotlight on China Christian Whiton is a former U.S. government official who has studied the use of foreign disinformation. “I can understand why Secretary Pompeo doesn’t want to get in a tit for tat with a mere Foreign Ministry spokesman, but we’re missing a great opportunity to spotlight China’s lies and force people to ask why they are resorting to disinformation, and what that says about the stability of Xi Jinping’s government,” Mr. Whiton said. Retired Navy Capt. Jim Fanell, a former Pacific Fleet intelligence director, said Chinese state-run media are continuing to spread the disinformation on a U.S.-origin of the virus. “The demarche appears to have had no impact given the several articles used today from PRC state-sponsored press organs that continue to spout this lie,” he said. “Our public diplomacy, which never recovered from the elimination of the U.S. Information Agency after the Cold War, is still a confused mess,” he said. “It brings to mind a quote by David Lloyd George about the intelligence bureaucracy: ‘It appears in the budget at quite a substantial figure, but when it comes to information it is not visible.’” Rich Higgins, a former National Security Council staff member in charge of strategic communication, said the entire global pandemic is the result of the Chinese Communist Party’s effort to cover up the initial outbreak and refuse to allow outside specialists into the country. “The U.S. government needs to expose and reinforce the [Communist Party‘s] culpability in the current situation to the American public, the Chinese people and the international community,” Mr. Higgins said. “In addition, the U.S. government needs to specifically call out the media interests in the United States that are busily parroting CCP talking points during this crisis.”  ",'Alternate reality': U.S. demands China halt coronavirus 'disinformation',"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/us-demands-china-halt-coronavirus-propaganda/,washington_times
"NEW YORK (AP) - A Florida man charged with conspiring with associates of Rudy Giuliani to make illegal campaign contributions claims prosecutors shouldn’t get to use electronics he mailed to lawyers in the case against him, but prosecutors disagreed Monday. Prosecutors said in papers filed in Manhattan federal court that they legally obtained a hard-copy notebook and electronic devices belonging to David Correia last October. They said Correia tried to mail them to his lawyers before flying to New York to surrender, apparently to avoid having them seized when he was arrested. Prosecutors obtained a warrant for the package and seized it, according to a letter prosecutors sent to Judge J. Paul Oetken. Correia’s claim that the materials are protected by attorney-client privilege is meritless, prosecutors said. They noted that a separate “filter team” of prosecutors supervised by senior prosecutors not handling the case were reviewing the materials to separate anything that was privileged. Correia, of West Palm Beach, Florida, has pleaded not guilty. He’s among four men charged with arranging illegal contributions to politicians to aid their political and business interests. Prosecutors said Correia was involved in a scheme to make illegal campaign donations to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada and other states in an attempt to get support for a new recreational marijuana business. Two other men charged in the case, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, worked with Giuliani to try and get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Democrat Joe Biden. They have both pleaded not guilty to charges. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who has served as a legal adviser to President Donald Trump, has said he had no knowledge of illegal donations and hadn’t seen any evidence that Parnas and Fruman did anything wrong. The judge, at the request of prosecutors, ordered defense lawyers to make any claims to block use of the electronic evidence by March 23. A message left with Correia’s lawyer for comment was not immediately returned.

"EL PASO, Texas (AP) - U.S. immigration courts sharply scaled back operations Monday but have stopped well short of a total shutdown demanded by employees, including judges and government attorneys. Wearing face masks, about 30 asylum seekers who had been waiting in Mexico were escorted by authorities into a federal building in El Paso, Texas, some carrying children.  They reported, as instructed, to a border crossing at 4 a.m. Monday and were driven to the court in white vans. Journalists were barred from the courtroom on the grounds that it was too crowded. A lawyer who attended said the judge appeared by video conference, and few, if any migrants wore masks once the hearing began.  “All of the benches are taken up,” Imelda Maynard said. “Most of the children are asleep in their parent’s arms.” The Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review late Sunday postponed preliminary hearings for people who aren’t in custody through April 10. While significant, the order doesn’t extend to courts in immigration detention centers or to the government’s “Migrant Protection Protocols” policy to make asylum seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in the U.S. It also didn’t apply to final hearings which determine whether migrants are granted asylum. The announcement came hours after judges and attorneys called for all courts to close for two to four weeks. “The (Justice Department) is failing to meet its obligations to ensure a safe and healthy environment within our Immigration Courts,” read a joint statement by the National Association of Immigration Judges, the American Immigration Lawyers Association and the American Federation of Government Employees Local 511, which represents Homeland Security Department attorneys.  Some asylum-seekers in the program known informally as “Remain in Mexico” live in squalid conditions outside in the Mexican border city of Matamoros. Others live in crowded migrant shelters in Mexico. The number of people on a typical day in immigration court exceeds 50, said Elise Wilkinson, a Houston-area immigration attorney. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday recommended  that the public avoid gatherings larger than 10 people over the next 15 days.  The judge’s union pressed Monday for additional action.  Judge Samuel Cole, speaking in his capacity as union spokesman, faulted lack of planning for “the current disaster of mismanagement and ad hoc decisions.”  “It is indefensible how they have placed people’s lives in danger,” he said. Of the decision to stick with “Remain in Mexico” hearings, the judges union said on Twitter, “The risks are simply too high.”  ___ Associated Press writers Nomaan Merchant in Houston and Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report.

"President Trump suggested Monday that he’d be open to making some changes to the House-passed coronavirus bill. “They’re [the Senate] working to only enhance it and make it better and make it fair for everybody,” he said. “We may go back and forth a bit with the House on it but both will be in a very positive fashion.” The bill still needs to be passed with some technical changes in the House on Monday before it even reaches the Senate — though attempting to pass the updates with a unanimous consent rule can be derailed by just one member. After a feverish 48 hours of negotiations, just after midnight on Saturday, the House passed a massive relief package to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers. It mandated free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone that does if they’re at a company with less than 500 employees. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, who helped craft the White House-approved package with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on Sunday acknowledged there were technical changes that needed to be made before it even reached the Senate. He said he was speaking with senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, on Saturday about the bill. “We are hearing feedback that certain small businesses are concerned about the burden of this,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “I think there’s a lot of bipartisan support. We hope they pass this bill. If not, we’ll work with the center on whatever minor changes we need.”  ",Trump floats changes to House coronavirus bill,"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/donald-trump-floats-house-coronavirus-bill-changes/,washington_times
"President Trump implored Americans Monday to avoid groups of 10 or more and enjoy takeout instead of stepping foot in restaurants, bars and food courts for the next 15 days, as the U.S. tries to avoid the fate of China or Italy in the fight against the coronavirus. His guidelines, which rely on public cooperation, say Americans should avoid discretionary travel and stay home if they are sick. Mr. Trump also wants everyone to learn or work at home, where possible, to disrupt chains of transmission. “We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it,” Mr. Trump said. It’s a sudden shift in tone from Mr. Trump, who in late February predicted the U.S. would tackle all of its cases swiftly. He now says the outbreak may last well into the summer. The White House guidelines are stiffer than ones the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released less than 24 hours earlier and come as governors and mayors enforce mandatory rules, such as shuttering schools, delaying primary voting and ordering restaurants, gyms and theaters to close outright. San Francisco and six area counties took the most stringent measures to date, saying residents can only leave home for necessities for the next three weeks, starting Tuesday. The lockdown applies to San Francisco, Marin, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa counties and the city of Berkeley. The federal, state and local moves reflect a more urgent phase in the fight against the coronavirus that’s sickened more than 4,000 in the U.S. and killed over 70, although nationwide testing is just getting started. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It infected tens of thousands in the surrounding Hubei Province before the epidemic shifted to other nations. It’s now spreading on six continents, particularly Europe. Authorities in Italy and Spain have locked down their entire populations, except for trips to work or grocery stores. France joined them on Monday. “We are at war,” French President Emmanuel Macron told the nation. Mr. Trump said he is not considering a nationwide lockdown because parts of the country aren’t seeing widespread transmission. “At this point, they shouldn’t worry,” Mr. Trump said. “We may look at certain areas, certain hotspots. We’ll be looking at that.” Mr. Trump said parts of New York, notably the suburb of New Rochelle, should be “tamped down even more” after Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, ordered a mile-wide lockdown in the town because of rapid transmission. Earlier Monday, Mr. Cuomo suggested the administration was at fault for not being explicit about quarantine measures. He said a patchwork of state-by-state rules is unworkable. “If the federal government isn’t going to do what it should do, then the states have to try their best,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference in Albany. He also called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to step in and retrofit buildings like college dorms and surplus property to function as hospitals in his state. He said there are 50,000 hospital beds and 3,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds in New York, and they might be overwhelmed. “You look at any of these projections and you see that coming,” he told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Mr. Trump said he told governors Monday to get things like ventilators through their own supply chains if they can get them faster than the federal government. In some ways, the press conference marked a pivot for Mr. Trump, as he highlighted health measures and the virus itself, instead of the financial fallout and Wall Street. He said markets would take care of themselves, and that airlines losing revenue would be taken care of at a later date. “We have an invisible enemy, we have a problem a month ago nobody thought about,” Mr. Trump said. “This is a bad one. This is bad in the sense of it’s so contagious. Sort of record-setting type contagion. My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything will fall into place.” Yet Mr. Trump continued to buck responsibility for hiccups in the response. He said he’d rate his efforts “a 10,” though a lack of testing has been an embarrassing blind spot in the U.S. response. Administration officials said they are entering a “new phase” of testing that taps commercial labs and makes it more available, with some areas opening drive-through service. The World Health Organization on Monday said testing is one of the most critical parts of the fight. “The most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate,” WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said. “You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.” The U.S. made progress in another critical area Monday — the race for a vaccine to the new coronavirus. The National Institutes of Health said it administered an investigational vaccine to a person as it kickstarts a phase-one trial at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. Scientists plan to enroll 45 healthy adults ages 18 to 55 and try out various dosages of the vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1273. It was developed by scientists at the infectious-disease arm of the National Institutes of Health and biotech company Moderna, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with [the new coronavirus] is an urgent public health priority,” said Anthony S. Fauci, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.” The vaccine model uses what’s known as messenger RNA and has shown promise in animal studies, but hasn’t been used on humans. This trial will test various dosages of the investigation vaccine. There is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19, and scientists say it could take a year to a year and a half before there is a shot for widespread use. While the world waits for an antidote, officials are imploring Americans to disrupt the spread of the disease through “social distancing,” in which people stay home when possible or six feet apart in public. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pushed to delay in-person voting from Tuesday to early June, saying it couldn’t in good conscience expose poll workers or invite crowds to its primary election. “I’m making this recommendation because we must also look out for our poll workers,” the Republican tweeted. “I believe when we look back on this, we’ll be happy we did this. The votes that have already been cast will still be counted — and this recommendation would allow others to vote in the future.” Governors across the northeast, meanwhile, decided to temporarily shutter bars, theaters and other public places late Monday, saying a lack of federal direction and public indifference to local transmission gave them no choice. Mr. Hogan defended his sweeping measures, saying he couldn’t afford to wait. “While these measures may seem extreme, if we do not take them now, it could be too late,” the governor said. Cancellations also rolled across official Washington on Monday. First lady Melania Trump said Monday she decided to scrap the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on April 13 out of an “abundance of caution.” “The health and safety of all Americans must be the first priority, especially right now,” Mrs. Trump said. “I deeply regret this cancellation, but we need to make difficult decisions in the short-term to ensure a healthy country for the long-term.” The Supreme Court announced Monday it would postpone its next sitting for oral arguments due to the COVID-19 spread, saying it would look at the calendar to reschedule at a later time. The court was expected to hear cases from March 23 through April 1 but decided to put off the challenges for now. “The Court will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances,” a spokesperson announced in a press release. Some of the most eyed cases that were scheduled during that period were disputes over Congress’s authority to subpoena banking documents and other private financial records from Mr. Trump’s businesses, as well as a challenge over the validity of a subpoena out of New York to obtain the president’s tax returns. The justices were also set to hear a case involving Google, which weighs the issue of copyright protection. There was also a First Amendment dispute scheduled to be argued involving employment discrimination cases brought against religious employers. Moving the hearings is quite rare, though it has happened in the past. The court postponed arguments in 1918 during the Spanish flu epidemic. The press release also noted calendars at the court were changed in August 1793 and in 1798 over yellow fever. • Alex Swoyer contributed to this report.

"Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said late Monday that the state department of health will order polls to be closed on Tuesday as a “health emergency,” hours after a judge declined to delay the state’s March 17 presidential primary at the behest of Mr. DeWine. Mr. DeWine, a Republican, said that to conduct an election Tuesday would force poll workers and voters to place themselves “at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus.” He tweeted that Dr. Amy Acton, who heads the Ohio Department of Health, “will order the polls closed as a health emergency.” “While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State @FrankLaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,” Mr. DeWine said. Dr. Acton signed a three-page order saying that all polling locations in the state would be closed “to avoid an imminent threat with a high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19 with a significant risk of substantial harm to a large number of people in the general population.” The order said she had authority under Ohio code to “make special orders…for preventing the spread of contagious or infectious diseases.” The action came hours after Franklin County Judge Richard Frye denied a motion to push in-person voting to June 2 amid concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, saying such a move could set a terrible precedent. After the ruling, Mr. DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a joint statement saying that given the circumstances, “it simply isn’t possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by Ohioans.” “They mustn’t be forced to choose between their health and exercising their constitutional rights,” the statement said. Earlier in the day, Judge Frye had said that decision wasn’t his to make, saying he was “very reluctant” to “say well, we’ll have a judge in Columbus rewrite the election code, reset the election for some arbitrary date in the future and upset the apple cart in a terrible precedent.” Mr. DeWine spoke as voters in Ohio, Arizona, Florida, and Illinois were preparing to head to the polls to cast their ballots in a race that has been upended by concerns over the coronavirus that is changing the daily lives of millions of Americans. President Trump, who said on Monday that Americans should avoid gatherings of more than 10 people for the next 15 days as part of the coronavirus response, said postponing elections is a state matter but that he generally isn’t a fan. “I think postponing elections is not a very good thing,” Mr. Trump said. “They have lots of room in a lot of the electoral places. … I think postponing is unnecessary.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday that elections can be done in a way that protects people. “We’ve limited access to the assisted living facilities in some of the areas where we may have vulnerable folks,” Mr. DeSantis said. “But at the same time, when you go and cancel that, the signal that that sends is somehow we’re paralyzed. And I don’t think that’s the case. I think we’re taking prudent steps.” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said Monday that officials understand voters might be apprehensive, but the election would proceed as planned. “This decision was not made lightly, and what it all comes down to is — that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,” Ms. Hobbs said. “The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this will become.” A spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections likewise said the state primary was proceeding as planned, saying the elections team has been working with public health officials and has made every effort to keep voters up to date on polling place location changes. Dan Kovats, executive director of the Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association, said Illinois has done a good job encouraging early voting and voting by mail over the last few cycles. “I believe we will have everything in place to ensure a legitimate primary election,” Mr. Kovats said. He said his group, in concert with the state Democratic Party, launched a large-scale texting program Monday morning to inform voters of changes in their polling locations and that he thought more than 300 precincts have had such changes. Officials in all four states already had been struggling to convince poll workers to show up and grappling with polling locations getting cut back or changed amid the escalating outbreak. Before Mr. Trump’s announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had issued guidance late Sunday recommending that the public avoid gatherings of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. In Florida, some local officials had already said they were short of where they wanted to be in terms of attracting enough workers to man the polls Tuesday in light of COVID-19. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, Florida Democrat, said Monday the state should have followed Ohio’s lead and pushed back its Tuesday election as well. “We need to protect the rights of all our citizens to safely have their voices heard,” Ms. Mucarsel-Powell tweeted, as she also expressed concern about reports of a lack of mail ballots in South Dade County. In Arizona, Maricopa County was planning to close dozens of polling locations because of COVID-19. “The closure of many polling places due to COVID-19 means it is uncertain how many voters who planned to vote on Tuesday will actually show up,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday his state will push its primary from May 19 to June 23, become the latest state leader to announce such a change. Louisiana and Georgia have already postponed their primaries that had been scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, and the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico said it was going to push for a delay in its March 29 primary.

"Stocks plunged again on Monday to wipe out nearly all of the three-year-long Trump rally, while U.S. airlines reeling from the coronavirus pandemic asked for $50 billion in federal aid and the White House weighed an economic rescue plan that is likely to top $800 billion. President Trump conceded the U.S. could be headed into a recession, but he predicted the markets would surge once the crisis subsides. “It may be,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re not thinking in terms of recession. We’re thinking in terms of the virus.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 2,997 points, or 12.9%, to close at 20,188. It was the Dow’s single biggest point drop in history. That’s more than 30% off its high just last month of 29,568. When Mr. Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, the Dow stood at 19,827. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 12.3%, while the S&P 500 was down 11.9%. Stocks fell so rapidly at the opening bell that the drop triggered an automatic temporary halt in operations for the third time in the past six trading days. The massive market losses, worst on a percentage basis since 1987, came despite the Federal Reserve’s emergency actions on Sunday to lower interest rates and pump more money into the economy to combat the impact of the coronavirus. The Fed on Sunday slashed interest rates by a full percentage point to zero, and said it would buy $700 billion in Treasury securities in a massive emergency move to protect the U.S. economy from the pandemic. Analysts increasingly are predicting a recession.

"Ronald Klain, an adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s presidential campaign, on Tuesday questioned Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s move to order the polls closed in his state’s presidential primary contest. Mr. Klain did compliment Mr. DeWine for his efforts on responding to the coronavirus outbreak, saying he’s been one of the “leading governors” and that it’s not a partisan issue. “[I’m] a little worried that this was done in defiance of a court order and that the state didn’t pursue this through the courts as it should have,” Mr. Klain, who coordinated the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak, said on CNN’s “New Day.” “I understand why Gov. DeWine did what he did, but I think we can have both public health and democracy,” Mr. Klain said. “I just think we have to make sure we’re doing these things the right way,” he continued. “The fact that the court ordered him not to do this, and he didn’t appeal that order [was] a little concerning.” Mr. DeWine said late Monday that Amy Acton, who heads the Ohio Department of Health, was ordering the polls closed as part of a health emergency. That announcement came after Franklin County Judge Richard Frye had turned aside a request to delay in-person voting in the March 17 primary at the behest of Mr. DeWine. The governor had acknowledged earlier in the day that he couldn’t unilaterally move the election and that he hoped for a favorable ruling from a judge. Dr. Acton’s order said she had authority under state code to “make special orders … for preventing the spread of contagious or infectious diseases.” Mr. Biden has been comfortably leading Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont in public polling on Ohio, as well as in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Those three states are pressing forward with their presidential primaries on Tuesday. A delay in voting in Ohio, coupled with the news that states like Georgia and Louisiana have postponed their primaries that were supposed to happen in the coming weeks, adds additional uncertainty to a race Mr. Biden is leading. The developments could give Mr. Sanders an incentive to hang around in the race longer than he might otherwise. After Sunday’s debate, Mr. Sanders said it was a valid question as to whether Tuesday’s primaries should be postponed. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people, doing all that stuff,” Mr. Sanders said on CNN. “Does that make a lot of sense? [I’m] not sure that it does.”  ","Ronald Klain, Joe Biden's campaign adviser, questions Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine's move to close polls"," -

"The Ohio Supreme Court overnight Tuesday turned aside a challenge that sought to keep some polls open for the state’s March 17 elections, after the state’s director of public health ordered them closed in light of the coronavirus outbreak. The complaint was filed on behalf of Corey Speweik, who is running for a seat on the Wood County Court of Common Pleas. It argues that changing the primary date would violate the “bedrock separation of powers” in the state constitution and that it would cause “chaos” for independent candidates. The decision, agreed to by four of the seven justices, simply read “writ denied.” Mr. Speweik had tried to get the court to compel Secretary of State Frank LaRose to hold the Wood County primary on March 17. In response, lawyers for the state said Mr. LaRose has no “clear legal duty” to heed the request and pointed out that Amy Acton, who heads the Ohio Department of Health, issued an order requiring that polls be closed on March 17. “The Secretary will not violate a clear legal duty by complying with an order from Ohio’s Health Director during a pandemic,” they said. Gov. Mike DeWine said late Monday that the polls would be closed due to a “health emergency,” capping a madcap day after a Franklin County judge had denied a request to push back in-person voting in Ohio just hours earlier. The complaint had cited comments from Mr. DeWine and Mr. LaRose at a Monday press conference where they had pushed for a delay in in-person voting. Those comments came before Franklin County Judge Richard Frye’s ruling and before Dr. Acton ordered the polls closed late Monday. Mr. DeWine and Mr. LaRose said people shouldn’t be forced to choose between protecting their health and exercising their constitutional right to vote in light of the expanding coronavirus epidemic. “It was simply untenable for us to continue telling Ohioans to go to the polls,” Mr. LaRose said Tuesday on CNN’s “New Day.” Mr. LaRose issued a directive to county boards of elections saying that the presidential primary is suspended until June 2. The directive says that boards of elections are to remain open on March 17 through 7:30 p.m. to receive any absentee ballots, but that they’re prohibited from tabulating and reporting any results until the close of polls on June 2. Asked what happens if things aren’t better by June 2, Mr. LaRose said: “That’s a bridge we’ll have to cross when we get to it.” Three other states are proceeding with their presidential primaries on Tuesday: Arizona, Florida and Illinois.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. Senate has voted to extend, rather than tweak, three surveillance powers that federal law enforcement officials use to fight terrorists, passing the bill back to an absent House and throwing the future of the authorities in doubt.  The 75-day extension pushes off the debate over the surveillance tools as Congress attempts to deal with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. It is unclear whether the House will accept the temporary extension of the surveillance powers, which lapsed on Sunday. The House last week passed a compromise bill negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy that would renew the authorities and impose new restrictions. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed the measure, but longtime skeptics of the surveillance tools in the Senate blocked a quick passage.  The House legislation would update the three expiring surveillance provisions, including one that permits the FBI to obtain court orders to collect business records on subjects in national security investigations. Another, known as the “roving wiretap” provision, permits surveillance on subjects even after they’ve changed phones. The third allows agents to monitor subjects who don’t have ties to international terrorism organizations.  The legislation would scale back some current authorities, such as the government’s access to certain records. It would also attempt to put stronger checks on some surveillance measures and make the process more transparent.  The compromise reflects angst in both major political parties about the way the surveillance powers have been used, but also a reluctance to strip those powers from the government’s arsenal. Republicans and Democrats in the House broadly agreed that they did not want civil liberties sacrificed in efforts to thwart terrorism and other crimes.  It is unclear whether the House will vote on the Senate extension, which would make no changes to the authorities during the 75 days. A Democratic aide said that House leadership was discussing how to move forward, as the House is on recess and has no set date for returning.  The Senate passed the extension by voice vote Monday after days of negotiations between McConnell and Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. The chamber had originally been scheduled to take a procedural vote to move forward on the House legislation, a step that would have set up final passage for later in the week. It’s not clear whether McConnell had enough votes for the House bill to pass.  McConnell said Monday evening that the Senate would eventually consider the House bill and several amendments, conceding to the demands from the three senators. The amendments would impose restrictions beyond the House bill on the government’s ability to surveil and gather information on Americans.  Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., speaking on the floor for McConnell, objected to that same deal last week, saying the Senate should pass the House bill. But there appeared to be more urgency to put off the surveillance issue Monday as coronavirus cases spiked in the United States and the economic damage mounted.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin is expected to meet with Senate Republicans Tuesday to discuss an $850 billion coronavirus relief package including aid for hard-hit industries. White House aides say the package could include more than $50 billion for airlines, about $500 billion in payroll tax cuts and $250 billion or more in Small Business Administration loans. The U.S. airline industry said it has lost about one million passengers in the first two weeks of March alone, compared with the same period a year ago. President Trump said Monday the pandemic, which has closed many businesses and schools across the country, could push the nation into a recession. The stock market suffered huge losses Monday, falling more than 12% to wipe out nearly all the gains since Mr. Trump was inaugurated. Markets were up slightly in early trading Tuesday.

"A spokesman for Sen. Bernard Sanders’ presidential campaign on Tuesday said that going to the polls in primaries amid the coronavirus outbreak is a “personal” choice and that they will respect the decisions of the public either way. The campaign is not doing traditional “get out the vote” outreach in states holding primary contests on Tuesday, said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca. “We are making clear to voters that we believe going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision, and we respect whichever choice they make,” Mr. Casca said. Ohio officials late Monday blew past a court order and ordered the polls closed on Tuesday, with plans to delay in-person voting until June 2 in light of the health risks the coronavirus is posing. Arizona, Florida and Illinois, meanwhile, are proceeding with their presidential primary contests on Tuesday, though officials are dealing with polling site closures and relocations because of COVID-19. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said there’s no guarantee that there would be a safer time to hold the election in the near future. “The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this will become,” she said on Monday. Mr. Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden have adjusted by pivoting to virtual events in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Biden is expected to increase his delegate lead over Mr. Sanders after Tuesday’s primaries, though other states have already moved to postpone their own contests as well, adding a dose of uncertainty to the contest.

"Yankton Daily Press & Dakotan, March 16 Proactive steps to combat COVID-19 Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. And that’s certainly what we are seeing and enduring as America and the world ramp up their response to the COVID-19 coronavirus that’s racing across the planet. The situation has been months in the making, and some countries have prepared relatively better than others. America is now working overtime in a feverish hope to catch up and minimize the damage as much as possible. We are seeing drastic steps that are literally touching every aspect of life across the country, across South Dakota and Nebraska, and in Yankton and every community in the region. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has called off school for the coming week (at least), and the Board of Regents did the same for state universities. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts on Friday mentioned the possibility of closing schools in that state for 6-8 weeks, if necessary. Indeed, events are being postponed or canceled in wholesale terms, from small local meetings to entire professional sports leagues and the NCAA “March Madness” college basketball tournaments. The NAIA basketball tournaments in Sioux Falls (for the men) and Sioux City (women) were canceled outright after the first day of action. The South Dakota Class B girls’ basketball tournament in Spearfish was postponed after the first round, and this coming weekend’s tournaments have also been postponed. Church service schedules are being altered. Even funerals are being delayed until the situation looks better. These are dramatic steps. But they are also important steps. They are strongly proactive in an attempt to slow the spread of the contagion, to protect as many people as possible and to avoid a crushing onslaught of patients on medical facilities, which would impact all medical care, even for non-COVID-19 patients. It’s part of what’s called “flattening the curve.” Much of it falls under the label of “social distancing,” which is actually not a new concept at all - just one expanded to societal terms. This purpose is to create isolation and separation to slow the spread of the virus. In spirit, it’s quite sensible. But in implementation, it is radical and will have a serious impact in other areas for some time to come. This is going to take a serious financial toll on a number of fronts, and states, cities and businesses must face those formidable battles. For instance, the cancellation of sporting events, which may seem minor to some people, will have major consequences on the cities and states that host these events, the vendors and other workers who make their livings from those events and so on. In effect, our nation is being asked to step back from its normal routines, and this will be tough for many people. It’s forcing us to re-think some things we do, in terms big and small. The consequences, either way you look at it, will be difficult. The debate over how we got here will be an important one, but the decisions we make in regard to what we do now are the most pressing. The government needs to do what it needs to do. And each of us needs to do what we must for the general good and health for both ourselves and those we know and love. It’s a battle we WILL ultimately win - and as was pointed out during a press conference of Yankton’s COVID-19 task force last week, if we fight this fight well enough, it will seem like we overreacted. So be it. Let’s make the fight worth it. ___ Madison Daily Leader, March 10 Government works better when open to citizens This week (March 15-21) marks the 15th Sunshine Week, a time to stress the importance of open government policies at all levels. The terms “Sunshine” suggests opening up government to the light of day. Sunshine Week started after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on America, when there was a rush to close off government information to the public. Tim Franklin, associate dean of the journalism school at Northwestern University, said the shutting down of access to public records and public meetings was based on the “misguided, and sometimes cynical, notion that Americans are safer the less they know about what the government is doing in their name and with their money.” That sounds a bit harsh, but we’re surprised how often we hear a phrase like “we don’t want the public to know this,” or “the public won’t understand this if we tell them.” At worst, we’ve heard “let’s not tell the public because it might cause a panic.” That’s what happened just recently in some countries with the coronavirus outbreak. Not surprisingly, we believe instead in the public’s right to know. A government “of the people” is not a private business owned by someone. Local governments are owned by citizens/taxpayers. We elect officials to conduct our business, but they still report to us as citizens. We deserve to have input into their decisions, open discussion about their decisions, and a permanent record of how they spend our money. We deserve to know what is going on in public schools. We want to be in the room when a zoning change is proposed in our neighborhood. We all need to be vigilant in asking for, and insisting on, open records, meetings and discussions. ___ Aberdeen American News, March 14 No more denying the uncertainty of COVID-19 If you’re not acknowledging the problem by now, you are part of the problem. The problem is, of course, COVID-19. And it’s real. There are many questions with unknown answers. And that’s what makes this such a slippery slope. That’s what’s sparking uncertainty and, in some cases, fear. That’s what makes this different from other viruses in the past. We hope, a few weeks or months from now, everything happening - closed schools, canceled events, travel restrictions, the shutdown of sports leagues - will look like wild overreactions. That’s the best-case scenario. But whether we reach that point, it’s too early to tell. In the meantime, here are some and inarguable facts to chew on: - After initially downplaying the COCID-19 outbreak, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency Friday. - That was hours after Gov. Kristi Noem did the same for the state. She wasn’t nearly as stubborn as the president. That said, the decision to kick media members out of a COVID-19 meeting earlier this week did nothing to instill trust. - The NCAA didn’t pull the plug on March Madness and give up hundreds of millions of dollars to make the president look bad. Or to inconvenience you. Nor did the other sports leagues that have paused their seasons act with those motives. Get over that kind of thinking. It’s petty, dangerous and foolish. No, all of these steps - the unprecedented actions - were made for our protection. Protection. Protection. Protection. And that is all. So stop looking for other reasons. That’s why South Dakota schools will be closed next week. That’s why college campuses will be empty next week. That’s why the state basketball tournaments have been postponed. That’s why there’s virtually nothing that’s not vital happening next week. Now it’s for all of us to help. And that’s the easy part. Because it involves some simple steps we’ve been hearing about for weeks: - Wash your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds. (You should have been doing this all along.) - Cover your mouth with your arm or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. - If you don’t feel good, stay home. Work remotely if you can or have to. - And avoid crowds if you are pregnant, older or have a weakened immune system. - Keep high-traffic and high-germ areas clean. - Oh, and don’t hoard toilet paper and sanitizer. Take what you need and leave some for the next shopper. This is not a fun time. It’s stressful and sometimes scary. Nobody is enjoying it. Not the government. Not the media. Not people making difficult decisions. Maybe, months from now, when with a little luck we are all looking back on this moment, we’ll see overreaction. Maybe the pandemic has peaked and it will start to backslide in the days to come. There’s no way to know. And that’s the reason for such drastic action. If we don’t encounter more problems, though, remember this time. Because the tough decisions being made now might be a big reason why.

"Voters like the idea of making legal immigrants pay their own way, and they are also keen on letting people sue sanctuary cities for crimes committed by illegal immigrants — both parts of President Trump’s immigration agenda — according to surprising polling numbers from Harvard University. Nearly four in five voters like the idea of an “immigration halt” with the coronavirus becoming a pandemic. Less popular is the move by a number of Democrat-led states such as New York to issue driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. Only about one-third of voters polled said people in the country without authorization should be allowed to apply for a license. The results of the Harvard Center for American Political Studies/Harris Poll suggest that Mr. Trump’s immigration policies have strong backing among the public at large, even though they are derided as racist or unfair in Washington and among Democratic leaders. “This should definitely be a warning, especially to Biden because he’s going to be the nominee, that going too far left is a real danger for him,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director at the Center for Immigration Studies. “I’m not even sure what he was thinking last night. He’s got the nomination. Why cater to the most radical anti-borders elements in his party?” Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, in a debate Sunday with Sen. Bernard Sanders, his chief opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, proposed shutting down all deportations for 100 days and then deporting only illegal immigrants with further felonies on their records. He also said he will cancel immigration detention for people awaiting court hearings if he wins the White House. He flatly said local police should not cooperate in turning over illegal immigrants to federal immigration authorities. “Xenophobia is a disease,” said Mr. Biden, condemning what he called “this demonization and divisiveness coming from the Trump administration on immigration.” The Harvard/Harris poll found immigration policy to be the second most important issue for voters, behind health care and ahead of terrorism and national security. When it comes to Mr. Trump, 49% said they approved of the president’s handling of immigration. That is at the high range of the past few years, with Harvard/Harris showing approval hovering between 44% and 49%. During his State of the Union address this year, Mr. Trump called for punishing sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal officials by allowing people victimized by illegal immigrants to sue the sanctuaries for damages. That idea earns 55% support, according to Harvard/Harris, though the pollsters asked the question without mentioning that Mr. Trump supports it. The same was true with a question on whether the government should deny green cards to immigrants who are likely to end up on the public dole. The Trump administration this year implemented a rule to do just that, and the Harvard/Harris poll said 60% support it — again, without Mr. Trump’s name attached to it. Immigrant rights activists have labeled that policy racist. They say it will hinder poor migrants from developing nations in Africa trying to achieve the American dream and reward those from richer nations in Europe. Mr. Krikorian said asking without the president’s name meant the pollsters were able to find Americans’ views without any Trump bias. He said there are probably people who would be hawkish on immigration, such as opposing sanctuary cities, though they dislike Mr. Trump. If told the president backed a crackdown, they might have a different answer to the polling question. “Because Trump’s name isn’t on there, people were giving answers based on what they actually thought policy should be rather than what is associated with the president,” he said. The Washington Times reached out to several immigrant rights activists about the numbers. They either didn’t respond or declined to tackle the questions. Mr. Trump has tied immigration to the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis, and the polling suggests Americans agree. A stunning 79% told the pollsters that an “immigration halt” should be imposed if the outbreak grows into a pandemic. On the other side of the ledger, voters resoundingly rejected the idea of issuing driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants, with 65% opposed and just 35% in favor. Immigration activists argue that illegal immigrants are on the roads anyway, and it makes more sense to license them and require them to have insurance. Fourteen states plus the District of Columbia have moved to grant licenses to those in the country without authorization, according to the National Council of State Legislatures. New York became the latest to offer licenses in December with its Green Light law. New Jersey will become the 15th state when its law takes effect in June.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic-controlled House, with President Trump’s support, early Saturday passed a bill to provide free testing for the coronavirus, as well as paid sick and family leave, strengthened unemployment insurance and increased food aid to ease the hardship on families. The vote was 363-40. The legislation will be taken up by the Senate next week. It would require paid leave for workers who contract the virus or who care for those who do and additional food aid for the poor and senior citizens. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, it causes more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus. The legislation includes: FREE CORONAVIRUS TESTING It requires private health insurance plans to provide free coronavirus testing and waives cost-sharing rules for testing provided to people covered by Medicare, Medicaid and federal retirement programs. Another $1 billion is provided to test people without health insurance. It boosts federal matching funds to state Medicaid programs by 6.2% to ease the financial strain on states. PAID SICK/FAMILY LEAVE It establishes a temporary coronavirus-related sick leave benefit paid by employers with fewer than 500 workers. Workers with the coronavirus would receive 100% or their wages if they have the coronavirus or are self-isolating and two-thirds of their pay when caring for family members. The benefit would expire in January 2021. It also permits 12 weeks of job-protected family or medical leave at two-thirds pay, though the first 14 days of the extended leave would be unpaid. In both cases, businesses would be reimbursed by the federal government through a refundable tax credit. FOOD AID It provides $1.3 billion in emergency food aid for low-income pregnant women and their young children, senior citizens and food banks. It allows states to provide food stamps to make up for lost school lunch benefits if their children are kept home from school and directs $100 million of the funds to U.S. territories. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak are already eligible for unemployment benefits, but the legislation provides $1 billion for additional caseloads and administrative costs to encourage temporarily furloughed workers to obtain unemployment benefits. PROTECTION FOR FIRST RESPONDERS The Occupational Safety and Health Administration would be required to issue a temporary rule requiring increased protections against the coronavirus.

"The federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., granted a request by House Democrats Friday to rehear cases over testimony from former White House Counsel Don McGahn and funds for President Trump’s border wall. Both cases are scheduled to be argued before the full circuit court on April 28. Democratic lawmakers in Congress have argued the president violated federal law by reallocating more than $8 billion from the Department of Defense to build the border wall. They also claim Mr. Trump abused his authority by denying the lawmakers from receiving testimony from Mr. McGahn during the impeachment inquiry.

"The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is calling on the Trump administration to “admit” that its ongoing pressure campaign against Iran is not working. The comments from Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, came just days after Iranian-backed military group Kata’ib Hezbollah launched an attack on a base north of Baghdad that killed two U.S. service members and one British soldier and wounded 14 others. The U.S. responded Thursday evening with airstrikes on five of the group’s weapons storage facilities that the Pentagon says “will degrade Kata’ib Hezbollah’s ability to conduct future strikes.” In a statement Friday evening, Mr. Menendez, the ranking member of the committee, said “that in attributing Wednesday’s attacks to Iranian-backed militia groups, the Trump Administration must admit its efforts to deter Iranian aggression are failing and American service members are paying the ultimate sacrifice.” The escalation in tension between Washington and Tehran quickly resurfaced just as the House approved a war powers resolution aimed at limiting the president’s authority to use force against Iran without explicit congressional approval. The bill — while expected to be vetoed by President Trump — “directs the President to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces for hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran or any part of its government or military, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force against Iran.” Mr. Menendez highlighted the bipartisan support for the resolution that allowed it to be approved by the Republican-held Senate and said this majority “has made clear it does not support an unnecessary war with Iran.”  ",Menendez calls on Trump to admit Iranian deterrence efforts are failing,"Friday, March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/13/menendez-calls-on-trump-to-admit-iranian-deterrenc/,washington_times
"In his quest to regain a Senate seat he once held, Jeff Sessions may have lost the endorsement he most coveted — the president’s — but he is racking up stamps of approval from many players in the conservative establishment. On Friday, the National Rifle Association backed Mr. Sessions’ bid to return to the Senate, an uphill fight in which the former attorney general trailed one time Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville in the March 3 primary. The two are now heading into a March 31 Republican runoff. The NRA’s backing came just two days after President Trump gave Mr. Tuberville his enthusiastic endorsement, driving a final stake through any pretension Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions maintained a political alliance or friendship. In Mr. Trump’s eyes, Mr. Sessions committed an unforgivable betrayal when, shortly after he got the attorney general position, he recused himself from the investigation into fraudulent charges the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. That led to the appointment of a special prosecutor who packed his office with supporters of Hillary Clinton and generally haunted the first three years of the Trump administration. No evidence of collusion was ever found. Nevertheless, the Sessions campaign has crafted itself as Trump loyalists, all behind a conservative lawmaker who could advance the president’s agenda better than a political neophyte and Alabama carpetbagger like Mr. Tuberville. “Powerful, well-funded national forces are bent on destroying our right to keep and bear arms,” Mr. Sessions said. “Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are working day and night to gut the Second Amendment. I have fought Schumer and Pelosi on this issue, and I have won, and I will do so again when I return to the Senate. “Alabama cannot afford to send an untested, unproven, weak-kneed greenhorn to the Senate who will get run over by Schumer and Pelosi,” Mr. Sessions added. Jason Ouimet, who heads the NRA’s Political Victory Fund, said endorsing Mr. Sessions was an easy choice. “Based on your strong leadership on Second Amendment issues as a U.S. senator and U.S. attorney general, you have earned the highest attainable rating, an A+ from NRA-PVF,” Mr. Ouimet said in the announcement. The winner of the Tuberville-Sessions runoff will face Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in November. Mr. Jones, who rode to office on a tide of out-of-state money in a 2017 special election to replace Mr. Sessions, is rated the most vulnerable senate incumbent by most political analysts. The myriad endorsements Mr. Sessions has collected reflect how the conservative establishment trusts him after he spent decades in Washington as a rock-ribbed Republican. Earlier this week, Mr. Sessions garnered support from the Eagle Forum PAC, which joined the endorsements from the Family Research Council PAC, the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, the Alabama Forestry Association and several conservative luminaries in the Yellowhammer state. But the establishment’s muscle may be hard pressed to push Mr. Sessions over the hurdle of Mr. Trump’s endorsement of his opponent, and the fact the March 3 primary saw a plurality of voters prefer either Mr. Tuberville or Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne who finished third.

"Count Sen. Bernie Sanders among the people who think President Trump should get tested for the coronavirus. During a press conference in Burlington, Vt., Mr. Sanders was asked whether Mr. Trump should get tested and release those results after reportedly  being around people who have been diagnosed with the virus. “I would,” Mr. Sanders said. “To the best of my knowledge I have not been in proximity to somebody who had the virus. If I knew that I was, I would get tested, and I think that holds true for the president.” During a press conference at The White House Friday, Mr. Trump said he sees no reason for that to happen because he has not exhibited symptoms of COVID-19.

"President Trump declared a national emergency to deal with the new coronavirus that’s swept the globe and hit the U.S., saying states will get federal money and face fewer obstacles in testing and caring for patients. “Two very big words,” Mr. Trump said from the White House Rose Garden. “No resource will be spared, nothing whatsoever.” The designation will invoke the Stafford Act and extend up to $50 billion in aid to states and municipalities. He also ordered states to activate emergency-operation plans. Mr. Trump said he is temporarily waiving interest on student loans held by federal entities and that he directed the Department of Energy to buy up oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Also, his administration will give hospitals and health centers the flexibility to see patients from afar through telehealth and waive certain licensing requirements, so doctors can’t help areas that need them. He’s also waiving restrictions that limit the number of hospital beds in each facility or the length of a patient’s stay. Mr. Trump also revealed he plans to be tested for the virus.

"The White House reached a sweeping agreement with congressional Democrats late Friday on a bill to provide relief to workers hurt by the coronavirus outbreak. “We are proud to have reached  an agreement with the Administration to resolve outstanding challenges,  and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act,”  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to her colleagues. After some last-minute wrangling, President Trump tweeted his support for the measure shortly before 9 p.m., clearing the way for a bipartisan vote. “This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers,” Mr. Trump said. “I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt.” He added, “I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES! I will always put the health and well-being of American families FIRST. Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!” Mrs. Pelosi had a dozen conversations with Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin throughout the day as they negotiated the details. The package includes free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured; two  weeks of guaranteed paid sick leave, as well as increased family leave;  increased spending on  unemployment benefits; more money to provide  school lunches to students whose schools are closed; and an increase in  Medicaid funding. Mr. Trump had been pushing for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year, but Democrats opposed it. Getting the White House’s approval means the Republican-controlled Senate would likely approve the measure sometime next week. Lawmakers are planning to take up an even larger emergency response bill on the coronavirus in the weeks ahead. Congress has already approved an $8.3 billion measure to help states with their initial emergency health care responses.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont said the coronavirus crisis is exposing gaps in the nation’s “cruel” and “dysfunctional” health care system that leaves millions of people without coverage when they need it most and millions of others more susceptible to contracting the virus. Mr. Sanders said the virus is helping the public come to grips with the fact that it is time to make fundamental changes to the economy and health care system that lifts up the working-class, calling for paid family leave, overhauled trade deals and a guarantee of health coverage. “In my view, the most cost-effective way to reform our dysfunctional and cruel system is to move to a Medicare for All single-payer health care system and I think in the midst of this crisis more and more Americans understand the truth of that,” Mr. Sanders said at a press conference in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont. “It is nearly impossible to believe that anyone can still think it is acceptable to continue with a health care system that leaves tens of millions of people uninsured.” “The cruelty and absurdity of that view is more obvious in the midst of this crisis,” he said. “Let’s be clear, the lack of health care and affordable medicine does not only threaten the health and well-being of the uninsured, it impacts everyone who comes in contact with them. In fact, what this crisis is beginning to teach us is that we are only as safe as the least insured person in America.” Fears over the virus have changed the contours of the 2020 presidential race, with Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden taking the advice of health officials and deciding against holding campaign rallies and events with large numbers of people. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden are set to appear in their first one-on-one debate Sunday. Citing concerns over coronavirus, the Democratic National Committee and the event sponsors, CNN and Univision, announced the debate would be moved from Phoenix to Washington, D.C., and that there would be no live audience. Consequently, Mr. Sanders has relied on getting his message out at press conferences this week that have been streamed online and picked up by cable news networks. On Friday, Mr. Sanders said public health officials, doctors, and scientists should lead the response to the virus  - not politicians. The federal government must dramatically increase the availability of test kits, intensive care units, and doctors and medical personnel needed to combat the virus, while making sure the frontline workers are protected, he said. Mr. Sanders said the nation must take stock of the mistakes the government has made responding to the virus and what moves can be made to the federal government to make sure people are better equipped to face future challenges. Mr. Sanders drove home the point that he expects support for universal health care to increase and lamented how the nation’s trade deals have sent jobs overseas and made the nation reliant on foreign countries such as China for the supplies it needs to combat this sort of crisis. “People who are sick today, who woke up with symptoms of the coronavirus are saying, ‘You know I feel sick, but I can’t afford to go to a doctor,’ and when somebody is not treated for the virus, somebody who is unable to afford to go to that doctor, that means that the infection can spread to many others, putting us at risk,” Mr. Sanders said. “Now the lack of health insurance for many millions of people threatens other people as well.”  ","America ‘only as safe as the least insured person,’ Sanders says regarding coronavirus emergency","Friday, March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-only-safe-least-insured-bernie-sanders/,washington_times
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats will vote later Friday on a coronavirus relief package, with or without the support of the White House. “The American people expect and deserve a coordinated, science-based and whole-of-government response to keep them and their loved ones safe,” Mrs. Pelosi said at the Capitol. But she didn’t answer a reporter’s question about whether President Trump supports the bill. The president wants a cut in payroll taxes through the end of the year; Democrats haven’t included it in the measure. Mr. Trump said later that the White House was still negotiating with Democrats, but he wasn’t pleased with the bill. “We just don’t think they’re giving enough,” the president said. “They’re not doing what’s right for the country. We thought we had something, but all of a sudden they didn’t agree to certain things they had agreed to.” The package would make coronavirus testing free for everyone who needs it, allow for two weeks of paid sick leave and provide unemployment insurance for furloughed workers. “We can only defeat this outbreak if we have an accurate determination of its scale and scope, so that we can pursue the precise science-based response that is necessary to put families first,” Mrs. Pelosi said. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin has been negotiating nearly round the clock with Mrs. Pelosi on the bill. They spoke eight times on Friday alone.

"NEW ORLEANS — Louisiana postponed its scheduled presidential primary by two months Friday in response to the ongoing coronavirus health crisis, officials said.Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced the primary, slated to be held on April 4, will now be June 20.Mr. Ardoin is expected to provide more details at a press conference later Friday. While major professional and college sports events, along with many college campuses, have shut down, Louisiana is the first political event to be postponed because of the virus. The state had 33 presumptive cases of coronavirus as of Friday morning, with the biggest cluster of those — 23 — being New Orleans. Many of Louisiana’s Election Day commissioners are 65 or older, and to date the coronavirus has been most lethal to the elderly. In addition, 32 polling locations are in nursing homes of senior facilities, according to the secretary of state’s office. “This decision has been made out of an absolute abundance of caution for Louisiana’s voters, voting officials and the general public as a whole,” Mr. Ardoin said. The primary was formally switched when Mr. Ardoin’s request to move it to June 20 was approved by Gov. John Bel Edwards. Although it does not appear to have moved voting days because of health scares in the past, Louisiana has altered its election schedule because of major hurricanes and natural disasters, officials said.

"Sen. Bob Casey took a shot at the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus, saying Americans would have better luck purchasing a semi-automatic rifle than they would tracking down a test kit for the virus. “Right now in America, it is easier to get an AR-15 than a test kit for COVID-19,” the Pennsylvania Democrat said on Twitter. President Trump and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been widely-criticized for being too slow to react to the spread of the infection. On Friday, Mr. Trump has shifted the blame for the shortage of test kits onto the Obama administration and the CDC, arguing they left the nation unprepared for this sort of outbreak. A week ago, Mr. Trump said that, “Anyone who wants a test can get a test” and Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said there is “no testing kit shortage.” Democrats on Capitol Hill have vehemently disagreed.

"The coronavirus has started to infect more and more political ads — particularly attacks targeting Republicans on health care. Advertising Analytics, an independent ad tracking firm, highlighted the recent uptick in coronavirus-related ads in its weekly recap, pointing out that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was the first to run a pair of COVID-19-related television spots in his short-lived 2020 campaign, and outside groups aligned with Democrats have since followed in his footsteps. Fair Fight Action, a voting rights group created by former Georgia state Rep. Stacey Abrams, has accused Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who defeated Ms. Abrams in the state’s 2018 gubernatorial race, of seeking to “blow up” programs that “keep Georgia Safe.” “Kemp is proposing blowing up our criminal justice system, cutting millions of dollars, blowing up job training programs, blowing up mental health services blowing up health care funding for every Georgia county as coronavirus hits our state,” the narrator says in the ad. Sen. Steve Daines, Republican Montana, was the target of a coronavirus-inspired attack ad from Protect Our Care, a liberal health care group that advocates for Obamacare. “Too many Montana families go to sleep at night worried about health care — coverage, costs, now the fear of coronavirus,” the narrator says in the ad. “That doesn’t worry. Steve Daines.” The Health Care Education Project, meanwhile, is accusing President Trump in an ad of trying to cut health care that people will need to protect themselves from the virus. “Now Trump wants billions more health care cuts when we need it most,” the narrator says over a screenshot of Mr. Trump and a news headline “CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK.” It then pivots to a video clip from a press conference in which New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says, “There has to be a play where you don’t play politics.” “It has to end somewhere, and it should end with health care,” the Democrat says.

"The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee moved forward with a subpoena against a lobbying shop for records relating to the work former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s son, Hunter, did for a Ukrainian energy firm. The committee suddenly shifted its attention to Blue Star Strategies earlier this week instead of its former consultant, Andrii Telizhenko, who turned to conservative talk radio to make his case. Sen. Ron Johnson, committee chairman, notified his Democratic colleagues on Thursday that he was sending a subpoena to Blue Star for records of its work on behalf of Burisma Holdings, the firm connected to Hunter Biden. Mr. Johnson’s letter indicates he also wants Blue Star’s CEO and chief operating officer to testify before his committee. Lawmakers were expected to vote in committee on Wednesday to issue a subpoena to Mr. Telizhenko, but Mr. Johnson abruptly shifted course to focus directly on Blue Star itself. Mr. Johnson has reiterated the decision was made based upon the suggestion of “both Democrat and Republican members of our committee.” Mr. Telizhenko still wants to have his voice heard, and appeared on conservative radio host Glenn Beck’s program on Thursday. Mr. Telizhenko said he did not want to speak about Blue Star until he felt threatened and heard that if Mr. Biden wins the presidency Mr. Telizhenko may no longer be welcome in the United States. “I have emails, communications, with Blue Star Strategies throughout the time I worked for them, before and after, that I wanted to share with the Senate, which is relevant for the investigation,” Mr. Telizhenko told Glenn Beck. “There’s no Russia collusion here, it’s just documents.” Mr. Telizhenko said his information is covered by a nondisclosure agreement, which is why he cannot voluntarily turn his information over to the Senate in the absence of the issuance of a subpoena. No hearing has yet been scheduled for the testimony of Blue Star executives.

"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who had dinner with President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence last weekend, said Friday his second test for the coronavirus was negative. Mr. Bolsonaro made the announcement on his Facebook page after a major daily newspaper in Brazil reported that his first test was positive. His son Eduardo, a lawmaker who was also on the trip, told Fox News that his father’s initial test was positive. Eduardo Bolsonaro tweeted Thursday that Mr. Bolsonaro was tested but was “not exhibiting any symptoms of the disease.” The populist Brazilian leader has developed a bond with Mr. Trump and met with the president Saturday at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Mr. Bolsonaro’s top press aide, who also attended the meetings with Mr. Trump, also has tested positive for the virus. The White House said Thursday that Mr. Trump hasn’t been tested, and the president said he was not concerned about being in close proximity to someone with the virus. Mr. Bolsonaro was wearing a surgical mask Thursday while carrying out his official duties in Brazil.

"House Majority Whip James Clyburn said he considers President Trump to be a racist and that the U.S. “could very well go the way of Germany in the 1930s,” Axios reported Friday. Mr. Clyburn, South Carolina Democrat, made the remarks in a recent interview scheduled to air this weekend on the “Axios on HBO” cable program, the news site reported. “I used to wonder, how could the people of Germany allow Hitler to exist? But with each passing day, I’m beginning to understand how. And that’s why I’m trying to sound the alarm,” Mr. Clyburn said in an excerpt released ahead of the episode airing. The third-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives and one of the most influential congressmen on Capitol Hill, Mr. Clyburn has been frequently critical of Mr. Trump and his policies as president. Mr. Clyburn endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden right before South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary. The congressman has also previously drawn parallels between Mr. Trump and former Nazi leader Adolf Hitler on more than one occasion. “Having studied history and having taught history, I can only equate one period of time with what we are experiencing now and that was what was going on in Germany around 1934 right after the 1932 elections when Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor,” Mr. Clyburn said during a CNN interview in January 2018. “When I see and hear and experience what’s going on in the country today, I think back to that time, and I really believe that we as Americans had better get a handle on things. If we don’t, we could very well see ourselves going the way of Germany,” he said at the time. More recently, Mr. Clyburn reiterated that warning while speaking to NBC News last March. “Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor of Germany. And he went about the business of discrediting institutions to the point that people bought into” it,” Mr. Clyburn said last year. “Nobody would have believed it now. But swastikas hung in churches throughout Germany. We had better be very careful.” The full version of the recent interview with Mr. Clyburn will air Sunday on HBO, Axios reported.

"PHOENIX (AP) - Maria Chavira, a senior administrator in the Diocese of Phoenix, says Spanish-speaking Catholic parishes in her area are “bursting at the seams” and celebrates the emergence of Hispanics as the largest ethnic component of the church nationwide. Throughout the Southwest, where the surge has been dramatic, Roman Catholic leaders are excited by the possibilities - and well aware of daunting challenges.  Hispanics now account for 40% of all U.S. Catholics, and a solid majority of school-age Catholics. Yet Hispanic Americans are strikingly underrepresented in Catholic schools and in the priesthood - accounting for less than 19% of Catholic school enrollment and only about 3% of U.S.-based priests.  In the Phoenix diocese, there are than 700,000 Hispanics out of a total of 1.2 million Catholics. Yet out of more than 200 priests, Catholic researchers counted only seven American-born Hispanics.  Extensive efforts are under way to narrow the demographic gaps. They have been highlighted in a nearly completed four-year study  by U.S. Catholic bishops seeking to strengthen the church’s engagement with Hispanics.  ”We have a lot of opportunities,” said Chavira, who oversees the Hispanic Mission Office and other departments in the Phoenix diocese. “There may be a little turbulence ahead, but we’re going to make it.”  Chavira is among more than two dozen Catholic leaders and activists who shared their thoughts about the Hispanic Catholic phenomenon with The Associated Press, some in telephone interviews and others face-to-face during a reporting trip to Arizona and Texas’ Rio Grande Valley.  Evidence of the change can be seen each December, when thousands of Hispanic Catholics dance and march in downtown Phoenix to celebrate Our Lady of Guadalupe. It can be seen in fast-growing, heavily Hispanic communities in Phoenix’s western suburbs.  Nationwide, more than 1,200 Catholic schools have closed in the past decade, usually under financial stress. Yet in the suburb of Avondale, enrollment is surging at a handsome new Catholic high school.  The school, named for Pope John Paul II, opened in 2018. About 70% of its 220 students are Hispanic; plans call for rapid expansion to accommodate an enrollment of 1,000.  “We’re serving people who’ve been underserved in this nation,” said the principal, Sister Mary Jordan Hoover. “These young people are trying to learn to be the next teachers, the next administrators, writers, doctors. They’re dreaming big.”  The hopefulness contrasts with circumstances in some other regions. Hundreds of parishes have closed in the Northeast and Midwest. The clergy sex abuse scandal has forced more than 20 dioceses across the U.S. into bankruptcy since 2004, most recently in the Northeast. The scandals haven’t spared the Southwest. The dioceses in Tucson, Arizona, and in Santa Fe and Gallup, New Mexico, are among those that declared bankruptcy. But in states along the Mexico border, past scandals don’t diminish the excitement over a future Hispanic-accented Catholic church. More than 400 new parishes have opened since 1970 in the border states, and many Hispanic Catholics were elated by the recent election of Mexican-born Los Angeles Archbishop José Gómez as the first Hispanic president of the bishops’ conference.  “It’s the tale of two churches,” said Hosffman Ospino, a professor of Hispanic ministry at Boston College. “In Boston, I see a Catholicism that’s very reserved. In the Southwest it’s very public, very expressive.”  A major challenge for the Catholic hierarchy: persuading more Hispanic young men to become priests.  An example of that challenge: 30-year-old Diego Piña Lopez of Tucson. He’s devoted his life to the Catholic tenet of supporting the dignity of all people, including asylum seekers who visit Casa Alitas, the Catholic-run shelter in Tucson where he works.  Growing up, he sometimes considered becoming a priest, but opted instead to pursue graduate degrees in social work and public health. Why not the priesthood? “I wanted to have a family,” he said.  By the latest count of the bishops’ conference, there are about 37,300 U.S.-based priests. Among them are roughly 3,000 Hispanics - more than 2,000 of them foreign-born.  One problem, said Ospino, is that Hispanics in the U.S. have lagged behind other groups in regard to college-level education, limiting the pool of young men qualified for seminary.  But even as the second and third generations of many Hispanic immigrant families do pursue higher education, other factors are at play.  “With those generations, there’s extremely heavy pressure to think more about economic success than the glory of God,” said Daniel Flores, bishop of Brownsville, Texas. “We need to teach them the concept of service, rather than you need to earn as much as you can.”  Overall enrollment in Catholic schools in the U.S. has plummeted in recent decades, from more than 5.2 million in the 1960s to about 1.73 million this year. Of the current students, only 18.5% are Hispanic.  Experts cite several reasons. Many Hispanics in the U.S. come from Latin American countries where private schools, including Catholic ones, are viewed as bastions of the wealthy. With tuition averaging more than $5,000 for elementary grades and $10,000 for high school, Catholic education in the U.S. seems unaffordable to many families. And many Catholic schools are losing students to charter schools which are able to access government funds for their operations.  All these factors are present in the Brownsville, diocese, where Catholic school enrollment has dropped sharply in recent years in the face of tougher competition from charter and public schools.  One of the elementary schools fighting to maintain its enrollment is St. Mary’s Catholic School. Its principal, Ana Gomez, says 95% of her 350 students are Hispanic. She’s been able to keep enrollment stable with strategies taught by the Latino Enrollment Initiative, a program based at Notre Dame University. Tactics include ensuring that schools are culturally in sync with Hispanic families, and helping parents fit tuition into their budgets. About 80 St. Mary’s students now get some financial aid, Gomez said.  While the Hispanic population in the U.S. is sure to grow, the extent of the Catholic Church’s hold on them is uncertain. Last year, the Pew Research Center reported that U.S. Hispanics are no longer a majority-Catholic group, with 47% of them calling themselves Catholic, down from 57% in 2009. The number identifying as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” increased from 16% to 23%; those identifying as Protestant rose from 23% to 26%.  Melba Salazar-Lucio, a professor and migrant-rights activist in Brownsville, says today’s Catholic Church seems too rigid for many Hispanics. Her mother no longer attends church, she said, and her three grown children are no longer practicing Catholics.  “There are other denominations - they have more music, younger pastors who are more accepting of people’s ways,” Salazar-Lucio said. “The Catholic church is not going to be changing with the times.”  At a migrant outreach center in Nogales, Mexico, abutting the Arizona border, Jesuit priest Sean Carroll ministers every day to asylum seekers who dream of joining the ranks of Hispanic Catholics in the U.S.  “They are bringing their culture, their gifts,” he said. “The challenge for the church is to be open to receiving those gifts. How do we get them to see themselves as leaders? How do we get them to feel at home?”  ___  Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

"BAGHDAD (AP) - At the once bustling hub of the largest anti-government protest movement in Iraq’s modern history, crowds have dwindled, and donation boxes have sprouted up. Loudspeakers resound with calls by activists for funds to keep their hard-fought revolution alive.  The six-month-old movement has faced one setback after another, from the shifting positions of a mercurial Shiite cleric to an apathetic political class and, now, fears over an outbreak of the coronavirus  that Iraq’s decrepit health system has struggled to contain, with nearly 93 confirmed cases and nine deaths.  Where once Baghdad’s Tahrir Square had seen thousands every day, now only a few hundred protesters turn up. Morale has been dampened among young Iraqis who first took to the streets on Oct. 1 to decry rampant government corruption, poor services and unemployment.  Protesters have found it difficult to revive the strength of their leaderless movement after scoring victories early on, like pressuring lawmakers to pass a key electoral reform bill and forcing former Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi to step down. Assassinations, abductions and threats targeting prominent protesters have contributed to blunting the momentum.  A looming economic crisis linked to the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing political dysfunction could eventually bring a new jolt that inspires Iraqis back to the streets. But for the moment, the movement is looking at what went wrong. The difficulties of recent months caused the poles of authority among protesters to shift from the capital to the south, while some say shunning any form of central leadership was a mistake. In Tahrir Square, a group of young men recently shared a hookah pipe under a tarp by a tunnel replete with the wall art of their revolution. Together, they embodied the spirit that first brought many into Iraq’s central squares to protest. Marwan Ali, 23, had attended university to study communication but could only find work as a barber after graduation. Mohammed Abbas, 19, didn’t bother pursuing a higher education, convinced it wouldn’t secure a job. So in October he picked up a banner and joined the movement.  Hussein al-Hind, 22, was a teenager when he heeded a call by Iraq’s top Shiite cleric to take up arms and defeat the Islamic State group with what would later become the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Forces. He soon became disenchanted as his one-time war heroes joined the ranks of the political class by running in the May 2018 election.  The young men have also suffered the violence that has met the movement. Al-Hind showed off two bullet wounds from clashes with riot police; Abbas was detained by police for three days early on in the demonstrations; Ali’s family has received messages from unknown groups threatening his life.  Now, the future of their hard-fought protest movement depends on the ability of these youth to keep to the streets. When the conversation turned to the state of their movement, Marwan Ali took a moment’s pause.  “We are disappointed,” he said. Asked why he was still coming to Tahrir, he said, “This isn’t about the homeland anymore, we are here for the blood of our martyrs.” Over 500 people have been killed since October under fire by security forces who have used live ammunition, tear gas and recently pellet guns to disperse crowds.  In nearby Khilani Square, clashes still rage between a core group of protesters and security, with at least two demonstrators dead last week.  The movement was dealt a blow in January after radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who also heads a major political bloc, withdrew support after elites selected a prime minister candidate he backed, Mohammed Allawi. Al-Sadr’s reversal instilled a climate of fear in the square as militiamen affiliated with his group, which once protected protest sites, intimidated demonstrators who refused to back Allawi, activists said. Allawi has since withdrawn from the post. “We were tools in al-Sadr’s game,” said Kamal Jaban, an activist.  It was an eventuality that activists said they wanted to avoid when al-Sadr’s followers first joined the movement.  As early as November, protesters bristled at the question of leadership and were quick to diminish the credibility of those making claims of authority over them. They tore down stages built by political parties in protest plazas, fearing the fate of previous grassroots movements that fizzled out when co-opted by political actors.  Three months since, protesters said in hindsight the lack of core leadership had hobbled their movement, enabling figures like al-Sadr to do exactly what they had feared.  “There is no one to represent us, put pressure on the government,” said Ali, under the tarp in Tahrir.  Al-Sadr’s move also diminished Tahrir Square’s status as the central voice of the movement. Activists started looking to Haboubi Square in the southern city of Nasiriya for orders. Nasiriya’s protesters have been resilient against infiltration by political parties, partly due to support from local tribes.  In hindsight, said Ali, this weakened the movement.  “Tahrir Square became tainted with al-Sadr supporters,” he explained. “At first Nasiriya was listening to us, now we listen to them.”  It was Nasiriya that gave political elites a deadline to make progress on protester demands, prompting an escalation in demonstrations across the country. Later, calls from the southern city led protesters in Baghdad to block the strategic Mohammed al-Qassim highway. When Haboubi Square raised the image of activist Alaa Rikabi as their choice for prime minister, Tahrir did the same.  Other protesters said fatigue from months on the street was taking a toll as donations for food and supplies were running short and temperatures dropped over the winter. “Weak turnout was expected some time ago because the protesters who have been here for five months are tired, sleeping in cold and far from wor¬¬k, their families and school,” said Murtada Emad, a protester and university student at Babil College of Basic Education. “I left school, but my family is pressuring me to go back.” By February, protesters were marginalized as political bickering over Allawi’s government formation ignored the core demands of the street. Allawi withdrew as prime minister-designate on March 1 after failing to secure parliamentary support for his Cabinet.  Back in Tahrir, Ali Jumaili, 22, said all hope was not lost.  “Every day, I sit on the sidewalk with my friends and weep because of the weakening demonstrations,” he said. “The revolution will repeat itself with more vigor in the future.”  ",Iraq's protesters struggle to keep waning movement going,"Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/iraqs-protesters-struggle-to-keep-waning-movement-/,washington_times
"BEIJING (AP) - Courtney Huang fell in love with the U.S. as a nursing student in Texas. She ended up staying 13 years and wants to become a U.S. citizen. But Huang now finds her job, future, and dreams of citizenship on the line since the Trump administration barred entry last month to non-U.S. citizens and residents flying in from China over the coronavirus outbreak. With crucial deadlines looming, her plans look increasingly at risk. “I’m really scared,” Huang said. “I have a lot there. If I don’t go back, it’s just going to be very difficult.” The U.S. suspended visa processing in China on Feb. 3, citing limited staffing during the virus outbreak. No deadline extensions have been announced and it’s not known when the suspension will be lifted. That’s put hundreds of Chinese citizens applying for U.S. work visas in limbo, fretting as their jobs look increasingly at risk. Huang had returned to China to see her parents over the Lunar New Year holiday in late January. She had recently landed a new job in California and her work visa was on the verge of approval when the American Consulate in Shanghai announced it was returning everyone’s passports. After weeks of fretting and weighing her options at her parent’s home in eastern China, Huang flew to Thailand. She now plans to wait out a mandated 14-day self-quarantine before seeing if she can get her visa from the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok. Though Huang was born and raised in China, her whole life is now in Oakland, California, where she has an apartment, car, friends and job. With her Christian faith and gregarious, outspoken manner, the U.S. feels like home. “I feel like I fit in better there. Free speech, free religion,” Huang said. Clean air, better career opportunities for women and a liberal social environment were also draws, she added. Huang obtained a nursing degree in Texas, then a master’s degree in bioengineering from U.C. Berkeley. She’s on the verge of completing an M.B.A., with an eye toward settling permanently. Now, Huang is concerned those plans could fall apart. Though her new employers, a company that provides clinical support for physicians, are understanding, Huang worries that as the months go by, there’s a possibility she may lose her job - and with it, her right to work in the U.S. Like Huang, Kevin Yang, a Chinese doctoral student researching immunology at an American university, is also reconsidering his options. After moving to the U.s. eight years ago, Yang has returned home each winter holiday and had his student visa renewed without a hitch. This year, though, Yang became one of many Chinese citizens caught up in the brutal tussle between Beijing and Washington over trade and technology. When Yang applied for a visa in December, the State Department told him it was being delayed while they investigated his background for ties to the Chinese government. American officials have in recent years grown alarmed over the alleged theft of U.S. technology by China, casting a cloud of suspicion on Chinese citizens like Yang who work in the sciences. Told the check would take four weeks, Yang changed his flights and prepared to stay longer. Then in late January, the Chinese government began locking down whole cities to contain the virus. Soon after, Trump announced the U.S. travel ban. Yang got his passport back in the mail with no visa. American officials told Yang’s academic adviser that since Yang no longer had a visa, they could no longer pay his stipend or fund his research with federal grant money. Hospital surveys that Yang said he spent “thousands of dollars and thousands of hours” over two years to set up were now in peril, something he described as a crushing blow. “Maybe it’s time for me to start thinking about an alternative career,” Yang said, mulling the possibility he won’t be able to finish his Ph.D. “It’s like restarting my life.” Discouraging high-skilled foreigners from immigrating could undermine the U.S. economy and its global prominence, said Anastasia Tonello, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Nearly 2.5 million Chinese were in the U.S. as of 2018, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, and most are significantly better educated than the average American. China is also the main source of foreign students enrolled in U.S. higher education. While health and safety are legitimate concerns, blanket travel bans aren’t the answer, Tonello said. “I just don’t think this was thought through,” she said. “These are just such broad strokes and can cause so much damage.” The U.S. isn’t the only country currently restricting entry from China. Travelers face restrictions across the globe, from neighboring North Korea to far-flung New Zealand, Somalia, and Guatemala. Australia, a major destination for Chinese students and immigrants, also has banned arrivals and stopped issuing visas. Such restrictions have been loudly criticized by China’s Foreign Ministry, though Beijing frequently singles out the United States. Yang and Huang both say they understand why a travel ban could help contain the virus. But they say the U.S. halt on new visas - with no deadline extensions or other accommodations - is frustrating and unreasonable. Even more frustrating for Huang is the sense that the U.S. is trying to bar her from coming back. “I’m not being respected. I work in the states as a talent; I pay my taxes diligently,” Huang said. “This just makes me feel like, ‘Oh, maybe I’m just not welcome in the states.’” Even for Chinese with visas, the clock is ticking. Tom, a programmer from the epicenter of the outbreak, the city of Wuhan, had just obtained a master’s degree in computer science from Emory University in Georgia. He has a U.S. visa but got stuck in Wuhan after the city was quarantined. Under American law, foreign students have 90 days after graduation to start new jobs if they want to stay and work in the U.S. If Tom is still trapped in Wuhan by May, he’ll lose both his new job at Amazon and his chance to work in America altogether. “I’d have to start all over again,” Tom said, declining to provide his last name for fear it could affect his visa and career prospects. “I just worry every day about whether I can go back to America.” Tom says his family spent around $70,000 to send him to Emory for a shot at a better life in the U.S. He didn’t want to work in China, deterred by the Chinese tech industry’s notoriously-long hours, popularly known as “996” –9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. U.S. officials told him there was nothing he could do.  “We just want some help or advice,” Tom said. “Please don’t ignore us, it’s something completely out of our control. That’s the worst thing.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"PHOENIX (AP) - The U.S. government says a new rule disqualifying more people from green cards if they use government benefits will not apply to immigrants with coronavirus or virus symptoms if they seek care.  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said late Friday that seeking treatment or preventive services won’t affect someone’s immigration status under the new, highly criticized public charge rule, which took effect last month and which punishes immigrants who need public assistance.  The agency acknowledged that some immigrants may fear seeking care in the wake of the virus, saying that it “will neither consider testing, treatment, nor preventative care” related to the virus in determining someone’s eligibility for permanent residency. It said that those who can’t work or attend school and must rely on public benefits during the duration of the virus outbreak and recovery can later explain and provide documentation and that it will be taken into consideration.  The announcement came after lawmakers and advocacy groups urged the government to suspend the rule during the coronavirus outbreak. Advocates say they have been fielding panicked calls from immigrants who are worried about the impact on their status if they seek health care.  Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles, said her group and others held a news conference urging immigrants to seek care if needed and reminding them that their health, and the health of their families, is most important.  “People are wondering about their vulnerability both in terms of disease but their vulnerability in terms of immigration status, in terms of being discovered,” she said. Salas said she doesn’t fully trust the Trump administration but feels confident that state, county and local authorities will support immigrants who come forward to seek the health care they need, regardless of their immigration status. Advocates have long derided the public charge rule, which punishes immigrants who are in the country legally and who are allowed to access some benefits, such as food stamps, for their American-born children.  As the coronavirus began to spread more widely in the U.S., supporters and lawmakers cautioned it could be detrimental to public health if some immigrants were too afraid to seek care.  Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights Boston, said his organization got a request for legal support from a woman who worked in hospitality industry in Chelsea, Massachusetts. The woman said her work schedule is in flux, and she doesn’t have a steady income. She wanted to apply for food stamps for her 9-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, but was too afraid. Now, with her son’s school closing down indefinitely, she was even more concerned.  “There is a tremendous reluctance, even among immigrant parents raising U.S. citizen children. There is a lot of fear surrounding the public charge rule, especially because immigration courts have remained open, creating a strong impression that removal proceedings trumps public health concerns,” Espinoza-Madrigal said.  On Thursday, Democratic lawmakers pressured Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, to suspend or disregard the rule during the virus outbreak. Cuccinelli said the public health exemptions written into the rule already addressed that issue.  U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, said the rule scares away people from seeking care, posing a public health risk for everyone. She tweeted after the new statement on Friday: “This is a huge win for immigrants, public health AND everyone!” ___ Associated Press reporter Amy Taxin contributed to this report   ",US: Immigrants can seek coronavirus care without fear,"Friday, March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/13/us-immigrants-can-seek-coronavirus-care-without-fe/,washington_times
"WASHINGTON (AP) - Seattle’s immigration court will close down as the nation continues to grapple with managing the coronavirus pandemic, and several other large immigration courts will postpone certain hearings for immigrants who are not detained that often involve large groups.  The court in Seattle was temporarily shut down earlier this week over a report of a second-hand exposure to the virus and will remain shut until April 10. Seattle is among the areas hardest hit so far, with a cluster of deaths and dozens sickened. The number of cases in the U.S. was put at around 1,700 Friday, with about 50 deaths. But by some estimates, at least 14,000 people might be infected. According to a statement obtained by The Associated Press from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which manages the immigration court system, other courts will remain open where the virus has struck, including Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Newark, New Jersey, and Sacramento, California. But “master calendar” dates for those who are not detained will be postponed. Those hearings can include dozens of people in a single courtroom. “The agency continues to evaluate the dynamic situation nationwide and will make decisions for each location as more information becomes available,” according to the statement from EOIR, which is a division of the U.S. Department of Justice.  There are 68 immigration courts nationwide; the others will operate as scheduled but officials with EOIR said they are evaluating and will adjust as needed.                  The U.S. immigration courts  are dealing with a massive backlog of 1 million cases. There have been some delays of trials among the nation’s criminal courts, and some states have closed courtrooms as the virus spreads.  There have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the immigration system, but it’s not clear how frequently tests are being performed, if at all. There is often movement between detention facilities at the border, where some migrants enter the U.S. sick, and throughout the immigration system that has put employees on edge.  A union representing immigration judges has called for a temporary halt to the “master calendar” hearings. On Thursday, Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the head of the union, wrote to the leadership of EOIR asking for more measures be put in place to protect judges and employees.  “In the absence of uniform guidance, some immigration judges have attempted to implement their own risk mitigation strategies,” she wrote. “However, these efforts have been frustrated by a time-consuming bureaucratic process that is simply not sufficient in the current circumstances.” Tabbador also called the postponements in six cities “wholly inadequate to address the public health risk” and called on EOIR “to shut down all of these large group hearings in all immigration courts across the country.” In El Paso, Texas, some guards work shifts at both the long-term detention center and the public courts where people are not detained. On Friday, guards were seen interacting with two dozen migrants for a mass hearing in the non-detained court, which sits on the 7th floor of a building that also has public offices for the IRS and other federal agencies.  The migrants have been required to live in Mexico while they apply for asylum. They sleep in a network of shelters in Ciudad Juarez, along with migrants from other countries and other continents.  Separately on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it would temporarily suspend social visits at all of its detention facilities across the U.S. Officials said there were no detainees in ICE custody who had confirmed cases of COVID-19 and said canceling visitation was precautionary to “further safeguard those in our care.” ICE holds more than 37,888 immigrants in more than 130 facilities, including local jails and prisons. But unlike other detention centers, have wide discretion on who can be released while their cases wind through the courts.  The federal Bureau of Prisons also shut down visitation; inmates at all 122 federal correctional facilities across the country will no longer be allowed visits from family, friends or attorneys for the next 30 days. ___ Associated Press Writer Cedar Attanasio contributed to this report from El Paso, Texas.

"DETROIT (AP) - An expected guilty plea to corruption charges by former United Auto Workers President Gary Jones has been delayed due to the coronavirus and traveling concerns. Jones was to appear in federal court in Detroit on Thursday. He’s accused of conspiring with UAW cronies to embezzle more than $1 million. Defense attorney Bruce Maffeo told The Detroit News that he asked for - and received - a two-week delay and that the guilty plea now will come on April 2. Maffeo is from New York.

Some officials took kickbacks from union contractors. Jones was president for about 1 1/2 years until quitting under a cloud in November. The government said union money was spent on golf, cigars, spas, high-end lodging and liquor. Jones‘ alleged scheme goes back years to his time as the leader of a UAW regional office near St. Louis.

"LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) - Slovenia’s new, right-leaning government was sworn in on Friday, pledging stronger efforts to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. The 90-member parliament voted 52-31 to approve a coalition government led by Prime Minister Janez Jansa, leader of the anti-immigrant Slovenian Democratic Party and an ally of Hungary’s hardline Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Jansa, 61, promised a more concerted effort to contain the spread of the disease, criticizing the previous government which declared an epidemic on Thursday. The outgoing government “flunked the test in recent days,” Jansa said. “What was coming was underestimated and reactions were chaotic,” the official STA news agency quoted Jansa as saying.  Slovenia reported 141 cases of infections on Friday, with a surge of 45 new confirmed cases in less than 24 hours in the Alpine country of 2 million people that borders Italy, the focus of Europe’s coronavirus crisis.  Jansa’s predecessor, Prime Minister Marjan Sarec, was a rare liberal head of government in Central and Eastern Europe. He announced he was stepping down in January, citing lack of support for his minority government.  Sarec, a former actor and comedian, had called for an early election, but his two former coalition partners instead agreed to form a new government with Jansa.  Jansa served twice as the prime minister in the past. He was convicted of corruption in a verdict that was later overturned by Slovenia’s top court, before turning harshly anti-immigrant ahead of the 2018 election that followed the mass influx of migrants into Europe in 2015-16. Jansa’s SDS won the most votes in the 2018 parliamentary election, but other groups in parliament initially refused to cooperate with the party because of its right-wing policies. Analysts in Slovenia say Jansa somewhat has toned down his rhetoric to position himself as an acceptable political figure.

"CHICAGO (AP) — Joe Biden held a town hall in Illinois — or at least  tried to — from 800 miles away in Delaware. Bernie Sanders is staging  daily news conferences from Vermont, instead of his usual rallies around  the country with thousands of supporters. The global coronavirus pandemic has sent the 2020 presidential campaign into a virtual phase. Big rallies and handshakes are out. Virtual phone banks and town  halls are the new normal. Political parties and groups are canceling  in-person gatherings. States holding primaries in coming weeks have urged more voters to  cast ballots by mail and extended hours for early voting centers in an  effort to avoid election day crowds. On Friday, Louisiana’s governor  said he planned to postpone his state’s April 4  primary to June. The Biden campaign scrapped plans for a Chicago rally ahead of  Illinois’ Tuesday primary due to warnings from public and health  officials against large gatherings. Instead, the Democratic front-runner  was supposed to take questions Friday in a virtual town hall via  Facebook live. But it was a rocky start. The livestream started after Biden had  begun speaking, cutting off his introduction, and at one point Biden -  holding a cell phone in his hand - turned and walked partially off  camera, so viewers could no longer see his face. The stream lasted less  than five minutes before wrapping up, with the campaign apologizing for  “technical difficulties.” “I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the  connections,” Biden said after answering a question about protecting  endangered species. “There’s a lot more to say but I’ve already probably  said too much to you.” Sanders, Biden’s rival for the Democratic nomination, has been  holding daily press briefings from his home state, where he has blasted  President Donald Trump and his administration’s response to the virus.  Biden did the same in an address Thursday. Speaking to reporters Friday, Sanders was subdued - the emotional  opposite of the big rallies that have helped fuel his support at the  polls. He drew over 10,000 people at a Chicago rally on Saturday, before  officials starting warning against large events. Sanders said his team  has mastered the use of internet campaigning, livestreaming almost all  of its events already. COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and  cough, for most people. It can cause more severe illness, including  pneumonia, for some people, especially older adults and those with  existing health problems. Most people recover from it. Those with mild  illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness  may take three to six weeks to recover, according to the World Health  Organization. With the coronavirus causing a sea change in presidential  campaigning, candidates and their supporters worry that the virtual  events won’t have the same impact. “We do more rallies than anybody else, and (they’re) often very well  attended. I love to do them,” Sanders told reporters at a hotel in his  home state of Vermont. “This coronavirus has obviously impacted our  ability to communicate with people in the traditional way that we do.  That’s hurting.” In Chicago, Biden volunteer Lally Doerrer was preparing to have a few  other supporters over to her home Friday to watch the virtual town  hall. The retiree finished an online MBA program a few years ago and  said it helped familiarize her with technology like virtual classrooms  and the potential for it to reach many more people than a rally. And  while she believes canceling large gatherings is the right thing to do,  she doesn’t think the virtual events will have the same impact as when  people come together in person. “There is a common physical element that comes from being face to  face, or better yet marching side by side, and that’s what is lost in  this,” Doerrer said. At Biden headquarters, Friday is the last day before the campaign  moves to a work-at-home model for everyone, from the most senior  advisers to the newest organizer. The policy extends to field offices around the country, as well —  just as the campaign was looking to build out the campaign toward a  potential general election matchup against President Donald Trump. Trump  himself has canceled rallies, for now. Biden advisers are reluctant to talk about what the coming weeks may  look like, mostly because they don’t know. They’ve not announced a  public schedule beyond Friday’s town hall and a similar event in Miami  on Monday, both replacing scheduled rallies ahead of Tuesday primaries. If anything, those events are tryouts for a new style, while aides  continue monitoring public health advisories from the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention. In a staff memo, Anita Dunn, Biden’s top strategist, and Jen O’Malley  Dillon, his new campaign manager, said that as of Thursday, that  guidance still suggests that “small gatherings are safe,” as long as no  exposed persons participate. “We will continue to hold smaller events  like roundtables, house parties and press statements,” besides the  virtual events. It’s not the first time this election cycle that candidates have had  to get creative about reaching voters. Stuck in Washington for Trump’s  impeachment trial in the weeks before the kickoff Iowa caucuses, Sens.  Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar held telephone town halls with Iowa  voters, and Sanders held nightly online chats where he spoke to  supporters via live stream, offering updates on the impeachment trial  and his campaign. Klobuchar, who said over 12,000 Iowa voters participated in one of  her telephone town halls, also spoke via phone to voters in New  Hampshire, the second state to vote. Warren held similar calls with  voters in New Hampshire and South Carolina ahead of those states’  primaries, as she campaigned elsewhere. She suggested later while  campaigning in person that she’d reached thousands of voters that way,  but her campaign never released figures on how many people actually  dialed in. Biden has held at least one virtual fundraiser, a rather uneventful  telephone gathering on Dec. 5, when he called in and essentially  delivered a modified version of a stump speech that he’s since  overhauled. Last week, he called in to a fundraiser being held at a  private residence in northern Virginia. Donors heard in person from  former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who’s endorsed Biden, and Steve  Ricchetti, one of his closest and longest-serving advisers, before the  former vice president called in. ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

"ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) - The Michigan Supreme Court has accepted a case involving the University of Michigan and the papers of a man considered to be an influential voice in anti-immigration matters. Dr. John Tanton of Petoskey donated 25 boxes of papers to the university, but 11 boxes were to remain closed until 2035. Those terms now are in question. The Michigan appeals court last year said the closed records are public documents under the Freedom of Information Act because they’re being held by a campus library as an “official function.” It’s a key phrase in state law.  The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the months ahead. Tanton died in July at age 85, days after the appeals court decision. He had a key role in forming Federation for American Immigration Reform. The lawsuit was filed by Hassan Ahmad, an attorney in McLean, Virginia.

"PITTSBURGH (AP) - The soothing voice that transports listeners to faraway places is still there. Visitors to the famed Nationality Rooms inside the University of Pittsburgh’s Cathedral of Learning can still hear E. Maxine Bruhns, 96, pay tribute to the countries and cultures of immigrants who helped shape Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. They simply have to flip an audio switch. Narrations that she researched and wrote for nearly all of the 31 classrooms, each intended to represent those nations before Pitt’s 1787 founding, are part of the legacy of a West Virginia native who spent more than half a century as Nationality Rooms director before retiring this year, citing health issues. Her departure means that for the first time in 54 years, a new director will be sought for the rooms whose rich wood, stained glass, colorful artifacts and other furnishings are of museum quality, yet serve as modern-day classrooms for Pitt students. Creating an updated job description for the woman who supervised it all could be tough given the web of duties that Ms. Bruhns embraced - from greeting world dignitaries and fundraising, to crawling around in a hard hat during maintenance inspections. Throughout her tenure, the rooms had no greater fan or fierce protector, said Maryann Sivak, assistant to the director. “They were her children,” she said. “People would ask her which one was her favorite, and she would say ‘They’re all my favorites.’” Ms. Bruhns was not available to be interviewed for this story. In a farewell to the campus published in the Nationality Rooms newsletter, she referenced health setbacks but focused more on her beloved rooms and a worldview influenced by a period starting in the 1940s when she lived and traveled through Europe, Africa and Asia with her husband, Fred C. Bruhns, who later taught at Pitt. Mr. Bruhns, who worked in refugee resettlement, died in 2006 at age 90. “In 15 years, we never stayed more than two years in any one place. I survived all of these different moves with no tragedies and learning not to hate but always appreciating the culture in which I was living,” Ms. Bruhns wrote. “I brought that back with me and found this marvelous job …” Globally minded Each room - Russian, Hungarian, German, Swedish, Ukrainian, Israeli, Norwegian, African, English, Philippine and others - is distinctive, built with donations from immigrant communities proud of what their sweat in the Pittsburgh steel mills and elsewhere achieved. About 25,000 visitors a year pay to tour the rooms on the first and third floors of the 42-story Cathedral, the tallest classroom building in the Western Hemisphere. Those patrons (adults pay $4 and youths $2) are in addition to others who poke their heads into the rooms during the semester while classes are in session. University officials said they hope by summer to identify a successor for Ms. Bruhns. That person will need to embrace the digital age, while safeguarding the authenticity of a landmark whose oldest rooms date to 1938. “We want someone who is global in mind, but also someone who can understand Pittsburgh and its history and knows what these Nationality Rooms have meant,” said Ariel Armony, vice provost for global affairs and director of the University Center for International Studies. Ms. Bruhns was decades ahead of many in embracing international study, he said. She immersed herself in the cultures of each room - the festivals and the personalities tied to them - knowing that a strong presence within each ethnic community solidified their bond with the university. She never got used to the computer, said staff, who would print out emails for her. Around the cathedral, she was a force far larger than her 5-foot-4, 100-pound frame - not shy about letting everyone know what needed to get done and not above a little colorful language for effect. Her complex travels took her to 83 countries, many with her husband. They left her with some simple truths. “She’d always say, ‘We all came from someplace,’ ” said Ms. Sivak. “She accepted the fact that we all come with our own customs and cultures and they’re all different, and yet we’re able to be accepted into this country. “Everyone felt she was on their side.” The voice of the rooms Ms. Bruhns’s soft, in-room recorded narrations resemble the practiced speech of a museum guide. They blend history, geography, culture and architecture into mini-lectures, with references to Christianity and Noah’s Ark in one room and Mecca and Muhammad in another. “You have entered the Armenian nationality Room through a doorway which tells more of the story of these remarkable people …” her voice informs those standing inside the 21st Nationality Room, later adding: “The stone arch is carved with grapes and pomegranate. These fruits, so prevalent in the area, are symbolic of a fertile land.” In another room, as strains of the bandura are heard behind her, the narration tells visitors they, in effect, are in the reception room of an Eastern European home from the 18th century. “The importance of hospitality to Ukrainians is reflected in their proverb: ‘When a guest enters the house, God enters the home.’” Ms. Bruhns steadfastly steered the rooms clear of politics and protected their historical accuracy, said Michael Walter, the rooms’ tour coordinator. As the Soviet Union dissolved, some encouraged renaming the Czechoslovak room the Czech-Slovak room, but she said that was out of line with the room’s history. Yet she also advocated for a Ukrainian room, though at the time, it was a state within the Soviet Union and not a sovereign nation. Appealing to immigrants On a research campus where clout is wielded by surgeons, scientists and executives with tongue-twisting titles, Ms. Bruhns drew her authority from a different place. Said Mr. Walter, “She talked to everyone.” Born in 1924 as E. Maxine Moose, she grew up 100 miles or so south of Pittsburgh in Grafton, W.Va., owned a pit bull, raised chickens and two piglets that her mother won in a hog-calling contest at a 4-H Club, according to co-workers. As she grew, so did Pitt’s massive Cathedral of Learning, an Indiana limestone structure symbolizing the university’s reach. It was commissioned three years before her birth and built between 1926 and 1936. Then-Chancellor John Bowman, who promoted the Cathedral, sought to harness the enthusiasm of immigrant mill workers by establishing classrooms that would honor their traditions and inspire their children to seek a college education. That idea became the Nationality Rooms. Staff say Ms. Bruhns has always worn her rural roots with pride, often calling herself a “by-gosh hillbilly.” She was an insatiably curious traveler and passionate voice for global scholarship at Pitt, a commuter campus in the 1960s beginning to realize its global aspirations. But her spontaneity was never far away. One day she greeted young 4-H Club members from Westmoreland County with a hog call in the Cathedral’s Commons Room. On the building’s third floor, just past the Armenian and Swiss rooms, two wall display cases are filled with artifacts and memories from her travels - many before she arrived at Pitt. Some are beautiful, if obscure, like the Mende mask from Sierra Leone, and the white oak plate and vessel from 20th century Ukraine, crockery made from a tree sacred to Ukrainians. Other mementos leap out: the photo of Ms. Bruhns standing with Dr. Albert Schweitzer, the theologian, humanitarian and physician of the early 20th century, with whom she spent 36 hours in 1964 while on the west coast of Africa. She and her late husband hopscotched the globe before arriving at Pitt in 1965. During that time, Ms. Bruhns learned to speak French “well,” German “with cute little mistakes,” and “conversational” Arabic, Farsi and Greek, she told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2006. She knew “basic” Italian and Cambodian and “emergency” Spanish and Chinese, she said. The couple ventured to Austria shortly after World War II to resettle war refugees, she said in the interview. Then it was off to Beirut, where the Ohio State University alumna finished a master’s degree and her husband examined the Palestinian refugee crisis. They were in South Vietnam in 1955 to help refugees fleeing from the north. Then there was Cambodia, and later, Iran during the reign of the shah. “We were supposed to go to Baghdad, but they had just killed the king, so they sent us to Tehran,” she said. Dalai Lama to Khrushchev At Pitt, her tenure dating nearly to the Cuban missile crisis generated colorful experiences and stories, from rice she shared with co-workers that had been blessed by the Dalai Lama and given to her during a visit to Oakland, to recollections of a tour of the Nationality Rooms by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, several years before she began her job. “He didn’t like the Russian room because it didn’t have any symbols of his beliefs,” she told the Post-Gazette in 2007. “They took him up to the Early American room and he said, ‘Now this is a Russian room.’ It had a big fireplace, a wooden floor, big, heavy wooden beams and a carved table.” Yet her most colorful stories may be the recorded room descriptions themselves, like that of the Syria-Lebanon Room, originally a library in a fine Damascus home dating to 1782. “Linden-paneled walls and ceiling are decorated with Gesso painting, in which a mixture of chalk and glue is applied by brush in intricate relief then painted and overlaid with silver and gold leaf.’’ The images may be why Ms. Bruhns was at peace telling an interviewer in 2006 that she doesn’t need to travel much anymore. “You can go around the world in about a week just from the people you speak to and the cultural events that go on in this building,” she said. “It’s never boring here.” ___ Online: https://bit.ly/2IA38iJ ___ Information from: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, http://www.post-gazette.com  ","Nationality Rooms director retires, but her voice lives on","Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/nationality-rooms-director-retires-but-her-voice-l/,washington_times
"President Trump isn’t getting tested for the coronavirus after all. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said in a memo released shortly before midnight Friday that the president would not be tested, nor would he self-quarantine, despite having interactions with at least two infected people from the Brazilian delegation last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The president’s interactions with the infected people were “low risk,” Dr. Conley wrote. “The president’s exposure to the first individual was extremely limited (photograph, handshake), and though he spent more time in closer proximity to the second case, all interactions occurred before any symptom onset,” he wrote. “Testing for Covid-19 is not currently indicated.” During a press conference on Friday, Mr. Trump said he “most likely” would be tested for the virus soon.

"Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, indicated his opposition Saturday to the coronavirus relief bill supported by President Trump and approved by the House of Representatives. Mr. Johnson, the chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, voiced concerns about the Families First Coronavirus Response Act being considered on Capitol Hill. In a statement, Mr. Johnson criticized language in the legislation that would require government employers and companies with fewer than 500 people on their payroll to provide paid sick leave to workers who contract COVID-19, the infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. “Although mandating that all employers must pay for sick leave might sound good, we need to consider the unintended consequences of this legislation. I fear that rather than offering a workable solution, the House bill will exacerbate the problem by forcing small businesses to pay wages they cannot afford and ‘helping’ them go further into debt,” said Mr. Johnson. “I hope the Senate will approach this with a level head and pass a bill that does more good than harm — or, if it won’t, pass nothing at all,” he said in the statement. “The president and states already have adequate authority and funding to address the current situation.” The Democratic-led House voted 363-40 early Saturday to pass the coronavirus relief bill, putting it on path to be considered next by the Senate where Republicans maintain a majority. Every House Democrat and most Republicans in the House voted to pass the bill, although Mr. Johnson is hardly the only Wisconsinite to raise objections. Each of the state’s Republican congressmen — U.S. Reps. Mike Gallagher, Glenn Grothman, Jim Sensenbrenner and Bryan Steil — were among the 40 lawmakers who voted against the bill Saturday, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted. President Trump announced his support for the bill Friday, saying on Twitter that he encourages “all Republicans and Democrat to come together and VOTE YES” and that he looks forward to signing the bill as soon as possible. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said during a press conference Saturday that 2,226 domestic cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the U.S. Around 50 people have died after contracting the disease, Mr. Trump said at the press conference.

"Republicans and Democrats linked arms early Saturday morning and pushed a massive coronavirus relief package through the House, calling it a down payment on the kinds of assistance Americans are going to need as the epidemic sweeps the country, The bill now heads to the Senate where GOP leaders said they’ll study it over the weekend, with an eye toward votes next week. House lawmakers brushed aside worries about the price tag and voted on the bill without knowing a cost, saying the virus is an unprecedented threat that must be dealt with no matter what the damage to the budget. The new bill has the government pick up the tab for coronavirus testing, pumps money into food assistance and unemployment programs and pays for sick leave so those who contract COVID-19, or who have to take off to care for someone who did, will be compensated. “Democrats worked tirelessly with the Trump administration and with Republicans in the House and Senate to ensure this is a truly bipartisan bill,” said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer. Mr. Trump also praised the bipartisanship. “Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats,” he said on Twitter. “Bill really pulled together. Nice to see!” House members voted just after midnight on Saturday, capping a few days of feverish negotiations. The House had first been slated to vote Thursday, and then Friday, on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s version of a bill. But she negotiated changes with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and the final result won overwhelming support from both sides, 363-40. Every Democrat who voted backed the bill, while the “No” votes came from conservative Republicans. The chamber’s lone independent voted “present.” More than two dozen lawmakers missed the vote, including several who are in self-quarantine after coming into contact with someone who later tested positive for the virus. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said he expects the bill will have wide support in his chamber, too. But first the Senate must figure out how to get beyond a surveillance bill that’s the pending business on the floor. The emergency virus bill does not include President Trump’s demand for a payroll tax cut, nor other economic stimulus measures. Mrs. Pelosi said they’ll look at stimulus measures in a future bill, which won’t be as rushed as this one. The bill that did pass focuses on addressing needs amid massive public institution closures. A major selling point of the bill was getting food out into communities for children who rely on free meals at schools, which have been shuttered for weeks to try to control virus spread. The bill also suspends work requirements for those who apply for food stamps, and pumps money into state Medicaid programs, so they can handle an influx of patients. All sides agreed the biggest aspect of the bill was promoting testing, so public health officials can get a better sense for the extent of the virus.

"Vice President Mike Pence told White House staffers on Saturday to use “social distancing” and to “avoid physical contact” to protect themselves and their colleagues from the coronavirus. In a staff-wide email, Mr. Pence cited “additional cases throughout the National Capital Region” in urging they take proper precautions. “As an employee aboard the White House Complex, we have an additional duty to protect the health of our Executive Branch and those working with us,” the vice president said. He noted that healthcare experts on the task force he’s leading advise the following steps to reduce transmission and illness: President Trump said Saturday that he has been tested for the coronavirus and is awaiting the results. The president, who also shook hands with several guests at a press conference on Friday, acknowledged it’s a hard habit to break. “It’s sort of a natural reflex, and we’re all getting out of it,” Mr. Trump said. “All of us have that problem. We’re all getting out of that, shaking hands. It’s not a great thing to be doing right now. People are thinking about it more and more, we have to think about it, it’s important.” The White House also has begun taking the temperatures of everyone who could come in close proximity to the president and the vice president. Mr. Pence’s email noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “recommends home-quarantine only for those who have had close (within 6 feet) prolonged (>10 minutes) contact with a symptomatic (cough, fever, etc.) COVID-19 patient, or their respiratory droplets.” “This excludes casual, limited interactions such as handshakes, photographs, etc.,” he wrote. “If you interacted with an individual when they are without symptoms (asymptomatic), but whom subsequently receives a positive test, the risk of you becoming infected from that interaction is considered LOW. You do not require testing, nor home isolation.  Active social distancing would be appropriate.”  ",Pence urges White House staffers to 'avoid physical contact' and use social distancing,"Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/pence-urges-white-house-staffers-avoid-physical-co/,washington_times

"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Misdemeanor, traffic and petty offense cases in federal court have been postponed in the Eastern District of Virginia in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The district also has suspended all non-case related events, tours and other gatherings in courthouses, including naturalization ceremonies. Chief Judge Mark S. Davis said in a special order posted Thursday that there have been confirmed or presumptive cases of coronavirus within the Alexandria, Richmond and Norfolk divisions of the court. He also said there have been reports of people scheduled to appear in court who are under self-quarantine based on possible exposure. The order says the cases will be continued through April 30. New dates will be reset without the need to file any motions. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that the delays caused by the continuances will be excluded from requirements of the Speedy Trial Act. “In exceptional circumstances, any judge in the Court may make a case-specific exception to the District-wide continuance if the parties and counsel agree that there is a valid case-specific reason to proceed with a hearing,” the order says. No changes have been made to civil or criminal felony dockets. The courthouses and clerks’ offices remain open.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez urged young New Yorkers on Saturday to stop crowding into bars and restaurants amid the coronavirus outbreak because they might be spreading the pathogen even if they feel OK. The bartender-turned-congresswoman tweeted about the need for “social distancing” amid evidence people in urban areas, including the popular 14th Street area of D.C., aren’t heeding calls to stay at least six feet away from others to avoid spreading the viral disease, COVID-19. “To everyone in NYC but ESPECIALLY healthy people & people under 40 (bc from what I’m observing that’s who needs to hear this again): PLEASE stop crowding bars, restaurants, and public spaces right now. Eat your meals at home,” the progressive first-term House Democrat wrote. “If you are healthy, you could be spreading COVID.” By “crowded,” she meant any place where you could not stand at least six feet away from another person. Andy Slavitt, the former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama, echoed that advice, saying the tribulations in hard-hit Italy should serve as a warning. “What are mayors, governors & their staffs reporting? That people are jamming the bars,” Mr. Slavitt tweeted. “I get it. Home from work. Cooped up. Crisis mentality. We need to let steam off. Shared experience. But stop that. All the bars & restaurants are closed now across Europe.” As people stay home, however, workers who cannot telework or rely on tips will take a major financial hit. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said Washington needs to step in to provide relief, including a universal basic income. “The need for social distancing from restaurants only underscores the need for relief for tipped workers, freelancers, shift workers, etc.” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote. “Tax credits & unemployment insurance does not help many of these workers — that’s a huge segment of our economy. We need emergency UBI, now.” The coronavirus was discovered in China in December and has sicken more than 150,000 people around the world, while killing over 5,700. The U.S. has recorded nearly 2,500 cases and about 50 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - A group of sheriffs is suing Illinois to halt a 2017 law that bans police from detaining people based on their immigration status without a court-ordered warrant. The lawsuit states that the Illinois Trust Act interferes with law enforcement’s ability to respond to detainers issued by the U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement. The detainers require police to keep custody of prisoners who are in the U.S. illegally for up to two days.  The lawsuit was filed Monday by sheriffs from McHenry, Ogle, Stephenson and Kankakee counties. It names Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul as a defendant.  “This language requires Illinois law enforcement officers to comply with an immigration detainer they receive from those federal officers tasked with carrying out national immigration policy,” the lawsuit states. “Immigration detainers notify law enforcement officials that DHS (the Department of Homeland Security) has found probable cause that the person subject to the request is a removable alien.” The sheriffs said the act has exposed them and their offices to litigation over the years, as three of the four  have been sued for allegedly violating the statute. The Illinois Sheriffs’ Association said last month that some violent felons who had faced deportation are instead being released after their prison terms end as a result of a policy change by Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration. The sheriffs’ concerns came just days after President Donald Trump’s administration announced the unusual step of dispatching Customs and Border Patrol Agents to Chicago and other “sanctuary cities” that have set up impediments to enforcement. The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigrant Justice Center called the lawsuit “a thinly veiled attempt to justify ongoing violations of the law.”  “Under the Trust Act, Illinois simply requires that federal immigration officials provide a judicial warrant, like would be expected for any other arrest, before local law enforcement are permitted to honor an immigration detainer,” the groups said. “Nothing about the Trust Act is unconstitutional. It simply doesn’t comport with the way in which these four sheriffs want to conduct their work. Law enforcement in Illinois cannot pick and choose which laws they follow and which they do not.” The Trust Act, which the General Assembly approved, was  signed into law by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. Critics argued that it turned Illinois into a sanctuary state, which Rauner and other supporters denied.

"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - When New Mexico law enforcement agents carrying Glock pistols and AR-15 rifles enter homes in predawn raids these days, they sometimes find themselves outgunned by the crooks. That’s not the only troubling trend. Violent offenders are getting younger, often recruited by older career criminals who know that under the state or federal laws they face stiffer sentences if caught. And suspects aren’t only wearing bulletproof vests, they are selling them on the streets. Such is the state of violent crime in the Albuquerque metro area and elsewhere in New Mexico as an FBI-led violent crime task force begins its second year on the streets. Over the past 10 months, nearly 100 people have been arrested and 76 firearms confiscated by task force agents who work 16 to 18 hours a day and carry active caseloads of up to 80 each. As proof of its success - and the continuing criminal hold on New Mexico - the special force of FBI agents, New Mexico State Police, Albuquerque Police Department detectives and Bernalillo County Sheriff’s deputies is set to nearly double in size, said FBI violent crimes division supervisor Percy Giles. Eight new task force officers, including one from the state probation/parole office, will join the 11 other members – who include four APD detectives, one from the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department and a total of three positions from State Police. “It’s basically a force multiplier for us, and it’s going to give us additional resources to do the things we need to do at a faster rate,” Giles said. The new boost in federal funding for the effort “is a testament to all the partnerships and the work we’ve been seeing. …” Most of those arrested are prosecuted federally, where conviction rates are “extremely high,” Giles said. FBI Special Agent Bryan Acee, coordinator of the task force, told the Journal his team puts a “priority” on targeting “that dedicated career offender” who has violent crime and/or drug trafficking convictions. Giles added that “in working with our state and local partners, we’re also looking for the individuals who are creating the violent acts on the streets.” Even if they aren’t considered career criminals or don’t have long rap sheets of convictions, they might be targeted “based on intelligence that we’re seeing on the ground.” But the work is getting more dangerous. Over the past year, Acee said, task force members have seen an increase in high capacity magazines for pistols and rifles and the use of AR-15 pistols, which can be concealed. “We’re seeing a lot of the AR-15 pistols, which is essentially an AR-15 rifle (with the butt stock removed), the same rifle the FBI is carrying when they’re entering a house.” He said the team is also coming across an increase in Glock pistols, “there again, by the coincidence, the same gun we carry.” But there’s a difference in the firepower. Agents carry Glocks with magazines that hold 15 rounds. Offenders are now using high capacity 30- and 50-round magazines that can be inserted into Glock pistols. And Acee said the team is starting to see Glock full-automatic selector switches. “So you can have a Glock pistol, with a 50-round magazine, then you can insert a device at the back of the Glock which converts it into a machine gun, or fully automatic. “Simply stated, a regular squad of FBI agents going into a home, we’re carrying that Glock pistol. We’re carrying the AR-15. They have more firepower than we have going into the house.” Giles said the task force is seeing more targets with bulletproof vests. “If we are in a firefight, that basically makes things equal, because we have bulletproof vests, too. That emboldens them to potentially do harm to law enforcement. …” In one recent case, Matthew “Goat” Martinez, a member of the Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico prison gang, was out on the streets selling bulletproof vests. Undercover task force agents bought four of the vests from him before arresting him. Martinez was later convicted of possession of heroin with intent to distribute. Last month, the task force arrested Manuel Bolivar after a predawn raid in Southwest Albuquerque. They found 3 pounds of methamphetamine, almost $16,000 in cash, five pistols and two rifles, 96 blue fentanyl tablets, 155 packaged strips of suboxone and a bulletproof vest, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition. And they recovered a selector switch to allow a Glock 9mm pistol to be fired as a fully automatic firearm. Bolivar is 21 years old. “One of the trends that we’ve been seeing is, and that’s also with the gangs as well as the violent actors, is they’re becoming younger and younger,” Giles said. “The older guys tend to have more of a criminal history, more convictions, and the word is getting out on the techniques that we’re using … the more convictions you have, the higher your criminal points are on the federal side, which means more prison time if convicted. “So they’re sending juveniles to do their dirty work for them.” One task force member, the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department, had this to say about the effort: “Sheriff Manuel Gonzales believes that our partnership with Federal agencies is critical to assist in keeping our community, children, families and businesses safe. The additional staffing complements our previous crime fighting efforts and will also assist in stronger prosecution of the violent offenders.” Giles and Acee said the involvement of state and local agencies is invaluable. Task force members with state or local jurisdiction can often arrest an offender on state charges, while federal agents look at federal crimes that might be filed. Or, Acee said, in the case of an offender who is a felon suspected of committing a homicide with a firearm, “that APD detective on our task force can charge the offender with being a felon in possession of the firearms (in the federal courts) and we can run with that case while the state continues to investigate the homicide.” The result often is getting the offender off the streets. Giles said roughly 60% of the cases investigated by the task force are “proactive.” Offenders targeted typically have a criminal history and are suspected in other violent crimes. For example, Casiano Coronel at age 21 was charged as a habitual offender in state District Court in 2018. Last April, he pleaded no contest to aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer, aggravated DWI, child abuse and receiving or transferring a stolen motor vehicle. State District Judge Daniel Ramczyk of Albuqueque released Coronel on his personal recognizance and referred him to comply with “Youth Adult Court,” pending further resolution. But months later, Coronel became a suspect in a shooting under investigation and the violent crime task force opened a “proactive case” on him. In late June, the task force requested its probation and parole partners put Coronel on GPS monitoring, and he was placed under task force surveillance. Within days, Coronel cut off his ankle monitor and tried to carjack an undercover APD detective, who killed Coronel in a shootout. According to news reports, the detective was conducting surveillance. Giles said the case underscores why the task force is also requesting its own federal prosecutor. “We need to execute things in a swift manner, because these are dangerous individuals we are targeting. They’re dangerous for the community. They’re dangerous for law enforcement, so a swift apprehension is most preferred.”  ",New Mexico authorities eye tactic changes amid violent crime,"Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/new-mexico-authorities-eye-tactic-changes-amid-vio/,washington_times
"MOSCOW (AP) - Police in the Russian capital have detained dozens of people at a protest against political repression outside the headquarters of the Federal Security Service. The OVD-Info group that monitors arrests at demonstrations in Russia said 49 people were detained on Saturday. It was not immediately clear what charges would be filed. The detentions came as people stood in line to take part in a single picket protest. Russian law allows lone picketers without prior permission. Rotating single pickets, in which each person stands for a short period before giving way to the next, is a frequent strategy. The security service is the main successor to the Soviet KGB and its headquarters building on Lubyanka Square has strong symbolic resonance.

"IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - Amid growing concern about the expensive incentives promised to Amazon to land its new headquarters, Kentucky lawmakers considered a bill to shield its largest city’s failed pitch from public scrutiny. To open government advocates, the effort to hide Louisville’s bid was an outrage that soon got worse: A House committee approved the bill with an amendment barring residents outside Kentucky from obtaining public records on any subject. Labeled a “wrecking ball” to the public records law, the bill stalled last March amid opposition. But opponents are anxiously waiting to learn whether a similar measure will be introduced again. “I fear that something’s going to drop and it’s not going to be good,” said Amye Besenhaver of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition. Advocates like her in all 50 states are getting a new tool to help identify legislation like the Amazon bill that affect the public’s right to know - and give a glimpse of what’s happening across the country. The National Freedom of Information Coalition is launching a bill tracker that aims to find, in real-time, all pieces of legislation that affect government transparency in state legislatures. On its website, the coalition is releasing dashboards of pending or recent legislation in all states for Sunshine Week, an annual celebration of open government that runs from March 15-21. One goal is to alert the public quickly so advocates can try to stop anti-transparency bills from becoming law or from spreading to other states. Another is to allow journalists and researchers to spot trends, ranging from efforts to expunge more court cases from the public record to preventing out-of-state residents from seeking documents. In Kentucky’s case, the tool could have helped flag the Amazon secrecy bill as well as legislation in states like Tennessee and Kansas to require more, not less, transparency around economic development incentives. Daniel Bevarly, the coalition’s executive director, said tracking such bills is challenging because only a few states, such as Florida and Maine, require such legislation to state up-front that they would affect government transparency. The number of reporters covering statehouses also has dropped significantly in recent years, meaning there are fewer eyes watching legislative action. Anti-transparency provisions are often buried deep in legislation, some of which may be about unrelated topics, Bevarly said. The new program could act as an early alarm system that blocks poorly written bills from becoming laws. “Hopefully when we are tracking this, lawmakers will have a better idea that they are under close scrutiny by the public,” said Bevarly, whose group has state and regional affiliates representing 37 states. The program uses software from Quorum, a Washington D.C.-based technology company, that scrapes the raw text of bills from all 50 state legislative websites once or more a day. That information goes into a database where key search terms can be used to identify a bill’s potential relevance to a group or an industry. Quorum has previously launched bill-tracking efforts for groups such as the Sierra Club, which has credited the program with helping mobilize its response to legislation that would ban protests around critical infrastructures such as pipelines. The National Freedom of Information Coalition conducted a pilot program with Quorum on all 142,000 state bills introduced in 2019. It found that 13.6 percent of those, or more than 19,000, contained transparency-related search terms that the coalition wanted to track, including phrases such as “public record,” “open meeting” and “body camera.” In a report on the pilot program in January, the coalition said that volume of bills was “too great” and turned up some that were extraneous. The coalition said the tracker would be more successful in the future as its members refine search terms and tailor them to each state. Eventually, the program could use machine learning to further inform its tracking and output. Quorum co-founder and CEO Alex Wirth noted that most, but not all, of the coalition’s state affiliates tracked legislation and their methods for doing so varied greatly. He said his company is helping centralize that information “so that every state can be alerted when there is a piece of legislation.” “That is the big value and the breakthrough, and the next step on that journey will be making that available to all of their coalition members and the general public,” he said. Coalition outreach manager Kelsey Ryan, who helped investigate secrecy in Kansas government  when she was with the Kansas City Star, said the dashboard isn’t perfect yet but will allow for a “more analytical and thorough method for finding transparency-related bills.” “This is particularly true for states like my home state of Kansas, where legislators have a history of doing ‘gut-and-go’ bills - passing bills before the public ever has a chance to find out what the bill is about,” she said in an email. Besenhaver, the Kentucky advocate, said she tracks legislation “the old-fashioned way” by reviewing the text of proposed bills. But she said her approach is not exhaustive and it takes good luck not to miss any potentially important provisions. The Kentucky bill was introduced in February 2019 amid a pending lawsuit filed by the Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper seeking records about the city’s unsuccessful bid for Amazon’s “HQ2” project. The bill would have shielded all records related to “proposed economic development incentives not accepted” by businesses. Dozens of cities and states offered Amazon tax breaks and other incentives worth hundreds of millions of dollars or more for the project, which ultimately went to Arlington, Virginia. Amazon abandoned its plan to build a second location in New York City after opposition from residents and politicians. Some government agencies that did not land the project have sought to keep their bids secret, with varying degrees of success. In August, the Kentucky Court of Appeals ordered the Louisville Metro Government to release its records to the newspaper, but the ruling remains on appeal. “It’s pretty clear they were going to make some extreme concessions to try to bring Amazon in,” Besenhaver said. “The public needs to know that.”  ",Legislative tracker sounds alarm on anti-transparency bills,"Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/legislative-tracker-sounds-alarm-on-anti-transpare/,washington_times

Any journalist, news organization or First Amendment group will be able to search and download the information for research purposes or to create their own, more detailed tracking system.

"WASHINGTON — As the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates return to the debate stage, their party, the stakes, and the world look much different than in their last meeting less than three weeks ago. The fast-moving coronavirus was something of an afterthought in that debate; now the escalating crisis is likely to dominate Sunday’s contest. Rising infections in the United States and around the world have prompted a dramatic slowdown of global travel, upended financial markets, and raised questions about President Donald Trump’s ability to lead the nation through a prolonged period of uncertainty. Just two Democrats - former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - remain to make the case that they are best-positioned to challenge Trump in November. Five other candidates who joined them on stage in the Feb. 25 debate in South Carolina have dropped out, with many rallying behind Biden’s surging candidacy. For both Biden and Sanders, the debate is a moment to display their leadership skills in front of what could be one of the largest audiences of the primary. They’ll aim to draw a contrast with Trump, but also with each other, arguing that they have the right experience, temperament and policy prescriptions to lead the nation through a crisis. “Moments like these don’t come around often in campaigns and this is a perfect opportunity to show millions that you have what it takes,” said Robert Gibbs, former White House press secretary and campaign adviser to President Barack Obama. “They must show voters they are the answer to what is missing right now by being calm, honest, ready to lead and empathetic.” The coronavirus crisis rapidly upended plans for Sunday’s debate. First, the Democratic National Committee announced that it would hold the contest without a live audience. Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel. One of the moderators had to withdraw because of potential exposure to a person who tested positive for coronavirus. It is Biden who will step on stage as the front-runner, a distinction that seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago. After disappointing showings in the early contests, Biden roared back with a commanding victory in South Carolina and has continued to rack up wins across the country, winning broad and diverse coalitions of voters. Moderate Democratic leaders, including former rivals Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, have rallied behind his candidacy and voters have done the same. Advisers say Biden will aim in Sunday’s debate to show voters who backed Sanders or other liberal candidates that they have a home in his campaign. In one overture to liberals, Biden announced his support for a bankruptcy plan championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who ended her campaign earlier this month and has yet to endorse. In a virtual town hall on Friday, Biden said his support for Warren’s proposal, which aims to simplify the bankruptcy process, is “one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on.” Biden holds a solid lead over Sanders in the all-important delegate race, and a strong showing in Tuesday’s primary contests could effectively guarantee his nomination. Four big states will be up for grabs: Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and Florida, a perennial general election battleground where Biden appears to have an edge over Sanders. After a strong start, the race has moved rapidly away from Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist with a loyal following among young voters and liberals. But he’s failed to expand his appeal, particularly among black voters, and his calls for a sweeping political and economic revolution have also fallen flat with suburban voters. Sanders is facing some pressure from within the Democratic Party to step aside and allow Biden take Trump on one-on-one. Several Democratic groups that were waiting to endorse until after the primary have consolidated around Biden, including super PAC Priorities USA. Sanders’ advisers say he is a realist about his current standing and the difficulty of the path ahead. Yet the senator is pledging to grill Biden in Sunday’s debate on his plans for tackling college debt, for his past support of the Iraq war and for his backing of multilateral trade agreements. “I’m going to ask Joe Biden, I mean Joe is part of the establishment for a very long time, ‘Joe, what role have you played in trying to make sure that we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?” Sanders said Saturday during an online “fireside chat” with supporters. Yet it’s unclear if the issues Sanders is aiming to highlight will resonate with voters at a time when much of the nation’s focus has shifted to the growing toll of the coronavirus and put a spotlight on the need for presidential leadership. Schools and businesses across the country are closed, and many hospitals and clinics are struggling to obtain tests for the coronavirus. For Biden, the outbreak of a global pandemic has been a moment to bolster the central argument of his candidacy: that his eight years as vice president give him the experience, as well as the relationships in Washington and around the world, that are needed in the Oval Office during turbulent times. With campaign rallies halted because of warnings against large gatherings, Biden delivered a speech in front of reporters and advisers on his proposal for combating coronavirus, including guaranteeing free testing. Sanders’ later announced his own speech, which focused largely on advocating for his call to overhaul the nation’s health insurance system and replace it with a Medicare for All program. After Sunday’s debate, it’s unclear where the candidates and the campaign go from here. Neither Biden or Sanders has announced any public rallies for next week or given any indication of when they may be able to appear in person for voters again. ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC  ","Coronavirus crisis presents 'perfect opportunity' for Biden, Bernie"," -

"JERUSALEM (AP) - A Jerusalem district court announced on Sunday that it was postponing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s criminal trial for two months because of restrictions arising from the outbreak of the coronavirus. Netanyahu was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday to face charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in connection to a series of scandals. But following the emergency health measures the government enacted restricting the gathering of people in public places, the court announced that it was pushing back the hearing until May 24. Netanyahu is accused of receiving expensive gifts from wealthy friends and offering to exchange favors with powerful media moguls. The long-ruling Israeli leader denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a media-orchestrated witch hunt. Netanyahu’s lawyers had previously appealed for a delay, saying they needed more time to review evidence. But it was swiftly rejected on ground that the March 17 hearing was a procedural reading of the charges only and the defendant’s response was not needed. But after Netanyahu announced a new series of coronavirus-related restriction late Saturday, including the barring of gathering more than 10 people, the justice ministry announced a state of emergency in the courts as well. The virus has spread to more than 100 countries and infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,700. In Israel, some 200 people have been infected with no casualties yet, as severe measures seem to have proven effective thus far. Netanyahu’s legal troubles stood at the center of Israel’s third national election in less than a year. Like elections last April and September, the March 2 vote also ended inconclusively. Netanyahu’s opponent, Benny Gantz, refuses to sit with him in government and has been looking to push for legislation in the incoming parliament that would bar anyone indicted for a crime being able to lead a government - in effect disqualifying Netanyahu from leading the country. But the coronavirus crisis has raised calls for an emergency unity government instead.

"MADRID — Spain’s government said Saturday that the wife of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has tested positive for the new coronavirus. It said Begoña Gómez and the prime minister are in good health and following the instructions of medical authorities at their residence in La Moncloa Palace in Madrid, the government seat. Two ministers of Sánchez’s Cabinet, the minister of equality and the minister of regional affairs, had already tested positive earlier this week. The government said both are in good health as well. The others member of the Cabinet have tested negative. The government informed the media of Gómez’s infection shortly after Sánchez gave a nationally televised address to announce a battery of measures his government will take to combat the pandemic during a two-week state of emergency. Prior to the address, Sánchez presided at a seven-hour Cabinet meeting that was attended by all the ministers except for the two who had tested positive. Health authorities said Saturday that coronavirus infections have reached 5,753 people in Spain, half of them in Madrid, since the first case was detected in late January.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Saturday he had the power to fire or demote Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, adding new fuel to his long-running animus toward the central bank’s leader at a moment when the economy was at risk of edging into recession. Trump told reporters that he wasn’t considering firing Powell, but reiterated his frustration with the chairman. The comments were particularly striking because they came as the coronavirus pandemic shook the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst week since October 2008. In just a few weeks, U.S. stocks have lost all the gains made during 2019. “I have the right to do that or the right to remove him as chairman,” Trump said Saturday at a news conference called to provide an update on the administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. “He has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.” No Fed chairman has ever been removed by a president. The law creating the Fed says its officials and those of other independent agencies can be “removed for cause” by a president. While that issue has never arisen in regard to a Fed official, the courts ruled decades ago that “for cause” meant more than a policy disagreement. Powell announced earlier this month a half-point interest rate cut that shrank the Fed’s key rate to a range of just 1% to 1.25%. It marked the first time the central bank has cut rates between scheduled policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis. And it’s the steepest rate cut the Fed has made since then. Yet, the president continued to complain that he was “not happy with the Fed” because it was “following” and “we should be leading.” The president pointed to lower interest rates set by the central banks in Japan and Germany as proof that Powell had not been aggressive enough in bolstering the U.S. economy. Economists, however, say the lower rates reflect the weaker economic outlooks than the U.S. economy. Trump said he’s made no decision, but suggested he could simply remove him as chairman. Powell’s four-year term ends in February 2022, and his term as a member of the Board of Governors expires January 2028. “I have the right to also take him and put him in a regular position and put somebody else in charge. And I haven’t made any decisions on that,” the president said.  ",Trump threatens Fed chairman as coronavirus roils markets," -

"NEW YORK — As schools across the U.S. shut down in hopes of helping to fight the coronavirus, New York City officials are arguing just the opposite: They’re keeping the nation’s largest school system open to ensure that health and emergency workers aren’t tied down with kids at home. But teachers, many parents and some health experts say the city is making a grave mistake by continuing to call more than 1.1 million children to public schools even as it calls for “social distancing” elsewhere to stem the virus’ spread. While many families elsewhere in the country spent Saturday making hasty plans for an unexpected school shutdown, New Yorkers debated the city’s decision. “You’re not going to have a functioning health care system if the folks in the medical field, the doctors, the nurses, the techs, everyone has to stay home with their kids,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on MSNBC. Parent Anna Gold didn’t see it his way. “It would be a hardship if they closed the schools, but I think it’s a necessary one we need to take in the space of this emergency,” said Anna Gold, who pulled her third-grader and kindergartner out of public schools in Brooklyn on Friday and plans to keep them home next week. Another parent, Dori Kleinman, said she wishes the mayor would allow individual schools to make a decision about whether to close. “I don’t want my children at risk,” she said. New York City became a big outlier as other major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Boston, and several states decided to shutter schools for a week or more. New York health care workers’ unions said the city shouldn’t close schools without a plan to care for the children of those staffing hospital wards. The unions and city officials fear that even New York’s massive health care system could be quickly overwhelmed by a surge in serious cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “If it’s apparent it’s the safe thing, then it must be done, but it’s going to have a big impact on nurses,” said Eileen Toback, executive director of the New York Professional Nurses Union, which represents nurses at Manhattan’s Lenox Hill Hospital. “They’re on the front lines. They need to be here in shifts. They’re single mothers or single fathers sometimes, so they don’t have many backups, and the hospital is 24/7.” In a column in The New York Times, three teaches from Stuyvesant High pressured de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo to close the schools, and develop a plan to feed students that depend on school meals. The teachers describe a lengthy journey for some to and from school that puts students, their relatives and educators at risk. “No amount of hand washing and extra cleaning can prevent our thousands of students and hundreds of faculty and staff members from transmitting germs as they move in and out of classrooms for 10 periods a day,” Samantha Daves, Maura Dwyer and Annie Thoms wrote. De Blasio, a Democrat, has not ruled out closing schools eventually and said city officials would continue a day-by-day examination. But he has noted that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that while there can be reasons to shut schools, it’s not clear that closures will make more difference than other measures, such as hand-washing and isolating the sick. But Dr. Dena Grayson, a researcher and infectious disease expert who works in the private sector, called de Blasio’s decision so far to keep schools open “incredibly foolish.” “The virus will spread like wildfire among the children. They get infected, and they can spread that virus easily to older people who are at a much higher risk,” she said. The city has confirmed coronavirus cases in at least two public school students and at least one teacher. Their schools have been closed for cleaning but are expected to reopen. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover, but the outbreak has caused more than 5,000 deaths worldwide. Teachers’ unions are pressing de Blasio to close the schools, saying they’re worried for their students’ families, their own and New Yorkers at large. “To have 1.1 million students and countless employees crisscrossing the city, it feels to me beyond irresponsible,” says Derek Stampone, who teaches physics and computer science at a Manhattan high school where only about 2/3 of students showed up Friday, a dropoff echoed in the system as a whole. Stampone found himself spending much of Friday’s classes talking about the virus and such prevention tips as hand-washing. “I can see the anxiety in the room,” he said. So did social studies teacher Elise Ritter, who works at a different Manhattan high school that happens to focus on emergency management. The students who did attend, she said, were “really looking around and saying, ‘Why are we still here?’” Many live with grandparents and worry about them contracting the virus, she said. Teachers suggest the city could find ways to provide child care for health care workers - and supply food to the hundreds of thousands of poor students who depend on school meals - without keeping the entire school system open. De Blasio has said that any alternative would recreate the problem that closing schools would seek to solve: People congregating. Cuomo, a Democrat, said school closings remain “purely a local decision” unless a student tests positive, in which case a school must be closed for cleaning. “The closing of schools is a significant trade-off of benefits and burdens,” he said Saturday in a conference call with reporters. “If you close the schools, there are people who will not show up for work the next day. The public education system is also a day care, in many ways.” __ Associated Press reporters Adam Geller and Vanessa Alvarez contributed to this report.

Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel. One of the moderators had to withdraw because of potential exposure to a person who tested positive for coronavirus. It is Biden who will step on stage as the front-runner, a distinction that seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago. After disappointing showings in the early contests, Biden roared back with a commanding victory in South Carolina and has continued to rack up wins across the country, winning broad and diverse coalitions of voters. Moderate Democratic leaders, including former rivals Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, have rallied behind his candidacy and voters have done the same. Advisers say Biden will aim in Sunday’s debate to show voters who backed Sanders or other liberal candidates that they have a home in his campaign. In one overture to liberals, Biden announced his support for a bankruptcy plan championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who ended her campaign earlier this month and has yet to endorse. In a virtual town hall on Friday, Biden said his support for Warren’s proposal, which aims to simplify the bankruptcy process, is “one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on.” Biden holds a solid lead over Sanders in the all-important delegate race, and a strong showing in Tuesday’s primary contests could effectively guarantee his nomination. Four big states will be up for grabs: Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and Florida, a perennial general election battleground where Biden appears to have an edge over Sanders. After a strong start, the race has moved rapidly away from Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist with a loyal following among young voters and liberals. But he’s failed to expand his appeal, particularly among black voters, and his calls for a sweeping political and economic revolution have also fallen flat with suburban voters. Sanders is facing some pressure from within the Democratic Party to step aside and allow Biden take Trump on one-on-one. Several Democratic groups that were waiting to endorse until after the primary have consolidated around Biden, including super PAC Priorities USA. Sanders‘ advisers say he is a realist about his current standing and the difficulty of the path ahead. Yet the senator is pledging to grill Biden in Sunday’s debate on his plans for tackling college debt, for his past support of the Iraq war and for his backing of multilateral trade agreements. “I’m going to ask Joe Biden, I mean Joe is part of the establishment for a very long time, ‘Joe, what role have you played in trying to make sure that we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality where three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?” Sanders said Saturday during an online “fireside chat” with supporters. Yet it’s unclear if the issues Sanders is aiming to highlight will resonate with voters at a time when much of the nation’s focus has shifted to the growing toll of the coronavirus and put a spotlight on the need for presidential leadership. Schools and businesses across the country are closed, and many hospitals and clinics are struggling to obtain tests for the coronavirus. For Biden, the outbreak of a global pandemic has been a moment to bolster the central argument of his candidacy: that his eight years as vice president give him the experience, as well as the relationships in Washington and around the world, that are needed in the Oval Office during turbulent times. With campaign rallies halted because of warnings against large gatherings, Biden delivered a speech in front of reporters and advisers on his proposal for combating coronavirus, including guaranteeing free testing. Sanders‘ later announced his own speech, which focused largely on advocating for his call to overhaul the nation’s health insurance system and replace it with a Medicare for All program. After Sunday’s debate, it’s unclear where the candidates and the campaign go from here. Neither Biden or Sanders has announced any public rallies for next week or given any indication of when they may be able to appear in person for voters again. ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC  ","Coronavirus crisis presents 'perfect opportunity' for Biden, Bernie","Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/democratic-debate-coronavirus-crisis-presents-perf/,washington_times
"JERUSALEM (AP) - A Jerusalem district court announced on Sunday that it was postponing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s criminal trial for two months because of restrictions arising from the outbreak of the coronavirus. Netanyahu was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday to face charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in connection to a series of scandals. But following the emergency health measures the government enacted restricting the gathering of people in public places, the court announced that it was pushing back the hearing until May 24. Netanyahu is accused of receiving expensive gifts from wealthy friends and offering to exchange favors with powerful media moguls. The long-ruling Israeli leader denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a media-orchestrated witch hunt. Netanyahu’s lawyers had previously appealed for a delay, saying they needed more time to review evidence. But it was swiftly rejected on the grounds that the March 17 hearing was a procedural reading of the charges only and that the defendant’s response was not needed. But after Netanyahu announced a new series of coronavirus-related restrictions late Saturday, including the barring of gatherings of more than 10 people, the justice ministry announced a state of emergency in the courts as well. Much of the country ground to a standstill Sunday, with schools, malls and places of entertainment shut down. Employees were encouraged to work from home and strict restrictions have been placed on personal interactions. The virus has spread to more than 100 countries, infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,700. In Israel, some 200 people have been infected with no casualties yet, as severe measures seem to have proven effective so far. Netanyahu’s legal troubles stood at the center of Israel’s recent parliamentary election, the third such vote in less than a year. As previous elections last April and September, the March 2 vote also ended inconclusively. Netanyahu’s opponent, Benny Gantz, refuses to sit with him in the government and has been looking to push for legislation in the incoming parliament that would bar anyone indicted for a crime from leading a government - in effect disqualifying Netanyahu from remaining prime minister. But the coronavirus crisis has raised calls for an emergency unity government instead. Netanyahu formally extended an offer Sunday to Gantz to join a government aimed at at halting the spread of the virus, suggesting two frameworks, including one that would see an alternating leadership between them over the course of four years. “The state of Israel needs it. The people of Israel expect it,” Netanyahu said. But Gantz’s centrist Blue and White party seems to consider the outreach yet another ruse after what has been an extremely acrimonious campaign that included unfounded smears against Gantz. “Netanyahu, let’s not manipulate the public. If you’re interested in unity, why postpone your trial at 1 a.m. and send an ‘emergency unity’ outline to the press, rather than sending your negotiating team to a meeting,” Gantz responded on Twitter. “As opposed to you, I will continue to support every appropriate governmental measure, leaving political considerations aside. When you get serious, we can talk.” His fellow party leader and former military chief Moshe Yaalon was even more blunt, comparing Netanyahu’s conduct to that of Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “Whoever criticized us for warning against Israel turning into Erdogan’s Turkey should internalize the cynical exploitation of the corona crisis for the political needs of a man standing before trial,” he said. The anti-Netanyahu forces in the new incoming parliament command a 62-58 majority but are deeply divided among themselves, and appear unlikely to unite to form an alternative government. Against the backdrop of the public health scare, Israel’s president began a series of consultations Sunday with all the elected parties to determine who to tap as prime minister-designate. It typically goes to the leader of the largest party, which in this case would be Netanyahu, but could also go to Gantz if he secures more recommendations from lawmakers.  Given the circumstances, President Reuven Rivlin has implored for a power-sharing unity deal. “Anyone who has watched the news in recent days understands that this is a time of trial, and that these are not regular consultations,” he said. “We must now deal with forming a government as soon as possible … at this complex time.” If the deadlock continues, Israel could see itself heading toward a fourth straight election, which experts say would have disastrous effects on the public’s confidence in their elected officials and electoral system - regardless of the corona crisis.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Sunday that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are already in talks for a third coronavirus bill. On ABC’s “This Week,” Mr. Mnuchin explained that this latest package will be a stimulus bill targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as specific industries that have been hit hard by the virus, including the airline and cruise industries. “We will use whatever tools we have and whatever tools we don’t have we will go to Congress on a bipartisan basis and get more tools,” he said. “We’re in the second inning of nine innings.” Just after midnight on Saturday, the House passed a massive relief package to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers. It mandated free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone that does. The bill also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and school kids. It also bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. “This bill was very important in getting workers money in their pockets, people that have to be home,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The bill passed without lawmakers knowing exactly how much it will cost. This came after Congress passed an $8.3 billion bill to get more resources to state and local health officials. Mr. Mnuchin said he would also ask Congress to help the Federal Reserve have more resources to help the economy weather the virus. However, he would not comment on President Trump’s frustration with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. On Saturday, the president told reporters he had the power to fire or demote Mr. Powell, reiterating his frustrations at what he sees as a slow response. The Fed recently cut rates, now at historic lows, and offered $1.5 trillion in loans to banks. “I’m not going to make comments on that. It would be inappropriate for me as Treasury secretary,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The markets plummeted last week, but recovered somewhat on Saturday, which Mr. Mnuchin credits to the president’s national address Friday and the bipartisan bill.

"Dr. Antony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, urged Americans to shut down more aggressively as the coronavirus spreads. On MSNBC’s “Meet the Press” Mr. Fauci endorsed a 14-day “national shutdown” to help slow down the virus. He explained that he has brought it up with the administration, which is generally open to his ideas. “I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,” he said. On ABC’s “This Week” the doctor explained that lockdowns helped China and South Korea fight the rapid spread of the disease in their countries. China, he said, has reached its peak and is starting to see number of cases drop, whereas South Korea has flatlined. However, he warned that while its hard to predict exactly how long the virus will be a threat, the U.S. should prepare for this to last for several weeks or a few months. “What we should be doing is absolutely much much different. Not business as usual. Just chill down,” he said on ABC. Across the nation, public schools and events are being shut down as states and local officials try to contain the virus.

"VIENNA, Va. (AP) - Everything was in place: the silver kiddush cup beside the rolled-up Torah. The ceremonial candle, brushing braided challah. Twin boxes of Streit’s matzot, unopened. But this wasn’t a hushed synagogue readying for the holidays. It was a Northern Virginia high school - loud, growing louder as class let out one Tuesday last month. Jacob Book, 16, adjusted his kippah and stepped forward to face two dozen students, none of whom he knew, at James Madison High School, which he does not attend. He pointed to three friends standing beside him, behind the table with the challah. “We are here to talk about our lives as Jewish teens,” Book said, “to you.” He cleared his throat. “Other teens.” The afternoon in Vienna, Va., marked the 25th time this school year that Jewish students walked into Washington-area classrooms, gymnasiums or auditoriums - during or after class - to spend an hour explaining their faith to non-Jewish peers. The visits take place through Student to Student, an adaptation of a decades-old Missouri program that the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of Greater Washington brought to the District last school year in a bid to combat a massive spike in anti-Semitic bullying. Washington-area schools have suffered a spate of swastika-filled graffiti in recent months - and incidents of anti-Semitic harassment in K-12 schools nationwide quadrupled between 2015 and 2017, according to a study conducted by the Anti-Defamation League. At the same time, some express concern that awareness of the Holocaust may be diminishing. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that Americans 65 and older displayed slightly greater knowledge of the genocide than did younger generations. “We’re seeing a literal epidemic of anti-Semitism,” said Ron Halber, executive director of JCRC. “It has to be fought.” Trump’s executive order on campus anti-Semitism draws praise, concern During trips, Jewish high school students - belonging to Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist traditions - discuss topics such as how they celebrate Shabbat, which Jewish holiday is most important (“It’s not Hanukkah,” Book said to surprise) and the Holocaust. Then, they take questions from the adolescent audience, some of whom, said program director Sara Winkelman, have never met a Jewish person. “It’s like Judaism 101,” Winkelman said. “But from your peers - and that humanizes it.” The need to “humanize Judaism,” Halber said, also spurred JCRC to begin pushing for a law to improve Holocaust education in Virginia about the same time it introduced Student to Student. JCRC’s legislative lobbying found success last month when the Virginia General Assembly passed a bill that forms a committee to revise how the state teaches students about the Holocaust, genocide and slavery. The legislation awaits the signature of Gov. Ralph Northam (D), whose spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky declined to say whether he plans to sign it. Yarmosky promised the governor will “carefully review” the legislation and said Northam “is committed to ensuring a safe, tolerant and inclusive school environment.” Schools throughout the nation are struggling to handle the outbreak of anti-Semitic harassment, experts said, and to ensure students graduate with a solid grasp of the Holocaust. In many places, Jewish groups are stepping in to help, said Barbara S. Burstin, a University of Pittsburgh lecturer who teaches on the Holocaust and the American Jewish experience. Often, that assistance has involved lobbying for bills similar to the one just passed in Virginia, Burstin said. Twelve states require Holocaust education by law - a number that jumped over the past few years, Burstin said, largely attributable to the efforts of Jewish organizations and Holocaust centers. School officials in Maryland strengthen requirements for Holocaust education Virginia is one of the 12, though Halber says its required lessons - listed in a state Education Department handout that says students should know the Holocaust is “prejudice . . . taken to the extreme” - lack gravity and detail. Education Department spokesman Charles Pyle noted “the department supports” the JCRC-backed bill, meant to make the state’s offerings more comprehensive. “This push for Holocaust education has been ongoing - but getting students to talk to students?” Burstin said. “Huh. Wow! I’ve never heard of anything like that before.” Inside James Madison High, Sam Nunez, 17, listened with arms folded across his Virginia Tech sweatshirt as the four presenters shifted the conversation to food. After sharing their favorites (matzoh ball soup was on three of four lists), the teens summarized Jewish dietary rules and rituals. Rachel Friedman, 16, raised a blue plastic pack of Oreos: These, she said, are kosher, meaning the cookies were prepared in accordance with Jewish culinary precepts. Those rules stipulate that Jews cannot eat pork or mix dairy products and meat, Friedman said. “Also, no shellfish,” she said. “So no shrimp and no lobster.” Nunez, increasingly agitated, could hold back no longer. “Ever?” he interrupted, uncrossing his arms, and most of the room giggled. Afterward, Nunez said the presentation taught him “new things about Judaism.” He knows some Jewish students at school, he said, but would never have thought to ask about their religion. This is the power of Student to Student, said Rori Picker Neiss, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of St. Louis, which originated the program. The St. Louis JCRC, inspired by an initiative that brought Israeli Jewish teenagers to talk to their American counterparts, launched Student to Student with six presenters in 1992. Popular from the start, it grew rapidly: Today, the Missouri program involves roughly 120 Jewish teens and reaches 4,000 non-Jewish teens each year, Picker Neiss said. It has also proved effective at fighting hatred - in yearly surveys conducted by the St. Louis JCRC, teachers reported that, after a Student to Student visit, their classrooms saw reductions in anti-Semitic bullying. Still, no one thought of extending the program beyond St. Louis, Picker Neiss said, until the recent national surge in anti-Semitism. Fueled by anxiety - and two grants totaling $30,000 from a Jewish nonprofit - her organization collaborated with Jewish groups and schools to launch Student to Student in Chicago, Indianapolis, Des Moines and the D.C. area. The ambition, Picker Neiss said, is to spread Student to Student to all 50 states. “An adult comes, and teens’ eyes glaze over,” she said. “But when they can interact with one another, they just perk up right away.” The program falls within a long tradition of “what you might call Jewish-American public relations campaigns,” said Hasia R. Diner, a professor at New York University who studies American Jewish history. The campaigns, often waged by faith leaders or activist groups in response to upswells in anti-Semitism, sent Jewish adults into libraries or churches to explain their religion to non-Jews. One came in the 1920s, amid heightened activity of the Ku Klux Klan, Diner said, another during Adolf Hitler’s ascent to power in the 1930s, still another during the 1950s. In the 1980s, Holocaust survivors began traveling the country to share their experiences in concentration camps - although that effort is ending, as survivors die or grow too old to continue. There is “no real sense” of the efficacy of these initiatives, Diner said. Today’s landscape of anti-Semitic harassment, she noted, may suggest they were in vain. “But I’m glad to know of Student to Student,” she said. “Teaching people how wrong their prejudices are, catching them young, with the young . . . maybe that works.” The stint at James Madison was Book’s third time participating in a Student to Student presentation. He often wonders, afterward, how his words affected fellow high school students. Most seem curious, Book said, eager to learn. One response he will never forget. At a presentation last month, Book began by telling the audience that he is Orthodox and attends a private, all-Jewish school in Rockville, Md. He joined Student to Student, he said, because he believes hatred will subside if Jews and non-Jews get to know each other. Near the hour’s end, a student raised her hand. “She asked me, why do I go to a Jewish school if I’m so interested in teaching about Judaism?” Book said. “Why am I keeping myself in the bubble?” Book did not know what to say. The silence stretched, so he blurted that it’s nice to be around people who “share the same morals” - but that, Book felt, was not quite right. He has thought more, since. He still doesn’t know the answer.

"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Turkish and Russian troops began joint patrols Sunday on a key highway in northwestern Syria, Turkey’s Defense Ministry said, while both the Russian government and Syrian opposition activists said the patrols were shortened because of protests.  Patrols on the highway known as the M4, which runs east-west through Idlib province, are part of a cease-fire agreement between Turkey and Russia signed earlier this month. The cease-fire ended an escalation in fighting that saw the Turkish military in rare direct conflict with Syrian government troops. The vital highway, which runs through northern Syria from the Mediterranean to the Iraqi border, has been partially closed since 2012. Work has been underway over the past days to refurbish it for traffic. Some sections of the M4 remain under rebel control, unlike the  north-south M5 highway, which Syrian forces completely recaptured in the latest offensive. For the past three days, residents along rebel-held parts of the M4 have protested in rejection of Russian troops patrolling the road because of Moscow’s strong support to Syrian government forces.  “The first Turkish-Russian united land patrol was carried out on the M4 highway in Idlib with the involvement of land and air elements,” Turkey’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Turkey and Russia carried out their first joint patrol mission along the M4 highway Sunday adding that “the patrols’ route was shortened” after militants used women and children to block the way. The Defense Ministry’s statement was carried by state-run news agency Tass. Ankara has been given additional time to ensure the safety of troops taking part in joint patrols, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Syrian opposition activists said residents blocked the highway with burning tires near the village of Nairab on the southern edge of Idlib in rejection to patrols by “Russian occupation forces.” The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor with activists on the ground in Syria, said the joint patrols were not successful as they moved a short distance west of the government held town of Saraqeb before being stopped by the protests.  It added that jihadi groups have threatened to attack Russian forces on the highway. Idlib is mostly controlled by al-Qaida-linked militants.  Ankara backs some of the opposition groups in Idlib, the fighters’ final stronghold against the Russian-backed forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Some 60 Turkish soldiers have been killed in Idlib since the start of February as Syrian troops carried out a ground and air offensive into the province that began in early December. The assault killed hundreds of civilians and sent 1 million fleeing towards the Turkish border. Russian officials visited Ankara last week to hammer out the cease-fire. After four days of talks, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkey hoped the deal would prove to be permanent. Turkey and Russia already conduct joint military patrols elsewhere in Syria. Following an agreement that halted Turkey’s attack on Kurdish forces in October, soldiers from the two countries monitor an area of northeast Syria along the Turkish border.

"With many houses of worship shuttered around the country, President Trump proclaimed Sunday a national day of prayer for all Americans affected by the coronavirus pandemic and for the national response efforts. He said Americans must remember that “no problem is too big for God to handle.” Mr. Trump urged people “of all faiths and religious traditions and backgrounds to offer prayers for all those affected, including people who have suffered harm or lost loved ones.” “As we continue to face the unique challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, millions of Americans are unable to gather in their churches, temples, synagogues, mosques, and other houses of worship,” the president said in a proclamation. “But in this time we must not cease asking God for added wisdom, comfort, and strength, and we must especially pray for those who have suffered harm or who have lost loved ones.” He said, “In our times of greatest need, Americans have always turned to prayer to help guide us through trials and periods of uncertainty.  I ask you to join me in a day of prayer for all people who have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and to pray for God’s healing hand to be placed on the people of our nation.” “We should all take to heart the holy words found in 1 Peter 5:7:  ‘Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you,’” the president’s proclamation said. “Let us pray that all those affected by the virus will feel the presence of our Lord’s protection and love during this time.  With God’s help, we will overcome this threat.” Mr. Trump declared a national emergency on Friday, freeing up about $50 billion in federal aid to combat the virus in states and localities. “I now encourage all Americans to pray for those on the front lines of the response, especially our nation’s outstanding medical professionals and public health officials who are working tirelessly to protect all of us from the coronavirus and treat patients who are infected; all of our courageous first responders, National Guard, and dedicated individuals who are working to ensure the health and safety of our communities; and our Federal, State, and local leaders,” the proclamation said. “We are confident that He will provide them with the wisdom they need to make difficult decisions and take decisive actions to protect Americans all across the country.  As we come to our Father in prayer, we remember the words found in Psalm 91:  ‘He is my refuge and my fortress:  my God; in him will I trust.’” The proclamation continued, “As we unite in prayer, we are reminded that there is no burden too heavy for God to lift or for this country to bear with His help. Luke 1:37 promises that ‘For with God nothing shall be impossible,’ and those words are just as true today as they have ever been.” “As one Nation under God, we are greater than the hardships we face, and through prayer and acts of compassion and love, we will rise to this challenge and emerge stronger and more united than ever before,” he said. “May God bless each of you, and may God bless the United States of America.”  ",Trump proclaims national day of prayer for Americans affected by coronavirus,"Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/donald-trump-proclaims-national-day-prayer-america/,washington_times
"Though it was certain to come at some point, Joe Biden picked up a big endorsement Saturday when the country’s largest union — the National Education Association — backed his presidential bid. The NEA and the American Federation of Teachers, the powerful teachers’ unions, are rock solid Democrats and in the general election back that party’s candidate. But prior to the NEA’s announcement they had waffled a bit, telling members that either Mr. Biden or Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders had their support. Since Mr. Biden cruised to an impressive victory in the Michigan primary and others last Tuesday, however, it has become clear his lead in delegates makes him the overwhelming favorite to clinch the Democratic nomination this summer. “Biden is the tireless advocate for public education and is the partner that students and educators need now in the White House,” NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia said in a statement. Thus far in 2020, Mr. Sanders has been the biggest recipient of NEA cash, according to OpenSecrets.com, which puts his total of $18,734 well ahead of Mr. Biden’s $7,595. The NEA endorsement means Mr. Biden can now finish the primary season with the union’s considerable muscle and deep pockets behind his campaign. In the 2016 presidential election year, the NEA showered $11.14 million on politics, and among direct contributions to candidates 84% — $2.88 million — of its giving went to Democrats, according to Open Secrets.

"MADRID — Spain’s government said Saturday that the wife of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has tested positive for the new coronavirus. It said Begoña Gómez and the prime minister are in good health and following the instructions of medical authorities at their residence in La Moncloa Palace in Madrid, the government seat. Two ministers of Sánchez’s Cabinet, the minister of equality and the minister of regional affairs, had already tested positive earlier this week. The government said both are in good health as well. The others member of the Cabinet have tested negative. The government informed the media of Gómez’s infection shortly after Sánchez gave a nationally televised address to announce a battery of measures his government will take to combat the pandemic during a two-week state of emergency. Prior to the address, Sánchez presided at a seven-hour Cabinet meeting that was attended by all the ministers except for the two who had tested positive. Health authorities said Saturday that coronavirus infections have reached 5,753 people in Spain, half of them in Madrid, since the first case was detected in late January.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Saturday he had the power to fire or demote Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, adding new fuel to his long-running animus toward the central bank’s leader at a moment when the economy was at risk of edging into recession. Trump told reporters that he wasn’t considering firing Powell, but reiterated his frustration with the chairman. The comments were particularly striking because they came as the coronavirus pandemic shook the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst week since October 2008. In just a few weeks, U.S. stocks have lost all the gains made during 2019. “I have the right to do that or the right to remove him as chairman,” Trump said Saturday at a news conference called to provide an update on the administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. “He has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.” No Fed chairman has ever been removed by a president. The law creating the Fed says its officials and those of other independent agencies can be “removed for cause” by a president. While that issue has never arisen in regard to a Fed official, the courts ruled decades ago that “for cause” meant more than a policy disagreement. Powell announced earlier this month a half-point interest rate cut that shrank the Fed’s key rate to a range of just 1% to 1.25%. It marked the first time the central bank has cut rates between scheduled policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis. And it’s the steepest rate cut the Fed has made since then. Yet, the president continued to complain that he was “not happy with the Fed” because it was “following” and “we should be leading.” The president pointed to lower interest rates set by the central banks in Japan and Germany as proof that Powell had not been aggressive enough in bolstering the U.S. economy. Economists, however, say the lower rates reflect the weaker economic outlooks than the U.S. economy. Trump said he’s made no decision, but suggested he could simply remove him as chairman. Powell’s four-year term ends in February 2022, and his term as a member of the Board of Governors expires January 2028. “I have the right to also take him and put him in a regular position and put somebody else in charge. And I haven’t made any decisions on that,” the president said.

"NEW YORK — As schools across the U.S. shut down in hopes of helping to fight the coronavirus, New York City officials are arguing just the opposite: They’re keeping the nation’s largest school system open to ensure that health and emergency workers aren’t tied down with kids at home. But teachers, many parents and some health experts say the city is making a grave mistake by continuing to call more than 1.1 million children to public schools even as it calls for “social distancing” elsewhere to stem the virus’ spread. While many families elsewhere in the country spent Saturday making hasty plans for an unexpected school shutdown, New Yorkers debated the city’s decision. “You’re not going to have a functioning health care system if the folks in the medical field, the doctors, the nurses, the techs, everyone has to stay home with their kids,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on MSNBC. Parent Anna Gold didn’t see it his way. “It would be a hardship if they closed the schools, but I think it’s a necessary one we need to take in the space of this emergency,” said Anna Gold, who pulled her third-grader and kindergartner out of public schools in Brooklyn on Friday and plans to keep them home next week. Another parent, Dori Kleinman, said she wishes the mayor would allow individual schools to make a decision about whether to close. “I don’t want my children at risk,” she said. New York City became a big outlier as other major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Boston, and several states decided to shutter schools for a week or more. New York health care workers’ unions said the city shouldn’t close schools without a plan to care for the children of those staffing hospital wards. The unions and city officials fear that even New York’s massive health care system could be quickly overwhelmed by a surge in serious cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “If it’s apparent it’s the safe thing, then it must be done, but it’s going to have a big impact on nurses,” said Eileen Toback, executive director of the New York Professional Nurses Union, which represents nurses at Manhattan’s Lenox Hill Hospital. “They’re on the front lines. They need to be here in shifts. They’re single mothers or single fathers sometimes, so they don’t have many backups, and the hospital is 24/7.” In a column in The New York Times, three teaches from Stuyvesant High pressured de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo to close the schools, and develop a plan to feed students that depend on school meals. The teachers describe a lengthy journey for some to and from school that puts students, their relatives and educators at risk. “No amount of hand washing and extra cleaning can prevent our thousands of students and hundreds of faculty and staff members from transmitting germs as they move in and out of classrooms for 10 periods a day,” Samantha Daves, Maura Dwyer and Annie Thoms wrote. De Blasio, a Democrat, has not ruled out closing schools eventually and said city officials would continue a day-by-day examination. But he has noted that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that while there can be reasons to shut schools, it’s not clear that closures will make more difference than other measures, such as hand-washing and isolating the sick. But Dr. Dena Grayson, a researcher and infectious disease expert who works in the private sector, called de Blasio’s decision so far to keep schools open “incredibly foolish.” “The virus will spread like wildfire among the children. They get infected, and they can spread that virus easily to older people who are at a much higher risk,” she said. The city has confirmed coronavirus cases in at least two public school students and at least one teacher. Their schools have been closed for cleaning but are expected to reopen. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover, but the outbreak has caused more than 5,000 deaths worldwide. Teachers’ unions are pressing de Blasio to close the schools, saying they’re worried for their students’ families, their own and New Yorkers at large. “To have 1.1 million students and countless employees crisscrossing the city, it feels to me beyond irresponsible,” says Derek Stampone, who teaches physics and computer science at a Manhattan high school where only about 2/3 of students showed up Friday, a dropoff echoed in the system as a whole. Stampone found himself spending much of Friday’s classes talking about the virus and such prevention tips as hand-washing. “I can see the anxiety in the room,” he said. So did social studies teacher Elise Ritter, who works at a different Manhattan high school that happens to focus on emergency management. The students who did attend, she said, were “really looking around and saying, ‘Why are we still here?’” Many live with grandparents and worry about them contracting the virus, she said. Teachers suggest the city could find ways to provide child care for health care workers - and supply food to the hundreds of thousands of poor students who depend on school meals - without keeping the entire school system open. De Blasio has said that any alternative would recreate the problem that closing schools would seek to solve: People congregating. Cuomo, a Democrat, said school closings remain “purely a local decision” unless a student tests positive, in which case a school must be closed for cleaning. “The closing of schools is a significant trade-off of benefits and burdens,” he said Saturday in a conference call with reporters. “If you close the schools, there are people who will not show up for work the next day. The public education system is also a day care, in many ways.” __ Associated Press reporters Adam Geller and Vanessa Alvarez contributed to this report.

"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo — States across the U.S. are allocating hundreds of millions of dollars to respond to the coronavirus, even as the U.S. government prepares to send billions more their way. Many states have built up sizable stockpiles in their “rainy day” funds during several robust years of tax collections. Some governors and state lawmakers now are tapping into those savings for emergency expenses. Others are looking to set aside even more in reserve, fearing the economic uncertainties stemming from the coronavirus could send tax revenues into a tailspin. “Forget the closure on Broadway - the loss of revenue to the state government, right now, is incalculable,” said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. He pulled the curtain on Broadway theaters this past week while banning gatherings of 500 or more people. President Donald Trump said Friday that he would free up as much as $50 billion for state and local governments as he declared the virus pandemic a national emergency. Many governors also have declared emergencies, giving themselves greater flexibility to spend money and waive regulations as needed. “All the resources we can have on hand - to make sure if things get worse - we want,” said Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, while announcing a state of emergency just hours after the president did so. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. State and local public health agencies have been on the front lines of the response, monitoring and testing those suspected of having the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease. Costs are mounting for staff time and medical supplies. But states also are bracing for a potential ripple effect on their revenues. The cancellation of major sporting and entertainment events could mean less tax revenue from tourists and local residents. Directives to work and study at home instead of at offices, schools and colleges could mean less revenue from fuel taxes and public transit fares. And if some employees can’t go to work, that could put a damper on state income and withholding taxes while driving up spending for public welfare programs such as unemployment insurance and state Medicaid health care programs. “It definitely has the potential to have a significant impact on state budgets - both on the spending and revenue side,” said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers. “One positive, if you want to use that word, is that this is coming after a period where states have seen strong revenue growth for the past couple of years … and have been able to increase the size of their rainy day funds and reserves,” Sigritz added. Across all states last fiscal year, the median rainy day fund balance equaled 7.6% of general fund expenditures. That’s a record high that was way up from a 1.6% share of general fund expenditures in the 2010 fiscal year, according to the budget officers group. In Washington state, which has seen the greatest number of U.S. coronavirus deaths, lawmakers this past week approved a budget that draws $200 million from the state’s rainy day fund. Of that, $175 million is to go to the public health system with the rest going to a special unemployment fund for affected businesses and workers. “The urgency of this is clear, the demand for action is clear, and we’ll stretch this as far as we can and we’ll find some way to finance more if we have to,” said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat. While tapping the emergency fund, Washington state lawmakers also pared back some proposed spending, allowing the state’s reserves to continue to grow in case the coronavirus causes more budgetary hardships. Georgia lawmakers this past week approved shifting $100 million from the state’s $2.8 billion of reserves into a governor’s emergency fund for the coronavirus. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, signed legislation allowing the state to tap up to $50 million from its rainy day fund. The spread of the coronavirus has coincided with crunch time in some state legislatures. Florida lawmakers, for example, extended their 60-day session that was scheduled to end Friday while working on a budget plan that has been complicated by the coronavirus outbreak. Concern about the economy has prompted budget writers to consider adding hundreds of millions of additional dollars to the state’s reserves to help offset any potential shortfalls. Some states where legislatures already had wrapped up budgets are now scrambling to account for the coronavirus costs. New Mexico lawmakers adjourned Feb. 20. This past week, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed about $150 million in infrastructure spending as coronavirus concerns caused world oil prices to plunge. The oil sector is a mainstay of the New Mexico economy. The cuts included nearly $50 million for local transportation projects plus funding for a rural water system, a preschool and senior center at Native American communities, and improvements at district courts. ___ Associated Press writers Jeff Amy in Atlanta; Bobby Caina Calvan in Tallahassee, Florida; Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington; Morgan Lee in Sante Fe, New Mexico; and Marina Villeneuve in Albany, New York, contributed to this report.

"TRENTON, N.J. — Officials are considering a statewide curfew to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Sunday morning. Hoboken already implemented one - from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. - starting Monday. Murphy was asked about curfews and also self-quarantine after Teaneck Mayor Mohammed Hameeduddin called for a citywide self-quarantine for the Bergen County town hit hard by COVID-19. “We’re not there at a statewide level on either of those steps, but we could be,” Murphy said on WBLS-FM 107.5. “The curfew is probably, of the two, is probably the more immediate one under consideration.” Murphy on Saturday night announced the second death in the state from coronavirus, a woman in her 50s who was being cared for at CentraState Medical Center in Monmouth County. Earlier, he had announced 19 new positive cases, bringing the statewide total to 69. More than a third of the COVID-19 cases - 25 - are in Bergen County, with 10 in Middlesex County, according to the state Department of Health website. The New Jersey Department of Corrections said its suspending visits for the next 30 days as of Saturday evening. Murphy said earlier that the state is preparing for closing schools statewide, though he stopped short of taking that step. He said it’s a matter of when, not if, they close. Education officials said some 354 districts, or roughly half, in the state have closed already. ___ HOBOKEN CURFEW Hours after announcing that gyms, health clubs, day cares and movie theaters would join the list of closures in Hoboken, Mayor Ravi S. Bhalla announced the forthcoming curfew and additional restrictions. The citywide curfew that begins Monday will be in effect from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. and requires all residents to remain in their homes, barring emergencies. People who are required to report to work are exempted. To further limit gatherings, the city’s Office of Emergency Management will not permit restaurants and bars to serve food within their premises. Bars that don’t serve food will be shut down, effective Sunday at 11 a.m. Any establishment that serves food will be allowed to conduct takeout and delivery service. Bhalla said that, as he was writing the statement, he received a call from the city’s police chief notifying him of a bar fight in downtown Hoboken. One person fell in and out of consciousness and police waited more than 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive because of the number of service calls emergency services have received. He said the incident illustrated how bar operations “can trigger calls for service that are delayed in part because of this public health crisis.” ___ COURTS SUSPENSION The chief justice of New Jersey’s court system announced a two-week suspension of municipal court sessions to mitigate public exposure to the coronavirus. Chief Justice Stuart Rabner said Saturday that individuals scheduled to appear through March 27 before a municipal court to contest a traffic or parking ticket or for a minor local ordinance violation should await notice of a new court date. Municipal courts will continue to handle some things such as applications for temporary restraining orders, hearings in which a defendant has been detained and matters that implicate public safety. Filings and payments will continue to be accepted except where a municipality has closed the municipal court building. Rabner earlier announced an indefinite suspension in all new jury trials, criminal and civil, in New Jersey due to the coronavirus outbreak. The order Thursday said jury trials already underway will continue and grand jury proceedings will continue pending further communication with county prosecutors and the state attorney general. ___ DRIVER’S LICENSES AND REGISTRATIONS State officials announced a two-month extension of expiration dates for driver’s licenses as well as vehicle registrations and inspection stickers. Murphy and Sue Fulton, chief administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, said the extensions apply to driver licenses expiring in March, April, and May; to registrations expiring in March, April, and May; and for inspection stickers expiring in March, April, and May. ___ CASES For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. ___ • The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Sunday that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are already in talks for a third coronavirus bill. On ABC’s “This Week,” Mr. Mnuchin explained that this latest package will be a stimulus bill targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as specific industries that have been hit hard by the virus, including the airline and cruise industries. “We will use whatever tools we have and whatever tools we don’t have we will go to Congress on a bipartisan basis and get more tools,” he said. “We’re in the second inning of nine innings.” Just after midnight on Saturday, the House passed a massive relief package to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers. It mandated free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone that does. The bill also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and school kids. It also bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. “This bill was very important in getting workers money in their pockets, people that have to be home,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The bill passed without lawmakers knowing exactly how much it will cost. This came after Congress passed an $8.3 billion bill to get more resources to state and local health officials. Mr. Mnuchin said he would also ask Congress to help the Federal Reserve have more resources to help the economy weather the virus. However, he would not comment on President Trump’s frustration with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. On Saturday, the president told reporters he had the power to fire or demote Mr. Powell, reiterating his frustrations at what he sees as a slow response. The Fed recently cut rates, now at historic lows, and offered $1.5 trillion in loans to banks. “I’m not going to make comments on that. It would be inappropriate for me as Treasury secretary,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The markets plummeted last week, but recovered somewhat on Saturday, which Mr. Mnuchin credits to the president’s national address Friday and the bipartisan bill.

"A former staffer in House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff’s office has tested positive for coronavirus. “We consulted with the House Attending physician and will be acting on their recommendations. Medical professionals believe that my former staff member likely contracted the virus after leaving the office, but we will still be taking additional precautions over the next few days,” the California Democrat said in a statement. The staffer left Mr. Schiff’s office 10 days ago. Mr. Schiff had already suspended public events in his district this coming week-long recess and ordered his staff to work from home before they found out about the sick staffer. Several outlets are reporting that the staffer is Daniel Goldman, who helped Mr. Schiff throughout the impeachment investigation as his top legal aide. Mr. Goldman spent the last week detailing on Twitter the difficultly he had trying to get a test for the coronavirus. Let’s be very clear: unless you have pneumonia and traveled to one of 5 high-risk countries recently, you can NOT get a #COVID19 test in New York City. If you, like me, have a fever and a headache (but tested negative for the flu), you are unable to rule out #COVID19. Shameful. Last week, a senate staffer working for Sen. Maria Cantwell also tested positive, prompting her D.C. office to close as they worked to sanitize the workspace. Across Capitol Hill, several lawmakers have already gone into self-quarantine after coming into contact with individuals who contracted the disease.

"Republican Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said Sunday that schools in his state could remain closed for the rest of the year. “You know, this may not peak until the latter part of April or May. So we’ve informed the superintendents, while we’ve closed schools for three weeks, that the odds are this is going to go on a lot longer and it would not surprise me at all if schools did not open again this year,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Ohio is one of several states across the country that have moved to shut down public schools in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Many universities as well have closed campuses and moved to online classes. Earlier this week, Mr. DeWine said, based on models and what he’s heard from experts, there are likely 100,000 undiagnosed cases of coronavirus in the state, and cases were likely to double every six days. The point of that was to illustrate to people that we have a lot of people walking around Ohio who are positive who haven’t been tested.

WHO is coordinating global response and has sent teams inside China to learn how the virulent bug sprouted and infected over 80,000 Chinese, by far the world’s most by country. Zhao Lijan, spokesperson and deputy director general of the Foreign Ministry information department, shifted virus blame to America on Twitter. “What are the names of the hospitals?

The that the deadly SARS, also a coronavirus,  was traced to bats fancied by the region’s diners. China’s Western critics have blamed the virus’s fast spread on the communism regime’s secrecy.

"A top member of the White House task force on combating the spread of coronavirus says the administration has “not seriously discussed” restricting travel within the United States. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, said on ABC’s “This Week” that the idea of domestic travel restrictions have come up during administration deliberations but such action is unlikely “right now or in the immediate future.” Fauci’s comments come a day after President Donald Trump told reporters that he was considering imposing restrictions on travel within the U.S. to areas hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The president said Saturday he was also adding the United Kingdom and Ireland to a list of countries that would face sweeping travel restrictions over the next 30 days. Last week, Trump announced a temporary suspension of travel into the U.S. for foreigners who had recently spent time in the 26-nation Schengen area, the European Union’s border-free travel zone.

"The Senate will convene Monday amid coronavirus panic with an eye toward “swiftly” voting on the massive relief package that cleared the House early Saturday morning, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday night. The Kentucky Republican, in a statement, implicitly rejected calls to send the Senate home and pass the coronavirus bill through an abbreviated process. He said they still have work to finish not only on the virus, but also on a bill to extend the government’s secret surveillance capabilities. House lawmakers, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, approved legislation that would boost food assistance for those struggling during the virus crisis, would give an infusion of cash to the unemployment program and to state Medicaid funds so they can treat those who contract COVID-19, and would give companies means to pay workers forced to take off because of the virus. Mr. McConnell called those first steps, and said he and his troops are already working on other legislation to bolster the economy amid a coronavirus downturn. “This new disease is challenging our great nation in unfamiliar ways. But we have overcome far greater challenges before,” he said. “Those of us in elected office — at all levels — must continue to put partisanship aside and focus on our common work to serve the common good.” The House went home for a week vacation after passing its bill Saturday. The Senate’s second-ranking Democrat on Sunday said he and his colleagues should also stay home, and said the House bill could pass by “unanimous consent” — which would take agreement of all senators. Sen. Richard Durbin, Illinois Democrat, said making lawmakers travel back to Washington puts them at risk. “Set an example for America, Senator McConnell.  Think about our staff, their families, and our constituents, as well as your Senate colleagues,” he said. The Senate had planned a vacation to match the House, but Mr. McConnell last week canceled it after calls from Republicans to stay in session to try to help the government manage the coronavirus crisis. Mr. McConnell pointed out that they still have the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act renewal bill to deal with. That bill is currently the pending business on the floor, and it must be surmounted before the chamber can turn to the House coronavirus legislation.

The power struggle created an awkward moment in which Mr. Nadler canceled the markup of his own bill just minutes before it was scheduled. FISA allows U.S. intelligence agencies to meet with judges behind closed doors and explain why spying is needed without anyone to question their evidence. The process has come under scrutiny since revelations last year confirmed that the FBI abused FISA to surveil Trump campaign figure Carter Page as part of its probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Liberal civil libertarians and conservative defenders of President Trump united in an attempt to curb the government’s powers with FISA reforms. Instead, Mr. Schiff, at the urging of the intelligence community, pushed for smaller tweaks to the law. As a result, the House passed a bill that few lawmakers liked, that advocacy groups on the left and the right condemned, and that Mr. Trump hinted he would veto. Three critical FISA provisions lapsed when the Senate failed to take action Friday on the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and Trump ally, urged swift passage of the House bill, but a Republican faction also pressing for a Trump veto blocked a quick vote. Senate Republican leaders aim to pass the House bill this time and hope the president won’t veto it. Sean Vitka, policy counsel for the left-leaning Demand Progress, slammed the House’s reform measures as “an insult to Americans.” “This bill fails to address the innumerable famously well-documented problems with recent and ongoing FISA surveillance,” he said. The Senate is poised to take up the House bill Monday, one day after three critical FISA provisions lapsed. The Senate’s fiercest civil liberties defenders are urging their colleagues to reject the legislation. Those who followed the FISA fight say Mr. Schiff’s interference may have cost a chance at meaningful reform. “Schiff was fairly careful to keep his hands clean publicly from meddling in that process, but what everyone behind the scenes was saying is that he in some ways had ownership of the final results of this process,” said Josh Withrow, senior policy analyst for FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. “He made it clear that nothing would be allowed to pass that the [intelligence committee] hadn’t signed off on first.” Rep. Zoe Lofgren, California Democrat, pointed a finger at Mr. Schiff after a markup hearing was canceled because leadership opposed amendments she planned to attach to the FISA bill. She told Politico that whenever there was a chance to overhaul FISA, regardless of which party proposed the change, the intelligence committee chairman scuttled it. Spokesmen for Mr. Schiff did not acknowledge requests for comment from The Washington Times. Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, rejected the idea that Mr. Schiff’s involvement in a bill outside of his committee had sunk the chance for FISA reform. He said staff from multiple committees, along with the Justice Department, had a hand in crafting the bill. “There were all types of elements at play,” he told The Times. “You are negotiating with everyone. That’s why it took forever over the last several days.” Though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed that Mr. Schiff’s refusal to concede the administration a talking point on the Page warrant was a factor in his go-small approach to reforms, they said the main issue was pressure from the intelligence community to keep the status quo. The National Security Agency, the CIA, the FBI and other agencies said their powers were necessary to keep the U.S. safe. Even Attorney General William P. Barr, a fierce critic of the Page warrant and an ally of Mr. Trump, surprisingly went against the president by lobbying Republicans for a clean renewal of the FISA provisions. He praised the House bill after it passed. “The establishment intelligence community was generally on the same page the whole time,” said former Rep. Dan Glickman, Kansas Democrat and a former intelligence committee chairman. “It doesn’t surprise me that Schiff would be inclined to support the intelligence community’s agenda.” Mr. Glickman said that after years of criticism by Mr. Trump and Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and the panel’s previous chairman, it is not surprising that the intelligence community and Mr. Schiff would look out for each other. “They’ve been browbeaten by the president for a long time now with him saying he knows more than they do and disregarding their raw intelligence,” he said. “I think in many respects the Democrats treated them more fairly than the president. Schiff has a better relationship with the intelligence community, certainly more than Nunes.” Mr. Vitka said the ability of the intelligence committee to control other members of Congress is “very unique and dangerous to the privacy of all people in the United States.” Civil liberties hawks, who viewed Mr. Nadler as one of their staunchest allies in Congress, said they were surprised he was rolled by Mr. Schiff. Mr. Nadler relentlessly opposed the Patriot Act and championed additional FISA reforms during a similar fight in 2015, but he sputtered to defend his committee’s bill last week. “It greatly increases civil liberties protections. Not as much as I would want … but it’s what we could get,” he said tepidly when urging his colleagues to support the legislation. “Chairman Nadler as an individual has consistently supported good civil liberties amendments, and he has already said he doesn’t think this bill goes far enough,” Mr. Vitka said. “The issue here was how much he was pressured to give up control to the intelligence committee, which has always been the primary obstacle in passing surveillance reform in the House.” Mr. Schiff wouldn’t have been able to bring Mr. Nadler to heel without the backing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, according to Capitol Hill insiders. The speaker last year repeatedly rebuffed Mr. Nadler’s push to begin the impeachment process. When she ultimately relented, she appointed Mr. Schiff to lead the proceedings. “Schiff has the ear of the speaker,” said Mr. Withrow, the FreedomWorks analyst. “Nadler is a weak chairman. I’m not saying it to knock the guy, but If you watch his hearings, he doesn’t have command of the committee a chairman should have. Schiff played that to his advantage.” The Senate on Monday will try to figure out what to do with the FISA bill. It does have some support among Republican leadership, including Mr. McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, but it has detractors in both parties, too. Sen. Mike Lee, Utah Republican, demanded a 45-day extension Thursday so senators could hammer out a better deal. Richard Burr, North Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, denied the plea. Mr. Vitka said he expects an intense battle in the Senate this week. “There are maybe 20 to 25 Republican senators who are willing to go along with whatever Burr and McConnell tell them to do,” he said. “Thankfully, people like Sen. Lee make it clear there are members, on both sides of the aisle, who will fight hard against this fake reform bill.”  ",Schiff protects intel ‘status quo’ power by sinking wide-reaching FISA reform: Source,"Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/adam-schiff-fisa-reform-intervention-protects-fbi-/,washington_times

"The Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step Sunday of cutting interest rates to zero and launching a massive emergency $700 billion quantitative easing program to protect the economy from the impact of the coronavirus, while Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi began work on a third relief bill to help U.S. businesses and workers. As restaurants, taverns, schools and some major companies closed across the country, the Fed announced it was lowering its prime lending rate to 0% to 0.25%, the second major cut in two weeks. Combined with the new easing program, it was the largest one-day action the central bank has ever taken. “The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,” the central bank said in a statement. “The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.” President Trump said the move was “really good news.” “It’s really great for our country,” the president told reporters at the White House. “I think people in the [stock] market should be very thrilled.” Still, stock futures fell Sunday after the Fed’s action, indicating more losses loom on Monday. Major stock indexes have plummeted more than 20% in the past two weeks from their highs in mid-February, largely on concerns about the economic impact of the virus. Stocks bounced back nearly 10% on Friday, bolstered by Mr. Trump’s announcement of a national emergency and steps to speed testing and aid to states. The dramatic action by the Fed emphasized the threat to the U.S. economy from the coronavirus outbreak. The central bank had just reduced the prime lending rate by 0.5% two weeks ago, and last week it injected $1.5 trillion into the bond market. The rate is a benchmark for short-term lending for financial institutions and is a guide to many consumer rates from car loans to mortgages. Reserve requirements at banks also were eased, and the Fed said it is coordinating with foreign banks to enhance dollar liquidity in Japan, Britain, Europe, Canada and Switzerland. Mr. Trump had been imploring the Fed to cut rates further to keep the U.S. economy competitive with other nations whose central banks have been cutting their rates deeper. In the coming months, the Fed said it will purchase at least $700 billion more in bonds as part of its new quantitative easing to ensure enough money in the economy. The majority of it, about $500 billion, will be U.S. Treasury bonds. The rest will be mortgage-backed securities. “The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,” the Fed said in a statement. Mr. Mnuchin and Mrs. Pelosi are already talking about a third coronavirus bill, even as their second bipartisan legislative response to the outbreak awaits action in the Senate. The next package will be a stimulus bill targeting small and medium-sized businesses as well as specific industries that have been hit hard by the virus, the secretary explained. “We will use whatever tools we have and whatever tools we don’t have we will go to Congress on a bipartisan basis and get more tools,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “We’re in the second inning of nine innings.” Its predecessor, however, still needs to get to the president’s desk. After a feverish 48 hours of negotiations, the House passed a massive relief package to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers just after midnight on Saturday. It mandated free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment-insurance programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone who does if they’re at a company with less than 500 employees. The bill also shores up food programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and schoolchildren, and bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. “This bill was very important in getting workers money in their pockets, people that have to be home,” Mr. Mnuchin said on ABC’s “This Week.” To help small businesses, the Treasury Department announced that those companies will be able to get deposits they gave the IRS and get a cash advance from the agency. This came just about a week after Congress passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion bill to get more resources to state and local health officials. And on Friday, President Trump declared a national emergency, freeing up about $50 billion in aid for states and localities to combat the virus. “I think there’s a lot of bipartisan support. We hope they pass this bill. If not, we’ll work with the center on whatever minor changes we need,” Mr. Mnuchin said on Fox News. The Senate, which left for the weekend on Thursday as plans for quick passage in the House fell apart, will be in on Monday, which will be the soonest the chamber could vote on the bill depending on what, if any, changes are made. At least one senator, though, is suggesting that the Senate doesn’t come back in at all this week. On Sunday, Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, called for the chamber to stay on recess and pass the bill on a unanimous consent vote — which can be derailed by just one objection — and allow those who object have it noted in the official record. He argued that doing otherwise would put senators and their staffers at risk of catching the virus unnecessarily. “We have been warned to limit unnecessary travel and gathering in large groups. Senators and staff are working to serve their states locally as best they can, and with unanimous consent for these measures there is no valid reason to force extra travel this week,” he said in a statement. However, the fact that lawmakers passed this latest legislative fix without a price tag, made it nearly impossible to push through the Senate on a unanimous basis. The chamber also needs to pass a bill to reauthorize and reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, parts of which expired Sunday. Both Mr. Mnuchin and Mrs. Pelosi said they will start working on the next package this week. The secretary wants the bill to specifically help sectors like the airline, tourism and cruise industries. Mr. Mnuchin defended the strategy, saying it wasn’t like the auto and banking bailouts that were spurred by the recession in the early 2000’s. “If you’re providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you’re taking collateral and you have security, that’s not a bailout,” he said on Fox News. “To the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted — again, our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted.” The total cost of the bailouts from the financial crisis of 2008-09 was $498 billion, according to an analysis last year by Deborah J. Lucas, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Golub Center for Finance and Policy. Mr. Trump has repeated floated a payroll tax as another means to help alleviate some of the economic fallout of the virus, but it’s failed to capture any enthusiasm from anyone on Capitol Hill, least of all Democratic leadership. The Fed had been scheduled to hold a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 17-18. In Sunday’s action, the central bank also slashed the rate of emergency lending at the discount window for banks by 125 basis points, to 0.25%, and lengthened loan terms to 90 days. The Fed said the purchases under its new quantitive easing would begin Monday with a $40 billion installment. The Fed’s action cuts rates to a new range of 0% to 0.25%, from 1% to 1.25%. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester was the only “no” vote, preferring to set rates at 0.5% to 0.75%.

"WASHINGTON — The White House is putting in place new measures starting Monday to protect President Donald Trump and his staff during the coronavirus outbreak, including taking the temperature of anyone who enters the complex, from visitors to members of the press corps. This would expand on screenings the White House began on Saturday for anyone who gets close to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration response to the virus. “In order to keep the entire White House complex safe and healthy, beginning Monday morning, temperature checks will be conducted on everyone who enters campus,” spokesman Judd Deere said. “As was announced over the weekend, additional temperature checks will be conducted on individuals who are in close contact with the president and vice president throughout the day.” Press corps members are also taking steps, independent of the White House, to limit their exposure. The White House on Saturday began taking the temperature of reporters attending a coronavirus briefing led by Trump and Pence. One reporter with a temperature of 100.4 degrees was denied entry to the briefing room. Temperature checks were conducted before Sunday’s briefing, too. Trump has had contact with individuals who later tested positive for coronavirus, including the press aide for Brazil’s president, but the president initially refused to be tested. On Saturday Trump said he had taken the test in response to questions at a Friday news conference. The White House doctor reported late Saturday that the test came back negative. Trump, 73, would be considered at risk because of his age. Other precautionary steps the White House is taking: pausing its internship and volunteer programs, canceling public tours and canceling large events through the end of March. The White House also has closed its Navy Mess Dining Room, where many staffers get daily meals. The White House also has encouraged staffers to follow guidelines for telework issued by the Office of Management and Budget. The White House Correspondents’ Association also has taken steps to limit the number of journalists who are in the briefing room on a daily basis, starting with television crews. Television networks have agreed to “pool” camera coverage of the briefing room, the WHCA board said in a statement Sunday. That means just one crew will cover briefings and share footage with all the other networks, instead of having multiple crews covering the same event. That system was in place for Sunday’s coronavirus briefing. “This is an important first step for us, but we all agree more action is needed to protect our members and the integrity of the press pool covering the president,” the board said. Members are also being asked to leave every other seat in the briefing room empty to practice the “social distancing” that public health officials are impressing upon all Americans. They are also being asked to not stand in the aisles during briefings and to monitor such events remotely, if possible.

"The Supreme Court’s 2018 Janus decision was a landmark in labor law, but now the namesake in the case would like the justices to go further. The high court ruled in Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees that public-sector employees cannot be forced to pay union dues because it violates their First Amendment rights. Mark Janus, a former Illinois state employee, asked the justices last week to consider his petition to claw back the dues he paid unwillingly for years before he won his case. “The Supreme Court agreed that the union taking money from nonmembers was wrong, but the union still has the money it illegally garnished from my paycheck,” he said in a statement. “It’s time for AFSCME to give me back the money they wrongfully took.” Mr. Janus has lost his reimbursement argument at the district court level and before the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel ruled against him last year. He also lost before that appeals court in the original Janus case, only to have the high court overturn its decision. Now, he’s hoping that track repeats itself, said Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which represents Mr. Janus. “It was a huge victory in 2018 and what we’re now asking the Supreme Court is to help Mark get his money back,” Mr. Mix said. “If there was a violation of his First Amendment rights, and Janus ruled there was, then he ought to get relief and that is what this is about.” AFSCME, again the defendant in Mr. Janus’ case, did not respond to a request for comment, but Mr. Mix said the union has successfully employed “a good faith” defense, arguing it was legal at the time it took a portion of Mr. Janus’ paycheck for dues. “It’s true that we haven’t had a whole lot of success thus far,” Mr. Mix said. “But Supreme Court rulings are considered ‘black letter law,’ in that it is considered statutes should have always been that way.” Although labor experts expected the Janus decision to damage the finances of public-sector labor unions, the unions insist they have thrived in its aftermath, managing to hold on to most of their members and in some cases expand their rolls or raise dues. The Janus decision does not apply to private-sector unions, although the Supreme Court has ruled that members can receive a refund on the portion of compulsory dues that unions spend on political activity. Given that public-sector employees are paid by taxpayers and negotiate with public officials, all of their activity is inherently political, the majority of the Supreme Court ruled in Janus. A clawback of Mr. Janus’ past dues would be a game-changer, Mr. Mix said. The money at stake for Mr. Janus is small — about $3,000, which his lawyers say represents the amount “AFSCME seized from his paycheck without his permission from March 23, 2013, to June 27, 2018, representing the two-year statute of limitations from the date his case started in March 2015 through the Supreme Court’s 2018 decision in his favor.” The principle, however, is enormous as the Janus decision affected an estimated 5 million public employees. “Another favorable ruling in the case could have a massive impact, setting a federal precedent that would be controlling in dozens of other cases seeking refunds of dues taken unlawfully by public-sector union bosses,” said the National Right to Work Foundation. Mr. Mix said he is involved in or is aware of two class-action suits centered on union dues — one in California and the other in Ohio — that could affect more than 80,000 workers. About 30 post-Janus cases are in various stages of federal litigation, he said.

"Country music icon Charlie Daniels is plenty riled after leaning that China is the source for many antibiotics, generic medications and prescription drugs vital to Americans — a situation now in sharp focus following the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent national emergency. “The United States of America depending on any other nation for anything as critical as medicine is downright dumb and an ever-present threat to national security,” Mr. Daniels writes in an op-ed published by CNSNews.com. “There is a lesson to be learned here. Over the years, high tax rates caused American businesses to outsource so much manufacturing to China, our economies have become so entwined, and we’ve made so much money off the cheap Chinese labor that we have basically turned a blind eye to what our enabling of an oppressive communist government has accomplished for China,” Mr. Daniels said. “The Chinese military grows in strength and threat every day, using the enormous profits from Sino-American trade deals to maintain the largest standing army in the world. It’s time for America to adopt an ‘If we use it here, we should produce it here’ attitude,” he continued. “For the first time in modern times, thanks to the common sense and foresight of President Donald Trump, America is energy-independent and our economy no longer has to depend on the largesse of Saudi Arabia or any other nation who hates our guts. Now it’s time for America to bring it all back home. If we use it here, it should be made here,” Mr. Daniels concludes. MEDIA REMAINS IN ATTACK MODE News organizations hostile to President Trump remain in attack mode despite the coronavirus national emergency, and at a time when many Americans could use helpful news, straight talk and unbiased perspectives. Just a few very recent headlines: “The Trump presidency is over” (The Atlantic); “Tracking Trump’s false or misleading coronavirus claims” (The Washington Post); “Fact Check: Trump’s claims about his response to the coronavirus” (The New York Times); and “Donald Trump’s Sunday: An online church service, Twitter attacks” (USA Today). DOCTORS: THE TRUST FACTOR Only about one-third of Americans trust “elected officials.” But doctors? A new Pew Research Center analysis finds that 74% of the public give physicians a big thumbs up. Every group agrees with this, for once. “There were no significant partisan differences in views of doctors: Around three-quarters of both Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (73%) as well as Republicans and GOP leaners (77%) expressed a mostly positive opinion of medical doctors. This differs notably from the public’s evaluations of other societal institutions, especially the news media, where attitudes are deeply polarized along partisan lines,” the analysis said. The partisan gaps can be huge: 76% of Democrats give the press a positive review, compared to 30% of Republicans. FOR THE LEXICON “The Thin White Line.” Timely new phrase coined by Breitbart columnist James O. Pinkerton, referring to EMTs, paramedics and nurses. “So now maybe we should know a little bit more about the emergency and health professionals who will be charged with our care should we be stricken with corona-related medical misfortune,” Mr. Pinkerton writes. “We might call them the ‘Thin White Line,’ referring to their white coats, as a variation on the ‘Thin Red Line’ of British military history, and the ‘Thin Blue Line’ of American policing. These workers typically don’t get paid all that much; they are givers, not takers. That is, they give health and order, and take just a tiny fraction of what Wall Street Masters of the Universe pay themselves,” the columnist says. GREENLAND OFFICIALS: ‘STAY AWAY’ At 836,330 square miles, it’s the largest island on the planet, 81% of it is covered by ice and it is currently a territory of Denmark. That would be Greenland, home to 55,992 people and now one of the few places on Earth which has not been invaded by coronavirus. Yet. Officials on Greenland want to keep it that way. “We would like to tell our guests to stay home if you are considering traveling to Greenland right now,” Bjorn Tegner Bay, chief of Greenland’s police force, said in a Friday press conference. In recent years, cruise ships have frequented Greenland’s shores, guests eager to experience “a primordial place ruled by ancient ice,” this according to Quark Expeditions, which offers a Greenland itinerary. Air traffic also is a regular occurrence. “A plane from Denmark arrives every day, and there are often planes from Iceland. In recent days, we’ve seen planes land with passengers who were under suspicion of being infected,” said an urgent public announcement from the nation’s four opposition political parties: Inuit Ataqatigit, Partii Naleraq, Samarbejdspartiet and Atassut. Officials fear the health-care system will be “overwhelmed,” says a report from Arctic Today, which notes that Queen Ingrid’s Hospital in the capital of Nuuk has 130 beds — and room for only four patients in its intensive care unit. “We have had no guarantee from the Danish health authorities, but our expectation is that people in Greenland and the Faroe Islands would have as much right to care as people in Denmark, in the event we see people seriously affected by the coronavirus,” Henrik L. Hansen, Greenland’s chief medical officer, told Arctic Today. As of Sunday, meanwhile, Denmark had 827 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and Iceland, Greenland’s nearest neighbor, 161.

"President Trump said Sunday he is “strongly” considering a complete pardon for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI two years ago. “So now it is reported that, after destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has ‘lost’ the records of General Michael Flynn,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!” Typically, the president sidesteps the issue when he’s asked about a possible pardon for Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with the then-Russian ambassador to the U.S. after the 2016 election. But he asked a federal court in January to withdraw his guilty plea, citing prosecutorial misconduct. One form of misconduct that Flynn attorney Sidney Powell has publicly alleged is that the original notes from the FBI’s first interview with Flynn have gone missing. Attorney General William P. Barr has appointed an outside prosecutor, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri Jeffrey Jensen, to review the case.  Flynn was scheduled to be sentenced last month but the hearing was postponed indefinitely.

"A former staffer in House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff’s office has tested positive for coronavirus. “We consulted with the House Attending physician and will be acting on their recommendations. Medical professionals believe that my former staff member likely contracted the virus after leaving the office, but we will still be taking additional precautions over the next few days,” the California Democrat said in a statement. The staffer left Mr. Schiff’s office 10 days ago. Mr. Schiff had already suspended public events in his district this coming week-long recess and ordered his staff to work from home before they found out about the sick staffer. The staffer appears to be Daniel Goldman, who helped Mr. Schiff throughout the impeachment investigation as his top legal aide. His last day as a member of Mr. Schiff’s staff was March 6. He confirmed on Twitter that he had tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday. Mr. Goldman spent the last week detailing on Twitter the difficultly he had trying to get a test for the coronavirus. Let’s be very clear: unless you have pneumonia and traveled to one of 5 high-risk countries recently, you can NOT get a #COVID19 test in New York City. If you, like me, have a fever and a headache (but tested negative for the flu), you are unable to rule out #COVID19. Shameful. Last week, a senate staffer working for Sen. Maria Cantwell also tested positive, prompting her D.C. office to close as they worked to sanitize the workspace.

"Rep. Ayanna Pressley is calling for the compassionate release of some federal prisoners who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic. During an appearance Saturday on MSNBC, the Massachusetts Democrat and “Squad” member told host Al Sharpton that prisons “are an ecosystem in  a petri dish for the spreading of this pandemic.” “I’m just advocating to make sure that when we are talking about  those that are most vulnerable — our low-income residents and citizens,  those experiencing homelessness, our seniors — that we are also including  the incarcerated men and women who are certainly amongst one of the  most vulnerable populations,” Ms. Pressley said. “And given the crowding and overpopulating  in our prisons for a confluence of other reasons … are an ecosystem in  a petri dish for the spreading of this pandemic, which is why I  partnered with my colleagues, Reps. [Nydia] Velasquez, [Alexandria]  Ocasio-Cortez, and [Rashida] Tlaib, to lobby the Bureau of Prisons to  use their full power and to communicate guidance for how we will contain  and mitigate this epidemic behind the wall,” she continued. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) on Friday released its immediate plans to address the COVID-19 outbreak, including suspending all social visits for 30 days and curtailing legal visits, as well as giving prisoners extra phone time and suspending inmate transfers between prisons. Ms. Pressley said the BOP’s announcement was “woefully inadequate” and that the agency should use its authority to exact clemency, commutations and compassionate release. “I think now would be the time to commute some sentences, to exact  clemency and to take care of our most vulnerable,” she said. “Ten percent of those that are  incarcerated are over the age of 60 and already have an underlying  condition. We should be using compassionate release.”  ",Rep.

"The owner of seven Capitol Hill restaurants is defying Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser’s order to limit seating and close bars due to the coronavirus, saying “we will not bow down to pressure from the mayor’s office or any group for that matter who covertly is attempting to shut us down.” The Hill Restaurant Group, which operates the Hawk ‘N Dove tavern, Finn’s, Lola’s and several others, said it fully understands the gravity of the coronavirus outbreak. But it added in a statement, “We fully support our employees and our patrons. It is not our burden to bear nor is it our staff’s burden to bear.” “All HRG restaurants will continue to operate as normal and we encourage our fellow industry folks to do the same,” the owners said. The mayor tweeted at the restaurant group, “While I recognize that all of us have been stressed beyond our immediate understanding of how coronavirus has so quickly upended our daily lives and personal and business existence — you must comply with the DC Health notice.” The mayor on Sunday ordered licensed nightclubs to shut down operations, and all eating and drinking establishments to eliminate bar seating. There are also restrictions on the number of patrons who can sit at tables at restaurants. The restaurant group’s announcement drew a strong reaction on social media, with some people saying they would no longer patronize those restaurants. David Zipper, a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, tweeted, “I invite fellow Washingtonians to join me in never again visiting any restaurant owned by Hill Restaurant Group.”  ",Capitol Hill restaurant group defies mayor's order to close bars,"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/capitol-hill-restaurant-group-defies-mayors-order-/,washington_times
"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden holds a 20-point lead over Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont in Arizona, according to a poll released on Monday ahead of Tuesday’s presidential primary contest. Mr. Biden was the top choice of 51% of likely Democratic primary voters, followed by Mr. Sanders at 31% and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 1%, according to the Monmouth University poll. “Biden has a strong advantage going into the primary. This is because much of his support has already been banked in the early vote,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. “The closure of many polling places due to COVID-19 means it is uncertain how many voters who planned to vote on Tuesday will actually show up.” Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders squared off in their first one-on-one debate on Sunday evening in Washington, D.C. The debate had been moved from Phoenix due to coronavirus concerns. Maricopa County is planning to close about 80 polling locations on Tuesday because of the coronavirus outbreak. The county recorder also planned to mail ballots to registered Democrats who haven’t voted yet, though a judge quashed that plan late last week after Attorney General Mark Brnovich took legal action. Mr. Biden held a 3-point, 46% to 43% lead over President Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up in Arizona in the poll, while Mr. Trump held a 1-point, 44% to 43% lead over Mr. Sanders. “Impressions of the Democratic nominee will shift once the general election campaign gets under way, but Biden would start off by putting Arizona within reach,” Mr. Murray said. Democrat Mark Kelly also held a 6-point, 50% to 44% lead over Republican Sen. Martha McSally in a hypothetical November match-up in what will be one the most closely-watched U.S. Senate races in the country. Top elections officials from Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio issued a joint statement on Friday saying they are confident that voters can “safely and securely” cast ballots in Tuesday’s primaries. Still, Louisiana and Georgia recently announced they were pushing off their presidential primaries due to the coronavirus outbreak. Louisiana is pushing its April 4 primary to June 20, and Georgia’s March 24 primary has been rescheduled for May 19. The Democratic Party of Puerto Rico also said over the weekend that it would seek to delay the March 29 presidential primary. The Monmouth poll of 847 registered voters was taken from March 11-14 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. The subset of 373 likely Democratic primary voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.1 percentage points.

"The U.S. faced mounting pressure Sunday to mimic Europe and stop crowded bars and public spaces as Americans from coast to coast become sick with worry and the new coronavirus that is taxing the nation’s hospitals, economy and political leaders at an unprecedented scale. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Sunday said organizers should postpone or cancel events that consist of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks — an aggressive marker that would upend mass gatherings in the U.S. It said events of any size should include hand washing and proper distancing while recognizing the vulnerability of certain groups to the coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. It said the guidance does not apply to the day-to-day operations of schools, colleges or businesses, though it was unclear why. “This recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus,” the CDC said. “This recommendation is not intended to supersede the advice of local public health officials.” Indeed, some of them may go further. Governors in Illinois and Ohio said they are exploring ways to lock down bars and restaurants, and the nation’s top authority on infectious diseases endorsed a 14-day “national shutdown” to slow the outbreak as young people jammed into bars in New York City, the District of Columbia and elsewhere.

"Joseph R. Biden said Sunday that Americans staring at the  coronavirus crisis are “looking for results, not a revolution,” as he  painted himself as a middle option between an incompetent President  Trump and a too-radical Sen. Bernard Sanders, who sees the epidemic as  the reason to adopt a government-run health care system. Mr. Biden said he would set up hundreds  of drive-through testing sites across the country, would call out the  military to stand up emergency hospitals and hold meetings to decide  whether to declare a quarantine and to figure out a long-term economic  stimulus. But he said Americans need to be assured  the government has them covered for all their needs right now, in what  sounded like a limited test-drive of Mr. Sanders‘ own health care plans. “This is like in a war, and in a war you  do whatever needs to be done to take care of your people,” Mr. Biden  said. “Everything you need in terms of dealing with this crisis needs to  be free.” He was facing off one-on-one against Mr. Sanders in a debate in Washington ahead of primaries in four more states Tuesday. The two men settled on one thing: that Mr. Trump has not handled the crisis well. “Shut this president up right now,  because he is undermining the doctors and scientists,” Mr. Sanders said  about Mr. Trump’s public remarks and tweeting. “It is unacceptable for  him to be blabbering with unfactual information, which is confusing the  general public.” The senator from Vermont said the  American health care system isn’t prepared to handle COVID-19, and it’s  proof that it’s time for his “Medicare for All” health care plan. “We’re spending so much money, and yet we  are not even prepared for this pandemic. How come we don’t have enough  doctors? How come hospitals in rural areas are shutting down?” he said. He blamed corporate greed and said the answer is to take it out of the equation. Mr. Biden countered: “You have a single-payer system in Italy. It doesn’t work there.” Mr. Biden also announced that if he  becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, he will pick a woman as his  running mate. Mr. Sanders said “in all likelihood” he would, too. Democratic Party leaders were hoping for a  show of unity between the two remaining major candidates. Instead, the  debate was peppered with pointed exchanges. Mr. Sanders pointed to Mr. Biden’s votes  against gay rights in the 1990s, his support for a restriction on  abortion funding, backing legislation that would have cut Social  Security, and voting for a 2005 bankruptcy bill as evidence that Mr.  Biden is not the liberal champion the country needs. Mr. Sanders also said Mr. Biden’s climate change plans fall short. “I know your heart is in the right place,  but this requires dramatic, bold action. We have got to take on the  fossil fuel industry,” he said. “Your plan does not do that.” Mr. Biden acknowledged that he has moved  toward Mr. Sanders‘ stances in many areas. He said he has apologized for  his vote for the Defense of Marriage Act and noted that he was the  first major figure in the Obama administration to call for legal  recognition of same-sex marriage. He also said he has changed on the  abortion funding question and his vote for the Iraq War was a mistake —  but only because he believed President George W. Bush. But he said the country’s not ready to go full Sanders right now. “People are looking for results; they are not looking for a revolution,” Mr. Biden said. There were points of agreement in areas  such as immigration. Both men said they would severely curtail  enforcement inside the U.S. Mr. Sanders said he would end “raids” on  illegal immigrants, and Mr. Biden affirmed his vow for a 100-day  no-deportation period, and after that only those with felonies on their  records would be deported. That would carve almost all the estimated 11  million illegal immigrants out of any fear of removal. Both men said that doesn’t mean open borders. Mr. Sanders called that “a total lie.” Mr. Biden has been surging since the last  debate just ahead of the South Carolina primary, winning at least 15 of  the last 21 state contests, including several states that Mr. Sanders  carried over Hillary Clinton four years ago. His stunning success on Super Tuesday,  and the stumblings of former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg,  cleared out the field and left Mr. Biden the choice of the party’s  less-liberal wing. That has consolidated the vote behind Mr. Biden, who now holds a solid lead in the delegate count over Mr. Sanders. The senator, watching his second bid for  Democratic nomination falter, delivered a speech last week laying out  his plans for this debate. He said he would pressure Mr. Biden to stake  out positions on a plethora of “progressive” issues. The strategy appeared aimed at defining  the candidates’ differences and giving the former vice president a  political road map for how to connect with the far-left voters who have  rallied behind Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden took the first steps Sunday  before the debate. He announced he had updated his higher education  agenda to include tuition-free public college for students from families  with incomes lower than $125,000. Tuition-free college and his Medicare for All health care plan are the centerpieces of Mr. Sanders‘ democratic socialist agenda. Mr. Sanders welcomed the backing but questioned the late change. “This is a little about leadership,” he said. “Glad you’re coming around now.” Mr. Biden also announced that he was  adopting the bankruptcy plan of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out  of the presidential race this month but maintains credibility among  liberal voters. Ms. Warren’s plan, which Mr. Biden now embraces, would  make it easier for people to claim bankruptcy and allow them to shield  some assets in the process. The embrace was a makeup call for Mr.  Biden, who has taken fire for his vote in 2005 for a bankruptcy bill  that irks liberal Democrats. To win the nomination, a candidate must collect 1,991 delegates. Mr. Biden appears poised to expand his  lead Tuesday when voters in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio have  their say. Polls show Mr. Biden with double-digit leads over Mr. Sanders  in each of those states. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden greeted each  other Sunday night with an elbow bump rather than a handshake, and both  men assured the debate moderators that they wash their hands frequently  amid the coronavirus outbreak. The debate was relocated from Phoenix to Washington, and the live audience was scrapped. COVID-19 has led to more than 50 deaths,  upending people’s daily lives and leaving the presidential contenders to  navigate unknown political waters at a pinnacle moment in the campaign. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll  found that 60% of Americans think the worst of the epidemic is yet to  come. Democrats are far more concerned about the virus than other  voters, making the candidates’ handling of it a major campaign issue. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have canceled  mass rallies and headed online for virtual town halls and fundraisers,  fireside chats and an increasing number of press conferences. Mr. Sanders has penciled in a virtual rally Monday that is set to include musical acts.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders isn’t a fan of Joseph R. Biden’s plan to address climate change, saying it is mind boggling that the former vice president is not rallying behind bolder ideas such as his push to ban fracking. During their first one-on-one debate Sunday in Washington, Mr. Sanders said Mr. Biden’s vision for confronting the “world-shaking event” falls woefully short. “I know your heart is in the right place, but this requires dramatic bold action, we  have got to take on the fossil fuel industry,” he said. “Your plan does not do that.” Mr. Biden defended his plan, countering that he would provide no more subsidies to the fossil fuel industry and would bar drilling on federal lands and offshore. He also said that he doesn’t support any “new fracking.” Mr. Sanders said he doesn’t understand why fracking is allowed to continue in the United States, and that it is time to “take on the fossil fuel industry.” “What Joe is saying goes nowhere near enough,” Mr. Sanders said. Mr. Sanders said Mr. Biden’s desire to reenter the Paris Accord is useful, but it is not enough -  sparking a chuckle from Mr. Biden. “If you are laughing Joe then you are missing the point,” Mr. Sanders said. “This is an existential crisis.” “I am talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,” Mr. Sanders said. “I’m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet.”  ",'Nowhere near enough': Sanders blasts Biden's climate change plan,"Sunday, March 15, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-blasts-joe-biden-climate-change-pla/,washington_times

I would pick a woman to be my vice president.” Asked whether he would pick a woman as well, Mr. Sanders said he could also go that route. “In all likelihood I will,” Mr. Sanders said. “For me it is not just nominating a woman, it is making sure we have a progressive woman, and there are progressive women out there.” “So my very strong tendency is to move in that direction,” he said.

"Democrats’ top two presidential candidates declared Sunday that they will halt key aspects of immigration enforcement as soon as they take the White House, and promised to work to legalize most of those here illegally. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden affirmed his plan for a 100-day halt to all deportations. “No one, no one will be deported at all,” he said at a debate with Sen. Bernard Sanders. After the 100-day period he said he would only deport those with felonies on their record, effectively carving almost all illegal immigrants out of danger of deportation. Mr. Biden also refuted the Obama administration’s policy of cracking down on sanctuary cities, saying flatly that he would not ask local authorities to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, said he would stop “raids” by ICE — apparently referring to the at-large arrests the agency says it has to make particularly in sanctuary communities, where local prisons and jails refuse help in arresting criminals. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders insisted their plans don’t mean “open borders.” “That is a total lie,” Mr. Sanders said. The two candidates called for surging immigration judges to the border, saying illegal immigrants should be met with a legal process and released, not detained.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders said he is happy that Joseph R.

The Vermonter said he took hard voters when it mattered most, and staked out positions that were once unpopular, but have become so in vogue that people that Mr. Biden has finally come around. “What leadership is about is about going forward when it is not popular,” Mr. Sanders said. “When it is an idea that you get criticized for.” Mr. Sanders said that he voted against, and Mr. Biden voted for, the Defense of Marriage Act, the bankruptcy bill, the war in Iraq, trade deals that he says have hurt the economy, and the Hyde Amendment. “It takes courage sometimes to do the right thing,” Mr. Sanders said.  “The people of America know my record.

"Joseph R. Biden  and Sen. Bernard Sanders clashed in the Democratic presidential debate over the 2008 bailout of Wall Street, with the former vice president arguing that the nation would have sunk into a depression if the Obama administration didn’t act. Mr. Sanders said that he voted against the bailout package because he didn’t want to reward the “illegal behavior” of people on Wall Street. ‘Had those banks gone under all those people that Bernie says he cares about would be in deep trouble - deep, deep trouble,” Mr. Biden said. “All those little folks. They would have gone out of business. They would have found themselves in the position of losing everything they had in that bank - whether it was $10, $300 or a savings account.” Mr. Sanders said that at the time he felt the bailout should have been funded with a surtax on the nation’s most wealthy citizens. “We need to stabilize the economy, but we can’t repeat what we did in 2008,” he said. “Joe voted for that, I voted against it because we have to do more than save the banks or the oil companies. Our job right now is to tell every working person in this country, no matter what your income is, you are not going to suffer.” The disagreement underscored the divide between Mr. Biden’s push for short-term fixes and Mr. Sanders‘ call for long-term systematic change.

Bernard Sanders as the two remaining major candidates for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Sanders said his “Medicare for All” health plan would guarantee illegal immigrants get health care, so they could show up at clinics for testing and care. And he said he would halt at-large immigration enforcement altogether so illegal immigrants wouldn’t be afraid to show up.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders said Sunday that the first step to solving the coronavirus epidemic is to silence President Trump, who he said is undermining the doctors trying to give good advice. “Shut this president up right now,” Mr. Sanders said as he kicked off a two-man debate with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden in the Democratic presidential contest. Mr. Biden also blamed Mr. Trump for a slow response, saying he should have accepted the World Health Organization’s offer of testing kits, instead of waiting for the U.S. to develop its own. The two men were debating at the CNN studios in Washington set far apart from each other on stage and from the moderators, as if to underscore the social distancing recommendations from doctors. Mr. Biden said the solution to the virus is to set up drive-through coronavirus testing and task the military with standing up emergency hospitals to prepare for a health emergency. Mr. Sanders said the virus is the latest proof that his Medicare for All health plan is needed, saying a guarantee that nobody would have to pay for anything related to the virus would be reassuring. Mr. Biden countered that a single-payer system isn’t working in Italy, though he said when it comes to the virus Americans shouldn’t have to pay for any coronavirus care — effectively calling for a limited Medicare for All. “The national criss says we’re responding. It’s all free. You don’t have to pay for a thing,” Mr. Biden said. “We’re at war with the virus.” Mr. Sanders said 30,000 people in the U.S. died last year because they couldn’t afford treatment. “I think that’s a crisis,” he said.

"When North Carolina courts issue warrants to search homes or private property during criminal investigations, records of that process are supposed to be public with rare exceptions. But an examination by a dozen North Carolina news outlets found state courts typically don’t track how often they keep these records secret. And although they contend that sealing search warrants is uncommon, many clerks, district attorneys and judges can’t say how often it happens. The statewide project coincided with  Sunshine Week, a national celebration each March of open government  and the public’s right to know. Journalists requested records and surveyed court officials in 30 counties – rural and urban, wealthy and less prosperous – and found inconsistent approaches to sealing search warrants that persist nearly a decade after an effort to standardize the process and make it more transparent. Brooks Fuller, director of the N.C. Open Government Coalition and assistant journalism professor at Elon University, said it’s sometimes necessary to seal records. “However, it is critical for the public to have a sense of how often and in what types of cases judges seal records from public view,” Fuller said.  North Carolina law dictates that once a warrant is executed and returned to the court, anyone - whether it’s a reporter, a suspect or an interested citizen - should be able to access it, unless a judge seals it. Investigators are required to get a warrant from the courts in most cases before conducting a search. They must explain what they’re looking for and demonstrate probable cause. Making the warrant public, says Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman, acts as a check on the incredible authority of the state. “The public has the right and needs to have the ability to review the exercise of that authority,” Freeman said. District attorneys say they must meet a high bar in the rare instances that a judge seals a search warrant.  Temporarily sealing a search warrant can be necessary, prosecutors say, when investigators need time to build their cases before tipping off suspects.  In Rockingham County, Superior Court Judge Stanley L. Allen said he hasn’t signed many orders to seal information, though doing so can help law enforcement conduct searches or protect the identity of an undercover police officer. In some cases, he said, a seal is used “so the bad guys won’t find out about it.” In Johnston County, District Attorney Susan Doyle said that, to her knowledge, her office had only filed one motion to seal in 2019 – and that was to protect victims and witnesses in a gang-related case with four co-defendants. “We rarely file any motions to seal,” Doyle said. “However, that is a tool that becomes necessary when the safety of victims and witnesses is at stake.” Franklin County Clerk of Superior Court Patricia Chastain estimates that judges there seal between one and two warrants per year, on average.  District Attorney Greg Newman, the chief prosecutor for Henderson, Polk and Transylvania counties, said the rare instances in which he seeks a seal most often deal with victims through the Department of Social Services.  “There’s no one just agreeing to seal records for no good reason,” Newman said.  And in Mecklenburg County, Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Bob Bell said he couldn’t remember the last search warrant he put under seal. “It’s anything but routine,” Bell said. Still, court officials in almost all of the 30 counties surveyed said they had no way to track sealed warrants or provide a specific number, Statewide, the N.C. Administrative Office of the Courts “has no application that tracks the issue of sealed search warrants,” spokeswoman Sharon Gladwell said. Wake County is an exception. Every sealed warrant is logged, noting the case, the date the order was signed and when the seal expires. That order was revised and refined following a 2008 dispute between the district attorney and news outlets over sealed search warrants in a high-profile murder case. The North Carolina Court of Appeals ruled that while temporary seals were justifiable, trial courts should not withhold public records from public inspection unless it is in the interest of the “proper and fair administration of justice” or where “the openness ordinarily required of our government will be more harmful than beneficial.”  In Mecklenburg County, motions to seal search warrants occur in a hearing unannounced to the public. Once in place, a seal is rarely removed. According to county data, slightly more than 2 percent of about 4,200 warrants were sealed in 2018 and 2019. No other counties surveyed by reporters were able to point to any similar tracking system.  ___ This story was reported by Jonathan Drew, of The Associated Press; Kate Martin, of Carolina Public Press; Doug Miller and Michael Gordon, of The Charlotte Observer; Chris Day and Julian Eure, of The Daily Advance; Paul Woolverton, of The Fayetteville Observer; Josh Shaffer, of The News & Observer; Amelia Harper, of the Rocky Mount Telegram; Ann McAdams and Brandon Wissbaum, of WECT-TV; Jenn Emert, of WLOS-TV; Tyler Dukes, of WRAL-TV; and Jason deBruyn, of WUNC.

"Republican Sen. Mitt Romney proposed Monday giving a $1,000 handout to every American adult in an attempt to help the U.S. economy weather the coronavirus which is devastating markets. The money is intended to “help fill the gaps” for Americans who are starting to have issues with their paychecks and bills. The senator sees it as an additional step to the House-passed coronavirus bill that includes free testing, paid sick leave and solidifies unemployment benefits. “We also urgently need to build on this legislation with additional action to help families and small businesses meet their short-term financial obligations, ease the financial burden on students entering the workforce, and protect health workers on the front lines and their patients by improving telehealth services,” Mr. Romney, Utah Republican, said in a statement. The idea of giving $1,000 to every American adult was first made popular by ex-presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Hawaii Democrat Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a candidate in the Democratic primary race, introduced a bill with a similar proposal in the House last week. The stipend is just one of the suggestions Mr. Romney floated. He also called for bridge grants from the Small Business Association for small companies that expect a 50% revenue loss because of the virus. For students, Mr. Romney calls for loan payments to be suspended as well as student fees and grants next year to take into account last-minute expenses on travel, housing and storage students incurred as universities and colleges shut down. Mr. Romney also wants the government to foot the bill for private insurance companies to cover the cost of telehealth services related to the coronavirus.

"The second coronavirus relief package was on its way Monday night to the Senate for final passage as lawmakers in the Capitol tried to balance their responsibilities for leading the country against rapidly escalating health risks. The House passed an updated version of its bill Monday, including technical changes that nearly derailed the process after objections from Rep. Louie Gohmert. The Texas Republican said he was concerned about the last-minute tweaks and was unhappy about passing such a large and expensive bill on such short notice. “I will not give my consent without first reading these very serious changes that will hopefully minimize bankruptcies caused by the virus rather than causing more,” Mr. Gohmert said, before ultimately standing down. Now both the original bill and the updated version, which reportedly includes new language to aid small businesses, will head to the Senate where they both need to pass before heading to President Trump’s desk. The president said earlier Monday even more changes could be made to the legislation now that it’s in the Senate. “They’re [the Senate] working to only enhance it and make it better and it make fair for everybody,” he said. “We may go back and forth a bit with the House on it but both will be in a very positive fashion.” Earlier Monday, some lawmakers were skeptical of the relief package’s chances in the Senate. On Fox News, Sen. Tom Cotton said the bipartisan bill didn’t yet have the votes. “I don’t think the House bill is going to pass as written for one basic problem — it doesn’t go far enough and it doesn’t go fast enough,” the Arkansas Republican said. But four top administration officials, including National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, came up to Capitol Hill to meet with senators late Monday. After the closed-door meeting, Mr. Mnuchin emerged and told reporters he expects the package to move through the Senate on Tuesday. The bill initially passed the House on a 363-40 vote just after midnight on Saturday, after a feverish 48 hours of negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin. The bill also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and children and bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. With the legislation passed the House and headed to the Senate, lawmakers are already talking about getting started on a third coronavirus bill — this time, Republicans are pushing to give an economic break to hard hit sectors, like the airline and cruise ship industries. The trouble the House has with the challenge to unanimous consent shows the difficultly Congress has in legislating during the coronavirus. Members — many of whom are older and more vulnerable to the virus — need to come in to vote, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended suspending events of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. The president on Monday tightened that restriction further: no events for 10 or more people. The new health guidelines prompted the Senates’ health committee to cancel its scheduled hearing on the coronavirus response this week. Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, advised members to cancel plans to come back to Capitol Hill on Monday and did not have a firm fly-in date. Members will have 24-hours notice if they need to return to D.C. for votes. Leadership is also considering new policies to try and limit how many members are in the chamber at a time. Meanwhile, the Senate canceled its recess this week in order to pass the coronavirus bill and FISA reauthorization.  ",House passes coronavirus bill after Gohmert reverses objection,"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/house-passes-coronavirus-bill-after-louis-gohmert-/,washington_times
"The Senate on Monday agreed to pass a temporary extension of three expired national security tools so it could spend more time debating a broad overhaul of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The stopgap measure, which extends the national security tools controlled by FISA for 77 days, passed without intervening action or debate. It also gives senators more time to focus on a multibillion dollar House coronavirus package as public pressure mounts for government action. “We have the next two months to build consensus around important reforms and help everybody — Democrats and Republicans — with joining that effort,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy, Vermont Democrat. The last-minute deal also avoids a potential veto of a House-passed bill by President Trump, who tweeted his displeasure with that proposal. Senators were set to reauthorize fully the critical national security tools controlled by FISA, which lapsed Sunday after a contentious debate in the House last week. Civil liberties advocates who had opposed the House measure praised the stopgap agreement. “The deal secured by bipartisan group of senators ensures that there will be debate on amendments that will protect Americans’ civil liberties,” said Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs for FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. Senators were set to take up a House bill that was approved last week with a bipartisan 278-136 vote. The House bill fully reauthorized the critical national security tools controlled by FISA, which lapsed Sunday. Upon its arrival in the Senate, the bill was quickly condemned by civil liberties hawks, including Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Opponents insisted the legislation didn’t do enough to curb government surveillance, insisting on more sweeping reforms. Both Mr. Lee and Mr. Paul had demanded a substantial overhaul of FISA since revelations confirmed last year the FBI had abused its surveillance powers to monitor Trump campaign figure Carter Page as part of its Russian election interference probe. “We know that the law itself as a whole is subject to abuse and at moments like this, when these provisions are expiring, it’s appropriate for us to take a broader look at overhauling the legal framework in which FISA operates,” Mr. Lee said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other leadership figures had expressed support for the House bill. The Kentucky Republican touted the bill’s privacy protections and warned delaying passage could threaten national security. Mr. McConnell said the reform bill “strikes a key balance.” “It reauthorizes the tools which our national security requires while also imposing a number of new reforms, which basic accountability demands,” he said. Urging passage of the stopgap measure Monday, Mr. McConnell said the three expired FISA provisions needed to be back online immediately. “Hostile foreign intelligence surveillances — whether Chinese, Russian or Iranian — still seek to conduct operations within our borders, to recruit assets and agents among our population,” he said. “These threats will not wait around if the United States delays restocking the toolbox and so the Senate should not wait to act.” The three expired FISA provisions extended by the legislation eliminate the need for separate warrants to wiretap multiple cell phones; allow authorities to monitor “lone wolf” threats who don’t have formal ties to terrorist organizations; and collect business records. House-passed reforms to the FISA process that will be considered later include enhanced penalties for those who abuse the process for political purposes, increased accountability to Congress, transcripts of court proceedings, and a one-time historical review off FISA court rulings since 1979. Mr. Trump warned last week that he could veto the bill until the origins of the Russian probe, which described as an “attempted coup” are investigated. “Many Republican senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what that led to, and happened with the illegal, attempted ‘coup’ of the duly elected President of the United States and others,” the president tweeted. Attorney General William Barr had expressed his support for the House bill and encouraged senators of both parties to vote yes on it. Mr. Barr, a fierce critic of the Page warrant, surprisingly went against the president lobbying for the minor FISA reforms. “The bill contains an array of new requirements and compliance provisions that will protect against abuse and misuse in the future while ensuring that this critical tool is available when appropriate to protect the safety of the American people,” he said.

"When it comes to starting from scratch to fight a rapidly spreading global pandemic of a heretofore unknown disease, Ambassador Deborah Birx has been there. The White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator, Dr. Birx cut her teeth in public health with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, starting her career in immunology in 1985 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and rising to head the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR] in 2014. In naming her to the administration’s coronavirus task force last month, Vice President Mike Pence described her as a “world-renowned global health official and physician,” and that’s no exaggeration, according to others in the field. Dr. Birx, 63, is “absolutely the right person” to lead the Trump administration’s COVID-19 response, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, professor of infections diseases at the Emory University School of Medicine, who called PEPFAR “the most successful global health program ever.” “I would give money to see a meeting between her and [President] Trump,” said Dr. del Rio. “She won’t stay quiet when she has something to say. She’s a tough lady. If anyone can talk truth to power, it’s her.” At the daily White House press conferences on the coronavirus, Dr. Birx frequently draws comparisons between HIV/AIDS and the fast-spreading virus causing pneumonia-like symptoms that has killed more than 6,500 worldwide since emerging last year in Wuhan, China. “We had another silent epidemic: HIV,” she said at Monday’s briefing. “I just want to recognize, the HIV epidemic was solved by the community, the HIV advocates and activists who stood up when no one was listening and got everyone’s attention. We’re asking that same sense of community to come together and stand up against this virus.” The HIV/AIDS epidemic hit home for her in 1983. Immediately after the birth of her older daughter, her obstetrician ordered a blood transfusion, but she refused it based on her knowledge of the mysterious new infection that appeared to have contaminated the nation’s blood supply. Former Secretary of State John Kerry told the story at her April 2014 swearing-in as ambassador-at large and U.S. global AIDS coordinator, according to the Vote Smart transcript. “And literally, just before she passed out from pain, Debbi screamed, ‘Do not let them give me blood,’” Mr. Kerry said. “Her husband refused the transfusion, and it is a mighty good thing that he did. Because the hospital learned later that that the blood of her blood type — that they would have used — was contaminated with HIV.” The White House Coronavirus Task Force will benefit from Dr. Birx’s ability to “do things when there’s no infrastructure and no program,” said Dr. del Rio, an investigator with the Emory Center for AIDS Research. “I’ve never heard her say, we can’t do that. It’s always, we can do that,” he said. Millennials ‘will stop this virus’ An Army physician, she reached the rank of colonel before retiring from the military, helping lead the influential RV 144 HIV vaccine trial and winning two U.S. Meritorious Service Medals and the Legion of Merit Award, as cited in her State Department biography. Dr. Birx “has repeatedly demonstrated her unparalleled ability to control infectious diseases and is extremely well positioned to develop an effective plan to address COVID-19 in the United States of America,” said UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima in a Feb. 29 statement. The elderly, infirm and immuno-compromised have been identified as the most susceptible to the coronavirus, but Dr. Birx on Monday described millennials as “the core group that will stop this virus.” “Now why do I think the millennials are the key? Because they’re the ones that are out and about,” she said. “And they’re the most likely to be in social gatherings, and they’re the most likely to be the least symptomatic. And I think we’ve always heard about the greatest generation — we’re protecting the greatest generation right now, and the children of the greatest generation, and I think the millennials can help us tremendously.” Another reason: Millennials are adept at communicating with each other without being in each other’s presence. “They need to communicate with each other,” Dr. Birx said. “Public health people like myself don’t always come out with compelling and exciting messages that a 25-35-year-old may find interesting and something they would take to heart, but millennials can speak to one another about how important it is in this moment to protect all of the people.” Questions have been raised about the task force’s divided leadership, given that Mr. Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also oversee the panel, but Dr. Birx has played an increasingly visible role in fielding public-health questions at press briefings. She has a history with the panel’s other experts. On Monday, she deferred to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on a question about how long the virus can live on hard surfaces. “He was my mentor so I’m going to have to let him speak,” she said with a grin. Dr. Birx graduated from Houghton College and the Hershey School of Medicine at Pennsylvania State University. She has two daughters, Danielle and Devynn. Other task force members include U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Robert O’Brien, assistant to the president for national security affairs; Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun.

"Sen. Rand Paul says Uncle Sam should hold off on collecting taxes for a few months — and waive fees — as Americans attempt to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. The Kentucky Republican’s proposal elicited a wave of feedback Monday as the COVID-19 outbreak continued to disrupt and redefine daily life throughout the world. “Today I’m calling on the IRS to move our tax filing deadline from April 15 to July 15, and to waive any interest and fees for late payment,” Mr. Paul tweeted. “This will allow those who owe money not to have to send it during our current situation.” A sampling of the reactions include: Mr. Paul’s suggestion comes after an $8.3 billion coronavirus package passed Congress last week and as officials on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue were working on relief packages measured in the hundreds of billions. “Good teamwork between  Republicans & Democrats as the House passes  the big CoronaVirus  Relief Bill,” President Trump tweeted Saturday. “People really pulled together. Nice to  see!” Today I’m calling on the IRS to move our tax filing deadline from April 15 to July 15, and to waive any interest and fees for late payment.

"As chief of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, Vice President Mike Pence has upped his profile plenty on the public radar. Mr. Pence is also getting good reviews. “He’s a daily, consistent presence on the airwaves. He provides useful info rather than random digressions. He leans on health and medical experts — both at public events and behind the scenes,” write Axios co-founders Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei, in a review of this uncommon surge. It is his “presidential moment,” they say. “Pence, 60, a likely contender for the Republican nomination in 2024, has become one of the most praised administration officials during the virus crisis,” they note. Tech author Scott Galloway said the vice president had done a “reasonably good job” while Politico media columnist Jack Shafer said Mr. Pence “acted less like the ‘coronavirus czar’ and more like a good old-fashioned White House press secretary. He was calm. He was direct. He was polite in face of shouted, competing questions.” Mr. Pence’s chief of staff Marc Short tells Axios that the vice president “has an understanding of what people are looking for” — facts that are “straightforward, not alarmist.” “Most importantly, Pence seems on the level. The more Americans see of him, the more likely they are to believe what the administration says about this crisis, provided that Pence’s statements about the pandemic hold up over time,” advises Paul Mirengoff, a columnist at Powerline.com. REASSURING NEWS “Sixty-two percent of U.S. adults assess the strength of U.S. national defense as being ‘about right,’ two points off the record-high 64% from 1990. About twice as many say U.S. defense is not strong enough (25%) as say it is stronger than it needs to be (12%),” reports Gallup analyst Jeffrey M. Jones, who adds that the majority of Americans are also comfortable with the amount of military spending. “At a time when Americans are relatively satisfied with the strength of the U.S. military and the amount of military spending, 58% say the U.S. is No. 1 in the world militarily,” writes Mr. Jones.

As public alarm grows over the coronavirus health emergency, one veteran columnist has a simple panacea which could at least get the nation through the next month: Neutralize the bitter sparring between Democrats and President Trump. “It’s time to do something about our national divide. A 30-day political cease-fire is reasonable and doable. We must take a break from the hate,” writes New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin. “A month would be a good cooling-off period to allow the public-health emergency to take its rightful place at the top of the agenda without the distraction of personal sniping, which is especially demoralizing these days. In this environment, each attack smacks of pettiness and politics-as-usual. Partisanship has an important role in our enduring experiment with self-government, but not now. Now is the time for a united America to mobilize against a lethal scourge,” he continues. “A 30-day cease-fire would allow the entire nation to focus on saving lives and preventing further disaster to the economy and jobs. There would be plenty of time later to resume the political hostilities before the November election,” Mr. Goodwin advises. “An agreement would be nice, but isn’t necessary. All they need do is start behaving as Americans first and partisans second.” BORDERING ON INSANITY In the wake of the pared-down Democratic presidential field, one GOP official has a reminder. “Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are leading the Democrat Party’s charge for open borders. And they’re sounding like the same person: Biden has promised to end illegal immigration detention ‘across the board,’ and to not deport illegal immigrants who have committed felony-like offenses,” points out Steve Guest, rapid response communications director for the Republican National Committee. “Bernie backs a moratorium on all deportations of illegal immigrants in the U.S. and says that it is not ‘appropriate’ to deport illegal immigrants not following law in the U.S. And both Biden and Bernie support government health care for illegal immigrants. Bottom Line: While Bernie and Biden push for plans that would make the border crisis worse, President Trump’s deal with Mexico has achieved results,” Mr. Guest advises, citing a single Associated Press headline regarding the outcome of Mr. Trump’s productive call to Mexico to help with the illegal immigration challenge: “AP exclusive: Border apprehensions drop for eight straight months.” HELPFUL DIVERSION “Just because coronavirus has you avoiding public spaces doesn’t mean you can’t get cultured from home,” reports Fast Company analyst Lilly Smith, who shares all the details. “Google Arts & Culture has partnered with over 2,500 museums and galleries around the world, including Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum, London’s National Gallery, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

"Rep. Louie Gohmert could block the House’ final passage of the bipartisan coronavirus relief package Monday over concerns about last-minute updates to the bill. The House was set to make technical changes to the package on Monday before passing on a unanimous consent rule, which can be derailed by just one member. “I will not give my consent without first reading these very serious changes that will hopefully minimize bankruptcies caused by the virus rather than causing more,” Mr. Gohmert, Texas Republican, said in a statement. Mr. Gohmert said he has spoken to both House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and President Trump about his concerns. “My constituents did not elect the California delegation to represent them, they elected me — and that’s what I am trying to do,” he said. After a feverish 48 hours of negotiations, the House passed a massive relief package just after midnight Saturday to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers. It mandates free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those who contract the virus or need to care for someone that does if they’re at a company with fewer than 500 employees. The bill also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, such the elderly and schoolchildren and bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, who helped craft the White House-approved package with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, acknowledged Sunday there were technical changes that needed to be made before it even reached the Senate. He said he was speaking with senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, on Saturday about the bill. “We are hearing feedback that certain small businesses are concerned about the burden of this,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “I think there’s a lot of bipartisan support. We hope they pass this bill. If not, we’ll work with the center on whatever minor changes we need.” The Senate will take up the House bill once handed over and is working in the meantime to pass FISA reauthorization and reform after it lapsed Sunday.

"President Trump implored Americans Monday to avoid groups of 10 or more and enjoy takeout instead of stepping foot in restaurants, bars and food courts for the next 15 days, as the U.S. tries to avoid the fate of China or Italy in the fight against the coronavirus. His guidelines, which rely on public cooperation, say Americans should avoid discretionary travel and stay home if they are sick. Mr. Trump also wants everyone to learn or work at home, where possible, to disrupt chains of transmission. “We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it,” Mr. Trump said. It’s a sudden shift in tone from Mr. Trump, who in late February predicted the U.S. would tackle all of its cases swiftly. He now says the outbreak may last well into the summer. The White House guidelines are stiffer than ones the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released less than 24 hours earlier and come as governors and mayors enforce mandatory rules, such as shuttering schools, delaying primary voting and ordering restaurants, gyms and theaters to close outright. San Francisco and six area counties took the most stringent measures to date, saying residents can only leave home for necessities for the next three weeks, starting Tuesday. The lockdown applies to San Francisco, Marin, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa counties and the city of Berkeley. The federal, state and local moves reflect a more urgent phase in the fight against the coronavirus that’s sickened more than 4,000 in the U.S. and killed over 70, although nationwide testing is just getting started. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It infected tens of thousands in the surrounding Hubei Province before the epidemic shifted to other nations. It’s now spreading on six continents, particularly Europe. Authorities in Italy and Spain have locked down their entire populations, except for trips to work or grocery stores. France joined them on Monday. “We are at war,” French President Emmanuel Macron told the nation. Mr. Trump said he is not considering a nationwide lockdown because parts of the country aren’t seeing widespread transmission. “At this point, they shouldn’t worry,” Mr. Trump said. “We may look at certain areas, certain hotspots. We’ll be looking at that.” Mr. Trump said parts of New York, notably the suburb of New Rochelle, should be “tamped down even more” after Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, ordered a mile-wide lockdown in the town because of rapid transmission. Earlier Monday, Mr. Cuomo suggested the administration was at fault for not being explicit about quarantine measures. He said a patchwork of state-by-state rules is unworkable. “If the federal government isn’t going to do what it should do, then the states have to try their best,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference in Albany. He also called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to step in and retrofit buildings like college dorms and surplus property to function as hospitals in his state. He said there are 50,000 hospital beds and 3,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds in New York, and they might be overwhelmed. “You look at any of these projections and you see that coming,” he told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Mr. Trump said he told governors Monday to get things like ventilators through their own supply chains if they can get them faster than the federal government. In some ways, the press conference marked a pivot for Mr. Trump, as he highlighted health measures and the virus itself, instead of the financial fallout and Wall Street. He said markets would take care of themselves, and that airlines losing revenue would be taken care of at a later date. “We have an invisible enemy, we have a problem a month ago nobody thought about,” Mr. Trump said. “This is a bad one. This is bad in the sense of it’s so contagious. Sort of record-setting type contagion. My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything will fall into place.” Yet Mr. Trump continued to buck responsibility for hiccups in the response. He said he’d rate his efforts “a 10,” though a lack of testing has been an embarrassing blind spot in the U.S. response. Administration officials said they are entering a “new phase” of testing that taps commercial labs and makes it more available, with some areas opening drive-through service. The World Health Organization on Monday said testing is one of the most critical parts of the fight. “The most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate,” WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said. “You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.” The U.S. made progress in another critical area Monday — the race for a vaccine to the new coronavirus. The National Institutes of Health said it administered an investigational vaccine to a person as it kickstarts a phase-one trial at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. Scientists plan to enroll 45 healthy adults ages 18 to 55 and try out various dosages of the vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1273. It was developed by scientists at the infectious-disease arm of the National Institutes of Health and biotech company Moderna, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with [the new coronavirus] is an urgent public health priority,” said Anthony S. Fauci, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.” The vaccine model uses what’s known as messenger RNA and has shown promise in animal studies, but hasn’t been used on humans. This trial will test various dosages of the investigation vaccine. There is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19, and scientists say it could take a year to a year and a half before there is a shot for widespread use. While the world waits for an antidote, officials are imploring Americans to disrupt the spread of the disease through “social distancing,” in which people stay home when possible or six feet apart in public. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pushed to delay in-person voting from Tuesday to early June, saying it couldn’t in good conscience expose poll workers or invite crowds to its primary election. “I’m making this recommendation because we must also look out for our poll workers,” the Republican tweeted. “I believe when we look back on this, we’ll be happy we did this. The votes that have already been cast will still be counted — and this recommendation would allow others to vote in the future.” Governors across the northeast, meanwhile, decided to temporarily shutter bars, theaters and other public places late Monday, saying a lack of federal direction and public indifference to local transmission gave them no choice. Mr. Hogan defended his sweeping measures, saying he couldn’t afford to wait. “While these measures may seem extreme, if we do not take them now, it could be too late,” the governor said. Cancelations also rolled across official Washington on Monday. First Lady Melania Trump said Monday she decided to scrap the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on April 13 out of an “abundance of caution.” “The health and safety of all Americans must be the first priority, especially right now,” said First Lady Melania Trump. “I deeply regret this cancellation, but we need to make difficult decisions in the short-term to ensure a healthy country for the long-term.” The Supreme Court announced Monday it would postpone its next sitting for oral arguments due to the COVID-19 spread, saying it would look at the calendar to reschedule at a later time. The court was expected to hear cases from March 23 through April 1 but decided to put off the challenges for now. “The Court will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances,” a spokesperson announced in a press release. Some of the most eyed cases that were scheduled during that period were disputes over Congress’s authority to subpoena banking documents and other private financial records from Mr. Trump’s businesses, as well as a challenge over the validity of a subpoena out of New York to obtain the president’s tax returns. The justices were also set to hear a case involving Google, which weighs the issue of copyright protection. There was also a First Amendment dispute scheduled to be argued involving employment discrimination cases brought against religious employers. Moving the hearings is quite rare, though it has happened in the past. The court postponed arguments in 1918 during the Spanish flu epidemic. The press release also noted calendars at the court were changed in August 1793 and in 1798 over yellow fever. • Alex Swoyer contributed to this report.

"Voters like the idea of making legal immigrants pay their own way, and they are also keen on letting people sue sanctuary cities for crimes committed by illegal immigrants — both parts of President Trump’s immigration agenda — according to surprising polling numbers from Harvard University. Nearly four in five voters like the idea of an “immigration halt” with the coronavirus becoming a pandemic. Less popular is the move by a number of Democrat-led states such as New York to issue driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. Only about one-third of voters polled said people in the country without authorization should be allowed to apply for a license. The results of the Harvard Center for American Political Studies/Harris Poll suggest that Mr. Trump’s immigration policies have strong backing among the public at large, even though they are derided as racist or unfair in Washington and among Democratic leaders. “This should definitely be a warning, especially to Biden because he’s going to be the nominee, that going too far left is a real danger for him,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director at the Center for Immigration Studies. “I’m not even sure what he was thinking last night. He’s got the nomination. Why cater to the most radical anti-borders elements in his party?” Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, in a debate Sunday with Sen. Bernard Sanders, his chief opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, proposed shutting down all deportations for 100 days and then deporting only illegal immigrants with further felonies on their records. He also said he will cancel immigration detention for people awaiting court hearings if he wins the White House. He flatly said local police should not cooperate in turning over illegal immigrants to federal immigration authorities. “Xenophobia is a disease,” said Mr. Biden, condemning what he called “this demonization and divisiveness coming from the Trump administration on immigration.” The Harvard/Harris poll found immigration policy to be the second most important issue for voters, behind health care and ahead of terrorism and national security. When it comes to Mr. Trump, 49% said they approved of the president’s handling of immigration. That is at the high range of the past few years, with Harvard/Harris showing approval hovering between 44% and 49%. During his State of the Union address this year, Mr. Trump called for punishing sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal officials by allowing people victimized by illegal immigrants to sue the sanctuaries for damages. That idea earns 55% support, according to Harvard/Harris, though the pollsters asked the question without mentioning that Mr. Trump supports it. The same was true with a question on whether the government should deny green cards to immigrants who are likely to end up on the public dole. The Trump administration this year implemented a rule to do just that, and the Harvard/Harris poll said 60% support it — again, without Mr. Trump’s name attached to it. Immigrant rights activists have labeled that policy racist. They say it will hinder poor migrants from developing nations in Africa trying to achieve the American dream and reward those from richer nations in Europe. Mr. Krikorian said asking without the president’s name meant the pollsters were able to find Americans’ views without any Trump bias. He said there are probably people who would be hawkish on immigration, such as opposing sanctuary cities, though they dislike Mr. Trump. If told the president backed a crackdown, they might have a different answer to the polling question. “Because Trump’s name isn’t on there, people were giving answers based on what they actually thought policy should be rather than what is associated with the president,” he said. The Washington Times reached out to several immigrant rights activists about the numbers. They either didn’t respond or declined to tackle the questions. Mr. Trump has tied immigration to the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis, and the polling suggests Americans agree. A stunning 79% told the pollsters that an “immigration halt” should be imposed if the outbreak grows into a pandemic. On the other side of the ledger, voters resoundingly rejected the idea of issuing driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants, with 65% opposed and just 35% in favor. Immigration activists argue that illegal immigrants are on the roads anyway, and it makes more sense to license them and require them to have insurance. Fourteen states plus the District of Columbia have moved to grant licenses to those in the country without authorization, according to the National Council of State Legislatures. New York became the latest to offer licenses in December with its Green Light law. New Jersey will become the 15th state when its law takes effect in June.

"Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said late Monday that the state department of health will order polls to be closed on Tuesday as a “health emergency,” hours after a judge declined to delay the state’s March 17 presidential primary at the behest of Mr. DeWine. Mr. DeWine, a Republican, said that to conduct an election Tuesday would force poll workers and voters to place themselves “at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus.” He tweeted that Dr. Amy Acton, who heads the Ohio Department of Health, “will order the polls closed as a health emergency.” “While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State @FrankLaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,” Mr. DeWine said. Dr. Acton signed a three-page order saying that all polling locations in the state would be closed “to avoid an imminent threat with a high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19 with a significant risk of substantial harm to a large number of people in the general population.” The order said she had authority under Ohio code to “make special orders…for preventing the spread of contagious or infectious diseases.” The action came hours after Franklin County Judge Richard Frye denied a motion to push in-person voting to June 2 amid concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, saying such a move could set a terrible precedent. After the ruling, Mr. DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a joint statement saying that given the circumstances, “it simply isn’t possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by Ohioans.” “They mustn’t be forced to choose between their health and exercising their constitutional rights,” the statement said. Earlier in the day, Judge Frye had said that decision wasn’t his to make, saying he was “very reluctant” to “say well, we’ll have a judge in Columbus rewrite the election code, reset the election for some arbitrary date in the future and upset the apple cart in a terrible precedent.” Mr. DeWine spoke as voters in Ohio, Arizona, Florida, and Illinois were preparing to head to the polls to cast their ballots in a race that has been upended by concerns over the coronavirus that is changing the daily lives of millions of Americans. President Trump, who said on Monday that Americans should avoid gatherings of more than 10 people for the next 15 days as part of the coronavirus response, said postponing elections is a state matter but that he generally isn’t a fan. “I think postponing elections is not a very good thing,” Mr. Trump said. “They have lots of room in a lot of the electoral places … I think postponing is unnecessary.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday that elections can be done in a way that protects people. “We’ve limited access to the assisted living facilities in some of the areas where we may have vulnerable folks,” Mr. DeSantis said. “But at the same time, when you go and cancel that, the signal that that sends is somehow we’re paralyzed. And I don’t think that’s the case. I think we’re taking prudent steps.” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said Monday that officials understand voters might be apprehensive, but the election would proceed as planned. “This decision was not made lightly, and what it all comes down to is — that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,” Ms. Hobbs said. “The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this will become.” A spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections likewise said the state primary was proceeding as planned, saying the elections team has been working with public health officials and has made every effort to keep voters up to date on polling place location changes. Dan Kovats, executive director of the Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association, said Illinois has done a good job encouraging early voting and voting by mail over the last few cycles. “I believe we will have everything in place to ensure a legitimate primary election,” Mr. Kovats said. He said his group, in concert with the state Democratic Party, launched a large-scale texting program Monday morning to inform voters of changes in their polling locations and that he thought more than 300 precincts have had such changes. Officials in all four states already had been struggling to convince poll workers to show up and grappling with polling locations getting cut back or changed amid the escalating outbreak. Before Mr. Trump’s announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had issued guidance late Sunday recommending that the public avoid gatherings of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. In Florida, some local officials had already said they were short of where they wanted to be in terms of attracting enough workers to man the polls Tuesday in light of COVID-19. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, Florida Democrat, said Monday the state should have followed Ohio’s lead and pushed back its Tuesday election as well. “We need to protect the rights of all our citizens to safely have their voices heard,” Ms. Mucarsel-Powell tweeted, as she also expressed concern about reports of a lack of mail ballots in South Dade County. In Arizona, Maricopa County was planning to close dozens of polling locations because of COVID-19. “The closure of many polling places due to COVID-19 means it is uncertain how many voters who planned to vote on Tuesday will actually show up,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday his state will push its primary from May 19 to June 23, become the latest state leader to announce such a change. Louisiana and Georgia have already postponed their primaries that had been scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, and the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico said it was going to push for a delay in its March 29 primary.

"The Republican primary for the Kansas Senate seat has become uglier as Kris Kobach has emerged as the front-runner to succeed retiring Sen. Pat Roberts. The conservative Club for Growth has mounted a new advertising campaign attacking rival candidate Rep. Roger Marshall over his alleged poor treatment of female patients as a doctor. Mr. Kobach, Kansas’ former secretary of state, is a longtime ally of President Trump, but many Republicans are worried he would lose the Senate race, as he lost his gubernatorial bid in 2018. Mr. Kobach held a double-digit percentage point lead on Mr. Marshall, his nearest competitor, in a February McLaughlin & Associates poll. The free-market advocacy group is spending about $33,000 on a print and digital ad campaign accusing Mr. Marshall of “poor treatment of women” as an obstetrician/gynecologist. The anti-Marshall ads ran in several newspapers with large circulations in the state, including the Kansas City Star, Topeka Capital Journal and Wichita Eagle. “Online public reviews of [Mr. Marshall‘s] dealings with patients suggest his treatment of women was not received positively in far too many instances,” the print ad reads above quotations branding the candidate as “arrogant” and “insensitive.” “Are these reports accurate? What’s the truth? What was your — or your loved one’s — experience with Dr. Marshall?” The digital effort includes RogerMarshallTruth.com, which features criticism from women posted anonymously. The Club for Growth is soliciting other women to come forward with negative stories about Mr. Marshall. “Several of Dr. Marshall’s patients have raised important concerns about their treatment while under his care,” David McIntosh, Club for Growth Action president, said in a statement. “We think Kansas voters deserve to hear what these women have said, and if other women have similar stories, we hope they speak out as well.” Mr. Marshall’s campaign said he would ignore the attack ads and focus on talking with Kansans about “real issues.” “Slinging amateur garbage from a D.C. office during a national pandemic isn’t surprising coming from these losers,” said Brent Robertson, Marshall campaign spokesman, in a statement. “While we understand that they have a 2016 campaign grudge, they put the Senate majority at risk by doing the dirty work of fellow loser Kris Kobach.” The group is not the only one attacking Mr. Marshall’s candidacy. Free Forever PAC has spent $70,000 to air ads on Fox News opposing Mr. Marshall, according to the Kansas City Star. The group, which is bankrolled by billionaire Peter Thiel, is also running ads on Facebook criticizing Mr. Marshall as an unreliable supporter of Mr. Trump because of his previous support for former Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s failed 2016 presidential bid. While Mr. Kobach has a reliable supporter in Mr. Thiel, he has far fewer friends in the Republican Party establishment. The Club for Growth is not supporting Mr. Kobach’s bid and has not endorsed a candidate. The National Republican Senatorial Committee said in July that Mr. Kobach’s candidacy would “simultaneously put President Trump’s presidency and [the] Senate majority at risk.” No Democrat has won a Senate seat in Kansas since the 1930s, but the food fight on the right has proven useful for Democrats looking to expand the map of targeted states in November. State Sen. Barbara Bollier, a retired physician, is the Democratic front-runner to compete for the open seat. A former Republican who switched parties and identifies herself a “pragmatic Democrat,” she figures to make health care and the coronavirus crisis a central aspect of the campaign. The Club for Growth declined to say whether it had discussed the race with potential candidates and said its interviews are “confidential.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a former Kansas congressman, has reportedly ruled out running for the seat.

"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden has been declared the winner of last week’s Democratic presidential primary in Washington state, giving him victories in five out of six states that voted March 10. After nearly a week of counting votes, the former vice president on Monday held onto a small lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that turned out to be insurmountable. Washington was a state that Sanders had been hoping to win. In 2016, he won more than two-thirds of the delegates from the Washington caucuses over Hillary Clinton. Of the state’s 89 pledged delegates, only 31 are allocated based on the statewide result. The remaining 58 are determined based on the results of the state’s 10 congressional districts, and those results might not be calculated until the election is certified by the secretary of state’s office, which could be as late as March 27. Biden won four other states last Tuesday: Missouri, Mississippi, Michigan and Idaho. Sanders won North Dakota. In Washington, Democrats used he vote-by-mail presidential primary – moved up this year from May – for the first time to allocate delegates instead of the smaller caucuses used in previous years. Four states – Arizona, Ohio, Illinois and Florida – are scheduled to hold primaries on Tuesday.

"The Justice Department filed a motion Monday to dismiss charges against Concord Management and Consulting, a Russian company accused of bankrolling schemes to meddle in the 2016 election. Federal prosecutors said in a court filing that pursuing the case could expose American law-enforcement methods they’d prefer to keep under wraps. “The risk of exposure to law enforcement’s tools and techniques, and the post-indictment change in the proof available at trial, the balance of equities has shifted,” they wrote. “It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution.” Concord had been using the case as a means to gather intelligence about how the United States combats foreign election interference, the prosecutors alleged. “Concord has been eager and aggressive in using the judicial system to gather information about how the United States detects and prevents foreign election interference,” the filing said. It is a stunning reversal that just weeks before the case was set to head to trial. Concord Management was among 13 Russian individuals and two companies charged in 2018 by former special counsel Robert Mueller. The government said they used social media to sow discord and spread disinformation to undermine the 2016 election. Concord Management, owned by Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, is accused of bankrolling a Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency. It was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. Mr. Prigozhin was nicknamed “Putin’s Chef” for his close relationship with the Russian president. Although others ignored the charges, Concord fought Mr. Mueller’s team in court. But instead of defending itself, Concord used the case as a means to obtain secret information about how the government detected the purported meddling. Prosecutors worried about sharing in discovery a trove of documents with Concord that detailed government sources and methods. Fears that Concord will make the information public were raised by prosecutors in earlier court filings. Several non-classified documents that prosecutors turned over to Concord’s defense team ended up on a website last fall, angering the Justice Department. All told, more than a thousand files were posted on the website, prosecutors said. At the time, the documents were even promoted on a newly-created Twitter account hyping the material as access to Mr. Mueller’s secret database. Prosecutors said Monday such tricks made the case run counter to the government’s interests, especially given its limited ability to punish a Russian corporation. “The government has concluded that further proceedings as to Concord, a Russian company with no presence in the United States and exposure to a meaningful punishment in the event of a conviction, promotes neither the interests of justice nor the nation’s security,” they wrote.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department is moving to drop charges against two Russian companies that were accused of funding a social media campaign to sway American public opinion during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Prosecutors said they concluded that a trial, against a corporate defendant with no presence in the United States and no prospect of meaningful punishment even if convicted, would likely expose sensitive law enforcement tools and techniques, “potentially undermining their effectiveness.” Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering were among three companies and 13 individuals charged in 2018 by special counsel Robert Mueller in a conspiracy to spread disinformation on social media during the 2016 presidential race. The effort was aimed at dividing American public opinion and sowing discord in the electorate, officials said.  The case was one of the signature indictments from Mueller’s two-year Russia investigation. Together with a separate case against Russian government hackers accused of breaking into Democratic email accounts, it revealed a sweeping Russian effort to influence, or interfere in, the race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Concord was the sole defendant in the case to enter an appearance in Washington’s federal court and contest the allegations. The case had been set for trial next month, making the government’s filing all the more abrupt. Concord is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as “Putin’s chef” for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been hit with U.S. sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 election and is charged alongside his company in the indictment brought by Mueller. The company, with the help of a high-powered law firm, filed a series of motions over the last two years, including to dismiss charges and to exclude certain evidence from the case.  In January 2019, prosecutors alleged that confidential material from the Russia investigation, which had been handed over to defense attorneys for Concord, was altered and disseminated as part of a disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the special counsel’s Russia investigation. The files surfaced online in a link posted by a pro-Russia Twitter account. But the Justice Department stopped short of accusing Concord of leaking the material. Still, prosecutors argued that the company’s request to have sensitive new evidence sent to Russia “unreasonably risks the national security interests of the United States.”  Some of the court appearances in the case have been unusually contentious, with the federal judge overseeing it chastising a lawyer for Concord, Eric Dubelier, for references in court filings to Looney Tunes and the 1978 raunchy comedy “Animal House” to criticize the Mueller investigation. “I’ll say it plain and simply: Knock it off,” U.S District Judge Dabney Friedrich told Dubelier at a January 2019 court appearance. Dubelier, who has referred to the case as involving a “made up” crime, has made allegations of prosecutorial misconduct and even once accused the judge of bias. The judge rejected the allegation. But with the case approaching trial, prosecutors said they had to weigh the risk of potentially exposing sensitive national security information against the benefits of continuing with the case against a company that likely wouldn’t face any significant punishment in the U.S.  In the court filing on Monday, prosecutors said Concord had been “eager and aggressive in using the judicial system to gather information about how the United States detects and prevents foreign election interference.”  “In short, Concord has demonstrated its intent to reap the benefits of the Court’s jurisdiction while positioning itself to evade any real obligations or responsibility,” prosecutors wrote. “It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country’s national security to continue this prosecution.”  Concord Catering did not have attorneys appear in court, but prosecutors said they would seek to drop charges against that company as well because it too was controlled by Prigozhin and “based on the likelihood that its approach to litigation would be the same as Concord.” Prosecutors vowed to continue to pursue their case against the 13 Russians who were named in Mueller’s indictment, along with the troll farm that Concord was alleged to have funded, the Internet Research Agency.

"An Ohio judge on Monday denied a motion to push in-person voting in the state’s presidential primary past March 17, after Gov. Mike DeWine had said earlier in the day he was advocating a delay because of concerns over the expanding coronavirus outbreak. Franklin County Judge Richard Frye said he was “very reluctant” to “have a judge in Columbus rewrite the election code, reset the election for some arbitrary date in the future and upset the apple cart in a terrible precedent.” Pending any potential appeal, the ruling means that Ohio’s presidential primary is on for Tuesday despite Mr. DeWine’s last-minute overture. Judge Frye said there are too many factors to balance in the “uncharted territory” of taking things away from the legislature and elected statewide officials and throwing things to “a common pleas court judge in Columbus with 12 hours to go until the election.” Mr. DeWine had acknowledged earlier in the day that he couldn’t unilaterally move the election, but had expressed hope that a judge would grant a favorable ruling to a legal petition. “We cannot conduct this election, in-person voting, for 13 hours…and conform to [federal] guidelines,” Mr. DeWine said. “It is therefore my recommendation…that voting be extended until June 2nd.”  ",Judge rejects Ohio bid to delay primary,"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/judge-richard-frye-rejects-ohio-primary-delay/,washington_times
"WASHINGTON (AP) -  The U.S. Senate has voted to extend, rather than tweak, three surveillance powers that federal law enforcement officials use to fight terrorists, passing the bill back to an absent House and throwing the future of the authorities in doubt.  The 75-day extension pushes off the debate over the surveillance tools as Congress attempts to deal with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. It is not yet clear whether the House will accept the temporary extension of the surveillance powers, which lapsed on Sunday. The House last week passed a compromise bill negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy that would renew the authorities and impose new restrictions. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed the measure, but longtime skeptics of the surveillance tools in the Senate blocked a quick passage.  The House legislation would update the three expiring surveillance provisions, including one that permits the FBI to obtain court orders to collect business records on subjects in national security investigations. Another, known as the “roving wiretap” provision, permits surveillance on subjects even after they’ve changed phones. The third allows agents to monitor subjects who don’t have ties to international terrorism organizations.  The legislation would scale back some current authorities, such as the government’s access to certain records. It would also attempt to put stronger checks on some surveillance measures and make the process more transparent.  The compromise reflects angst in both parties about the way the surveillance powers have been used, but also a reluctance to strip those powers from the government’s arsenal. Republicans and Democrats in the House broadly agreed that they did not want civil liberties sacrificed in efforts to thwart terrorism and other crimes.  It is unclear whether the House will vote on the Senate extension, which would make no changes to the authorities during the 75 days. A Democratic aide said that House leadership was discussing how to move forward, as the House is on recess and has no set date for returning.  The Senate passed the extension by voice vote Monday after days of negotiations between McConnell and Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. The chamber had originally been scheduled to take a procedural vote to move forward on the House legislation, a step that would have set up final passage for later in the week. It’s not clear whether McConnell had enough votes for the House bill to pass.  McConnell said Monday evening that the Senate would eventually consider the House bill and several amendments, conceding to the demands from the three senators. The amendments would impose restrictions beyond the House bill on the government’s ability to surveil and gather information on Americans.  Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., speaking on the floor for McConnell, objected to that same deal last week, saying the Senate should pass the House bill. But there appeared to be more urgency to put off the surveillance issue Monday as coronavirus cases spiked in the United States and the economic damage mounted.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders emerged from the 2016 election and his strong challenge to eventual nominee Hillary Clinton believing the Democratic Party was at a tipping point, ready for his brand of democratic socialism. It’s increasingly apparent that he misread the voters. After a couple of early wins, Mr. Sanders has fallen on tough times in the Democratic primary, watching former Vice President Joseph R. Biden rocket past him, both in terms of state wins and the chase for delegates. Mr. Biden is poised for another big night Tuesday as voters in Arizona, Florida and Illinois vote in the Democratic primary — all states where Mr. Sanders trails badly in polling. Ohio is also slated to hold its primary, though the governor petitioned a court Monday for a postponement amid coronavirus fears. Analysts said it’s not that primary voters are rejecting Mr. Sanders‘ ideas, but they have a different goal in mind right now than policies like Medicare for All. “There is a great concern among Democrats about ensuring that Donald Trump is a one-term president and I think the Democratic establishment, and the media, has done a good job educating voters that if your goal is to beat Trump, Sanders is the candidate who is probably the least likely to help you achieve that goal,” said Mark P. Jones, political science professor at Rice University in Houston. Even voters who might agree with Mr. Sanders on policy see him as a tougher candidate for the party to sell to the nation. “That is certainly the case in Texas, where even many very progressive Democrats view Sanders as a nightmare for their broader goals of turning Texas purple, flipping the Texas House, having a seat at the redistricting table in 2021 and removing Donald Trump from The White House,” Mr. Jones said. It’s apparently the case in places like Michigan, where Mr. Sanders won the 2016 primary by scoring big in rural areas and overcoming Mrs. Clinton’s lead in Detroit. For liberal activists, that was proof that white working class voters were more excited about rallying behind the Sanders‘ revolution than they were in getting behind Mrs. Clinton’s more “moderate” vision. Last week, though, Mr. Biden easily carried the state — including the rural areas. “Bernie was making the fatal assumption that all of the 40 something percent of the vote that he got in the [2016] primary was favorable to his brand of progressivism,” said John Couvillon, a pollster. “I think the bigger question was how much of that was a visceral reaction to Hillary Clinton because what happened in Michigan didn’t just end in the primary. It continued on to the general election when Donald Trump upset Hillary Clinton there.” Mr. Sanders 2020 rejection in Michigan came even though 57% of primary voters told exit polling they backed Mr. Sanders‘ marquee idea of a “Medicare for All” government-run health care system. That also was true in states from Mississippi to Maine, where strong majorities said they liked Medicare for All — but rejected Mr. Sanders in favor of Mr. Biden. Nina Turner, national co-chair for the Sanders‘ campaign, described the trend as “the damnedest thing.” “It really doesn’t make sense. The world is really upside down,” Ms. Turner said. “The senator worked so hard for what four years ago seemed like it was impossible — for his vision for this country to be in the mainstream. And now his vision for the country is mainstream, and people are voting the other way.” “The forces of the status quo have been effective in portraying the two-term vice president as a pillar and really villainizing the senator,” she said. Meanwhile, Neil Sroka, spokesman for the progressive PAC Democracy for America, agreed that Mr. Sanders‘ benefited from running against Mrs. Clinton, but disagreed with the notion that his camp learned the wrong lessons of 2016. “No, we read it right,” Mr. Sroka said. “What has become clear is that, because of the media environment and because of elite opinion, a lot of voters have voted in this race as pundits, most have put punditry ahead of passion and ultimately made a decision essentially rooted in fear of re-electing Donald Trump more than in their preferred vision of the future.” On the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders acknowledges he’s losing the electability debate, even as he says he’s won on the ideas. “I cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said, ‘I like what your campaign stands for, I agree with what your campaign stands for, but I am going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,’” Mr. Sanders said at a press conference in Vermont last week. “We have heard that statement all over the country.” “Needless to say, I disagree with that assertion,” he said. He says that to beat Mr. Trump, the Democratic nominee must tap into new voters, reaching record turnout. He predicted that would happen in the primaries — but to a large extent, it has not. While Mr. Sanders has outperformed Mr. Biden among younger voters, they’ve not surged in turnout, according to exit polling. In just one state, Iowa, have they accounted for a larger share of the Democratic primary vote than they did in 2016. Meanwhile, 11 of the states where exit polling was conducted have seen a spike in the percentage of older people that turned out. That has been good news for Mr. Biden, who has been far and away the top choice of greying voters.

"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on China’s Communist Party to halt disinformation spread by propaganda outlets claiming the novel coronavirus was first spread in China by the U.S. Army. Mr. Pompeo made the comments in a phone call Monday to Yang Jiechi, director of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the Communist Party of China. The secretary “conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,” according to a statement issued by the State Department. “The secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat.” Mr. Yang, according to state-run Chinese television, told Mr. Pompeo that any attempt to smear China for its efforts to counter the coronavirus “will not succeed,” Reuters reported. The Chinese senior diplomat also threatened unspecified retaliation about what he said were efforts by U.S. politicians to denigrate China’s efforts to fight the virus. The exchange is the latest in Washington and Beijing’s growing war of words about the virus. White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien had harsh criticism in remarks last week to The Heritage Foundation for China’s early handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Mr. O’Brien said that instead of using best practices for handling new diseases, “this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up.” Doctors who sought to disclose the virus were imprisoned or silenced, he added. “It probably cost the world community two months to respond, and those two months … could have dramatically curtailed what happened in China and what is now happening across the world,” he said. First hints of disinformation Zhong Nanshan, a senior Chinese government scientist, first hinted in a late February press conference that the virus may not have originated in China. Last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian promoted the conspiracy theory on Twitter by saying the virus was brought to China by the U.S. Army. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” Mr. Zhao tweeted. He urged people to read an article in a Canadian publication known for spreading Russian disinformation that claimed the Army had spread the virus in China. “Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” China’s ambassador to South Africa retweeted the post and called it “more evidence” that the virus was “not so-called ‘made in China.’” Some U.S. lawmakers have urged the Trump administration to launch a more aggressive campaign to counter Beijing’s narrative. Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, denounced what he called a “shameless new chapter in China’s cynical campaign to control its own image.” “America has worked to assist all countries — China very much included — suffering from this pandemic,” he said in an op-ed on Breitbart.com. “But we cannot stand by as Beijing’s lies result in economic decline and in lives threatened across the world.” Chinese officials initially said the virus originated from a wild food market in Wuhan. However, some of the first people who contracted the flulike disease were not associated with the Wuhan seafood market that was thought to be the source. Health researchers believe the virus originated in bats, jumped to another wild animal and then spread to humans. Wuhan, however, is the location of China’s sole high-security biological research lab that is known to study coronaviruses, leading to speculation that the virus may have escaped from the laboratory through an infected worker or a lab animal sold to the market. Uneven response Prior to Mr. Pompeo’s statement, the State Department privately dressed down Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai over suspected disinformation efforts related to the pandemic. David Stillwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs delivered a diplomatic protest Friday, and Mr. Cui was later shown leaving the department in a video that went viral. President Trump, who has said the pandemic was caused by a “foreign virus,” has also sought to play down the controversy. He told reporters, “I did read one article, but I don’t think that article was representative — certainly not of my conversations with President Xi — and they know where it came from. We all know where it came from.” Lea Gabrielle, director of the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which is charged with countering foreign disinformation, told The Washington Times on Sunday that the Chinese are “engaged in an all-out aggressive campaign to try to reshape the global narrative around the coronavirus, essentially to the degree of trying to provide an alternate reality of what has actually happened since December.” She offered no specifics but said China’s propaganda efforts have “caused us to have to react with a full-spectrum activation of our own public messaging and diplomatic engagement, and really just having to push access to fact-based information by our own communicators so they’re able to counter these false narratives with local audiences.” Michael Pillsbury, a China analyst with the Hudson Institute and unofficial adviser to President Trump, said the Chinese were using disinformation techniques learned from the Soviet Union during the Cold War, including a false report uncovered by U.S. officials claiming that the U.S. Army created AIDS, he said. “There’s a social science theory that if you get your story out first, you get that first impression,” Mr. Pillsbury said on Fox News. “That’s what the Chinese seem to be doing.” Mr. Pillsbury said China is also pushing the argument that it is “racist” to call the coronavirus the Chinese virus or the Wuhan virus. “They’ve also gone further by telling stories that there were American soldiers [in China] for a competition, creating doubt about our motives,” Mr. Pillsbury said. Spotlight on China Christian Whiton is a former U.S. government official who has studied the use of foreign disinformation. “I can understand why Secretary Pompeo doesn’t want to get in a tit for tat with a mere Foreign Ministry spokesman, but we’re missing a great opportunity to spotlight China’s lies and force people to ask why they are resorting to disinformation, and what that says about the stability of Xi Jinping’s government,” Mr. Whiton said. Retired Navy Capt. Jim Fanell, a former Pacific Fleet intelligence director, said Chinese state-run media are continuing to spread the disinformation on a U.S.-origin of the virus. “The demarche appears to have had no impact given the several articles used today from PRC state-sponsored press organs that continue to spout this lie,” he said. “Our public diplomacy, which never recovered from the elimination of the U.S. Information Agency after the Cold War, is still a confused mess,” he said. “It brings to mind a quote by David Lloyd George about the intelligence bureaucracy: ‘It appears in the budget at quite a substantial figure, but when it comes to information it is not visible.’” Rich Higgins, a former National Security Council staff member in charge of strategic communication, said the entire global pandemic is the result of the Chinese Communist Party’s effort to cover up the initial outbreak and refuse to allow outside specialists into the country. “The U.S. government needs to expose and reinforce the [Communist Party‘s] culpability in the current situation to the American public, the Chinese people and the international community,” Mr. Higgins said. “In addition, the U.S. government needs to specifically call out the media interests in the United States that are busily parroting CCP talking points during this crisis.”  ",'Alternate reality': U.S. demands China halt coronavirus 'disinformation',"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/us-demands-china-halt-coronavirus-propaganda/,washington_times
"NEW YORK (AP) - A Florida man charged with conspiring with associates of Rudy Giuliani to make illegal campaign contributions claims prosecutors shouldn’t get to use electronics he mailed to lawyers in the case against him, but prosecutors disagreed Monday. Prosecutors said in papers filed in Manhattan federal court that they legally obtained a hard-copy notebook and electronic devices belonging to David Correia last October. They said Correia tried to mail them to his lawyers before flying to New York to surrender, apparently to avoid having them seized when he was arrested. Prosecutors obtained a warrant for the package and seized it, according to a letter prosecutors sent to Judge J. Paul Oetken. Correia’s claim that the materials are protected by attorney-client privilege is meritless, prosecutors said. They noted that a separate “filter team” of prosecutors supervised by senior prosecutors not handling the case were reviewing the materials to separate anything that was privileged. Correia, of West Palm Beach, Florida, has pleaded not guilty. He’s among four men charged with arranging illegal contributions to politicians to aid their political and business interests. Prosecutors said Correia was involved in a scheme to make illegal campaign donations to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada and other states in an attempt to get support for a new recreational marijuana business. Two other men charged in the case, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, worked with Giuliani to try and get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Democrat Joe Biden. They have both pleaded not guilty to charges. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who has served as a legal adviser to President Donald Trump, has said he had no knowledge of illegal donations and hadn’t seen any evidence that Parnas and Fruman did anything wrong. The judge, at the request of prosecutors, ordered defense lawyers to make any claims to block use of the electronic evidence by March 23. A message left with Correia’s lawyer for comment was not immediately returned.

"EL PASO, Texas (AP) - U.S. immigration courts sharply scaled back operations Monday but have stopped well short of a total shutdown demanded by employees, including judges and government attorneys. Wearing face masks, about 30 asylum seekers who had been waiting in Mexico were escorted by authorities into a federal building in El Paso, Texas, some carrying children.  They reported, as instructed, to a border crossing at 4 a.m. Monday and were driven to the court in white vans. Journalists were barred from the courtroom on the grounds that it was too crowded. A lawyer who attended said the judge appeared by video conference, and few, if any migrants wore masks once the hearing began.  “All of the benches are taken up,” Imelda Maynard said. “Most of the children are asleep in their parent’s arms.” The Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review late Sunday postponed preliminary hearings for people who aren’t in custody through April 10. While significant, the order doesn’t extend to courts in immigration detention centers or to the government’s “Migrant Protection Protocols” policy to make asylum seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in the U.S. It also didn’t apply to final hearings which determine whether migrants are granted asylum. The announcement came hours after judges and attorneys called for all courts to close for two to four weeks. “The (Justice Department) is failing to meet its obligations to ensure a safe and healthy environment within our Immigration Courts,” read a joint statement by the National Association of Immigration Judges, the American Immigration Lawyers Association and the American Federation of Government Employees Local 511, which represents Homeland Security Department attorneys.  Some asylum-seekers in the program known informally as “Remain in Mexico” live in squalid conditions outside in the Mexican border city of Matamoros. Others live in crowded migrant shelters in Mexico. The number of people on a typical day in immigration court exceeds 50, said Elise Wilkinson, a Houston-area immigration attorney. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday recommended  that the public avoid gatherings larger than 10 people over the next 15 days.  The judge’s union pressed Monday for additional action.  Judge Samuel Cole, speaking in his capacity as union spokesman, faulted lack of planning for “the current disaster of mismanagement and ad hoc decisions.”  “It is indefensible how they have placed people’s lives in danger,” he said. Of the decision to stick with “Remain in Mexico” hearings, the judges union said on Twitter, “The risks are simply too high.”  ___ Associated Press writers Nomaan Merchant in Houston and Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report.

"President Trump suggested Monday that he’d be open to making some changes to the House-passed coronavirus bill. “They’re [the Senate] working to only enhance it and make it better and make it fair for everybody,” he said. “We may go back and forth a bit with the House on it but both will be in a very positive fashion.” The bill still needs to be passed with some technical changes in the House on Monday before it even reaches the Senate — though attempting to pass the updates with a unanimous consent rule can be derailed by just one member. After a feverish 48 hours of negotiations, just after midnight on Saturday, the House passed a massive relief package to alleviate the pressure on families and hourly workers. It mandated free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone that does if they’re at a company with less than 500 employees. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, who helped craft the White House-approved package with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on Sunday acknowledged there were technical changes that needed to be made before it even reached the Senate. He said he was speaking with senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, on Saturday about the bill. “We are hearing feedback that certain small businesses are concerned about the burden of this,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “I think there’s a lot of bipartisan support. We hope they pass this bill. If not, we’ll work with the center on whatever minor changes we need.”  ",Trump floats changes to House coronavirus bill,"Monday, March 16, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/16/donald-trump-floats-house-coronavirus-bill-changes/,washington_times
"President Trump implored Americans Monday to avoid groups of 10 or more and enjoy takeout instead of stepping foot in restaurants, bars and food courts for the next 15 days, as the U.S. tries to avoid the fate of China or Italy in the fight against the coronavirus. His guidelines, which rely on public cooperation, say Americans should avoid discretionary travel and stay home if they are sick. Mr. Trump also wants everyone to learn or work at home, where possible, to disrupt chains of transmission. “We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it,” Mr. Trump said. It’s a sudden shift in tone from Mr. Trump, who in late February predicted the U.S. would tackle all of its cases swiftly. He now says the outbreak may last well into the summer. The White House guidelines are stiffer than ones the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released less than 24 hours earlier and come as governors and mayors enforce mandatory rules, such as shuttering schools, delaying primary voting and ordering restaurants, gyms and theaters to close outright. San Francisco and six area counties took the most stringent measures to date, saying residents can only leave home for necessities for the next three weeks, starting Tuesday. The lockdown applies to San Francisco, Marin, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa counties and the city of Berkeley. The federal, state and local moves reflect a more urgent phase in the fight against the coronavirus that’s sickened more than 4,000 in the U.S. and killed over 70, although nationwide testing is just getting started. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It infected tens of thousands in the surrounding Hubei Province before the epidemic shifted to other nations. It’s now spreading on six continents, particularly Europe. Authorities in Italy and Spain have locked down their entire populations, except for trips to work or grocery stores. France joined them on Monday. “We are at war,” French President Emmanuel Macron told the nation. Mr. Trump said he is not considering a nationwide lockdown because parts of the country aren’t seeing widespread transmission. “At this point, they shouldn’t worry,” Mr. Trump said. “We may look at certain areas, certain hotspots. We’ll be looking at that.” Mr. Trump said parts of New York, notably the suburb of New Rochelle, should be “tamped down even more” after Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, ordered a mile-wide lockdown in the town because of rapid transmission. Earlier Monday, Mr. Cuomo suggested the administration was at fault for not being explicit about quarantine measures. He said a patchwork of state-by-state rules is unworkable. “If the federal government isn’t going to do what it should do, then the states have to try their best,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference in Albany. He also called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to step in and retrofit buildings like college dorms and surplus property to function as hospitals in his state. He said there are 50,000 hospital beds and 3,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds in New York, and they might be overwhelmed. “You look at any of these projections and you see that coming,” he told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Mr. Trump said he told governors Monday to get things like ventilators through their own supply chains if they can get them faster than the federal government. In some ways, the press conference marked a pivot for Mr. Trump, as he highlighted health measures and the virus itself, instead of the financial fallout and Wall Street. He said markets would take care of themselves, and that airlines losing revenue would be taken care of at a later date. “We have an invisible enemy, we have a problem a month ago nobody thought about,” Mr. Trump said. “This is a bad one. This is bad in the sense of it’s so contagious. Sort of record-setting type contagion. My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything will fall into place.” Yet Mr. Trump continued to buck responsibility for hiccups in the response. He said he’d rate his efforts “a 10,” though a lack of testing has been an embarrassing blind spot in the U.S. response. Administration officials said they are entering a “new phase” of testing that taps commercial labs and makes it more available, with some areas opening drive-through service. The World Health Organization on Monday said testing is one of the most critical parts of the fight. “The most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate,” WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said. “You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.” The U.S. made progress in another critical area Monday — the race for a vaccine to the new coronavirus. The National Institutes of Health said it administered an investigational vaccine to a person as it kickstarts a phase-one trial at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. Scientists plan to enroll 45 healthy adults ages 18 to 55 and try out various dosages of the vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1273. It was developed by scientists at the infectious-disease arm of the National Institutes of Health and biotech company Moderna, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with [the new coronavirus] is an urgent public health priority,” said Anthony S. Fauci, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.” The vaccine model uses what’s known as messenger RNA and has shown promise in animal studies, but hasn’t been used on humans. This trial will test various dosages of the investigation vaccine. There is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19, and scientists say it could take a year to a year and a half before there is a shot for widespread use. While the world waits for an antidote, officials are imploring Americans to disrupt the spread of the disease through “social distancing,” in which people stay home when possible or six feet apart in public. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine pushed to delay in-person voting from Tuesday to early June, saying it couldn’t in good conscience expose poll workers or invite crowds to its primary election. “I’m making this recommendation because we must also look out for our poll workers,” the Republican tweeted. “I believe when we look back on this, we’ll be happy we did this. The votes that have already been cast will still be counted — and this recommendation would allow others to vote in the future.” Governors across the northeast, meanwhile, decided to temporarily shutter bars, theaters and other public places late Monday, saying a lack of federal direction and public indifference to local transmission gave them no choice. Mr. Hogan defended his sweeping measures, saying he couldn’t afford to wait. “While these measures may seem extreme, if we do not take them now, it could be too late,” the governor said. Cancellations also rolled across official Washington on Monday. First lady Melania Trump said Monday she decided to scrap the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on April 13 out of an “abundance of caution.” “The health and safety of all Americans must be the first priority, especially right now,” Mrs. Trump said. “I deeply regret this cancellation, but we need to make difficult decisions in the short-term to ensure a healthy country for the long-term.” The Supreme Court announced Monday it would postpone its next sitting for oral arguments due to the COVID-19 spread, saying it would look at the calendar to reschedule at a later time. The court was expected to hear cases from March 23 through April 1 but decided to put off the challenges for now. “The Court will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances,” a spokesperson announced in a press release. Some of the most eyed cases that were scheduled during that period were disputes over Congress’s authority to subpoena banking documents and other private financial records from Mr. Trump’s businesses, as well as a challenge over the validity of a subpoena out of New York to obtain the president’s tax returns. The justices were also set to hear a case involving Google, which weighs the issue of copyright protection. There was also a First Amendment dispute scheduled to be argued involving employment discrimination cases brought against religious employers. Moving the hearings is quite rare, though it has happened in the past. The court postponed arguments in 1918 during the Spanish flu epidemic. The press release also noted calendars at the court were changed in August 1793 and in 1798 over yellow fever. • Alex Swoyer contributed to this report.

"Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said late Monday that the state department of health will order polls to be closed on Tuesday as a “health emergency,” hours after a judge declined to delay the state’s March 17 presidential primary at the behest of Mr. DeWine. Mr. DeWine, a Republican, said that to conduct an election Tuesday would force poll workers and voters to place themselves “at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus.” He tweeted that Dr. Amy Acton, who heads the Ohio Department of Health, “will order the polls closed as a health emergency.” “While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State @FrankLaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity,” Mr. DeWine said. Dr. Acton signed a three-page order saying that all polling locations in the state would be closed “to avoid an imminent threat with a high probability of widespread exposure to COVID-19 with a significant risk of substantial harm to a large number of people in the general population.” The order said she had authority under Ohio code to “make special orders…for preventing the spread of contagious or infectious diseases.” The action came hours after Franklin County Judge Richard Frye denied a motion to push in-person voting to June 2 amid concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, saying such a move could set a terrible precedent. After the ruling, Mr. DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a joint statement saying that given the circumstances, “it simply isn’t possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by Ohioans.” “They mustn’t be forced to choose between their health and exercising their constitutional rights,” the statement said. Earlier in the day, Judge Frye had said that decision wasn’t his to make, saying he was “very reluctant” to “say well, we’ll have a judge in Columbus rewrite the election code, reset the election for some arbitrary date in the future and upset the apple cart in a terrible precedent.” Mr. DeWine spoke as voters in Ohio, Arizona, Florida, and Illinois were preparing to head to the polls to cast their ballots in a race that has been upended by concerns over the coronavirus that is changing the daily lives of millions of Americans. President Trump, who said on Monday that Americans should avoid gatherings of more than 10 people for the next 15 days as part of the coronavirus response, said postponing elections is a state matter but that he generally isn’t a fan. “I think postponing elections is not a very good thing,” Mr. Trump said. “They have lots of room in a lot of the electoral places. … I think postponing is unnecessary.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday that elections can be done in a way that protects people. “We’ve limited access to the assisted living facilities in some of the areas where we may have vulnerable folks,” Mr. DeSantis said. “But at the same time, when you go and cancel that, the signal that that sends is somehow we’re paralyzed. And I don’t think that’s the case. I think we’re taking prudent steps.” Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said Monday that officials understand voters might be apprehensive, but the election would proceed as planned. “This decision was not made lightly, and what it all comes down to is — that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,” Ms. Hobbs said. “The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this will become.” A spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections likewise said the state primary was proceeding as planned, saying the elections team has been working with public health officials and has made every effort to keep voters up to date on polling place location changes. Dan Kovats, executive director of the Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association, said Illinois has done a good job encouraging early voting and voting by mail over the last few cycles. “I believe we will have everything in place to ensure a legitimate primary election,” Mr. Kovats said. He said his group, in concert with the state Democratic Party, launched a large-scale texting program Monday morning to inform voters of changes in their polling locations and that he thought more than 300 precincts have had such changes. Officials in all four states already had been struggling to convince poll workers to show up and grappling with polling locations getting cut back or changed amid the escalating outbreak. Before Mr. Trump’s announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had issued guidance late Sunday recommending that the public avoid gatherings of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. In Florida, some local officials had already said they were short of where they wanted to be in terms of attracting enough workers to man the polls Tuesday in light of COVID-19. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, Florida Democrat, said Monday the state should have followed Ohio’s lead and pushed back its Tuesday election as well. “We need to protect the rights of all our citizens to safely have their voices heard,” Ms. Mucarsel-Powell tweeted, as she also expressed concern about reports of a lack of mail ballots in South Dade County. In Arizona, Maricopa County was planning to close dozens of polling locations because of COVID-19. “The closure of many polling places due to COVID-19 means it is uncertain how many voters who planned to vote on Tuesday will actually show up,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday his state will push its primary from May 19 to June 23, become the latest state leader to announce such a change. Louisiana and Georgia have already postponed their primaries that had been scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, and the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico said it was going to push for a delay in its March 29 primary.

"Stocks plunged again on Monday to wipe out nearly all of the three-year-long Trump rally, while U.S. airlines reeling from the coronavirus pandemic asked for $50 billion in federal aid and the White House weighed an economic rescue plan that is likely to top $800 billion. President Trump conceded the U.S. could be headed into a recession, but he predicted the markets would surge once the crisis subsides. “It may be,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re not thinking in terms of recession. We’re thinking in terms of the virus.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 2,997 points, or 12.9%, to close at 20,188. It was the Dow’s single biggest point drop in history. That’s more than 30% off its high just last month of 29,568. When Mr. Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, the Dow stood at 19,827. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 12.3%, while the S&P 500 was down 11.9%. Stocks fell so rapidly at the opening bell that the drop triggered an automatic temporary halt in operations for the third time in the past six trading days. The massive market losses, worst on a percentage basis since 1987, came despite the Federal Reserve’s emergency actions on Sunday to lower interest rates and pump more money into the economy to combat the impact of the coronavirus. The Fed on Sunday slashed interest rates by a full percentage point to zero, and said it would buy $700 billion in Treasury securities in a massive emergency move to protect the U.S. economy from the pandemic. Analysts increasingly are predicting a recession.

"Ronald Klain, an adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s presidential campaign, on Tuesday questioned Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s move to order the polls closed in his state’s presidential primary contest. Mr. Klain did compliment Mr. DeWine for his efforts on responding to the coronavirus outbreak, saying he’s been one of the “leading governors” and that it’s not a partisan issue. “[I’m] a little worried that this was done in defiance of a court order and that the state didn’t pursue this through the courts as it should have,” Mr. Klain, who coordinated the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak, said on CNN’s “New Day.” “I understand why Gov. DeWine did what he did, but I think we can have both public health and democracy,” Mr. Klain said. “I just think we have to make sure we’re doing these things the right way,” he continued. “The fact that the court ordered him not to do this, and he didn’t appeal that order [was] a little concerning.” Mr. DeWine said late Monday that Amy Acton, who heads the Ohio Department of Health, was ordering the polls closed as part of a health emergency. That announcement came after Franklin County Judge Richard Frye had turned aside a request to delay in-person voting in the March 17 primary at the behest of Mr. DeWine. The governor had acknowledged earlier in the day that he couldn’t unilaterally move the election and that he hoped for a favorable ruling from a judge. Dr. Acton’s order said she had authority under state code to “make special orders … for preventing the spread of contagious or infectious diseases.” Mr. Biden has been comfortably leading Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont in public polling on Ohio, as well as in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. Those three states are pressing forward with their presidential primaries on Tuesday. A delay in voting in Ohio, coupled with the news that states like Georgia and Louisiana have postponed their primaries that were supposed to happen in the coming weeks, adds additional uncertainty to a race Mr. Biden is leading. The developments could give Mr. Sanders an incentive to hang around in the race longer than he might otherwise. After Sunday’s debate, Mr. Sanders said it was a valid question as to whether Tuesday’s primaries should be postponed. “I’m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people, doing all that stuff,” Mr. Sanders said on CNN. “Does that make a lot of sense? [I’m] not sure that it does.”  ","Ronald Klain, Joe Biden's campaign adviser, questions Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine's move to close polls"," -

"The Ohio Supreme Court overnight Tuesday turned aside a challenge that sought to keep some polls open for the state’s March 17 elections, after the state’s director of public health ordered them closed in light of the coronavirus outbreak. The complaint was filed on behalf of Corey Speweik, who is running for a seat on the Wood County Court of Common Pleas. It argues that changing the primary date would violate the “bedrock separation of powers” in the state constitution and that it would cause “chaos” for independent candidates. The decision, agreed to by four of the seven justices, simply read “writ denied.” Mr. Speweik had tried to get the court to compel Secretary of State Frank LaRose to hold the Wood County primary on March 17. In response, lawyers for the state said Mr. LaRose has no “clear legal duty” to heed the request and pointed out that Amy Acton, who heads the Ohio Department of Health, issued an order requiring that polls be closed on March 17. “The Secretary will not violate a clear legal duty by complying with an order from Ohio’s Health Director during a pandemic,” they said. Gov. Mike DeWine said late Monday that the polls would be closed due to a “health emergency,” capping a madcap day after a Franklin County judge had denied a request to push back in-person voting in Ohio just hours earlier. The complaint had cited comments from Mr. DeWine and Mr. LaRose at a Monday press conference where they had pushed for a delay in in-person voting. Those comments came before Franklin County Judge Richard Frye’s ruling and before Dr. Acton ordered the polls closed late Monday. Mr. DeWine and Mr. LaRose said people shouldn’t be forced to choose between protecting their health and exercising their constitutional right to vote in light of the expanding coronavirus epidemic. “It was simply untenable for us to continue telling Ohioans to go to the polls,” Mr. LaRose said Tuesday on CNN’s “New Day.” Mr. LaRose issued a directive to county boards of elections saying that the presidential primary is suspended until June 2. The directive says that boards of elections are to remain open on March 17 through 7:30 p.m. to receive any absentee ballots, but that they’re prohibited from tabulating and reporting any results until the close of polls on June 2. Asked what happens if things aren’t better by June 2, Mr. LaRose said: “That’s a bridge we’ll have to cross when we get to it.” Three other states are proceeding with their presidential primaries on Tuesday: Arizona, Florida and Illinois.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. Senate has voted to extend, rather than tweak, three surveillance powers that federal law enforcement officials use to fight terrorists, passing the bill back to an absent House and throwing the future of the authorities in doubt.  The 75-day extension pushes off the debate over the surveillance tools as Congress attempts to deal with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. It is unclear whether the House will accept the temporary extension of the surveillance powers, which lapsed on Sunday. The House last week passed a compromise bill negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy that would renew the authorities and impose new restrictions. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed the measure, but longtime skeptics of the surveillance tools in the Senate blocked a quick passage.  The House legislation would update the three expiring surveillance provisions, including one that permits the FBI to obtain court orders to collect business records on subjects in national security investigations. Another, known as the “roving wiretap” provision, permits surveillance on subjects even after they’ve changed phones. The third allows agents to monitor subjects who don’t have ties to international terrorism organizations.  The legislation would scale back some current authorities, such as the government’s access to certain records. It would also attempt to put stronger checks on some surveillance measures and make the process more transparent.  The compromise reflects angst in both major political parties about the way the surveillance powers have been used, but also a reluctance to strip those powers from the government’s arsenal. Republicans and Democrats in the House broadly agreed that they did not want civil liberties sacrificed in efforts to thwart terrorism and other crimes.  It is unclear whether the House will vote on the Senate extension, which would make no changes to the authorities during the 75 days. A Democratic aide said that House leadership was discussing how to move forward, as the House is on recess and has no set date for returning.  The Senate passed the extension by voice vote Monday after days of negotiations between McConnell and Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. The chamber had originally been scheduled to take a procedural vote to move forward on the House legislation, a step that would have set up final passage for later in the week. It’s not clear whether McConnell had enough votes for the House bill to pass.  McConnell said Monday evening that the Senate would eventually consider the House bill and several amendments, conceding to the demands from the three senators. The amendments would impose restrictions beyond the House bill on the government’s ability to surveil and gather information on Americans.  Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., speaking on the floor for McConnell, objected to that same deal last week, saying the Senate should pass the House bill. But there appeared to be more urgency to put off the surveillance issue Monday as coronavirus cases spiked in the United States and the economic damage mounted.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin is expected to meet with Senate Republicans Tuesday to discuss an $850 billion coronavirus relief package including aid for hard-hit industries. White House aides say the package could include more than $50 billion for airlines, about $500 billion in payroll tax cuts and $250 billion or more in Small Business Administration loans. The U.S. airline industry said it has lost about one million passengers in the first two weeks of March alone, compared with the same period a year ago. President Trump said Monday the pandemic, which has closed many businesses and schools across the country, could push the nation into a recession. The stock market suffered huge losses Monday, falling more than 12% to wipe out nearly all the gains since Mr. Trump was inaugurated. Markets were up slightly in early trading Tuesday.

"A spokesman for Sen. Bernard Sanders’ presidential campaign on Tuesday said that going to the polls in primaries amid the coronavirus outbreak is a “personal” choice and that they will respect the decisions of the public either way. The campaign is not doing traditional “get out the vote” outreach in states holding primary contests on Tuesday, said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca. “We are making clear to voters that we believe going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision, and we respect whichever choice they make,” Mr. Casca said. Ohio officials late Monday blew past a court order and ordered the polls closed on Tuesday, with plans to delay in-person voting until June 2 in light of the health risks the coronavirus is posing. Arizona, Florida and Illinois, meanwhile, are proceeding with their presidential primary contests on Tuesday, though officials are dealing with polling site closures and relocations because of COVID-19. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said there’s no guarantee that there would be a safer time to hold the election in the near future. “The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this will become,” she said on Monday. Mr. Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden have adjusted by pivoting to virtual events in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Biden is expected to increase his delegate lead over Mr. Sanders after Tuesday’s primaries, though other states have already moved to postpone their own contests as well, adding a dose of uncertainty to the contest.

"Yankton Daily Press & Dakotan, March 16 Proactive steps to combat COVID-19 Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. And that’s certainly what we are seeing and enduring as America and the world ramp up their response to the COVID-19 coronavirus that’s racing across the planet. The situation has been months in the making, and some countries have prepared relatively better than others. America is now working overtime in a feverish hope to catch up and minimize the damage as much as possible. We are seeing drastic steps that are literally touching every aspect of life across the country, across South Dakota and Nebraska, and in Yankton and every community in the region. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has called off school for the coming week (at least), and the Board of Regents did the same for state universities. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts on Friday mentioned the possibility of closing schools in that state for 6-8 weeks, if necessary. Indeed, events are being postponed or canceled in wholesale terms, from small local meetings to entire professional sports leagues and the NCAA “March Madness” college basketball tournaments. The NAIA basketball tournaments in Sioux Falls (for the men) and Sioux City (women) were canceled outright after the first day of action. The South Dakota Class B girls’ basketball tournament in Spearfish was postponed after the first round, and this coming weekend’s tournaments have also been postponed. Church service schedules are being altered. Even funerals are being delayed until the situation looks better. These are dramatic steps. But they are also important steps. They are strongly proactive in an attempt to slow the spread of the contagion, to protect as many people as possible and to avoid a crushing onslaught of patients on medical facilities, which would impact all medical care, even for non-COVID-19 patients. It’s part of what’s called “flattening the curve.” Much of it falls under the label of “social distancing,” which is actually not a new concept at all - just one expanded to societal terms. This purpose is to create isolation and separation to slow the spread of the virus. In spirit, it’s quite sensible. But in implementation, it is radical and will have a serious impact in other areas for some time to come. This is going to take a serious financial toll on a number of fronts, and states, cities and businesses must face those formidable battles. For instance, the cancellation of sporting events, which may seem minor to some people, will have major consequences on the cities and states that host these events, the vendors and other workers who make their livings from those events and so on. In effect, our nation is being asked to step back from its normal routines, and this will be tough for many people. It’s forcing us to re-think some things we do, in terms big and small. The consequences, either way you look at it, will be difficult. The debate over how we got here will be an important one, but the decisions we make in regard to what we do now are the most pressing. The government needs to do what it needs to do. And each of us needs to do what we must for the general good and health for both ourselves and those we know and love. It’s a battle we WILL ultimately win - and as was pointed out during a press conference of Yankton’s COVID-19 task force last week, if we fight this fight well enough, it will seem like we overreacted. So be it. Let’s make the fight worth it. ___ Madison Daily Leader, March 10 Government works better when open to citizens This week (March 15-21) marks the 15th Sunshine Week, a time to stress the importance of open government policies at all levels. The terms “Sunshine” suggests opening up government to the light of day. Sunshine Week started after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on America, when there was a rush to close off government information to the public. Tim Franklin, associate dean of the journalism school at Northwestern University, said the shutting down of access to public records and public meetings was based on the “misguided, and sometimes cynical, notion that Americans are safer the less they know about what the government is doing in their name and with their money.” That sounds a bit harsh, but we’re surprised how often we hear a phrase like “we don’t want the public to know this,” or “the public won’t understand this if we tell them.” At worst, we’ve heard “let’s not tell the public because it might cause a panic.” That’s what happened just recently in some countries with the coronavirus outbreak. Not surprisingly, we believe instead in the public’s right to know. A government “of the people” is not a private business owned by someone. Local governments are owned by citizens/taxpayers. We elect officials to conduct our business, but they still report to us as citizens. We deserve to have input into their decisions, open discussion about their decisions, and a permanent record of how they spend our money. We deserve to know what is going on in public schools. We want to be in the room when a zoning change is proposed in our neighborhood. We all need to be vigilant in asking for, and insisting on, open records, meetings and discussions. ___ Aberdeen American News, March 14 No more denying the uncertainty of COVID-19 If you’re not acknowledging the problem by now, you are part of the problem. The problem is, of course, COVID-19. And it’s real. There are many questions with unknown answers. And that’s what makes this such a slippery slope. That’s what’s sparking uncertainty and, in some cases, fear. That’s what makes this different from other viruses in the past. We hope, a few weeks or months from now, everything happening - closed schools, canceled events, travel restrictions, the shutdown of sports leagues - will look like wild overreactions. That’s the best-case scenario. But whether we reach that point, it’s too early to tell. In the meantime, here are some and inarguable facts to chew on: - After initially downplaying the COCID-19 outbreak, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency Friday. - That was hours after Gov. Kristi Noem did the same for the state. She wasn’t nearly as stubborn as the president. That said, the decision to kick media members out of a COVID-19 meeting earlier this week did nothing to instill trust. - The NCAA didn’t pull the plug on March Madness and give up hundreds of millions of dollars to make the president look bad. Or to inconvenience you. Nor did the other sports leagues that have paused their seasons act with those motives. Get over that kind of thinking. It’s petty, dangerous and foolish. No, all of these steps - the unprecedented actions - were made for our protection. Protection. Protection. Protection. And that is all. So stop looking for other reasons. That’s why South Dakota schools will be closed next week. That’s why college campuses will be empty next week. That’s why the state basketball tournaments have been postponed. That’s why there’s virtually nothing that’s not vital happening next week. Now it’s for all of us to help. And that’s the easy part. Because it involves some simple steps we’ve been hearing about for weeks: - Wash your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds. (You should have been doing this all along.) - Cover your mouth with your arm or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. - If you don’t feel good, stay home. Work remotely if you can or have to. - And avoid crowds if you are pregnant, older or have a weakened immune system. - Keep high-traffic and high-germ areas clean. - Oh, and don’t hoard toilet paper and sanitizer. Take what you need and leave some for the next shopper. This is not a fun time. It’s stressful and sometimes scary. Nobody is enjoying it. Not the government. Not the media. Not people making difficult decisions. Maybe, months from now, when with a little luck we are all looking back on this moment, we’ll see overreaction. Maybe the pandemic has peaked and it will start to backslide in the days to come. There’s no way to know. And that’s the reason for such drastic action. If we don’t encounter more problems, though, remember this time. Because the tough decisions being made now might be a big reason why.

"Voters like the idea of making legal immigrants pay their own way, and they are also keen on letting people sue sanctuary cities for crimes committed by illegal immigrants — both parts of President Trump’s immigration agenda — according to surprising polling numbers from Harvard University. Nearly four in five voters like the idea of an “immigration halt” with the coronavirus becoming a pandemic. Less popular is the move by a number of Democrat-led states such as New York to issue driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. Only about one-third of voters polled said people in the country without authorization should be allowed to apply for a license. The results of the Harvard Center for American Political Studies/Harris Poll suggest that Mr. Trump’s immigration policies have strong backing among the public at large, even though they are derided as racist or unfair in Washington and among Democratic leaders. “This should definitely be a warning, especially to Biden because he’s going to be the nominee, that going too far left is a real danger for him,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director at the Center for Immigration Studies. “I’m not even sure what he was thinking last night. He’s got the nomination. Why cater to the most radical anti-borders elements in his party?” Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, in a debate Sunday with Sen. Bernard Sanders, his chief opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, proposed shutting down all deportations for 100 days and then deporting only illegal immigrants with further felonies on their records. He also said he will cancel immigration detention for people awaiting court hearings if he wins the White House. He flatly said local police should not cooperate in turning over illegal immigrants to federal immigration authorities. “Xenophobia is a disease,” said Mr. Biden, condemning what he called “this demonization and divisiveness coming from the Trump administration on immigration.” The Harvard/Harris poll found immigration policy to be the second most important issue for voters, behind health care and ahead of terrorism and national security. When it comes to Mr. Trump, 49% said they approved of the president’s handling of immigration. That is at the high range of the past few years, with Harvard/Harris showing approval hovering between 44% and 49%. During his State of the Union address this year, Mr. Trump called for punishing sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal officials by allowing people victimized by illegal immigrants to sue the sanctuaries for damages. That idea earns 55% support, according to Harvard/Harris, though the pollsters asked the question without mentioning that Mr. Trump supports it. The same was true with a question on whether the government should deny green cards to immigrants who are likely to end up on the public dole. The Trump administration this year implemented a rule to do just that, and the Harvard/Harris poll said 60% support it — again, without Mr. Trump’s name attached to it. Immigrant rights activists have labeled that policy racist. They say it will hinder poor migrants from developing nations in Africa trying to achieve the American dream and reward those from richer nations in Europe. Mr. Krikorian said asking without the president’s name meant the pollsters were able to find Americans’ views without any Trump bias. He said there are probably people who would be hawkish on immigration, such as opposing sanctuary cities, though they dislike Mr. Trump. If told the president backed a crackdown, they might have a different answer to the polling question. “Because Trump’s name isn’t on there, people were giving answers based on what they actually thought policy should be rather than what is associated with the president,” he said. The Washington Times reached out to several immigrant rights activists about the numbers. They either didn’t respond or declined to tackle the questions. Mr. Trump has tied immigration to the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis, and the polling suggests Americans agree. A stunning 79% told the pollsters that an “immigration halt” should be imposed if the outbreak grows into a pandemic. On the other side of the ledger, voters resoundingly rejected the idea of issuing driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants, with 65% opposed and just 35% in favor. Immigration activists argue that illegal immigrants are on the roads anyway, and it makes more sense to license them and require them to have insurance. Fourteen states plus the District of Columbia have moved to grant licenses to those in the country without authorization, according to the National Council of State Legislatures. New York became the latest to offer licenses in December with its Green Light law. New Jersey will become the 15th state when its law takes effect in June.

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed on Tuesday not to leave Washington until his chamber has passed a “significant and bold” third coronavirus bill to help the economy weather the spread of the disease. The Kentucky Republican said he was concerned the House’s bipartisan relief bill could cause more harm than good if another supplement fix isn’t passed immediately. “In particular, it seems increasingly clear that the House’s effort to mandate that small businesses provide new worker benefits, just many small businesses themselves are in major jeopardy of their own, might even be actively harmful unless we urgently address a broader package that includes more and broader small business relief,” he said on the Senate floor. On Tuesday, the Trump administration $850 billion coronavirus relief package, which would include aid for hard-hit sectors such as the airline and cruise industries. Talks between Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and Senate Republicans began Monday night and will continue on Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a key ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has a proposal of his own. On Monday, he called for at least $750 billion that would go toward shoring up hospital resources, affordability of coronavirus treatment, fund public transportation and emergency child care, and pause payments on loans immediately. The outline did not include aid for industries the administration wants. Other Republicans are floating ideas as well, aside from the payroll tax the administration has called for. Some, such as Sens. Mitt Romney and Tom Cotton, have suggested giving cash handouts to Americans to help them with bills over the next few weeks. First, the Senate still needs to pass the House’s coronavirus bill that cleared the lower chamber Monday evening. If legislation on a third coronavirus package does move in the Senate, the House will need to reconvene to pass it as early as next week, despite delaying their return from recess in light of the virus.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin is expected to meet with Senate Republicans Tuesday to discuss an $850 billion coronavirus relief package including aid for hard-hit industries. White House aides say the package could include more than $50 billion for airlines, about $500 billion in payroll tax cuts and $250 billion or more in Small Business Administration loans.

"SAN DIEGO (AP) - Family, friends and lawyers of convicted ex-Rep. Duncan Hunter say the California Republican is a devoted father and proud former Marine who should be shown some mercy for making mistakes after returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Prosecutors paint a different picture. They have submitted 87 pages of details to U.S. District Court Judge Thomas J. Whelan ahead of Tuesday’s sentencing that shows a corrupt congressman who intentionally and repeatedly stole from his campaign funds for a decade.  The funds bankrolled private school tuition for his children, his wife’s shopping sprees, weekend trips with his mistress and drinking parties in Washington. A broke and debt-saddled Hunter also cavalierly spent campaign money on small things, such as a tin of chewing tobacco, and a copy of the book, “Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid,” according to prosecutors.  And after he was caught, he ran for reelection and tried to convince voters in the district east of San Diego that as a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, he was the victim of a political witch hunt by left-leaning prosecutors trying to drive him out of office in Democratic California.  A year after winning a sixth term, Hunter pleaded guilty to a single corruption charge. He and his wife, who served as his campaign manager, each faces up to five years in jail. Prosecutors said a 14-month prison sentence is needed to punish a lawmaker who misled his constituents and whose wrongdoing has now left the 50th congressional district without a representative. Hunter resigned from Congress in January. A Democrat and Republican are headed to a November runoff for his seat. “As we now know, Hunter lied to the people about his guilt. Not once, but countless times. In doing so, he conned voters into electing a soon-to-be-convict,” prosecutors wrote in their arguments for the prison term. The Hunters were accused in a 60-count indictment of stealing more than $250,000 in campaign contributions and trying to hide it on financial disclosure records, listing some personal expenses as contributions to wounded warriors. Each pleaded guilty to a single count in separate plea agreements last year.  Defense attorneys say he deserves 11 months in home confinement because of his military and public service. They said he saved thousands of San Diego jobs on the chopping block and helped craft laws to better the lives of veterans.  His parents wrote a letter pointing out his bravery in signing up for the Marine Corps the day after the Sept. 11 attacks, and a Democratic colleague, San Diego Rep. Juan Vargas, penned that “Mr. Hunter needs special counseling and treatment after fighting our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.” Hunter is not the first congressmen accused of the illegal use of campaign money. Prosecutors compared Hunter’s case to that of former Illinois Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr., who got 30 months for stealing $750,000 in campaign funds. Hunter’s defense lawyers compare him to former California Rep. Jay Kim, who was spared prison time in 1998 and sentenced to two months home confinement after he admitted to taking more than $250,000 in illegal campaign contributions.  Hunter’s conviction ended his family’s political dynasty in the 50th congressional district. Hunter won the seat after his father. Hunter L. Duncan, represented the area of suburbs and farm towns for 28 years before retiring.

"A spokesman for Sen. Bernard Sanders’ presidential campaign on Tuesday said that going to the polls in primaries amid the coronavirus outbreak is a “personal” choice and that they will respect the decisions of the public either way. The campaign is not doing traditional “get out the vote” outreach in states holding primary contests on Tuesday, said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca. “We are making clear to voters that we believe going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision, and we respect whichever choice they make,” Mr. Casca said. Ohio officials late Monday blew past a judge’s ruling and ordered the polls closed on Tuesday, with plans to delay in-person voting until June 2 in light of the health risks the coronavirus is posing. Arizona, Florida and Illinois, meanwhile, are proceeding with their presidential primary contests on Tuesday, though officials are dealing with polling site closures and relocations because of COVID-19. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said there’s no guarantee that there would be a safer time to hold the election in the near future. “The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this will become,” she said on Monday. Mr. Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden have adjusted by pivoting to virtual events in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Biden is expected to increase his delegate lead over Mr. Sanders after Tuesday’s primaries, though other states have already moved to postpone their own contests as well, adding a dose of uncertainty to the contest.

"The Republican primary for the Kansas Senate seat has become uglier as Kris Kobach has emerged as the front-runner to succeed retiring Sen. Pat Roberts. The conservative Club for Growth has mounted a new advertising campaign attacking rival candidate Rep. Roger Marshall over his alleged poor treatment of female patients as a doctor. Mr. Kobach, Kansas’ former secretary of state, is a longtime ally of President Trump, but many Republicans are worried he would lose the Senate race, as he lost his gubernatorial bid in 2018. Mr. Kobach held a double-digit percentage point lead on Mr. Marshall, his nearest competitor, in a February McLaughlin & Associates poll. The free-market advocacy group is spending about $33,000 on a print and digital ad campaign accusing Mr. Marshall of “poor treatment of women” as an obstetrician/gynecologist. The anti-Marshall ads ran in several newspapers with large circulations in the state, including the Kansas City Star, Topeka Capital Journal and Wichita Eagle. “Online public reviews of [Mr. Marshall‘s] dealings with patients suggest his treatment of women was not received positively in far too many instances,” the print ad reads above quotations branding the candidate as “arrogant” and “insensitive.” “Are these reports accurate? What’s the truth? What was your — or your loved one’s — experience with Dr. Marshall?” The digital effort includes RogerMarshallTruth.com, which features criticism from women posted anonymously. The Club for Growth is soliciting other women to come forward with negative stories about Mr. Marshall. “Several of Dr. Marshall’s patients have raised important concerns about their treatment while under his care,” David McIntosh, Club for Growth Action president, said in a statement. “We think Kansas voters deserve to hear what these women have said, and if other women have similar stories, we hope they speak out as well.” Mr. Marshall’s campaign said he would ignore the attack ads and focus on talking with Kansans about “real issues.” “Slinging amateur garbage from a D.C. office during a national pandemic isn’t surprising coming from these losers,” said Brent Robertson, Marshall campaign spokesman, in a statement. “While we understand that they have a 2016 campaign grudge, they put the Senate majority at risk by doing the dirty work of fellow loser Kris Kobach.” The group is not the only one attacking Mr. Marshall’s candidacy. Free Forever PAC has spent $70,000 to air ads on Fox News opposing Mr. Marshall, according to the Kansas City Star. The group, which is bankrolled by billionaire Peter Thiel, is also running ads on Facebook criticizing Mr. Marshall as an unreliable supporter of Mr. Trump because of his previous support for former Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s failed 2016 presidential bid. While Mr. Kobach has a reliable supporter in Mr. Thiel, he has far fewer friends in the Republican Party establishment. The Club for Growth is not supporting Mr. Kobach’s bid and has not endorsed a candidate. The National Republican Senatorial Committee said in July that Mr. Kobach’s candidacy would “simultaneously put President Trump’s presidency and [the] Senate majority at risk.” No Democrat has won a Senate seat in Kansas since the 1930s, but the food fight on the right has proven useful for Democrats looking to expand the map of targeted states in November. State Sen. Barbara Bollier, a retired physician, is the Democratic front-runner to compete for the open seat. A former Republican who switched parties and identifies herself a “pragmatic Democrat,” she figures to make health care and the coronavirus crisis a central aspect of the campaign. The Club for Growth declined to say whether it had discussed the race with potential candidates and said its interviews are “confidential.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a former Kansas congressman, has reportedly ruled out running for the seat.

"President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Tuesday they’re strongly considering giving Americans $1,000 each within the next two weeks to help with the impact from the coronavirus. “We’re going big,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. Mr. Mnuchin, who was meeting later with Republican senators, said the administration is quickly coming around to the idea of cutting checks for every American who needs it. “We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately. Americans need cash now,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “I mean now in the next two weeks.” He said the details for qualifying still would need to be worked out with Congress. “We don’t need to send people who make a million dollars a year checks,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The president said he wants to “do something that gets money to them as quickly as possible.” “Obviously some people shouldn’t be getting checks with $1,000,” he said. “We’ll have a pretty good idea by the end of the day how we’re going to do it.” The president has been pushing for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year, but he acknowledged on Tuesday that the impact of such relief would be felt more slowly. “Payroll tax is one way, but it does come over a period of months. We’re going big. It’s a substantial number,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Mnuchin underscored the urgency. “The president has instructed me we have to do this now,” he said. “This is no fault to American workers. For medical reasons, we are shutting down parts of the economy.” He added that other sectors of the economy need help too. “This is worse than 9/11. For the airline industry, they’ve almost ground to a halt,” he said. There are roughly 155 million workers in the U.S.  If every one of them got a check, the cost would be about $155 billion.

"State health officials can now authorize tests for the coronavirus and Medicare patients can confer with any doctor remotely, through “telehealth,” at no additional cost, President Trump said Tuesday, as his administration tries to blunt the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Mr. Trump said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is on standby in case they need to conduct emergency construction. Those operations may include renovations to expand and retrofit existing facilities or setting up smaller mobile field hospitals, or MASH units, to render care. The president said one way or another, the U.S. will declare victory over the pathogen. “One day will be standing up here and say: We won,” Mr. Trump told White House reporters. “Sure as you’re sitting there, we’re going to say that.” So far, the virus and the disease it causes, COVID-19, has sickened more than 4,600 people and killed over 85 people in the country, though testing is just ramping up. Mr. Trump reiterated that he wants people to avoid unnecessary travel and groups of 10 or more for the next two weeks. “We’ll see what happens after that,” Mr. Trump said. “Our country can be rolling again pretty quickly.” Deborah Birx, who is coordinating the federal response, implored younger Americans to stop going out and spreading the virus on doorknobs and countertops, saying they’re putting older Americans at risk. Officials also said mobile testing units are “blossoming” in states across the country, with federal help, Vice President Mike Pence said that as more diagnostics come online, each and every American must act on Mr. Trump’s push for “social distancing.” “You don’t need the results of testing to know what you should do,” Mr. Pence said. Mr. Pence also asked construction companies to donate special N95 respirator masks to local hospitals and forego new orders, so health workers can get the equipment they need. Officials said changes to telehealth rules will allow seniors to get regular checkups without leaving their homes amid the pandemic. “They can talk to their doctor via Skype, and they don’t have to risk exposure to the virus,” said Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Mr. Trump also spoke to restaurant executives by phone Tuesday, reminding them they can “flatten the curve” of transmission by urging customers to use drive-through, pickup or delivery options instead of entering their establishments. The executives agreed. “All of the executives committed their restaurants to this critical guideline and assured the president they fully intend to continue feeding their communities through these other innovative avenues,” White House Deputy press secretary Judd Deere said. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said many eateries use apps that allows for home delivery or quick handoffs. “You can order ahead of time,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “They can give it to you with social distancing, and it’s very fast.” Amazon, meanwhile, said it’s suspending shipments to its warehouses of items other than medical supplies or household staples so it can focus on the supply of things that are needed amid the outbreak. Individual states continued to take action. The San Francisco area faces the most stringent lockdown, with 7 million residents told to limit outings to trips for supplies. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said his state has recorded more than 1,300 cases, the most in the nation, though he rejected rumors that New York City would go into total quarantine. “That is not true,” the Democrat said. “That cannot happen. It cannot happen legally. No city in [the] state can quarantine itself without state approval, and I have no interest whatsoever and no plan whatsoever to quarantine any city.” Mr. Cuomo compared the situation to a tabletop snow globe. “Somebody picked up our country and just shook it,” Mr. Cuomo said. “It is a frightening time on every level. At the same time, it’s this much time,” the governor said, placing his hands slightly apart. “We will get through this much time. Understand what we’re dealing with, understand the pressures that we’re feeling — but we will get through this much time.” Mr. Trump said he had a “constructive” conversation with Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday, despite warring tweets over the past two days. “We’re both doing a really good job,” Mr. Trump said. The president also deferred to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s judgment in putting off his state’s primary election. “He’s definitely somebody who knows what he’s doing,” the president said. Mr. Trump said the best thing the country can do to preserve future elections is to defeat the virus. • David Sherfinski contributed to this report.

"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said a Chinese disinformation campaign around the coronavirus is part of an attempt to shift responsibility for dragging their feet in responding to the outbreak months ago. At the same time, he said the world should be focused on fighting the actual pathogen instead of pointing fingers. “Now is not the time for recrimination,” Mr. Pompeo told reporters. “There will come a day when we will go evaluate how the world responded.” Mr. Pompeo said the Chinese government did, however, have a special responsibility to sound the alarm over the virus after it popped up in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in December. “It took an awful long time for the world to become aware of this risk,” Mr. Pompeo said. America’s top diplomat was responding to claims by Chinese authorities that the coronavirus might have originated in a U.S. military lab.

"HOUSTON (AP) - After being denied U.S. asylum in Texas and returned to a squalid camp in Mexico, a mother from El Salvador chose to send her three children back across the border alone. Now, those children face deportation, even though their father lives in Maryland and is eager to take them in, according to attorneys.  Lawyers for the children sued the U.S. government Tuesday demanding that the children be released from a government facility and allowed to seek asylum.  Their mother remains in Matamoros, Mexico, where an estimated 2,000 people live in a squalid tent camp, waiting for their court hearings a short distance away in Brownsville, Texas.  Many parents at the camp have made the same choice. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 498 children in its custody have said their family is in Mexico. In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., the CAIR Coalition and Justice Action Center argue that the children deserve a new court hearing because they are now considered “unaccompanied” children under government rules.  The Associated Press is withholding the names of the mother and her children because they fear being targeted by MS-13 if forced to return to El Salvador.  According to the lawsuit, the mother and father were active in their local church in El Salvador and frequently evangelized to others. They believe their ministry drew the attention of MS-13, the violent transnational gang. Gang members attacked the father and eventually threatened his life, leading the family to flee. They lived in Mexico for two years, then moved back to El Salvador, going from town to town, the lawsuit says. But they concluded last year that they would have to try to enter the U.S. The father and his second eldest daughter went first, arriving in the U.S. in June 2019 and settling in Maryland after they were released by border agents.  The mother and three of their children - daughters now aged 16 and 14, and a 9-year-old son - left later and arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in September. By then, the U.S. had implemented its “Remain in Mexico” program in South Texas, under which more than 50,000 people have been sent back across the border with court dates sometimes months away. The mother and her three children were sent to Matamoros under the program.  In January, a judge in Brownsville denied their asylum claim and the family returned to the camp.  At the camp, someone grabbed the 16-year-old daughter and tried to assault her. Another person beat the 9-year-old boy and took money he had to buy food. They had seen kidnappings and extortion attempts, and once observed a corpse floating in the nearby Rio Grande.  So the mother sent her three children across the border alone in January.  The Department of Health and Human Services has declined to release the three children, so their father goes to a facility in Crofton, Maryland, to see them.  He says he is certain that if they are deported, they would be killed. “My only purpose was to save my family,” he said.  Even if the children win their case in U.S. courts, the mother may have no way of entering the country herself. According to her lawyers, she has missed a deadline to file an appeal.  The mom said she would be happy regardless. “A mother wants the best for her children,” she said. “Nothing can compare to a mother’s love.” ___ This version corrects the name of the Justice Action Center from Justice Action Council.

"Americans should postpone elective medical services because hospitals and doctors need the beds and patients shouldn’t expose themselves to the virus, the U.S. coronavirus coordinator said Tuesday. “If you’re a person with an elective surgery, you don’t want to go into a hospital right now,” Deborah Birx, an HIV/AIDS expert tapped by President Trump to coordinate his team, told reporters at a White House briefing. The administration also said seniors on Medicare can check in with their doctors remotely, through telehealth, at no extra cost as the administration scrambles to blunt the spread of the deadly coronavirus. “They can talk to their doctor via Skype, and they don’t have to risk exposure to the virus,” said Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Officials advised patients as part of Mr. Trump’s broader plea to stay home and avoid unnecessary exposure to the coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19. The virus has infected 5,200 people and killed more than 90 people in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University’s tracker — although testing is just ramping up. The president said he always viewed the situation as serious, although in late February he suggested 15 domestic cases could be knocked down to zero within days. “I’ve felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday. Looking ahead, Mr. Trump reminded people to avoid unnecessary travel and groups of 10 or more for the next two weeks. “We’ll see what happens after that,” Mr. Trump said. “Our country can be rolling again pretty quickly.” “One day will be standing up here and say: We won,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “Sure as you’re sitting there, we’re going to say that.” Mr. Trump said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is on standby in case they need to conduct emergency construction. Those operations may include renovations to expand and retrofit existing facilities or setting up smaller mobile field hospitals, or MASH units, to render care. Officials also said mobile testing units are “blossoming” in states across the country, with federal help, and that states have wide latitude to authorize tests. Vice President Mike Pence said that as more diagnostics come online, each and every American must act on Mr. Trump’s push for “social distancing.” “You don’t need the results of testing to know what you should do,” Mr. Pence said. Mr. Trump wants people to use takeout and drive-thru services instead of entering bars and restaurants, saying it’s another way to put the nation closer to victory against the pathogen. The White House said executives representing Chick-fil-A, Olive Garden, McDonald’s and other restaurants agreed to emphasize those options Tuesday in a phone call with the president. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said many eateries use apps that allow for home delivery or quick handoffs. “You can order ahead of time,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “They can give it to you with social distancing, and it’s very fast.” Amazon, meanwhile, said it is suspending shipments to its warehouses of items other than medical supplies or household staples so it can focus on the supply of things that are needed amid the outbreak. Individual states continued to take action. The San Francisco area faces the most stringent lockdown, with 7 million residents told to limit outings to trips for supplies. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said his state has recorded more than 1,300 cases, the most in the nation, though he rejected rumors that New York City would go into total quarantine. “That is not true,” the Democrat said. “That cannot happen. It cannot happen legally. No city in [the] state can quarantine itself without state approval, and I have no interest whatsoever and no plan whatsoever to quarantine any city.” Mr. Cuomo compared the situation to a tabletop snow globe. “Somebody picked up our country and just shook it,” Mr. Cuomo said. “It is a frightening time on every level. At the same time, it’s this much time,” the governor said, placing his hands slightly apart. “We will get through this much time. Understand what we’re dealing with, understand the pressures that we’re feeling — but we will get through this much time.” Mr. Trump said he had a constructive conversation with Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday, despite warring tweets over the past two days. “We’re both doing a really good job,” Mr. Trump said. The president also deferred to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s judgment in closing the state’s primary polls Tuesday. “He’s definitely somebody who knows what he’s doing,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump said the best thing the country can do to preserve future elections is to defeat the virus. • David Sherfinski contributed to this report.

"SAN DIEGO (AP) - Former California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter was sentenced Tuesday to 11 months in prison after pleading guilty to stealing campaign funds and spending the money on everything from outings with friends to his daughter’s birthday party.  The ex-Marine’s defense attorneys had asked for home confinement, citing his military service including fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his nearly six terms in Congress. Hunter resigned from Congress in January after representing one of Southern California’s last solidly Republican districts.  Prosecutors submitted 87 pages of details to U.S. District Court Judge Thomas J. Whelan ahead of Tuesday’s sentencing that showed a corrupt congressman who intentionally and repeatedly stole from his campaign funds for a decade.  Hunter and his wife were accused in a 60-count indictment of stealing more than $250,000 in campaign contributions and trying to hide it on financial disclosure records, listing some personal expenses as contributions to wounded warriors. Each had faced up to five years in prison. Each pleaded guilty to a single count in separate plea agreements last year.  The funds bankrolled private school tuition for his children, his wife’s shopping sprees, weekend trips with his mistress and drinking parties in Washington.  Hunter asked the court Tuesday to spare the mother of his three children jail time, and said he takes full responsibility. He showed little emotion.  The hearing was held despite many state and federal courts across California and the country all but shutting down or holding hearings by teleconference to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.  The judge said the full courtroom did not have more than 50 people in it. Whelan said Hunter wanted the hearing to proceed as planned. Federal judges in San Diego have held many call-in hearings when parties of a case could not be present.  Prosecutors said a 14-month prison sentence was needed to punish a lawmaker who misled his constituents and whose wrongdoing has now left the 50th congressional district without a representative. A Democrat and Republican are headed to a November runoff for his seat. A broke and debt-saddled Hunter cavalierly spent campaign money on small things, such as a tin of chewing tobacco, and a copy of the book, “Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid,” according to prosecutors.  And after he was caught, he ran for reelection and tried to convince voters in the district east of San Diego that as a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, he was the victim of a political witch hunt by left-leaning prosecutors trying to drive him out of office in Democratic California.  “As we now know, Hunter lied to the people about his guilt. Not once, but countless times. In doing so, he conned voters into electing a soon-to-be-convict,” prosecutors wrote in their arguments for the prison term. Defense attorneys said he deserved 11 months in home confinement because of his military and public service. They said he saved thousands of San Diego jobs on the chopping block and helped craft laws to better the lives of veterans.  His parents wrote a letter pointing out his bravery in signing up for the Marine Corps the day after the Sept. 11 attacks, and a Democratic colleague, San Diego Rep. Juan Vargas, penned that “Mr. Hunter needs special counseling and treatment after fighting our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.” Hunter is not the first congressmen accused of the illegal use of campaign money. Prosecutors compared Hunter’s case to that of former Illinois Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr., who got 30 months for stealing $750,000 in campaign funds. Hunter’s defense lawyers compare him to former California Rep. Jay Kim, who was spared prison time in 1998 and sentenced to two months home confinement after he admitted to taking more than $250,000 in illegal campaign contributions.  Hunter’s conviction ended his family’s political dynasty in the 50th congressional district. Hunter won the seat after his father. Hunter L. Duncan, represented the area of suburbs and farm towns for 28 years before retiring.  Hunter was ordered to report to prison on May 29.   ",Ex-California Rep.

"Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said he is eager to offer resources to President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin who signaled support Tuesday for the idea of a stimulus check to Americans during the coronavirus pandemic. The signature policy of Yang’s bid for the Democratic nomination was a universal basic income in the form of monthly $1,000 checks to all U.S. citizens 18 or older, which he branded the “freedom dividend.” “I’m pleased to see the White House adopt our vision of putting money directly into the hands of hard-working Americans,” Mr. Yang said in a statement posted to Twitter. “It’s unfortunate to see this development take place under the current circumstances, but this is exactly what Universal Basic Income is designed to do — offer a way to ensure that Americans can make ends meet when they need it most.” Mr. Yang added that his team has been in touch with the White House about the proposal and “are offering resources.” At a press conference Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin said the administration wants to send checks to Americans within the next two weeks. Some reports said the administration wants the checks to be larger than $1,000. “Although the president likes the idea of a payroll tax holiday … we’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” the Treasury secretary said. The stimulus is designed to help Americans cope with the economic disruption brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. and around the world. The idea has been floated by major figures, notably Sen. Mitt Romney, Utah Republican, in recent days.  Mr. Yang, an entrepreneur now working as a CNN analyst, suspended his Democratic presidential campaign after the New Hampshire primary and later endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.  “I look forward to monitoring the developments of the White House as they consider methods of distribution, and both me and my team are eager to offer our support to ensure this process runs as smoothly as possible,” Mr. Yang wrote.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday said a third coronavirus package needs to expand benefits for workers, and she also wants  refundable tax credits for self-employed and gig-economy workers. “During negotiations, the Democratic House will continue to make clear to the Administration that any emergency response package must put Families First before any aid to corporate America is considered,” Mrs. Pelosi said in a statement. She wants the third bill to expand on benefits for workers, including ensuring first responders and health workers have paid leave if they need it. Mrs. Pelosi and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin Tuesday morning about the next package and specifically concerns about the airline industry. The two Democrats will also speak with a group of airline CEOs Tuesday afternoon, according to Mrs. Pelosi’s chief of staff. The Senate still needs to pass the second coronavirus relief package, the final version of which was passed by the House Monday night. The Trump administration proposed a $850 billion coronavirus relief package, which would include aid for hard-hit sectors like the airline and cruise industries. Talks between Mr. Mnuchin and Senate Republicans began Monday night and will continue on Tuesday.

"While fierce new health protocols settle in with the general public during the coronavirus crisis, an esteemed physician also has a ready prescription for one and all. “There’s nothing wrong with praying in a crisis. Neanderthals no doubt proffered a few entreaties to their Zeus when a sabre-tooth tiger hunt went south. It’s pretty much part of the human toolkit. The wisdom and efficacy of prayer in a crisis depends wholly on one question: is the prayer directed to someone who is real, or is prayer based on a delusion?” writes Dr. Michael R. Egnor, a professor of neurosurgery and pediatrics at State University of New York, Stony Brook. “If the object of supplication is real, then prayer is probably the first thing you want to do in a crisis. A plea to the Boss is a fine preamble to the grunt work of managing a crisis. I’m a neurosurgeon, and I pray before each operation. It really helps,” Dr. Egnor advises in a column for Mind Matters, a publication of the Discovery Institute and the Walter Bradley Center for Natural and Artificial Intelligence. He also backs up his recommendations with thoughts from medieval philosopher and theologian St. Thomas Aquinas — plus another source. The physician also cited Vice President Mike Pence, who recently prayed with members of the White House coronavirus task force. In addition, President Trump has also prayed in the White House on multiple occasions with religious leaders of every description. “Should we be praying through the coronavirus crisis? Well, there is good evidence of the efficacy of prayer regardless of one’s view on the ultimate question, which ought to be a good thing for everybody concerned,” summarizes Mark Tapscott, an editor of Hill Faith, a blog covering religion on Capitol Hill, which also cites Dr. Egnor’s advice. CUOMO AND CUOMO CNN prime-time host Chris Cuomo has had a special guest on his evening program recently. That would be his older brother New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. On two occasions, the pair have discussed the coronavirus and President Trump’s response to it in less-than-flattering terms. “Does it make sense for liberal CNN host Chris Cuomo to interview his liberal Democrat brother, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, on the network’s prime time line-up? According to the network, it’s the perfect place for two members of a prominent Democrat family to bash the Republican president,” writes Newsbusters.org analyst Scott Whitlock, who reviewed the exchanges between the brothers. “This is the second time in less than a week that Andrew Cuomo appeared on his brother’s show. The idea that CNN had no problem with Democrat Chris Cuomo interviewing Democrat Andrew Cuomo — both children of Democratic governor Mario Cuomo — is bizarre. Was Anderson Cooper not available?” asks Mr. Whitlock. FOR THE LEXICON “MRNA-1273” That is the name of the potential vaccine for use against the coronavirus developed by Moderna, with input from the National Institutes of Health. The trial began at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle on Monday. Also of note: In case you missed the news reports, Jennifer Haller, 43, was the first to receive the vaccine, and will receive another dose of the vaccine in a month. “I hope that we get to a working vaccine quickly and that we can save lives and people can go back to life as soon as possible,” she told Time magazine in the aftermath. Another 44 adult volunteers will receive their doses of the vaccine in the next six weeks. SUCCESS: SAFEGUARDING AMERICA’S INTERNET A round of applause, please, for Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, who has successfully rallied the nation’s major online providers to look after the nation and keep people connected with one another during the coronavirus crisis. Mr. Pai has issued the “Keep Americans Connected Pledge” for providers, which ensures that service for residential or small-business customers will not be terminated if their bills go unpaid. The pledge also waives late fees for customers and opens Wi-Fi hot spots to any American who needs them. Within 24 hours, a reassuring cross section of 85 providers had signed up — from major names like T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T to the Farmers Telecommunications Cooperative, Antietam Broadband and Central Arkansas Telephone Cooperative. Mr. Pai says he is confident the nation’s broadband and telephone companies will prevail over the huge usage increases coming from increased telecommuting and social distancing. “I applaud those companies that have already taken the Keep Americans Connected Pledge. They are stepping up to the plate and taking critical steps that will make it easier for Americans to stay connected during this pandemic and maintain much-needed social distancing. I urge other companies to join them. This may be a difficult time for our nation, but if we all work together, I am confident that we can rise to the challenge,” Mr. Pai says.

"President Trump is pondering a move to declare the southwest border closed to all illegal immigration as officials eye the growing number of coronavirus cases in countries that are responsible for the lion’s share of unauthorized crossings. Under the policy the administration would claim powers to turn back into Mexico anyone who shows up without permission. Currently, they are arrested and usually go through a deportation process of varying speeds. One administration official said the possibility of COVID-19 cases making their way into the U.S. via the border has caused “profound alarm within the federal government, national security apparatus and health care community.” “The truth is that the unmitigated spread of pandemic through the [southwest] border will have dangerous, adverse and even deadly consequences to potentially millions of Americans, as well as migrants, law enforcement personnel, doctors and nurses, and so many more,” said the official, who is familiar with the discussions. Mr. Trump had publicly said he was considering shutting down the border, then reversed last week and said he doubted it would be necessary. In more recent days, though, he has stepped up his rhetoric, with immigrant-rights activists complaining after he called COVID-19 the “Chinese virus.” The virus originated in China. Word of the potential new border policy further enraged activists. Frank Sharry, executive director at America’s Voice, said Mr. Trump was playing politics with the move, “throwing red meat to white grievance voters and deliberately dividing the country.” “This is a nasty move by a nasty White House as they gear up to run the nastiest campaign in American history,” Mr. Sharry said. The New York Times first reported the potential border shutdown. Mexico, which accounts for more than half of illegal border crossings so far this fiscal year, and is the transit point for those from further south, had 53 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Tuesday afternoon. All told, migrants from 122 different countries have been nabbed at the border this year, according to Homeland Security data shared with The Times. Countries that have COVID-19 cases and also account for a large number of illegal immigrants include Brazil, Cameroon, China, Ecuador, Honduras and Guatemala.

"CHICAGO — Kim Foxx, the Chicago area’s top prosecutor, won the Democratic nomination Tuesday against three challengers who zeroed in on her handling of the Jussie Smollett criminal case. The primary race for Cook County state’s attorney was one of the most expensive of its kind, particularly with Navy veteran Bill Conway making his first run for public office with millions of dollars in family wealth. He had been running television ads for months questioning Foxx’s controversial decision to drop charges against the “Empire” actor. Smollett is accused of staging a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago. She recused herself from the Smollett case, but questions loom about whether she acted improperly for speaking to a Smollett relative and aide to former first lady Michelle Obama before the charges were dismissed. A special prosecutor reinstated the charges last month, which Foxx blasted as political. On the campaign trail, Foxx tried to focus on her record, touting the work of a conviction integrity unit and reforms to the cash bail system. She led in endorsements and establishment backing. Several super PACS also worked against her opponents, including Conway whose $11.5 million campaign came mostly from his billionaire father, William Conway, co-founder of Washington D.C.-based Carlyle Group. The other Democrats running were former Chicago Alderman Bob Fioretti and former federal prosecutor Donna More.

"LAS VEGAS — Nevada’s governor ordered a monthlong closure of casinos and other non-essential businesses like bars, movie theaters and gyms starting noon Wednesday and restaurants to shutter their dining rooms and only offer takeout or delivery in order to stem the spread of the new coronavirus.  The order from Democrat Steve Sisolak Tuesday night follows similar moves by more than 10 other governors as states scramble to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19.  Sisolak’s order gave thousands of businesses in the tourism capital less than a day to prepare. Though a number of casinos started to close their doors this week, the governor’s sweeping order shutters Nevada’s main industry, anchored by glitzy casinos lining the Las Vegas Strip.  The closures are part of federal guidance recommending social distancing. President Donald Trump has urged Americans to follow sweeping guidelines for the next few weeks, including for older residents to stay home and for all people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 as well as restaurants and bars.  Sisolak’s order comes after many casinos in Las Vegas moved to shut their doors entirely and the mayor of city said she hoped bars and restaurants would be able to stay open.  “My hope is that private industry rises to the top, that they’re allowed to stay open and take care of these families that are paycheck to paycheck,” Mayor Carolyn Goodman told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The mayor of Reno had issued an order similar to Sisolak Monday night, telling many of those non-essential businesses to close in that city starting Friday at 5 p.m. Mayor Hillary Schieve initially included casinos but rescinded that, allowing gambling operations to continue.  Nevada has reported more than 50 cases of the virus so far. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. In Las Vegas, MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts announced earlier in the week they planned to close their properties. Tuesday morning, three more casino resorts joined in.  The MGM casino closures of 13 properties included the Bellagio and its famous fountain show in front, which often draws a crowd to watch the fountains shooting as high 460 feet (140 meters) into the air, choreographed to lights and music.  The Hoover Dam, near the Arizona border and another Nevada tourist attraction, is temporarily closing to visitors “because of the nature of the structure and an inability to implement social distancing standards recommended by the” CDC, according to a statement.  With businesses closing and tourism expected to drop off, the state is forecasting a financial hit, but how big is unknown. In Nevada, gambling taxes are second only to sales taxes as a percentage of the state’s annual budget. The leisure and hospitality industry directly employs one of every four workers in the state and has an economic output of about $68 billion in Nevada, according to the Nevada Resort Association.  The state’s biennial Legislature isn’t scheduled to meet again until 2021, and legislative leaders are not yet planning to go into a special session to address Nevada’s budget.  Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson, both Democrats, said in a joint statement provided to the Associated Press on Tuesday that they’re evaluating all options and they’re working closely with the governor.  But “at this time, we have no plans to go into a special session,” they said.  State officials have not yet released any numbers of how many people have filed claims for unemployment benefits over the past few days.  Sisolak said over the weekend that the state was in “relatively good shape” to pay unemployment claims but it cannot last forever and the state was working to get some additional assistance from the federal government.   ","Nevada's governor shutters casinos, restaurants","Tuesday, March 17, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/17/steve-sisolak-nevada-governor-closes-casinos-resta/,washington_times
"President Trump clinched the Republican nomination for his reelection bid on Tuesday night when he won Florida’s 122 delegates. The victory gave the president 1,330 delegates, above the 1,276 needed to win the nomination, his campaign said. “The Republican Party is more unified and energized than ever before and it’s because of President Trump’s leadership and clear record of accomplishment on behalf of all Americans,” said Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager. “As his response to the coronavirus has shown, and as the broad and strong economy demonstrates, the president wakes up every day putting America first in every decision he makes. And voters have responded.” The president had only token opposition from minor GOP rivals such as former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, who never came close to threatening Mr. Trump. He will be formally nominated at the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, in late August.Mr. Trump has received at least four million votes more than the previous record for total votes cast for an incumbent president in the states that have held GOP primaries so far, besting the record held by former President Bill Clinton in his 1996 re-election campaign, the campaign said. The president set vote total records in Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Washington. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said nobody motivates the party’s base like Mr. Trump. “Fueled by both our longtime supporters and the thousands of new voters that continue to join our movement, we are united and enthusiasm is on our side,” she said.

"Homeland Security’s citizenship agency announced Tuesday it has canceled all in-person business for the rest of March, meaning no more asylum interviews or naturalization ceremonies, blaming the threat from the coronavirus. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it will automatically reschedule some of the appointments. Emergency requests can still be made, the agency said. The closure will last at least through April 1, USCIS said. “To protect our workforce and to help mitigate the spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in our communities, effective immediately, USCIS is suspending all routine face-to-face services with applicants at all of our offices, including all interviews and naturalization ceremonies,” the agency said. The move comes as agencies across the federal government shut their doors, hoping to limit person-to-person contact and constrain the rapid spread of COVID-19.

"Voters heading to the polls in Illinois, Florida and Arizona on Tuesday were greeted with unexpected closures and delays — as well as sightings of protective masks and hand sanitizers — as they tried to navigate their presidential primaries amid the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak. Election officials had expressed confidence heading into Tuesday that they could hold primaries while simultaneously advising voters to be smart about personal hygiene and “social distancing” in polling lines, but Illinois and Florida reported early problems. “It has been a hectic and trying day,” said Jay Young, executive director of the advocacy group Common Cause Illinois. “We immediately began seeing problems principally around polling places where election judges had chosen not to show.” Ohio abruptly postponed in-person voting that was scheduled for Tuesday, with Gov. Mike DeWine blowing past a judge’s ruling Monday evening to invoke a state health emergency and push the election to June 2. A spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners on Tuesday said they asked Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker last week to cancel in-person voting and switch completely to voting by mail after the World Health Organization classified the coronavirus as a pandemic, but the governor’s office declined. “It was a snowball we could all see coming down the hill,” Jim Allen, the spokesman, told reporters. Mr. Pritzker pushed back against Mr. Allen’s contention, saying their offers to provide the National Guard and other volunteers were rebuffed. “[It’s] times like these when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else,” the governor said. “If people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I’ll wear it like a badge of honor.” A spokeswoman for the governor had said earlier that there are no perfect solutions at the moment — only “least bad solutions.” As it stood, voters Tuesday were being turned away at some locations, including in Cook County, because of a lack of election judges. Cook County Clerk Karen Yarbrough posted a picture on social media of blue painters tape with instructions for poll workers to try to mark the floor and keep voters at least six feet apart. Dan Kovats, executive director of the Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association, said turnout was “very low” but that voting were proceeding. “We had some election judges call off, but county clerks have done a good job with having reserve judges ready to deploy as needed,” he said. “There have been some issues in Chicago but these issues are similar to a standard Election Day.” Officials in the three states were hoping that a surge in early voting and vote by mail would make up for lower in-person turnout, with both voters and poll workers wary of getting crosswise with national guidance to avoid large crowds to try to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s campaign issued a memo before the polls closed Tuesday estimating that turnout in Florida and Arizona would be about on pace with 2016 and that Illinois’ turnout would be about in line with 2018 levels. Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who is facing a significant deficit to Mr. Biden in the delegate count, said voting at the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and the campaign would respect whatever voters choose to do. Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections, said the state had been on pace to set new records for early and mail voting for a primary election. As of Monday, 504,000 early votes had been cast cast and 294,000 mail ballots sent to voters. That was up from a day before the 2016 primary, when the numbers were 400,000 and 160,000, respectively, he said. Slightly more than 2 million ballots were cast in the 2016 Democratic primary in Illinois. In Florida, meanwhile, some polling locations were forced to open late because poll workers failed to show. “We have experienced poll worker no-shows, causing some of our polling locations to open late,” Wendy Sartory Link, the Palm Beach County supervisor of Elections, said on Facebook. As of Tuesday morning, more than 658,000 Democrats had voted by mail and more than 438,000 had voted early in Florida, well ahead of the numbers from 2016. About 1.7 million ballots were cast in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary contest in Florida. In Arizona, in-person turnout was slow but Democrats exceeded their 2016 overall vote total through early ballots alone, according to estimates from the state Democratic Party. About 480,000 early ballots were cast in the 2020 election, compared to about 468,000 total ballots in the 2016 contest in Arizona, the party said. “We haven’t heard about a massive exodus of polling workers,” said Matt Grodsky, a spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party. “We never anticipated there being long lines in a negative sense — we always had a feeling that this would run pretty efficiently just because of the amount of Arizonans that leveraged the mail-in ballot option. “Turnout lines have been very small and minimal and I think they’ve been running efficiently, so we’re happy about that,” he said. Still, some advocates said the states should have followed in the footsteps of Mr. DeWine and delayed their elections. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a directive saying that the election would be held on June 2, in line with what Mr. DeWine had pushed for on Monday. Mr. DeWine defended the decision Tuesday amid questions about the legality of the move, saying officials did what they needed to do to protect residents in his state. “What is important as we discuss this is that people have an opportunity to vote over an extended period of time,” he said. “I am confident that we can protect people’s rights and give them that time.” Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said states holding primaries should make voting easier and that voting by mail should be made available to all registered voters. “What happened in Ohio … has only bred more chaos and confusion, and the Democratic Party leadership in Ohio is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote,” Mr. Perez said. He said states that have not yet held primary elections should make it easier to vote “instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.” • This article was based in part on wire-service reports.

"Illinois Democrats are ready to leave the Obama years behind them, according to early exit polling Tuesday that showed a plurality of the party’s primary voters in the state say they want the next president to be more liberal than President Obama. Mr. Obama served four years as senator from Illinois before springboarding to the White House, becoming the first black person to win the presidency in 2008. Four years later he won re-election. Yet Democratic voters in a number of states say they’re ready to turn the page on his eight years, telling exit pollsters that they want the next president’s policies to “be more liberal than Obama’s.” In Illinois, that was the position of 42% of voters, according to early exit polling posted by CNN. Just 37% said they wanted to see a return to Mr. Obama’s policies, and 8% said the next president should cool it and be more conservative. In Florida, which also held its presidential primary Tuesday, Mr. Obama’s reign was more popular. A plurality of 43% said they wanted to see a return to his kinds of policies, while only 36% wanted to go more liberal, according to the early exit polling data. In both states, a majority of Democratic voters said they backed government-run health insurance that would supplant the private market — akin to the “Medicare for All” plan Sen. Bernard Sanders has championed. Support hit 59% in Illinois and 57% in Florida. Fox News, which uses a different type of primary polling, found support for a Sanders-style health plan even higher, at 71% in Illinois and 74% in Florida.

"SAN DIEGO (AP) - The Trump administration is considering a plan to turn back all people who cross the border illegally from Mexico, two administration officials said Tuesday, using powers they say the president has during pandemics like the coronavirus outbreak to mount what would be one of the most aggressive attempts to curtail illegal immigration. The plan is under consideration and no final decisions have been made, according to the officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the plan hasn’t been announced. The officials said the president has authority to take such action in a pandemic and that Mexico’s efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus, along with Venezuela’s, have been the weakest in North and South America. The officials said its authority relies on a law that gives the president authority to deny entry to people or to reject cargo if the Surgeon General determines there is “serious danger” of bringing a communicable disease to the United States.  The administration had declared in November 2018 that anyone who crossed the border illegally from Mexico would be denied asylum, a measure has been blocked in court. Last month, a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in San Francisco upheld a lower court decision to keep that asylum ban on hold while a lawsuit proceeds. The ban now being considered, which was first reported by The New York Times, would turn back to Mexico all people who cross the border illegally, not just those seeking asylum. Homeland Security Department spokeswoman Heather Swift said the president was focused on protecting Americans from the coronavirus and that “all options are on the table.” Immigrant advocacy groups condemned the possible move. “Decisions relating to the pandemic should be guided by public health officials, not by the Trump administration’s long-standing agenda to close the border to refugees seeking asylum,” said Eleanor Acer, Human Rights First’s director of refugee protection. “The administration is using the pandemic as a pretext to advance its long-term goal of curtailing asylum rights for people fleeing persecution.” A third official familiar with the administration’s decision making and unauthorized to speak publicly said there was some alarm within the government and health care community about the health of people at the Southern border, and there could be consequences without further restrictions. The official noted that some migrants are coming over the border from countries with confirmed cases of the virus.  But the proposal is also in line with Trump’s overall policies on migrants, especially poor people arriving at the border, and his desire to clamp down on immigration. It would be the effort to deter asylum and illegal immigration on the Mexican border. About 60,000 asylum-seekers have been returned to Mexico to wait for hearings in U.S. immigration court since January 2019 under its “Remain in Mexico” policy, which the Supreme Court ruled last week could stay in effect during a legal challenge. The officials didn’t detail the mechanics of how this new effort would work.  Many migrants who are forced to wait in Mexico live in squalor in makeshift camps as they wait out their court cases to stay in the U.S., often facing violence and poverty. On Tuesday, some 30 asylum-seekers, many with children, wore masks to court in El Paso, Texas.  One U.S. official told the AP that people who cross the border illegally would still be processed by the Border Patrol, which has limited ability to so without taking people to a station. Mexico can refuse to take back non-Mexicans, but the Trump administration hopes the measure will increase pressure on Mexican authorities to address the public health threat. Since November, the administration has denied asylum to hundreds of people from El Salvador and Honduras and flown them to Guatemala with a chance to seek protection there.  There were more than 851,000 arrests for crossing the border during the 2019 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. The new policy would not apply to asylum-seekers who present themselves at land ports of entry, the official said.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The worldwide outbreak has sickened more than 180,000 people and left more than 7,000 people dead. In the United States, there have been more than 4,000 confirmed cases and scores of deaths. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden is close to putting away the Democratic presidential race after wins Tuesday in Florida, Illinois and Arizona that expanded his lead over Sen. Bernard Sanders. The races in all three states were called an hour after the polls closed or sooner, leaving little doubt that Mr. Biden was continuing his march through the March primaries. The contests were also the first to play out amid the full coronavirus panic. Ohio, which also had been slated to vote Tuesday, postponed its contests, while voters in the other states were bombarded with messages about limiting their exposure to others as they tried to do their civic duty. Analysts say the virus, which is responsible for over 100 deaths in the U.S., is rewriting the rules of politics. That was evident Tuesday when Mr. Biden addressed voters via a blurry livestream from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, rather than the customary roomful of cheering supporters. Mr. Biden said he has moved close to winning the nomination by building a coalition of voters that could power him to victory in November. “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” said Mr. Biden, signaling his support for expanding health care coverage, reducing income equality and combating climate change. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all these issues, and together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this county.” “So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by and supported Sen. Sanders, I hear you,” Mr. Biden said. “I know what is at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as campaign and my goal as a candidate for president of the United States is to unify this party and then to unify the nation.” Mr. Biden crushed Mr. Sanders in Florida, and the race there was called as soon as the polls closed. With 98% of the precincts reporting, Mr. Biden led Mr. Sanders by a 61.7% to 22.8% margin. Mr. Biden was leading Mr. Sanders by a 58.7% to 36.5% margin in Illinois with a little over half of the precincts reporting. And in Arizona, he held a lead of 42.4% to 29.6% with 58% of the vote counted. Despite the results, exit polls showed a majority of voters in Florida and Illinois (59% and 57%, respectively) backed government-run health insurance that would supplant the private market — akin to the “Medicare for All” plan that Mr. Sanders has championed. The exit polls also showed that a number of voters aren’t interested in returning to the policies of the Obama years. For Mr. Sanders, the setbacks could lead to some soul-searching and will spark more calls for him to pull out of the race. Party leaders are eager to avoid a repeat of 2016, when a prolonged primary battle and a nasty convention hurt the party’s ability to unify against President Trump. “We know how this race is going to turn out now. We just don’t know when,” David Axelrod, who was a senior adviser to President Obama, said on CNN. “The question for Sen. Sanders is: Does it benefit the project of defeating President Trump for him to say in this race simply to make a statement, or is it time to consolidate around Biden?” Coronavirus concerns and the difficulties it could cause in upcoming primaries are fueling the sense of urgency that Democrats will be better off if they can clear the way for Mr. Biden and let him focus on Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden said combating the virus is a national emergency that is “akin to a war.” “This is a moment when we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact on what happens, make a big difference in the severity of this outbreak and the ability of our medical and hospital systems to handle it,” he said. Ohio is the fifth state to push back its primary date in response to the pandemic, although it had the earliest scheduled date and did it with the smallest amount of notice — just hours before polls were to open. The virus has threatened to depress turnout, which has been up in many states since 2016. Michigan had record turnout last week, marking a 30% increase over four years ago. The ripple effect of the coronavirus manifested itself Tuesday at slow polling locations. Some voters decided to sit on their hands instead of potentially exposing themselves to the COVID-19 virus. The results Tuesday, though, showed plenty of others had already voted via absentee and mail-in ballots, which Mr. Biden dominated in Florida. The contests followed a tumultuous election eve in Ohio that ended when the state Supreme Court upheld Gov. Mike DeWine’s late-in-the-game decision to postpone in-person voting. Elected leaders in Ohio are now considering whether to have in-person voting on June 2. March has been good to Mr. Biden. Entering Tuesday, he had won 15 of 22 contests this month. Mr. Sanders had won six of them. Former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took the other — in American Samoa. Mr. Biden carried a 894 to 793 delegate lead into the contests. It marks a dramatic turnout from roughly a month ago when Mr. Biden limped out of the first three primary contests without a single victory — only to turn things around with a landslide win in the South Carolina primary. ⦁ Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.

"SAN DIEGO (AP) - The small federal courtroom in San Diego where former California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter was sentenced Tuesday was crowded, and there was no attempt by attendees, security or the judge to separate people as recommended to curb the spread of the coronavirus.  Before imposing an 11-month sentence, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas J. Whelan acknowledged concerns about the virus had interrupted proceedings in many courts. He said Hunter wanted the hearing to proceed and that attendance in the courtroom was below the 50-person limit recommended by federal health officials.  However, people in the gallery that seats 36 people were not adhering to the recommendation that people stay six feet apart. Reporters and others were sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in some cases.  Whelen did respond to a request for comment after the hearing. Hunter’s attorney, Devin Burstein, said he knew of no defendant asking for a postponement. While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said no gathering should surpass 50 people, President Donald Trump said Monday that a better limit is 10. Citing that number, Chief Judge Larry Alan Burns announced hours after Hunter’s sentencing hearing that all jury trials in civil and criminal cases in the district will be suspended until April 16. Sentencings, arraignments and other hearings will be suspended as well unless directed otherwise by individual judges, according to the order. Criminal complaints and arrest and search warrants, initial appearances, and bail and detention hearings will continue before magistrate judges.  The order mirrors the precautions taken by other federal and state courts nationwide.  The U.S. Supreme Court announced Monday that it was postponing arguments for the first time in more than 100 years because of the pandemic.  Federal courts in northern California, including San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose, are closed to the public until May 1 and will not be holding trials until then.  Judges can still rule on cases and hold hearings by teleconference, among other things.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders said Tuesday the federal government should consider giving every household $2,000 per month to help them deal with the financial fallout from the coronavirus. Mr. Sanders outlined a broad bailout package for Americans, saying unemployment compensation should be expanded to cover everyone who loses a job and to cover 100% of an individual’s salary up to $75,000. He said he will be presenting his package of proposals to Senate leaders this week. The plan calls for a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, and for the suspension of mortgage loan payments for primary residences. It calls for rental assistance to be provided to make sure people do not kicked out of their homes. It also calls for waiving student loan payments during the duration of the crisis.

"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s history of how the FBI targeted Donald Trump associates has become a constant presence on social media as journalists and Russia aficionados make more discoveries and connect the dots. Every page of the Horowitz report contains new disclosures. The report’s banner headline was that FBI agents supplied inaccurate information or withheld exculpatory evidence 17 times when they asked judges to approve four wiretap warrants on campaign volunteer Carter Page. Morsels of information placed in footnotes or buried in a few sentences also tell a fuller story about the Trump-Russia investigation. Four examples: ⦁ Former FBI Director James B. Comey has asserted that the FBI on July 31, 2016, opened cases not on the Trump campaign but on four Americans: Mr. Page, Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. But it would appear that in the mind of agent Peter Strzok, who led the probe dubbed Crossfire Hurricane, the entire campaign was under scrutiny from the start. A day after opening the investigation, he traveled to London to interview Alexander Downer, the Australian ambassador to Britain who had chatted with Trump volunteer George Papadopoulos over a drink in London. Mr. Downer’s report to the FBI prompted the FBI to open a history-changing investigation. As he returned to Washington, Mr. Strzok later told the inspector general, he decided he had to find out what Trump allies besides Papadopoulos had heard that Moscow might have dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state. Based on the Downer interview, Mr. Strzok told the inspector general that “the initial investigative objective of Crossfire Hurricane was to determine which individuals associated with the Trump campaign may have been in a position to have received the alleged offer of assistance from Russia.” In effect, the entire campaign from that moment was under FBI scrutiny. In the end, special counsel Robert Mueller found no Trump-Russia conspiracy to interfere in the election. ⦁ Attorney General William Barr last spring tapped John Durham, U.S. attorney for Connecticut, to conduct a special investigation into the origins of the long FBI inquiry and determine whether laws were broken in the process. One path Mr. Durham is taking is to look for any foreign intelligence involvement in targeting the Trump campaign. Was Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud, who told Papadopoulos he heard in Moscow that the Russians could share dirt on Mrs. Clinton, a Western agent or a Russian tool? The public learned for the first time in the Horowitz report that the Crossfire team from the outset did ask for foreign assistance. The single sentence states: “The FBI also sent names of individuals associated with the Trump campaign to other U.S. government agencies and a foreign intelligence agency and requested any information about those individuals.” The inspector general’s report does not name the foreign agency. The U.S. and Britain have a long history of intelligence sharing. ⦁ The intelligence community, led by the director of national intelligence and comprising the CIA, the FBI and other agencies, produced an assessment in January 2017. It said Russia hacked Democratic Party computers and waged a social media campaign to help candidate Trump and hurt Mrs. Clinton, the assessment said. The Washington Times first reported in September 2018 that Mr. Comey wanted the Christopher Steele dossier, financed by the Clinton campaign and by the Democratic Party, included in the official assessment. The Times headline: “James Comey was chief anti-Trump dossier proponent within U.S. intelligence community. Source: Then-FBI Director James B. Comey directly advocated inclusion.” The Horowitz report confirms the reporting in footnote No. 507, with details. “FBI leadership, including Comey and McCabe, advocated for the Steele election reporting to be included in the intelligence community assessment (ICA) on Russian election interference,” the inspector general’s report states. Mr. Comey telephoned Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper on Dec. 17, 2017, and lobbied for the dossier’s inclusion. The DNI and CIA Director John O. Brennan objected and decided to include a short summary of the dossier in the appendix. Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe on Dec. 28 sent an email to the DNI objecting to the summary. An FBI intelligence section chief told the inspector general that the CIA viewed the Steele dossier as “internet rumor.” The inspector general report said: “The FBI’s view did not prevail and the final ICA report included a short summary of the Steele election reporting in an appendix.” ⦁ The FBI’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application to federal judges begins with this heading: “Verified Application.” Some commentators have taken this to mean the agents were telling judges that the bureau had corroborated the affidavit’s stated evidence from Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence officer. Not true, says the Horowitz report. The FBI verification process is known as the Woods Procedures, named after the agent who devised FISA fact-checking in the early 2000s. Mr. Horowitz determined that the Woods process required agents to verify that the material came from a particular source and that the application quotes that source accurately. Here is the inspector general’s finding: “Corroboration of source information is not required by the FBI’s Woods Procedures. Although Woods Procedures require that every fact in a FISA application be ‘verified,’ when a particular fact is attributed to a source, an agent must only verify that the fact came from the source and the application accurately states what the source said. The Woods Procedures do not require that the FBI have a second source for the same information.” The Horowitz report also notes: “We found that the FBI did not have information corroborating the specific allegations against Carter Page in Steele’s reports when it relied upon them in the FISA applications.” Released on Dec. 9, the inspector general’s 476-page report was the first official accounting of the Obama administration’s initial selection of Trump allies to investigate. The FBI’s essential piece of material to obtain the surveillance was Mr. Steele’s error-filled dossier. When agents learned from his main source that the anti-Trump allegations were Kremlin gossip, they withheld the discrepancies from Justice Department overseers, thus obtaining more wiretaps. The Justice Department balked at approving the first wiretap until the Crossfire Hurricane team received the Steele dossier on Sept. 19, 2016. “Although the Horowitz dossier offers a helpful preliminary summary of a few of the criminal acts committed by the DOJ and FBI in support of the Democrats’ coup attempt against President Trump, there’s so much more to come when the full truth is finally revealed over the coming months.” Mr. Page told The Washington Times.

"Americans should postpone unnecessary surgeries because hospitals will need the beds, the U.S. coronavirus coordinator said Tuesday, as Amazon planned to limit its product line, the Outer Banks decided to reject visitors and major department stores closed their doors. Deborah Birx, an HIV/AIDS expert tapped to organize President Trump’s team, said ventilators and a hospital’s time and attention will be at a premium, so all need to do their part. “If you’re a person with an elective surgery, you don’t want to go into a hospital right now,” she told reporters at a White House briefing. “There’s a lot of distraction. There’s a lot of people doing a lot of other things to save people’s lives.” The administration also loosened Medicare rules so that seniors can see their doctors remotely, through telehealth, at no extra cost. “They can talk to their doctor via Skype, and they don’t have to risk exposure to the virus,” said Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The moves are part of Mr. Trump’s broader plea to Americans to stay home and avoid unnecessary exposure to the coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19. The U.S. case count rose to 5,900 and the death toll approached 100, according to Johns Hopkins University’s tracker on Tuesday. Yet testing is still ramping up, meaning the full extent of the domestic outbreak is unknown. States, localities and businesses continued to close up shop or clamp down on public movements to keep people apart. The United Auto Workers union pressured Ford, General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler to mimic their European counterparts and shut down their U.S. plants for two weeks to ensure the safety of employees. However the Big Three have remained reluctant to curtail production. Macy’s said it would close its stores until March 31 and Nordstrom announced a two-week closure. In North Carolina, tourists were banned from popular Outer Banks destinations such as Nags Head and Kitty Hawk. As Capitol Hill negotiated ways to prop up workers and businesses, Mr. Trump said he is taking the outbreak very seriously, after suggesting in February that a set of 15 domestic cases “within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.” “This a pandemic. I’ve felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday. “All you had to do was look at other countries.” The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It infected tens of thousands in the surrounding Hubei Province before the epidemic shifted to other nations. It’s now spreading on six continents, particularly Europe. Authorities in Italy, France and Spain have locked down their populations, except for trips for essential supplies. Mr. Trump hasn’t gone that far, but he reminded Americans on Tuesday to avoid unnecessary travel and groups of 10 or more for the next two weeks. “We’ll see what happens after that,” he said. “Our country can be rolling again pretty quickly.” Mr. Trump said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is on standby in case they need to conduct emergency construction. Those operations could include renovations to expand and retrofit existing facilities or the construction of small field hospitals, or MASH units, to deliver care. Officials also said mobile testing units are “blossoming” across the country and that states are authorized to approve tests created by the private sector. Vice President Mike Pence said that as more diagnostics come online, every American must act on Mr. Trump’s push for “social distancing.” “You don’t need the results of testing to know what you should do,” Mr. Pence said. Mr. Trump wants people to use takeout and drive-thru services instead of entering bars and restaurants, saying it’s another way to put the nation closer to victory against the pathogen. The White House said executives representing Chick-fil-A, Olive Garden, McDonald’s and other restaurants agreed to emphasize those options Tuesday in a phone call with the president. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said many eateries use apps that allow for home delivery or quick handoffs. “You can order ahead of time,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “They can give it to you with social distancing, and it’s very fast.” The National Institutes of Health published research suggesting the coronavirus can survive on hard surfaces for some time, including up to four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard and two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Officials made direct appeals to millennials to avoid partying even if they feel invulnerable, saying they might spread the virus to vulnerable groups on doorknobs and countertops. “We can’t do this without the young people cooperating,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Amazon, meanwhile, said it is suspending shipments to its warehouses of items other than medical supplies or household staples so it can focus on stocking and delivering things that will be needed amid the outbreak. Individual states continued to take action. The San Francisco area faces the most stringent lockdown, with 7 million residents told to limit outings to trips for supplies. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said his state has recorded over 1,300 cases, the most in the nation, though he rejected rumors that New York City would go into total quarantine. “That is not true,” the Democrat said. “That cannot happen. It cannot happen legally. No city in [the] state can quarantine itself without state approval, and I have no interest whatsoever and no plan whatsoever to quarantine any city.” Mr. Cuomo compared the situation to a tabletop snowglobe. “Somebody picked up our country and just shook it,” Mr. Cuomo said. “It is a frightening time on every level. At the same time, it’s this much time,” the governor said, placing his hands slightly apart. “We will get through this much time. Understand what we’re dealing with, understand the pressures that we’re feeling — but we will get through this much time.” Mr. Trump said he had a constructive conversation with Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday, despite warring tweets over the past two days. “We’re both doing a really good job,” Mr. Trump said. The president also deferred to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s judgment in closing the state’s primary polls Tuesday. “He’s definitely somebody who knows what he’s doing,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump said the best thing the country can do to preserve future elections is to defeat the virus. ⦁ David Sherfinski contributed to this report.

"NEW YORK (AP) - When the Brooklyn clothing factory where she worked closed its doors, Josefa Marín started picking up cans and bottles from trash cans to make ends meet. A decade later, the 50-year-old Mexican immigrant is handed hundreds of recyclables by bars and clubs and by concierges of private buildings, who know her so well that they even give her the keys to their trash rooms so she can take what she needs.  For Marín, working alongside her partner, Pedro Galicia, canning is a little business that allows her to pay bills, cover her $1,500 per month rent and put food on the table for two kids. “This is our job, we have learned to survive doing this, whether it’s hot in the summer or cold in the winter,” she said, hunkered down wearing plastic gloves, while fishing through containers. In one of the most expensive cities in the world, where monthly rents in wealthy neighborhoods surpass $10,000, people who scour through trash might be viewed by some as probably homeless, but many so-called canners refute that claim. They are called “bottle professionals” by some redemption centers employees who describe them as people who know by heart each recycling and trash pick-up route, who buy from other canners and who take the job seriously thanks to a 1982 law in New York that allows consumers to return empty containers for five cents. “They have the buildings that they are dedicated to. And if they do their job properly through their network, they should be able to earn, you know, 200 to 250 dollars a day, which should equate out to over 30 dollars an hour,” said Conrad Cutler, president of Galvanize Group, a redemption center that sends trucks to Manhattan to buy from about 220 canners. “It’s not work that everybody would want to do, but it’s certainly an honest way to make a living.” The closing of restaurants and bars in the city due to the coronavirus will mean less bottles and cans for canners. However, those who collect cans from residential buildings and concierges expect big quantities as residents hunker down. The majority of canners use gloves and some now use masks as protection against germs, but they keep going out on the streets as they need cash on a regular basis.  “I think we have a high immunization system because we are always around trash,” said Ana Martínez de Luco, a nun who co-founded Sure We Can, a Brooklyn nonprofit redemption center. Some canners sit on the nonprofits board. It isn’t clear what will happen to these underground economy workers if New York City starts putting restrictions on people leaving their homes in an attempt to control the virus outbreak. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that residents should be prepared to “ shelter in place ” if the city and state decide it is safer to keep people away from each other indoors. Under the Bottle Bill, beverage distributors return redemption centers the five-cent deposit and pay them a 3.5-cent handling fee. Besides New York, nine more states in the country have bottle bills. Distributor trucks, for example, park every day in front of Sure We Can. The smell of beer from empty bottles fills the air and a clinking noise is heard all day as dozens of canners come from the streets, take out their material from shopping carts and place it in clear bags or cardboard boxes.  They all know how to sort each container: some belong to Corona, others to Pepsi, others to Polar Spring. Each canner will get between six and six and a half cents per can or bottle if they do the sorting. That’s what Josefa Teco works on every week. Teco, 57, who is a Mexican immigrant started canning five years ago, when she became unemployed after the tortilla factory she worked at moved out of state due to high rents.  She and her husband Juan have informal agreements to take recyclables from several bars and from a building they also help clean. They make around $10 for a bag of 200 cans and bottles. “I am not going to ask people ‘give me a dollar.’ No, no. I prefer to do this so I can have my money, to eat, and for all expenses,” she said. Sure We Can serves more canners each year: about 500 in 2017, more than 700 in 2018 and more than 800 last year, de Luco said. The job is not only done by Latin American or Chinese immigrants, she said, but also by the elderly, people with disabilities and all kinds of low-skill workers or business owners out of a job. Many are not “bottle professionals” but people who needs some extra cash. De Luco is fighting for the nonprofit to stay alive after the landlord asked them to leave so he can sell the property. There are no official statistics on how many canners are the in the city, but an environmental consulting firm called Eunomia estimates the number to be approximately between 4,000 and 8,000.  Chicago Crosby is one of them. The New Yorker started canning seven years ago, when her mother got sick and she took a leave of absence from her job that became permanent. At first, she would get strange looks, she said, but now people help her on a regular basis, giving her all their empty bottles and cans. “I am mainly doing pickups from this person, that person, and it is so many now,” said Crosby. “I have to keep a calendar of who called me on this day, I know it is every two weeks for this one, I know it is one week for that one. So that keeps me very, very busy.” Canners have sometimes been at odds with officials because once recycling is left on the curb it belongs to the city. However, Belinda Mager, director of communications for the city’s Sanitation Department, said that it is not illegal for individuals to redeem cans and bottles and her department does not oppose residents who do this to make ends meet. “Our goal is to send zero waste to landfills,” she said.  For Jesus Corral, 41, and Carlos Vega, 44, canning is a temporary lifeline until they find a better job. The Mexican immigrants sleep in a public park in Greenpoint and walk the streets opening trash cans.  “What do you have?” Corral asked in Spanish on a recent morning to an employee of a Brooklyn meat warehouse, who then went to the back and came out with only a few empty water bottles. “That’s okay. We already made our money for the day,” explained Vega, who had spent all night canning. “I am looking forward to the summer. We make more. People drink more, so, more bottles.”   ","In New York, making a life out of bottles and cans","Tuesday, March 17, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/17/in-new-york-making-a-life-out-of-bottles-and-cans/,washington_times
"SALEM, Ore. (AP) - The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic is threatening to worsen labor shortages experienced by Pacific Northwest farms and food processors. On March 16, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico said it would suspend routine immigrant and non-immigrant visa services due to COVID-19, potentially cutting off seasonal and migrant agricultural workers through the H-2A visa program. Dan Fazio, CEO of Wafla - formerly the Washington Farm Labor Association - told the Capital Press that the USDA is working with the State Department to obtain an emergency designation for H-2A visas, which would allow temporary farmworkers to continue entering the country. “We’ve got to get these people here in May so we can have a harvest in October,” Fazio said. Washington state had over 25,000 H-2A labor certifications in 2019, which accounted for 25% of seasonal workers, Fazio said. So far this year, Wafla has brought in more than 5,000 H-2A workers, with the biggest wave still to come in late May for the start of cherry harvest. Agriculture is a baseline industry, Fazio said, and any disruptions would trickle down throughout the economy.  Spring is also peak shipping season for Oregon’s $995 million greenhouse and nursery industry. Jeff Stone, executive director of the Oregon Association of Nurseries, said it is already difficult to find workers willing to package products and load trucks. With coronavirus potentially stalling the H-2A program, he said it only adds to the pressure. “All this really shows is the fragility of the workforce,” Stone said. “This adds a layer of worry. I feel for every business.”  ","Virus threatens labor for farms, food processors in PNW","Tuesday, March 17, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/17/virus-threatens-labor-for-farms-food-processors-in/,washington_times
"Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez is calling on states with upcoming presidential primaries to use vote-by-mail and other measures to make it safe for people to vote because of the coronavirus outbreak. In a lengthy statement issued as three state held primaries Tuesday, Perez was critical of Ohio officials for postponing their primary on the eve of voting. Ohio Gov. Mike Dewine made the call Monday night, while officials in Arizona, Florida and Illinois decided to go ahead with in-person voting on Tuesday. Perez did not name DeWine, a Republican, but said the delay “has only bred more chaos and confusion.” Perez said states that already have mail voting should “proactively mail ballots to registered voters, where feasible, and should count all ballots … postmarked by the date of the primary.” He also suggested expanding days and hours of early, in person voting and expanding absentee voting to all registered voters. Some state laws allow absentee voting for a limited number of reasons. Georgia, Maryland, Louisiana, Ohio and Kentucky have postponed upcoming primaries.

"NEW YORK (AP) - Fox News Channel’s influential prime-time lineup is starting to reflect the changed realities of the coronavirus outbreak, without embracing old enemies. The network most popular with President Donald Trump’s supporters has added a daily coronavirus-themed show and extended news hours, is practicing social distancing on the air and is frequently featuring guests like Dr. Mehmet Oz and Dr. Nicole Saphier. With the country hunkering down to protect against the virus’ spread, talk of “hysteria” and “panic” was gone Monday from the prime-time opinion lineup that is the network’s engine. Sean Hannity promised “facts without fear” and said that “we are all Americans.” Laura Ingraham said federal guidelines restricting movement should be taken extremely seriously. Some things remained consistent: There was time to criticize Democrats and non-Fox media. The sister channel Fox Business Network last Friday shelved a prime-time program hosted by Trish Regan, days after she suggested criticism directed at Trump for his coronavirus response was “yet another attempt to impeach the president.” Tucker Carlson, the first of Fox News’ three prime-time personalities, stood out last week with his calls to Americans to treat the coronavirus seriously. On Monday’s show, Carlson said that protecting the jobs of Americans should be the government’s top priority. Hannity, Trump’s top media ally and cable news’ most popular host, last week told his viewers that while the coronavirus is a serious matter that poses risks and challenges, it’s not “the end of days. It’s not the end of the world.” “I don’t like that we are scaring people unnecessarily,” he said. He has frequently drawn comparisons between the new coronavirus and the seasonal death rate for the common flu and, last Tuesday, to street violence. “To put it in perspective, 26 people were shot in Chicago alone over the weekend,” he said. “I doubt you heard about it. You notice there’s no widespread hysteria about violence in Chicago.” At one point when Hannity introduced statistics on how many people died of the flu, he was scolded by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci, a guest on the show, told Hannity to make sure that people understand that coronavirus is more lethal than the flu. There’s also a vaccine for the flu, and not for the new strain of coronavirus. Similarly, Oz applied the brakes last week when Hannity said that the odds of people dying from coronavirus were negligible unless they were elderly or had a preexisting condition. The doctor said: “The risk of dying is unclear because we haven’t been able to study it in this country.” While Hannity mentioned the flu again on Monday’s show, he also noted that the coronavirus death rate was higher. Most people who get coronavirus have only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. Both Hannity and Ingraham praised Trump this week for his decisions to restrict travel to the United States from China and Europe. “We can say tonight without a doubt, the president’s China and European travel ban I predict will go down as the single most consequential decision in history,” Hannity said. “That’s not political. It bought us time. It bought the hospitals time to prepare.” While attacking the “media mob” for criticizing Trump, Hannity also cited a Breitbart News report that suggested Democrats were not paying enough attention to coronavirus in its early stages because they were preoccupied with the president’s impeachment trial. “The media, some have been enjoying this moment that has brought great inconvenience, disruption and suffering to American workers and American families, let alone all the health challenges, the deaths and the infection rates,” Ingraham said. “Because some people think it is Trump’s downfall and they’re cheering it on.” All of Fox’s prime-time hosts have emphasized the virus’ origin, calling it the “China coronavirus” or the “Wuhan virus.” “Let’s not forget where it came from,” Ingraham said She has also questioned the restriction of movements of people who were not in “hot spots” of infection. “That’s panic and that’s hurting the market,” she said. On Monday, she urged Americans to heed warnings but also not to accept the current situation as “the new normal.” “If we don’t learn the right long-term lessons, well, we can just face a recurring cycle of misery and shutdowns if something happens that is bad in another country,” she said. She called for fewer imports of products from China, and tighter security and medical screening at the nation’s borders. Hannity on Monday had California Rep. Devin Nunes as a guest. He attacked the “media freaks” who criticized his comments on the Fox Business Network where he suggested people should go to restaurants - which are now closed to diners in many parts of the country. “Don’t just go to the grocery store and buy $4,000 of food,” Nunes said. “Go to your local pub.” Nunes told Hannity that he was suggesting people get take-out food at restaurants, although that wasn’t apparent a day earlier. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"The Senate is set to push ahead with a vote on the House coronavirus bill while Republicans ramp up their efforts to unify around a set of priorities for the third economic package. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the plan to leave the two packages separate Tuesday, though the timing of when his chamber will pass the House’s relief bill is still unclear. He dismissed suggestions of amending the House bill to make it broader, which would have forced the House to return and repass the legislation. The Republican leader acknowledged, though, that some of his GOP colleagues are unhappy with the bill as written, and urged them to focus on addressing those concerns later. “My counsel is — to gag and vote for it anyway,” Mr. McConnell said. However, Sen. Rand Paul is still pushing for a vote on an amendment before the Senate votes on the House bill, delaying the “warp speed” vote that Mr. McConnell wanted. “If they allow us an amendment, we’ll allow them to do it more quickly,” he said, according to The Hill. The bill mandates free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs, and pays for sick leave for those who contract the virus or need to care for someone who does if they work for a company with a cap of 500 employees. It also shores up food programs for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and children, and it bolsters state Medicaid programs so health care providers can handle an influx of patients. A version passed the House on Monday evening, after lawmakers tweaked some paid-leave provisions. Though there is no official price tag on the House bill, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it will cost around $104 billion. Mr. McConnell vowed to not adjourn the Senate until it has written and passed a third economic package to address the economic fallout — a plan that is still in its very early stages as lawmakers across Capitol Hill float their own priorities for the economic fix. To get his party on the same page, Mr. McConnell crafted three task forces to work on putting together a Republican version of the bill and negotiate with Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin to ensure it has White House approval. “I’ve told everyone else if they have a really good idea, how to funnel it into a particular task force,” he said. The administration initially proposed a $850 billion plan Tuesday, which would include aid for hard-hit sectors, particularly the airline industry which is lobbying the government for assistance after dramatically pulling back on flights. White House aides say the package could include more than $50 billion for airlines, about $500 billion in payroll tax cuts, and $250 billion or more in Small Business Administration loans. That figure soared, however, to $1 trillion by Tuesday afternoon. There’s also been an uptick of GOP support for immediate cash handouts to Americans — initially proposed by Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah. Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin said they were strongly considering giving Americans $1,000 each within the next two weeks to help with the impact of the coronavirus. “The president has instructed me we have to do this now,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “This is no fault to American workers. For medical reasons, we are shutting down parts of the economy.” The president had been pushing for a payroll tax cut to get more money to the American public, but acknowledged Tuesday it could take too long for people to feel that impact. The proposal also failed to get any enthusiasm on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, Democrats have laid out their own priorities for the upcoming package. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer called for at least $750 billion that would go toward shoring up hospital resources, affordability of coronavirus treatment, fund public transportation and emergency child care and pause payments on loans immediately. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants the third bill to expand on benefits for workers, including ensuring first responders and health workers have paid leave if they need it. She also wants refundable tax credits for self-employed and gig economy workers. “During negotiations, the Democratic House will continue to make clear to the Administration that any emergency response package must put Families First before any aid to corporate America is considered,” she said in a statement. Mrs. Pelosi and Rep. Peter DeFazio, Oregon Democrat and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman, began talks Tuesday with Mr. Mnuchin about the next package and specifically concerns about the airline industry. They also spoke with airline CEOs about their urgent need as well as the AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka about expanding paid leave benefits.

"Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado will self-quarantine “out of an abundance of caution” after contacting a constituent who tested positive for COVID-19. Mr. Gardner said he was alerted on Tuesday by the Tri-County Health Department that a constituent who visited his Washington office for a meeting tested positive for the coronavirus, although the senator himself isn’t displaying symptoms. “The health and safety of Coloradans and Americans across the nation is my top priority, and I will continue working to make sure Congress provides the resources needed to help combat the spread of COVID-19,” Mr. Gardner said. The effective date for the quarantine was March 11. Other U.S. senators who have self-quarantined for precautionary reasons include GOP Sens. Rick Scott of Florida, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Graham said a subsequent COVID-19 test he took turned up negative.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders’ campaign manager on Wednesday said the Democratic presidential candidate is going to be talking to supporters to “assess” his campaign, after former Vice President Joseph R. Biden racked up several more wins Tuesday to amass a daunting delegate lead. “The next primary contest is at least three weeks away,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. “Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.” “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable,” he said. Mr. Biden cruised to wins in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday to build a delegate lead that will be exceedingly difficult for the Vermont senator to overcome in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Biden has 1,147 delegates to Mr. Sanders’ 861, according to the latest tally from The Associated Press. Mr. Sanders spoke via livestream before the polls closed Tuesday, but devoted the entire address to his ideas to deal with COVID-19, including a proposal to pay every American $2,000 per month for the duration of the crisis. The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted the lives of millions of Americans, and has prompted states like Georgia and Louisiana that had primaries scheduled in the next few weeks to postpone them. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine blew past a judge’s ruling this week to invoke a health emergency and postpone in-person voting in Ohio’s primary from March 17 to June 2. The elections that did take place on Tuesday were plagued with polling location closures and delayed openings, as workers and voters were wary of congregating in public amid national warnings against doing so. Some advocates have talked up expanding vote-by-mail options for states that have yet to hold their primaries. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said on Tuesday that states should implement such measures moving forward “instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.”  ",Bernie Sanders will have talks to 'assess' his campaign," -

"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - Margaret Sparrow was 21 years old when she drank a concoction to induce an abortion, at a time when the procedure was both illegal and socially unacceptable in New Zealand.  Now age 84, Sparrow was delighted Wednesday when lawmakers passed a landmark bill that treats the procedure as a health issue rather than a crime.  “It’s been a long time coming,” said Sparrow, a doctor who has spent her life advocating for the reproductive rights of women. While views about abortions have generally become much more liberal in New Zealand since Sparrow’s experience, the law, while updated in 1977, had not fully reflected that change. Until Wednesday’s vote, the procedure was still regulated under the Crimes Act, requiring women to prove to a doctor that their pregnancy presented a danger to their physical or mental health before they could get an abortion. Justice Minister Andrew Little said that requirement forced most women to lie about their mental health and caused unnecessary delays which added health risks. The new law removes those obstacles, allowing women who are up to 20 weeks pregnant to get an abortion and those over 20 weeks to get one with approval from a health practitioner. Lawmakers voted 68 to 51 in favor of the bill.  Conservative lawmaker Simeon Brown, who opposed it, said an unborn child had a heartbeat and felt pain, and should be considered a person who is treated with dignity and respect. Jackie Edmond, the chief executive of Family Planning, New Zealand’s largest referrer of women to abortion services, said she was thrilled with the vote and that women were finally being trusted to make their own health decisions. “It’s fantastic Parliament has addressed something that they should have addressed 40 years ago,” Edmond said. Sparrow said the law stayed on the books for so long because people found a work-around and lawmakers worried about the political consequences of opening up a debate about it. That changed when Jacinda Ardern was elected prime minister in 2017 and followed up on a campaign promise to bring the issue to a vote. Sparrow said it wasn’t so much her own experience of having an abortion that motivated her work over the decades but more recognizing that there was an unfilled need for women. She began her career helping students get access to contraception and for several years helped send people to Australia to get abortions before the first New Zealand clinic opened. She said the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade gave people hope for change in New Zealand. Sparrow, who has received one of New Zealand’s top honors for her work, said the new law is a step forward but her work is not done yet. “It will be safer for women and better for access,” she said. “The next stage is making sure its implemented.”  ",New Zealand passes landmark law to decriminalize abortion,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/new-zealand-passes-landmark-law-to-decriminalize-a/,washington_times
"Voting rights groups and the head of the Democratic National  Committee want the states with remaining primary elections to offer  voting by mail as a way to ensure that voters can safely cast their  ballots amid the coronavirus outbreak. A quick and easy fix? Not always. For states that don’t already have vote-by-mail or that greatly  restrict it, such a change could require amending state law. It also  would require major changes to state and county voting and tabulating  systems. Buying the equipment and software to track ballots and read the  signatures on them could cost millions. And that’s not to mention  deciding who pays for return postage - individual voters or taxpayers? So far this year, there have been quick moves to extend mail voting  in only two cases, both limited in scope: Maryland postponed its primary  but decided to hold next month’s special congressional election by  mail. And the Democratic Party in Wyoming, which already was sending all  its members ballots, has canceled the in-person portion of its  presidential caucus. As in Wyoming, the Democratic caucuses and primaries in Alaska,  Hawaii and Kansas were already to be held largely by mail this spring.  So far, none of the five states that have postponed their primaries —  Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland or Ohio — have said they will  mail ballots statewide. A bill in Louisiana seeking to expand vote-by-mail was introduced  even before the state’s primary was pushed back, but it hasn’t received a  legislative hearing and is opposed by the state’s top elections  official. Pennsylvania lawmakers eased absentee ballot rules last year,  and now Democrats want to expand voting by mail. Republicans, who  control the statehouse, have generally resisted voting changes, and it’s  unclear if the virus crisis is enough to overcome concerns about the  costs of greatly expanding vote-by-mail. Opposition isn’t unusual, typically because lawmakers or election  officials believe it opens a pathway to voter fraud. The ability to  receive a ballot in the mail is greatly restricted in 16 states. Those states allow absentee ballots only for voters who give a valid  reason to get one - and require they be requested for each election. Of  those, Delaware and New York are phasing in no-excuse mail voting. The hurdles to implementing voting by mail for all voters is why  states might be better off taking only small steps at first, said  Charles Stewart, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology. That could mean simply making absentee ballots  easier to get. “Hastily implemented changes to voting rules and laws can end up  causing all types of problems that you didn’t anticipate,” he said. Doug Jones, an election security expert at the University of Iowa,  said universal mail voting also raises concerns about voters illegally  selling blank ballots or being coerced to vote a certain way. On Tuesday, after Ohio postponed its primary and poll workers failed  to show up at some Florida and Illinois precincts, Democratic National  Committee Chairman Tom Perez called a shift to voting largely by mail  “the simplest tool” to balance health concerns and the need to carry out  a fundamental function of democracy. A half-dozen states already have or are implementing systems where  all voters are mailed ballots. They can mail them back, drop them off at  designated spots or choose to vote in person on Election Day. Oregon has been conducting elections that way since the 1990s. Since  then, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Utah and Washington have implemented  or begun phasing in similar systems. With the coronavirus pandemic, the idea has generated more interest.  The National Vote at Home Institute advocates for a switch to a  mail-based voting system and consults with governments about it. Said chief executive Amber McReynolds: “It’s better than hoping  people show up and aren’t scared, and hoping that you don’t have a giant  poll worker shortage and hoping polling places aren’t closed.” ___ Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey. ___ Associated Press writers Frank Bajak in Boston; Melinda Deslatte in  Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,  contributed to this report.

"Voters heading to the polls in Illinois, Florida and Arizona on Tuesday were greeted with unexpected closures and delays — as well as sightings of protective masks and hand sanitizers — as they tried to navigate their presidential primaries amid the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak. Election officials had expressed confidence heading into Tuesday that they could hold primaries while simultaneously advising voters to be smart about personal hygiene and “social distancing” in polling lines, but Illinois and Florida reported early problems. “It has been a hectic and trying day,” said Jay Young, executive director of the advocacy group Common Cause Illinois. “We immediately began seeing problems principally around polling places where election judges had chosen not to show.” Ohio abruptly postponed in-person voting that was scheduled for Tuesday, with Gov. Mike DeWine blowing past a judge’s ruling Monday evening to invoke a state health emergency and push the election to June 2. A spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners on Tuesday said they asked Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker last week to cancel in-person voting and switch completely to voting by mail after the World Health Organization classified the coronavirus as a pandemic, but the governor’s office declined. “It was a snowball we could all see coming down the hill,” Jim Allen, the spokesman, told reporters. Mr. Pritzker pushed back against Mr. Allen’s contention, saying their offers to provide the National Guard and other volunteers were rebuffed. “[It’s] times like these when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else,” the governor said. “If people want to criticize me for that, well, go ahead. I’ll wear it like a badge of honor.” A spokeswoman for the governor had said earlier that there are no perfect solutions at the moment — only “least bad solutions.” As it stood, voters Tuesday were being turned away at some locations, including in Cook County, because of a lack of election judges. Cook County Clerk Karen Yarbrough posted a picture on social media of blue painters tape with instructions for poll workers to try to mark the floor and keep voters at least six feet apart. Dan Kovats, executive director of the Illinois Democratic County Chairs’ Association, said turnout was “very low” but that voting were proceeding. “We had some election judges call off, but county clerks have done a good job with having reserve judges ready to deploy as needed,” he said. “There have been some issues in Chicago but these issues are similar to a standard Election Day.” Officials in the three states were hoping that a surge in early voting and vote by mail would make up for lower in-person turnout, with both voters and poll workers wary of getting crosswise with national guidance to avoid large crowds to try to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s campaign issued a memo before the polls closed Tuesday estimating that turnout in Florida and Arizona would be about on pace with 2016 and that Illinois’ turnout would be about in line with 2018 levels. Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who is facing a significant deficit to Mr. Biden in the delegate count, said voting at the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and the campaign would respect whatever voters choose to do. Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections, said the state had been on pace to set new records for early and mail voting for a primary election. As of Monday, 504,000 early votes had been cast cast and 294,000 mail ballots sent to voters. That was up from a day before the 2016 primary, when the numbers were 400,000 and 160,000, respectively, he said. Slightly more than 2 million ballots were cast in the 2016 Democratic primary in Illinois. In Florida, meanwhile, some polling locations were forced to open late because poll workers failed to show. “We have experienced poll worker no-shows, causing some of our polling locations to open late,” Wendy Sartory Link, the Palm Beach County supervisor of Elections, said on Facebook. As of Tuesday morning, more than 658,000 Democrats had voted by mail and more than 438,000 had voted early in Florida, well ahead of the numbers from 2016. About 1.7 million ballots were cast in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary contest in Florida. In Arizona, in-person turnout was slow but Democrats exceeded their 2016 overall vote total through early ballots alone, according to estimates from the state Democratic Party. About 480,000 early ballots were cast in the 2020 election, compared to about 468,000 total ballots in the 2016 contest in Arizona, the party said. “We haven’t heard about a massive exodus of polling workers,” said Matt Grodsky, a spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party. “We never anticipated there being long lines in a negative sense — we always had a feeling that this would run pretty efficiently just because of the amount of Arizonans that leveraged the mail-in ballot option. “Turnout lines have been very small and minimal and I think they’ve been running efficiently, so we’re happy about that,” he said. Still, some advocates said the states should have followed in the footsteps of Mr. DeWine and delayed their elections. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a directive saying that the election would be held on June 2, in line with what Mr. DeWine had pushed for on Monday. Mr. DeWine defended the decision Tuesday amid questions about the legality of the move, saying officials did what they needed to do to protect residents in his state. “What is important as we discuss this is that people have an opportunity to vote over an extended period of time,” he said. “I am confident that we can protect people’s rights and give them that time.” Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said states holding primaries should make voting easier and that voting by mail should be made available to all registered voters. “What happened in Ohio … has only bred more chaos and confusion, and the Democratic Party leadership in Ohio is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote,” Mr. Perez said. He said states that have not yet held primary elections should make it easier to vote “instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.” • This article was based in part on wire service reports.

"Illinois Democrats are ready to leave the Obama years behind them, according to early exit polling Tuesday that showed a plurality of the party’s primary voters in the state say they want the next president to be more liberal than President Barack Obama. Mr. Obama served four years as senator from Illinois before springboarding to the White House, becoming the first black person to win the presidency in 2008. Four years later he won re-election. Yet Democratic voters in a number of states say they’re ready to turn the page on his eight years, telling exit pollsters that they want the next president’s policies to “be more liberal than Obama‘s.” In Illinois, that was the position of 42% of voters, according to early exit polling posted by CNN. Just 37% said they wanted to see a return to Mr. Obama’s policies, and 8% said the next president should cool it and be more conservative. In Florida, which also held its presidential primary Tuesday, Mr. Obama’s reign was more popular. A plurality of 43% said they wanted to see a return to his kinds of policies, while only 36% wanted to go more liberal, according to the early exit polling data. In both states, a majority of Democratic voters said they backed government-run health insurance that would supplant the private market — akin to the “Medicare for All” plan Sen. Bernard Sanders has championed. Support hit 59% in Illinois and 57% in Florida. Fox News, which uses a different type of primary polling, found support for a Sanders-style health plan even higher, at 71% in Illinois and 74% in Florida.

"President Trump on Tuesday denounced China for falsely claiming the U.S. Army spread the deadly coronavirus in China, as Beijing condemned Mr. Trump’s use of the phrase “Chinese Virus” and said it was expelling more U.S. journalists from the country. Asked Tuesday about a tweet the day before referring to the virus, Mr. Trump told reporters, “Well, China was putting out information which was false that our military did this to them.” “That was false and rather than having an argument, I said I had to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So I think it’s a very accurate term,” he said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week also criticized the Chinese Communist Party for spreading the false notion the U.S. created the virus. Washington and Beijing have escalated the rhetorical war over the illness in recent days, with Chinese disinformation efforts suggesting that American soldiers attending a military competition in Wuhan last fall brought the virus to the country, and Chinese officials slamming U.S. criticisms of its handling of the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday that it was expelling journalists for The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post. The journalists, whose work permits were to expire at the end of the year, must to leave the country in four days. The Chinese were retaliating for the Trump administration’s recent designation of five state-run Chinese media outlets in the United States as foreign government entities covered by State Department restrictions on travel and real estate. That in turn was retaliation for China’s expulsion of three Wall Street Journal journalists over an opinion column critical of China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. “The U.S. approach to the Chinese media is based on Cold War thinking and ideological prejudice,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday. At the State Department, Mr. Pompeo said the expulsions were unjustified and that China lacks press freedoms enjoyed by news reporters in the U.S. “We know that that kind of freedom doesn’t exist inside of China,” he said. “Indeed the Chinese will tell you that they want more information, people to know more about the country, and yet they continue to take actions like the one you see today where they deny the world the capacity to know what is really going on inside of their country.” The Chinese news organizations sanctioned by the State Department “were part of Chinese propaganda outlets,” Mr. Pompeo said. Mr. Pompeo warned the Chinese will be held accountable for their role in spreading lies about the new virus that originated in Wuhan, China. “Look, this information campaign that they are waging is designed to shift responsibility,” he said. While saying “now is not the time for recrimination,” Mr. Pompeo said the time will come when the U.S. evaluates how the world responded to the pandemic. “We know this much, we know that the first government to be aware of the Wuhan virus was the Chinese government,” he said, adding that Chinese officials delayed alerting the world even after they learned of the potential health risk. China “had a responsibility to do this not only for Americans and Italians and South Koreans and Iranians who are now suffering but for their own people as well,” Mr. Pompeo said. Asked about Mr. Trump’s virus tweet, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang expressed “strong indignation and objection to such stigmatization.” The Communist Party-affiliated Global Times newspaper said Mr. Trump’s tweet signaled a new round of tensions. “The improper nomenclature from Trump and his ilk may be just the start of escalated China-U.S. tensions in a wide range of fields like trade, economic exchanges and politics,” the paper said. “In this sense, China needs to be prepared for the re-escalation of China-U.S. trade conflict in the coming period.” But naming a virus after its place of origin is not unusual. Several other dangerous viruses are named for the location where they broke out, including the Ebola virus named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Marburg virus after a city in Germany, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.

"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden is close to putting away the Democratic presidential race after wins Tuesday in Florida, Illinois and Arizona that expanded his lead over Sen. Bernard Sanders. The races in all three states were called an hour after the polls closed or sooner, leaving little doubt that Mr. Biden was continuing his march through the March primaries. The contests were also the first to play out amid the full coronavirus panic. Ohio, which also had been slated to vote Tuesday, postponed its contests, while voters in the other states were bombarded with messages about limiting their exposure to others as they tried to do their civic duty. Analysts say the virus, which is responsible for more than 100 deaths in the U.S., is rewriting the rules of politics. That was evident Tuesday when Mr. Biden addressed voters via a blurry livestream from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, rather than the customary roomful of cheering supporters. Mr. Biden said he has moved close to winning the nomination by building a coalition of voters that could power him to victory in November. “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” said Mr. Biden, signaling his support for expanding health care coverage, reducing income equality and combating climate change. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all these issues, and together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this county.” “So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by and supported Sen. Sanders, I hear you,” Mr. Biden said. “I know what is at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as campaign and my goal as a candidate for president of the United States is to unify this party and then to unify the nation.” Mr. Biden crushed Mr. Sanders in Florida, and the race there was called as soon as the polls closed. With 98% of the precincts reporting, Mr. Biden led Mr. Sanders by a 61.7% to 22.8% margin. Mr. Biden was leading Mr. Sanders by a 58.7% to 36.5% margin in Illinois with a little over half of the precincts reporting. And in Arizona, the former vice president held a lead of 42.4% to 29.6% with 58% of the vote counted. Despite the results, exit polls showed a majority of voters in Florida and Illinois (59% and 57%, respectively) backed government-run health insurance that would supplant the private market — akin to the “Medicare for All” plan that Mr. Sanders of Vermont has championed. The exit polls also showed that a number of voters aren’t interested in returning to the policies of the Obama years. For Mr. Sanders, the setbacks could lead to some soul-searching and will spark more calls for him to pull out of the race. Party leaders are eager to avoid a repeat of 2016, when a prolonged primary battle and a nasty convention hurt the party’s ability to unify against President Trump. “We know how this race is going to turn out now. We just don’t know when,” David Axelrod, who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said on CNN. “The question for Sen. Sanders is: Does it benefit the project of defeating President Trump for him to stay in this race simply to make a statement, or is it time to consolidate around Biden?” Coronavirus concerns and the difficulties it could cause in upcoming primaries are fueling the sense of urgency that Democrats will be better off if they can clear the way for Mr. Biden and let him focus on Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden said combating the virus is a national emergency that is “akin to a war.” “This is a moment when we need our leaders to lead, but it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact on what happens, make a big difference in the severity of this outbreak and the ability of our medical and hospital systems to handle it,” he said. Ohio is the fifth state to push back its primary date in response to the pandemic, although it had the earliest scheduled date and did it with the smallest amount of notice — just hours before polls were to open. The virus has threatened to depress turnout, which has been up in many states since 2016. Michigan had record turnout last week, marking a 30% increase over four years ago. The ripple effect of the coronavirus manifested itself Tuesday at slow polling locations. Some voters decided to sit on their hands instead of potentially exposing themselves to the COVID-19 virus. The results Tuesday, though, showed plenty of others had already voted via absentee and mail-in ballots, which Mr. Biden dominated in Florida. The contests followed a tumultuous election eve in Ohio that ended when the state Supreme Court upheld Gov. Mike DeWine’s late-in-the-game decision to postpone in-person voting. Elected leaders in Ohio are now considering whether to have in-person voting on June 2. March has been good to Mr. Biden. Entering Tuesday, he had won 15 of 22 contests this month. Mr. Sanders had won six of them. Former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took the other — in American Samoa. Mr. Biden carried an 894 to 793 delegate lead into the contests. It marks a dramatic turnout from roughly a month ago when Mr. Biden limped out of the first three primary contests without a single victory — only to turn things around with a landslide win in the South Carolina primary. • Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.

"Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz’s history of how the FBI targeted Donald Trump associates has become a constant presence on social media as journalists and Russia aficionados make more discoveries and connect the dots. Every page of the Horowitz report contains new disclosures. The report’s banner headline was that FBI agents supplied inaccurate information or withheld exculpatory evidence 17 times when they asked judges to approve four wiretap warrants on campaign volunteer Carter Page. Morsels of information placed in footnotes or buried in a few sentences also tell a fuller story about the Trump-Russia investigation. Four examples: ⦁ Former FBI Director James B. Comey has asserted that the FBI on July 31, 2016, opened cases not on the Trump campaign but on four Americans: Mr. Page, Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. But it would appear that in the mind of agent Peter Strzok, who led the probe dubbed Crossfire Hurricane, the entire campaign was under scrutiny from the start. A day after opening the investigation, he traveled to London to interview Alexander Downer, the Australian ambassador to Britain who had chatted with Trump volunteer George Papadopoulos over a drink in London. Mr. Downer’s report to the FBI prompted the FBI to open a history-changing investigation. As he returned to Washington, Mr. Strzok later told the inspector general, he decided he had to find out what Trump allies besides Papadopoulos had heard that Moscow might have dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state. Based on the Downer interview, Mr. Strzok told the inspector general that “the initial investigative objective of Crossfire Hurricane was to determine which individuals associated with the Trump campaign may have been in a position to have received the alleged offer of assistance from Russia.” In effect, the entire campaign from that moment was under FBI scrutiny. In the end, special counsel Robert Mueller found no Trump-Russia conspiracy to interfere in the election. ⦁ Attorney General William P. Barr last spring tapped John Durham, U.S. attorney for Connecticut, to conduct a special investigation into the origins of the long FBI inquiry and determine whether laws were broken in the process. One path Mr. Durham is taking is to look for any foreign intelligence involvement in targeting the Trump campaign. Was Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud, who told Papadopoulos he heard in Moscow that the Russians could share dirt on Mrs. Clinton, a Western agent or a Russian tool? The public learned for the first time in the Horowitz report that the Crossfire team from the outset did ask for foreign assistance. The single sentence states: “The FBI also sent names of individuals associated with the Trump campaign to other U.S. government agencies and a foreign intelligence agency and requested any information about those individuals.” The inspector general’s report does not name the foreign agency. The U.S. and Britain have a long history of intelligence sharing. ⦁ The intelligence community, led by the director of national intelligence and comprising the CIA, the FBI and other agencies, produced an assessment in January 2017. It said Russia hacked Democratic Party computers and waged a social media campaign to help candidate Trump and hurt Mrs. Clinton, the assessment said. The Washington Times first reported in September 2018 that Mr. Comey wanted the Christopher Steele dossier, financed by the Clinton campaign and by the Democratic Party, included in the official assessment. The Times headline: “James Comey was chief anti-Trump dossier proponent within U.S. intelligence community. Source: Then-FBI Director James B. Comey directly advocated inclusion.” The Horowitz report confirms the reporting in footnote No. 507, with details. “FBI leadership, including Comey and McCabe, advocated for the Steele election reporting to be included in the intelligence community assessment (ICA) on Russian election interference,” the inspector general’s report states. Mr. Comey telephoned Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper on Dec. 17, 2017, and lobbied for the dossier’s inclusion. The DNI and CIA Director John O. Brennan objected and decided to include a short summary of the dossier in the appendix. Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe on Dec. 28 sent an email to the DNI objecting to the summary. An FBI intelligence section chief told the inspector general that the CIA viewed the Steele dossier as “internet rumor.” The inspector general report said: “The FBI’s view did not prevail and the final ICA report included a short summary of the Steele election reporting in an appendix.” ⦁ The FBI’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application to federal judges begins with this heading: “Verified Application.” Some commentators have taken this to mean the agents were telling judges that the bureau had corroborated the affidavit’s stated evidence from Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence officer. Not true, says the Horowitz report. The FBI verification process is known as the Woods Procedures, named after the agent who devised FISA fact-checking in the early 2000s. Mr. Horowitz determined that the Woods process required agents to verify that the material came from a particular source and that the application quotes that source accurately. Here is the inspector general’s finding: “Corroboration of source information is not required by the FBI’s Woods Procedures. Although Woods Procedures require that every fact in a FISA application be ‘verified,’ when a particular fact is attributed to a source, an agent must only verify that the fact came from the source and the application accurately states what the source said. The Woods Procedures do not require that the FBI have a second source for the same information.” The Horowitz report also notes: “We found that the FBI did not have information corroborating the specific allegations against Carter Page in Steele’s reports when it relied upon them in the FISA applications.” Released on Dec. 9, the inspector general’s 476-page report was the first official accounting of the Obama administration’s initial selection of Trump allies to investigate. The FBI’s essential piece of material to obtain the surveillance was Mr. Steele’s error-filled dossier. When agents learned from his main source that the anti-Trump allegations were Kremlin gossip, they withheld the discrepancies from Justice Department overseers, thus obtaining more wiretaps. The Justice Department balked at approving the first wiretap until the Crossfire Hurricane team received the Steele dossier on Sept. 19, 2016. “Although the Horowitz dossier offers a helpful preliminary summary of a few of the criminal acts committed by the DOJ and FBI in support of the Democrats’ coup attempt against President Trump, there’s so much more to come when the full truth is finally revealed over the coming months.” Mr. Page told The Washington Times.

"BETHEL, Alaska (AP) - An Alaska woman facing deportation was unaware she was not a U.S. citizen until she was 22 years old, she said. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has ordered Becky Trimble to leave the country, Alaska Public Media reported  Tuesday. The Bethel resident has lived in the United States since she was three days old. Trimble received a letter from the agency Feb. 10 saying she had 33 days to leave or risk being deported because she voted illegally in the 2008 presidential election. Until then, Trimble assumed she was a U.S. citizen. She had gotten a job, a driver’s license and voted. She is married with two children. But Trimble’s parents adopted her three days after her birth and brought her to the U.S. from Mexico. As a 19-year-old high school senior, Trimble was told voting was the right thing to do. President George W. Bush was ineligible for another term and Republican John McCain faced Democrat Barack Obama in the contest for the White House. “It was a very big election, 2008,” Trimble said. “We could make history.” Trimble told citizenship and immigration services she had no idea she was not a citizen when she cast her ballot, but the agency maintained her action was still illegal. “I feel like there are holes in the system and that I just need to be looked at as an individual, and not just over a letter,” Trimble said. Trimble is not worried about her upcoming departure deadline. “I just don’t feel like they could deport me when there’s just nowhere to go,” Trimble said. “There’s no proof (of where) to send me.” The birth certificate her adoptive parents received from her birth mother in Mexico was fake and she does not believe the United States will send her to a country where she does not officially belong. “Who knows if they even want me,” Trimble joked. Trimble has received encouragement from Alaska officials. Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski phoned her, while Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and Democratic state Rep. Tiffany Zulkosky said they have advocated on her behalf. “I’m going to stay here and just live out normal life, and just kind of see how things play out,” Trimble said. “It’s still scary because, of course, they could probably detain me, but I feel at peace that things are going to work out and that I’m safe.”  ",Alaska woman facing deportation believed she was a citizen,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/alaska-woman-facing-deportation-believed-she-was-a/,washington_times
"Sen. Bernard Sanders’ campaign manager on Wednesday said the Democratic presidential candidate is going to be talking to supporters to “assess” his campaign, after former Vice President Joseph R. Biden racked up several more wins Tuesday to amass a daunting delegate lead. “The next primary contest is at least three weeks away,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. “Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.” “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable,” he said. Mr. Biden cruised to wins in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday to build a delegate lead that will be exceedingly difficult for the Vermont senator to overcome in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Biden has 1,147 delegates to Mr. Sanders’ 861, according to the latest tally from The Associated Press. Mr. Sanders spoke via livestream before the polls closed Tuesday, but devoted the entire address to his ideas to deal with COVID-19, including a proposal to pay every American $2,000 per month for the duration of the crisis. The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted the lives of millions of Americans, and has prompted states like Georgia and Louisiana that had primaries scheduled in the next few weeks to postpone them. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine blew past a judge’s ruling this week to invoke a health emergency and postpone in-person voting in Ohio’s primary from March 17 to June 2. The elections that did take place on Tuesday were plagued with polling location closures and delayed openings, as workers and voters were wary of congregating in public amid national warnings against doing so. Some advocates have talked up expanding vote-by-mail options for states that have yet to hold their primaries. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said on Tuesday that states should implement such measures moving forward “instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.”  ",Bernie Sanders will have talks to 'assess' his campaign,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/bernie-sanders-will-have-talks-to-assess-his-campa/,washington_times
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to pass the House coronavirus bill on Wednesday as his chairmen continue to craft a third package behind the scenes. Mr. McConnell, Kentucky Republican, highlighted “shortcomings” he’s concerned about in the House’s relief package that extends benefits to workers hard hit by the virus, particularly the pressure on small businesses. “This is a time for urgent bipartisan action,” he said. “In this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers.” Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer slammed the Republican leadership for how Wednesday’s vote will unfold. “First, we must dispose of a Republican amendment that would make a condition of the bill a requirement that the president terminates military operations in Afghanistan,” the New York Democrat said. “In a time of national emergency, this Republican amendment is ridiculous,”  he added. Meanwhile looking ahead to the stimulus package, Mr. McConnell is dividing his senators to focus on different priorities for the next stimulus package: getting more money in the public’s pockets, shoring up public health resources and finding ways to support small businesses. He highlighted that many small businesses across the nation are being shuttered to help enforce the social-distancing practices urged by health professionals. Sens. Marco Rubio, chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, and Susan Collins will unveil a $300 billion relief package for these hard-hit companies later Wednesday afternoon. “So we’re going to pass the House’s bill, but its imperfections will make our more comprehensive package even more urgent,” Mr. McConnell said. “We aren’t leaving until we deliver it. The Senate will not leave small businesses behind.” Mr. Schumer, however, is calling for Republicans to stop negotiating among themselves and include the White House, himself and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the talks. “Secretary Mnuchin says he wants legislation passed by the end of the week. The McConnell process will not get us there,” he said. Because of the heightened concern of spreading the virus among lawmakers and their staffs, senators will have a 30-minute window to vote, with the leader urging members not to congregate but instead practice social-distancing as they enter and leave the chamber.

"The number of pro-life Democrats are dwindling on Capitol Hill. Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois became the latest casualty of the liberal push to remake the Democratic Party after Marie Newman declared victory over him in the state’s 3rd Congressional District primary race on Tuesday. It gave the far-left activists their first scalp of the 2020 election cycle and means the next Congress could have only three remaining pro-life Democrats. Waleed Shahid, spokesman for Justice Democrats, a liberal progressive group, celebrated Ms. Newman’s victory. “Lipinski opposed Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, abortion, and even opposed a $15 min wage up until 2018,” Mr. Shahid said on Twitter.  “He’s the third incumbent to lose to a @justicedems-backed primary challenger after @AOC and @AyannaPressley’s victories in 2018.” Mr. Lipinski, an eight-term member of Congress, had voted with President Trump 25% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight.com running analysis of votes. Sens. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts were among the high-profile liberal progressives that endorsed Ms. Newman, who tried and failed to defeat Mr. Lipinski in 2018. Pro-life groups lamented the outcome. “Congressman Lipinski has long been a profile in courage, bucking the sad trend of Democrat leaders vying to be the greatest advocate of abortion,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. The other pro-life House Democrats are Reps. Henry Cueller of Texas, who survived a liberal primary challenge earlier this month, Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Ben McAdams of Utah.

"SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) - A recent surge in white nationalism in the U.S. has led to a growing threat of violence by factions that embrace bloodshed and advocate for a race war, according to a report released Wednesday by an organization that tracks far-right extremists. The Southern Poverty Law Center’s annual report on extremist groups said its count of white nationalist groups has risen 55% over the past three years, from 100 in 2017 to 148 in 2018 to 155 in 2019. Many of these white nationalists are embracing “accelerationism,” a fringe philosophy that promotes mass violence to fuel society’s collapse, the law center said. “In their view, political activity is pointless, and escalating violence, on a broad scale, is the only way to bring down the pluralistic, democratic society they want to destroy,” its report says. The Montgomery, Alabama-based law center described another faction of U.S. white nationalism as “mainstreamers,” who often call themselves members of the “dissident right” and are trying to appeal to a wider audience. “Much of the movement’s energy lies in the growing accelerationist wing, which, for the most part, is organized in informal online communities rather than formal groups,” the report says. Over the past few months, the FBI has arrested a string of suspects linked to white supremacist groups, including The Base and Atomwaffen Division, that have advocated for violence and a race war. The man accused of attacking two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, and killing 51 people in March 2019 devoted a section of his manifesto to the concept of accelerationism. “There is little to suggest that the violence that has accompanied the surge in white nationalism in recent years will abate,” the report says. The total number of “hate groups” counted by the law center dropped by about 8%, from a record high of 1,020 in 2018 to 940 last year. But the law center said the decline “does not reflect a significant diminishment of the radical right” given an increased activity among white nationalist groups. The law center said Donald Trump’s first presidential campaign energized white nationalists “who saw him as an avatar of their grievances and their anxiety over the country’s demographic changes.” The conspiracy theory that white people are experiencing a “great replacement” by nonwhite populations is the most powerful force driving far-right extremism, according to the law center.  “Trump didn’t create the fear of nonwhite immigrants but rather harnessed it to win the White House in 2016 and continues to nurture it by fanning the flames of resentment within the most extreme elements of the Republican base,” the report says. White House spokesman Judd Deere said that, while the administration hasn’t seen the law center’s report, “President Trump has repeatedly condemned racism, bigotry, and violence of all forms and his policies have reduced violent crime and made communities safer.” Deere also said the law center is a “far-left smear organization that only wants to libel, slander, and defame this president with its lies.” “Their comments are disgusting, particularly while the president demonstrates unprecedented leadership to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Deere said in an email. Critics have accused the law center of using overly broad criteria to compile its list of hate groups. Some groups on the list have unsuccessfully sued the law center over the designation. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., dismissed a lawsuit  that accused law center leaders of trying to financially destroy one of the organizations that it has labeled as a hate group, the Center for Immigration Studies. A federal judge in Virginia ruled that the First Amendment protected a charity tracking website’s use of the law center’s hate group labels. In 2018, however, the law center apologized to a London-based group, Quilliam, and its founder, Maajid Nawaz, and agreed to pay $3.4 million in an out-of-court settlement after labeling them as anti-Muslim extremists. The law center defines a hate group as an organization that “has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics” and vilifies others because of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.

"Despite Sen. Bernie Sanders‘ lackluster performance since Super Tuesday, the self-professed democratic socialist has beefed up his presence in Joe Biden’s boyhood home state of Pennsylvania. The Vermont lawmaker opened five offices in the key swing state and staffed them with about 20 staffers last week, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Though, the campaign acknowledged offices may be short-lived due to the spread of the coronavirus and the campaign’s transition to digital outreach through virtual rallies and town halls. The Pennsylvania primary is scheduled for April 28, but some states have been moving primary dates to June due to fears of increased transmission COVID-19 in crowded spaces. G. Terry Madonna, the director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College, said it’s unclear if Mr. Sanders will remain in the race given the extension of some primaries despite him lagging behind Mr. Biden by hundreds of delegates in the count towards the Democratic Party’s nomination. “I don’t know if Sanders looks at the change in the primary dates will have some long term meaning for him,” Mr. Madonna said, adding it is “hard to find a way in which he can win. You just can’t find a way.” Fernand Amandi, managing partner of the public opinion research and consulting firm Bendixen & Amandi, echoed Mr. Madonna’s take, noting Mr. Sanders stayed in the race in 2016 longer against Hillary Clinton because he was still winning primaries late in the game. “Bernie has no rationale to continue running whatsoever and he only invites greater scorn,” Mr. Amandi said. “He will get out of the race. The only question is when because every additional day and hour he stays in the race he prevents Joe Biden from formally being able to take control.” After losing the primaries in Illinois, Florida, and Arizona Tuesday, Mr. Sanders’s campaign has said it is re-assessing its efforts.

"President Trump’s attempted truce with the media over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak has ended. After several days of offering unusual praise of the media for covering him fairly, Mr. Trump on Wednesday blasted the press for coverage portraying him as taking the pandemic seriously too late. “The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!” Mr. Trump tweeted. “I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the ‘borders’ from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved.” He also cited his approval ratings, saying they were “not bad considering I get nothing but Fake & Corrupt News, day and night.” On Tuesday, the president had sounded generally pleased with the press coverage of his response to the pandemic. “We’re all in this together, including you, and we want to see fair press,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “And I tell you what: Generally speaking, I think it’s been — it’s been a great thing to see.” On Monday, he said of the press, “I think a lot of the media actually has been very fair.  I think people are pulling together on this.”  ",Trump slams media's coronavirus coverage after days of praise,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/trump-slams-medias-coronavirus-coverage-after-days/,washington_times
"Hillary Clinton accused President Trump of relying on “racist rhetoric” to turn attention away from his bungled response to the coronavirus. The president is turning to racist rhetoric to distract from his failures to take the coronavirus seriously early on, make tests widely available, and adequately prepare the country for a period of crisis. Don’t fall for it. Don’t let your friends and family fall for it. Mr. Trump has been criticized for referring to COVD-19 as the “China virus” and for being too slow to react to the virus. He, however, had had a much different take, giving his response a ten out of ten. I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the “borders” from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!

"President Trump said he is invoking the Defense Production Act in the fight against a coronavirus that’s impacted all 50 states and put the White House on a “wartime” footing. The Korean War-era law gives the president broad authority to “expedite and expand the supply of resources from the U.S. industrial base to support military, energy, space, and homeland security programs,” according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency website. Experts say the U.S. is facing an equipment crunch for things like ventilators and masks. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said his department is making 5 million N95 masks available to health workers, including 1 million immediately, and freeing up 2,000 ventilators from its stockpile. Mr. Trump is also sending the USNS Comfort as a hospital ship to New York state and another ship, USNS Mercy, to a location yet to be named. The president said he is also finding ways to expand the use of “self-swab” tests for the virus that would free up busy health professionals. The U.S. has recorded about 7,300 cases and at least 115 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, although testing is still ramping up across the country. Worldwide, there have been over 200,000 cases and more than 8,200 deaths since the virus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. Mr. Trump said he’s on a wartime footing as Washington explores ways to resuscitate the economy and prop up workers who’ve been furloughed or laid off amid sweeping business closures and plummeting demand for things like flights and hotel rooms. “You have to do things, you have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they’ve ever been,” the president said. The administration said it is rushing sorely needed tests to every corner of the country, though people should not seek one unless they have symptoms. At the same time, Mr. Trump was unable to explain why privileged persons without symptoms, including NBA players, were able to get tests while everyday Americans could not. “Perhaps that’s the story of life,” Mr. Trump said. Moving forward, doctors will be able to operate across state lines so that health systems can share resources, according to Vice President Mike Pence. Officials said they’ll also issue guidelines that formalize their plea for Americans to defer elective surgeries. Deborah Birx, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, said she is concerned by early reports from Italy and France that suggest young adults can be severely impacted by the coronavirus. She said there’s been “a disproportional number of infections” in millennials but not a significant number of deaths in children. For days, she’s implored young Americans to avoid crowded bars and other situations that might spread the virus around. She also said people should try to avoid hard surfaces outside of the home, which may contain the virus. “The level of contagion has been incredible,” Mr. Trump said. The president in February predicted a swift end to the crisis. Now he’s striking a somber tone about the pandemic while calling on Americans to rally to the fight. “We’re all in this together and we’ll come through together,” Mr. Trump said. The president referred to the pathogen as the “Chinese virus” during his briefing.He says the name reflects its origins in Wuhan, but others say it stigmatizes Asians and Asian-Americans. Mr. Trump signaled he doesn’t plan to change his tune, even as a reporter pointed to reports of bias against Chinese Americans. “It comes from China. It’s not racist at all,” Mr. Trump said. “It comes from China. I wanted to be accurate.” The World Health Organization says people should refer to the coronavirus’s disease as “COVID-19.”  ",Trump to invoke Defense Production Act to ramp up supplies,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/trump-invoke-defense-production-act-ramp-supplies/,washington_times
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to pass the House coronavirus bill on Wednesday as his chairmen continue to craft a third package behind the scenes. Mr. McConnell, Kentucky Republican, highlighted “shortcomings” he’s concerned about in the House’s relief package that extends benefits to workers hard hit by the virus, particularly the pressure on small businesses. “This is a time for urgent bipartisan action,” he said. “In this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers.” Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer slammed the Republican leadership for how Wednesday’s vote will unfold. “First, we must dispose of a Republican amendment that would make a condition of the bill a requirement that the president terminates military operations in Afghanistan,” the New York Democrat said. “In a time of national emergency, this Republican amendment is ridiculous,”  he added. Meanwhile looking ahead to the stimulus package, Mr. McConnell is dividing his senators to focus on different priorities for the next stimulus package: getting more money in the public’s pockets, shoring up public health resources and finding ways to support small businesses. He highlighted that many small businesses across the nation are being shuttered to help enforce the social-distancing practices urged by health professionals. Sens. Marco Rubio, chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, and Susan Collins will unveil a $300 billion relief package for these hard-hit companies later Wednesday afternoon. “So we’re going to pass the House’s bill, but its imperfections will make our more comprehensive package even more urgent,” Mr. McConnell said. “We aren’t leaving until we deliver it. The Senate will not leave small businesses behind.” Mr. Schumer, however, is calling for Republicans to stop negotiating among themselves and include the White House, himself and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the talks. “Secretary Mnuchin says he wants legislation passed by the end of the week. The McConnell process will not get us there,” he said. Because of the heightened concern of spreading the virus among lawmakers and their staffs, senators will have a 30-minute window to vote, with the leader urging members not to congregate but instead practice social-distancing as they enter and leave the chamber.

"The number of pro-life Democrats on Capitol Hill is dwindling. Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois became the latest casualty of the liberal push to remake the Democratic Party after Marie Newman declared victory over him in the state’s 3rd Congressional District primary race on Tuesday. It gave the far-left activists their first scalp of the 2020 election cycle and means the next Congress could have only three pro-life Democrats. Waleed Shahid, spokesman for Justice Democrats, a progressive group, celebrated Ms. Newman’s victory. “Lipinski opposed Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, abortion, and even opposed a $15 min wage up until 2018,” Mr. Shahid said on Twitter.  “He’s the third incumbent to lose to a @justicedems-backed primary challenger after @AOC and @AyannaPressley’s victories in 2018.” Mr. Lipinski, an eight-term member of Congress, had voted with President Trump 25% of the time, according to the running analysis of votes by FiveThirtyEight.com. Sens. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts were among the high-profile progressives who endorsed Ms. Newman, who tried and failed to defeat Mr. Lipinski in 2018. Pro-life groups lamented the outcome. “Congressman Lipinski has long been a profile in courage, bucking the sad trend of Democrat leaders vying to be the greatest advocate of abortion,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. The other pro-life House Democrats are Reps. Henry Cueller of Texas, who survived a liberal primary challenge earlier this month, Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Ben McAdams of Utah.

"Recent editorials from Florida newspapers:  ___ March 18 The Orlando Sentinel on how the University of Central Florida is conducting its search for a new president: Florida narrowly dodged a dreadful new law that would have made the search for university presidents secret. The bill died a welcome death on Saturday, thanks to the state Senate. What a relief, until you consider how the University of Central Florida is circumventing the existing Sunshine Law without the Legislature’s help. Six months after UCF started looking for a new president, and less than a week before it was scheduled to pick one, a mystery candidate emerged on Monday. That’s right, a mystery candidate, whose identity was revealed on Wednesday morning as Alexander Cartwright, chancellor of the University of Missouri. After the search committee reviewed his credentials Wednesday morning, and conducted a video interview, they decided he should be a finalist, joining another finalist - Cato Laurencin of the University of Connecticut - whose name has been public since early March. (A third finalist dropped out Wednesday, perhaps sensing the fix is in.) Now, the UCF Board of Trustees is scheduled to make its final choice on Friday. That gives the public - and the trustees - all of 48 hours to figure out if Cartwright is the right person to lead America’s second largest university and one of the region’s most important and influential institutions. And to think we were worried about a proposed law that would have required universities to reveal their finalists for president three weeks ahead of making a selection. This community now has barely two days to take a look at a candidate who may become its next university president. This is an outrageous circumvention of the Florida Sunshine Law, which exists to ensure that records and meetings are open, including university presidential searches. Universities have gotten around the law in the past by hiring headhunting firms to go find candidates and then present a group of finalists to the people who do the picking. Leadership searches in years past by the University of Florida and the University of South Florida were marred by other cloak-and-dagger tactics to keep the public in the dark. From the beginning of this process, however, UCF made noise about getting students, faculty and the public involved in the selection. Beverly Seay, the chair of UCF’s Board of Trustees, promised the selection of a new president would be “inclusive, collaborative and transparent…” Introducing a mystery candidate into the mix 48 hours before picking a president is not our idea of inclusiveness, collaboration or transparency. We also don’t view prior, non-public meetings between the unidentified candidate and search committee members to be in the interest of transparency, either. As much as we’d like to have complete faith in the company UCF hired to recruit candidates - Storbeck/Pimentel & Associates - one of the other finalists it had chosen dropped out after the Fort Worth Star-Telegram unearthed allegations that he had mistreated employees. We’ve heard over and over the reason why universities prefer secret searches - the best candidates may not apply because they don’t want their current employer to know they’re looking around. But as Pamela Marsh of the First Amendment Foundation pointed out on Tuesday, before Cartwright’s identity was revealed, “If the secret inside candidate doesn’t want his current employer to know he’s applied to UCF, that means - prior to the big ‘reveal’ - no one can talk to his prior employer about his recent on-the-job performance. Most people wouldn’t hire a babysitter for their children without talking to prior employers.” The reason UCF is looking for a new president is because the last one, Dale Whittaker, got caught up in a spending scandal. The university can’t afford to get this one wrong, and introducing a candidate at the last minute, without time for a full public vetting, seems a sure-fire way to risk something going wrong. There may be reasons why UCF’s trustees and the firm it hired were willing to go to these lengths to protect Cartwright’s identity. But even if he turns out to be the university president equivalent of a superhero, this isn’t how it’s supposed to work in Florida, where the people in charge are expected to value open government. We teach our college students that rules matter. It’s why they can’t cheat. What is UCF teaching them about the value of rules right now? Online: https://www.orlandosentinel.com/ ___ March 18 The Sarasota Herald-Tribune on Sunshine Week: Ever since a collection of journalists and open-government advocates came up with the bright idea in 2005, Sunshine Week has happened quietly every March. Public response has ranged from respectful nods to dismissive yawns. This year is quite another story. We’re in the middle of Sunshine Week — March 15-21 — at the same time we’re in the throes of a novel coronavirus outbreak that has transformed the free flow of information from and about our leaders into our very lifeblood. Sunshine Week is a national observance of an abstract concept. It’s when pundits, newspaper editorial boards and investigative journalists try to get the public excited about its right to know what our government and political leaders are up to, and how they try to hide it. Unfortunately, this is a right that fails to impress most folks as compelling in times of relative peace, prosperity and tranquility. Government in the sunshine - especially in Florida, where far-sighted landmark legislation on public records access has sustained so many tiny chips and dings that it’s coming to resemble damaged goods - is too often seen as an inconvenience or violation of privacy. One example is the unsuccessful attempt in this year’s legislative session to create a public records exemption that would have made recruitment of state university presidents more confidential and thus, presumably, more selective. This time, wiser heads prevailed. But as with most legislation of this sort, it will likely be back next year. One reason that open-government laws have an image problem is that it’s difficult - and often expensive - to expose the most outrageous and pervasive cultures of secrecy. The more our elected and appointed officials are pressured to practice transparency, the more adept they become at devising new window treatments to shut out the public, and show themselves in a flattering light. Journalists and citizen activists almost daily have to weigh the costs of pursuing tips and hunches against the probable value of what public documents might reveal. So for Floridians, awareness of government in the sunshine is often confined to lawsuits where transparency advocates go after the low-hanging fruit. Local officials who run afoul of open-meeting laws are dragged into court as examples, and wind up costing taxpayers for their relatively innocuous offenses. Holding these low-level culprits to the letter of the law can sometimes obscure the vital importance of its larger spirit. That spirit is in danger of succumbing to a cynical politicization of public opinion that has intensified over the last decade in our state. When it comes to responding to requests for timely and detailed information, Florida’s county-based health departments have been increasingly controlled by the message-crafters in Tallahassee — ratcheted up under the administration of Gov. Rick Scott. Now we are feeling the effects of this self-serving trend. The current coronavirus outbreak is a timely reminder of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis’ nod, more than 100 years ago, to sunlight’s disinfecting properties. Brandeis is thought to have been paraphrasing the British jurist James Bryce, who wrote about government transparency in his 1888 book, “The American Commonwealth.” “Public opinion is a sort of atmosphere, fresh, keen, and full of sunlight, like that of the American cities,” he wrote, “and this sunlight kills many of those noxious germs which are hatched where politicians congregate.” Amen. Online: https://www.palmbeachpost.com/ ___ March 13 The SunSentinel on pregnant women in jail: You may not recognize the name Tammy Jackson. But you know her story. Left alone and abandoned in a Broward jail cell, Jackson gave birth to a daughter last April after seven hours of labor as her anguished cries for help went ignored. The 35-year-old Jackson, who is mentally ill, was in a Pompano Beach jail on a cocaine possession charge and held in isolation because she was pregnant, the sheriff’s office said. This inexcusable neglect was first brought to light last May when the Broward public defender, Howard Finkelstein, describing himself as “incensed and heartbroken,” raised pointed questions in a letter to Sheriff Gregory Tony. The mistreatment of Tammy Jackson forced the Legislature to take action after the case drew outrage across the country and brought demands for a full investigation. Lawmakers were shocked to discover that nothing in state law prevented a pregnant woman from being isolated in jail or held in confinement. Is it really necessary to legislate humanity and decency? Sadly, the answer is yes. A bill headed to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ desk will ensure that pregnant women are afforded basic protections of respect, dignity and humanity behind bars. The bill (SB 1259) is the work of Rep. Shevrin Jones, D-West Park, Rep. Amy Mercado, D-Orlando, and Sen. Jason Pizzo, D-Miami. They received encouragement from many community groups including the Dignity Coalition, a statewide grassroots effort of women who have served time in jail. The simple fact that these long-overdue changes passed both chambers by unanimous votes reflects the level of outrage by policymakers in both political parties and the need for reform. After DeSantis signs the bill into law, it will be illegal to place a pregnant inmate in restrictive housing unless extraordinary circumstances justify it. She must be visited at least once every 24 hours, kept in the least restrictive setting and given an intensive medical treatment plan - none of which took place in Tammy Jackson’s case. The bill includes new restrictions on body cavity searches of pregnant prisoners and prevents officers from using restraints on pregnant inmates if a medical professional requests it, and new rules will require correctional officers to document any extraordinary circumstances. If a prisoner misses her due date, she must be placed in an infirmary and be provided the same privileges as other inmates. The only exception provided for in the bill authorizes a pregnant prisoner to be involuntarily placed in restrictive housing if the corrections official, in consultation with the individual overseeing prenatal care and medical treatment at the correctional institution, determines that an extraordinary circumstance exists such that restrictive housing is necessary and that there are no less restrictive means available. According to a legislative analysis, four to 10 percent of women are pregnant when they go to jail or prison. Their health is often compromised by a lack of prenatal care, poor diet or untreated medical and psychiatric conditions. African-American women like Tammy Jackson are three to four times more likely to suffer pregnancy complications than white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheriff Tony, who was appointed by DeSantis last year, has said that his office and the jail health care provider, Wellpath, have expanded training to all staff members focusing on pregnant inmates, and that two employees were fired and three others received counseling and corrective action plans. According to The New York Times, based on an account provided by Jackson’s lawyers, the inmate was found by jail guards at 10 a.m. last April 10, clutching her newborn daughter. No pregnant woman should give birth alone, especially when she is in custody. And no pregnant woman should ever be placed in solitary confinement, anywhere. It is unsafe. More importantly, it is inhumane. Florida has among the highest incarceration rates in the country for women and men. The legislation will take effect on July 1. It is called the “Tammy Jackson Healthy Pregnancies for Incarcerated Women Act.” Ms. Jackson never wanted any notoriety and her anguished cries for help were callously ignored for too long. Far too late, her cause got the attention she deserved the night she lay alone and in excruciating pain on the cold, hard floor of a Broward jail.

"The Latest on the coronavirus  pandemic, which has infected more than 214,000 people and killed more than 8,700. The COVID-19 illness causes mild or moderate symptoms in most people, but severe symptoms are more likely in the elderly or those with existing health problems. More than 82,000 people have recovered so far, mostly in China. ___ U.S. President Donald Trump says he plans to invoke extraordinary powers to immediately turn back to Mexico anyone who crosses the border illegally. The president says at a White House briefing that he will announce the measure “very soon,” probably later Wednesday. Trump says he isn’t planning a full shutdown of the U.S. border with Mexico but that the powers he will invoke to respond to a health emergency give him “great latitude.” Asked about new restrictions on the Canadian border, the president says he only wants to allow travel that is deemed essential, such as movement related to the medical industry, the military or certain industries. He says some people go back and forth for leisure pursuits, such as going to restaurants, and he wants to end that kind of travel on a temporary basis. ___ Guatemala has airlifted 87 of its citizens who were trapped in Costa Rica and Colombia after it closed its borders to commercial traffic. The foreign ministry says all had their temperature taken and will have to home quarantine back home to avoid potentially spreading Also Wednesday, President Alejandro Giammattei asked lawmakers for a $1 billion budget package to stimulate the Central American nation’s economy. ___ Oregon Gov. Kate Brown says the state will open a temporary 250-bed hospital by Friday on the Oregon State Fairgrounds in Salem.  Oregon purchased the pop-up hospital several years ago for a crisis situation such as this, she said Wednesday. Meanwhile, Oregon officials are working to identify 1,000 temporary beds around the state and patients in hospitals who do not have the new coronavirus, and who are in recovery from other illnesses and procedures, will start to be moved to those beds, Brown said. The state has contracted with a private company for 20,000 test kits and the first batch of 5,000 should arrive soon, said Brown’s chief-of-staff, Nic Blosser. The tests will first be used on frontline healthcare workers, first responders and those living in community-style nursing homes. Brown did not directly address whether or not she would order a shelter-in-place order for the Portland metropolitan area similar to the one underway in San Francisco. ___ Poland’s biggest laboratory that is testing for coronavirus infections says it has suspended activity after one of its scientific employees tested positive for the virus. The employee was not involved in the diagnostic process.  The head of the PZH laboratory in Warsaw, Grzegorz Juszczyk said in a statement Wednesday that people who recently had contact with the employee are being submitted to a quarantine and are waiting for the results of their own tests.  Juszczyk said that three other laboratories in Warsaw are ensuring continuous testing, and there are other laboratories elsewhere in the country. The PZH laboratory will resume work as soon as possible, he said.  A nation of 38 million, Poland has confirmed 287 cases of infection with coronavirus. Five of the patients have died. ___ Portugal’s president is set to declare a state of emergency, granting authorities exceptional powers to help fight the spread of COVID-19. The measure allows the government to place temporary limits on civil liberties, such as freedom of movement and the right to protest, and grants it special powers, including requisitioning private property. The government can also fix prices and stipulate what goods are manufactured. The armed forces can be deployed to enforce the measures. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was due to announce the move in a nationally televised address Wednesday evening. The government and parliament have given their blessing. Portugal on Wednesday reported a total of 642 cases, 194 higher than the previous day, and two deaths. The country has close ties with its neighbor Spain, which is one of the countries most affected by the outbreak. ___ The U.S. Transportation Security Administration reports a ninth case of an airport security screening officer testing positive for the new coronavirus. The ageny said Tuesday that a checked baggage screener at Newark-Liberty International Airport in New Jersey is the most recent. The officer’s last shift was Saturday. The other officers who previously tested positive worked at airports in San Jose, California; Fort Lauderdale and Orlando in Florida; Cleveland and Atlanta. ___ Conservative Republican legislators in Kansas are moving to limit Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s power to address the coronavirus pandemic after she closed the state’s K-12 schools for the rest of the spring semester. Conservatives said Wednesday that Kelly’s action was an overreaction. Kansas has at least 18 confirmed coronavirus cases and one COVID-19-related death. Most infected people recover but some can develop serious problems. They included language from GOP conservatives in a resolution that would extend a state of emergency declared by Kelly last week to prevent her from invoking a state law giving the governor broad powers to act to “promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population.” And at the urging of conservative Republican Sen. Dennis Pyle, of Hiawatha, senators added a provision to prohibit Kelly from confiscating guns. The House must consider the language, but some Republicans there also grumbled about Kelly’s order to close schools ___ Britain is closing all its primary and secondary schools because of the new coronavirus, one of the last countries in Europe to do so. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says schools across England will close after Friday until further notice. The governments of Scotland and Wales have already announced that schools there will close Friday, and schools in Northern Ireland on Wednesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said closing schools is of “limited value” in slowing the spread of the virus but that now is the right time to do it. He said there would be measures to ensure that health care workers and other key staff who are parents can still go to work. The U.N. cultural organization, UNESCO, says that as of late Tuesday, over 850 million children and youth – roughly half of the world’s student population – has to stay away from schools and universities because of the pandemic. ___ Casinos throughout Nevada were closed Wednesday, along with other nonessential businesses, following under an order from Gov. Steve Sisolak. He urged residents to stay home to help curtail the spread of the new coronavirus. The last time casinos closed in Las Vegas was for John F. Kennedy’s funeral on Nov. 25, 1963. Michael Green, a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said he believes this is the first time all Nevada casinos have been closed statewide. On the Las Vegas Strip, vehicle traffic was busy as usual despite gambling having halted at midnight, but pedestrians were scarce. Large orange barricades were placed in front of driveways to the Wynn and Encore casinos, while gates blocked walkways and padlocks and entrances to a nearby shopping mall had been chained and padlocked. Across the street, a chain link fence had been placed in front of the Circus Circus resort. ___ German Chancellor Angela Merkel says not since World War II has the country faced a challenge like the current outbreak of the coronavirus. Merkel on Wednesday night made her first direct TV address to the nation in over 14 years in power, other than her annual New Year’s speech. She called on every person in Germany to help protect those who are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. “Let me tell you: This is serious. Take it seriously too,” Merkel said in her speech that was to be aired on several public and private TV stations starting at 19:15 local time (1818 GMT). An embargoed copy of her speech was given to news agencies for earlier release. Merkel, who is a physicist by training, said that while researchers were working under high pressure to develop a vaccine and medication to treat the new respiratory illness, currently, the slowdown of virus was the only to deal with it. “Germany has an excellent health system, perhaps one of the best in the world,” she said. “But our hospitals, too, would be completely overwhelmed if too many patients would be delivered in too short a time.” ___ China has sent medical supplies to France to help health workers dealing with patients infected by the coronavirus and in need of masks and other protective material. The Chinese Embassy in France tweeted on Wednesday that a batch of supplies has arrived. The supplies include face masks, medical gloves and protective suits. “United we will vanquish,” the tweet concluded. China has sent supplies to Italy, the hardest hit among European countries, and to Spain. France took early action to help China, sending 17 tons of similar supplies in mid-February to Wuhan, where the COVID-19 was first detected. What French officials called a “solidarity” shipment has taken some criticism recently in France, where masks are available with difficulty for the general population. French authorities ordered citizens into confinement this week in an effort to control the virus. As of Tuesday, France registered 7,730 positive cases and 175 deaths. ___ Hungary’s prime minister has announced a series of measures meant to protect jobs and ease the effects of the coronavirus epidemic on the country’s economy. Viktor Orban said Wednesday that employers’ payroll taxes would be eliminated until June 30 in sectors already hard hit by the crisis, including tourism, hotels, entertainment, sports and taxi services. Payroll taxes for employees in those sectors also will be cut significantly. Orban also announced that all existing personal and company loans will be exempt from making principal and interest payments until the end of the year, while interest rates on new consumption loans will be capped . Labor laws will be loosened so “employers and employees can more easily reach agreements,” Orban said. Hungary has 58 confirmed cases of people infected with the new virus, with only one death linked so far to COVID-19, a 75-year-old man who was being treated for pneumonia. ___ Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has announced a 100 billion Turkish lira (US $15.4 billion) relief package in a bid to mitigate the blow from the new coronavirus outbreak. The “Economic Stability Shield” package announced Wednesday includes delaying debt payments, assisting businesses by deferring tax and social security payments and increasing the lowest pensions. Erdogan also urged citizens to adhere to government guidance and to stay at home saying: “we can limit the period of home isolation to three weeks if everyone complies to the measures with sensibility.” Turkey has reported one COVID-19 death and 98 confirmed infections. The country has suspended flights from 20 countries, closed schools and universities and shut down bars, night clubs, cafes, cinemas and gyms among other measures to contain the virus’ spread. ___ Barring a miracle, Italy will surpass China in the number of coronavirus deaths in just one more day. On Wednesday, Italy saw a record new high in the numbers of infections and deaths reported, adding more than 4,200 new cases for a total of 35,713 infections. Another 475 people died, bringing Italy’s death toll to 2,978. China, where the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged late last year, has seen 3,241 deaths, most in the hard-hit central province of Hubei. Italy has an older population than China’s, but only has 60 million people to China’s 1.4 billion people. Medical experts say the new virus is killing people over 65 at a much higher rate than other age groups. ___ A 1,000-bed Navy hospital ship will deploy to New York City to relieve pressure on hospitals treating people with COVID-19.  The ship would accept non-coronavirus patients. The news came Wednesday as New York City-area hospitals are clearing out beds, setting up new spaces to triage patients and urging people with mild symptoms to consult health professionals by phone or video chat instead of flooding emergency rooms.  Those moves come in anticipation of a huge spike in coronavirus patients. Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned that demand for hospital beds could soon outstrip capacity by tens of thousands as the outbreak surges. Virus cases in the state topped 2,300 Wednesday, with at least 20 deaths. ___ Florida now has 314 people testing positive for COVID-19 and six deaths.  Its theme parks and bars and nightclubs and many beaches are closed. An exception Wednesday was Clearwater Beach near Tampa, which was open and packed beneath clear, sunny skies.  Most groups there did seem to be sitting at least six feet (2 meters) apart from other clusters of people, but Sarah Kelley, a St. Louis grocery store section manager, agreed that visiting the beach with her two teenage sons may not have been the best idea.  “It is a great festering Petri dish,” she said. — Coronavirus deaths in the U.S. mirror what’s been reported in other countries, with about 4 out of 5 deaths occurring in people 65 and older and no deaths in kids, according to a new federal report. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the findings on Wednesday, in a look at more than 4,200 U.S. cases reported from Feb. 12 to March 16. Officials had limited information, with data on the ages of about 2,500 of them. Drawing from available information, researchers found about a third of the reported cases were in people 65 and older, but retirement-age Americans made up the bulk of people who suffered severe illness. More than half of coronavirus patients admitted to hospital intensive care units were 65 and older, the CDC reported. No one 19 or under was admitted to an ICU, the CDC said. __ Iceland is aiming to test a higher proportion of its population for the new coronavirus than any other nation in an attempt to find out more about how the COVID-19 disease spreads. The North Atlantic nation, population 360,000, has 250 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with three hospitalizations and no deaths.  Reykjavik-based biopharmaceutical company deCODE Genetics has set up a testing facility capable of gathering 1,000 samples a day and hopes to test 14,000 people – about 4% of Iceland’s population. The company said of 3,700 people tested so far, 0.8% had the virus despite showing little or no symptoms of being ill.  Iceland has quarantined 2,500 people because of possible exposure to the virus. They have been tested and about 10% were found to be infected. Stefánsson said the difference in infection rates between the general population and those in quarantine showed the effectiveness of government’s efforts.  ___ Vice President Mike Pence has called on hospitals to delay all elective procedures across the country to help ensure medical capacity is focused on stemming the spread of the coronavirus. Hospital systems in hard-hit areas, including New York and Washington state, have already begun postponing elective surgeries as they anticipate a need for more hospital beds for people diagnosed with the virus. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he would sign an executive order to postpone all elective surgeries at New York City hospitals so doctors and nurses can focus on treating patients infected with the virus. Pence said the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator Seema Verma will soon be issue federal guidance on elective procedures. — President Donald Trump says he’ll invoke the Defense Production Act to marshal the private sector in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump also says the Department Housing and Urban Development is providing immediate relief to renters and homeowners by suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April.  More than two dozen Senate Democrats have been urging Trump to invoke the Korean War-era law to increase production of needed masks, ventilators and respirators. Use of the law will also help expand hospital capacity to combat the coronavirus. Trump announced at a White House briefing Wednesday that he will sign the papers to invoke the act later in the day. The U.S. has had 116 virus-related deaths and over 7,300 infections. ___ In an unprecedented move during peacetime, the French army has started evacuating critical coronavirus patients from eastern France, the country’s worst hit region by the pandemic. French Defense Minister Florence Parly said six patients were being transferred Wednesday on an Airbus military plane in order to ease the pressure on the local hospitals of Mulhouse and Colmar. They were being moved to military hospitals in southern France. The transfer is expected to be the first of several. In an address Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that a makeshift army hospital will be constructed shortly in eastern France. It will house around 30 intensive care beds. France is Europe’s third worst-hit country in terms of fatalities from COVID-19.

"PHOENIX (AP) - As government officials across the country warn about the dangers of the coronavirus, they’re doing so predominantly in English. They’re potentially not reaching the millions of Spanish speakers in the U.S. who aren’t proficient in English to make sure they know how to stay healthy during a global pandemic. Advocacy groups and Spanish-language media have stepped up to fill in the gaps as cities and states say they’re working to translate guidance about hand washing and the effects of closing schools and businesses into the second-most spoken language in the U.S.  In Arizona, where 30% of residents are Hispanic, the Department of Health Services website offers a page with coronavirus updates - but none of the information is in Spanish. The health department was still translating coronavirus updates, Director Cara Christ said Monday. By Wednesday, there was still no Spanish. No media briefings have been broadcast in Spanish, although health officials have done Spanish-language interviews with Hispanic media.  “This has been a rapidly evolving situation and so things update almost daily,” Christ said. “We are working on getting a lot of our hard materials translated into Spanish and working on getting Spanish in our social media.”  Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a civil rights organization, said he’s not surprised that some states are behind on Spanish-language messaging, especially those like Arizona, where immigrants and Hispanics have faced hostility from laws and raids meant to crack down on illegal immigration. He said Hispanic and immigrant communities already face barriers to health care, including fear of seeking treatment because of their immigration status.  “The lack of bilingual material sort of exacerbates some of those issues that create uneven access to information and services,” Saenz said.  To help, an advocacy group is providing workers at a day labor work center in Pasadena, California, with information in Spanish to help them reduce their risk of infection and be ready in case they get sick or the government orders a lockdown. The National Day Laborer Organizing Network also streamed a radio show on social media dedicated to the virus, addressing hygiene strategies, how to talk with children about the disease and the drastic drop in hirings the center has seen. “I prefer the information in Spanish because it is our language,” said Carlos, a day laborer who was getting information at the center and didn’t want to share his last name out of fear he would be targeted by immigration authorities. “They are advising us on how to act, and how to get ready to face this, especially those of us who have children, so that we don’t take this home because the children are out of school.” Spanish-language media outlet Noticias Telemundo says it’s adding a national weekday newscast focused on the coronavirus. It’s also expanding its morning show and midday newscast to include segments on the virus.  While states have started adding Spanish to their health department websites, it can be hard to find. A day after The Associated Press asked the New Mexico governor’s office about a lack of Spanish on the health department website, it’s Spanish-language site went live and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham tweeted about it in Spanish. A purple-highlighted banner atop the website’s main page has, in small letters, a link to Spanish updates.  The nation’s most Hispanic state also has had a Spanish educator and health official at every news conference to do an interviews with Spanish-language media.  The outreach to Spanish-speaking communities has been mixed. The federal government has done little, but the CDC does have coronavirus information available in Spanish on its website, although it is hard to find.  Critics say it’s taken too long to post updates in Spanish. For example, the CDC’s Spanish-language Twitter account hasn’t tweeted about the coronavirus, instead retweeting a message about the virus from the CDC Environment account Tuesday.  In Hispanic-heavy states like Florida, many news conferences held by state officials have been bilingual, and the state health department has Spanish-speaking agents available round the clock at its coronavirus call center, spokesman Alberto Moscoso said. Washington state, which has had the most deaths in the U.S., has information and news releases posted in both English and Spanish on its health department website. Health officials there are working with a translation firm and with independent translators to get the word out in over 40 languages, spokeswoman Kathleen Meehan said.  Meehan added that it’s the first time the state health department created a community engagement task force to address things like language barriers. And while government officials have had to communicate in other languages before, such as during wildfires, the virus outbreak is unprecedented, she said.  “Our messaging isn’t effective if people can’t understand it,” Meehan said.  In the California wine region of Sonoma County, officials are giving news updates in both languages, broadcasting them on Facebook Live.  And in El Paso, Texas, where roughly 80% of residents are Hispanic, authorities have conducted news conferences in both languages. Mayor Dee Margo posts updates in Spanish and English to his official Facebook page.  Raquel Terán, an Arizona lawmaker and longtime community activist, said she asked state officials two weeks ago whether information would be delivered in Spanish. Now, as the warnings ramp up - state officials have closed all schools and continue to urge people to stay home - messaging in more than just English is essential, Terán said.  She said the state should hire Spanish translators, noting that although not all Hispanics speak Spanish, many do.  The community wants “to hear a trusted voice,” Terán said. “They want the trusted messenger in Spanish. That’s the reality.” ___ Garcia Cano reported from Washington.

"President Trump challenged a journalist on Wednesday after she accused an unnamed White House staffer of describing the coronavirus as the “Kung flu.” PBS Newshour reporter Yamiche Alcindor told Mr. Trump that “at least one White House official” had used the term, and asked him if it was wrong. “I wonder who said that,” the president replied evenly. “Do you know who said that?” “I’m not sure the person’s name,” Ms. Alcindor answered. “Say the term again,” Mr. Trump demanded. “A person at the White House used the term ‘Kung flu,’” she repeated. “Kung flu?” Mr. Trump asked. “Kung flu,” she said. “Do you think the term is wrong? And do you think using the term ‘Chinese virus’ puts Asian Americans at risk, that people will target them?” “No, not at all,” the president said, addressing her second question. “I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There’s nothing not to agree [with].” Mr. Trump then turned to the assembled reporters and said, “Okay, how about last question?” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway chided reporters who asked her about an anonymous official allegedly using the term “Kung flu.” “Excuse me!” Mrs. Conway said. “Of course it’s wrong. But you can’t just make an accusation and not tell us who it is.” A Trump campaign official, Andrew Clark, tweeted after the briefing that he “cannot stress enough how tone deaf these questions sound to literally anyone outside the press briefing room.”  ",Trump spars with reporter over accusation that staffer called coronavirus 'Kung flu'," -

"The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday slammed the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying the president has sought to “downplay” the significance of the spread. Sen. Jack Reed argued that the U.S. is behind in its approach to combating COVID-19 and pointed to the president’s stated intention to invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) which the Rhode Island Democrat said should have already been put to use. “Instead of preparing and mobilizing for this pandemic, President Trump tried to downplay it,” Mr. Reed said in a statement. “As a result, America is not as ready as we should be.” He acknowledged that the administration has taken some steps necessary to coordinate an effective response, but we’ve “got to do more.” Mr. Trump said earlier on the day he is invoking the DPA in the fight against a coronavirus that, as of Tuesday evening, has impacted all 50 states and put the White House on a “wartime” footing. The Korean War-era law gives the president broad authority to “expedite and expand the supply of resources from the U.S. industrial base to support military, energy, space and homeland security programs,” according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency website. On Tuesday, Mr. Reed urged the president to invoke the DPA and mobilize the authorities permitted by the act to alleviate stresses on the healthcare system and respond to the pandemic. “Invoking the DPA is a step in the right direction that will enable the federal government to team up with the private sector to increase the availability of needed health supplies,” he said.

"Recent editorials of statewide and national interest from Pennsylvania’s newspapers: Sunshine week reminds citizens they have a right to know what officials are up to Harrisburg Patriot News/Pennlive.com March 13 Just in time for the nationwide observance of Sunshine Week, the Pennsylvania Legislature has given us an unequivocal reminder (no irony intended, just business as usual) of why we must keep the spotlight of public scrutiny trained unrelentingly on our government. Sunshine Week, March 15-21, sponsored by several news media organizations, calls attention to the importance of government openness and accountability, and reminds citizens of the laws that ensure public access: the Sunshine (open meetings) Act and the Pennsylvania Right to Know Act. But having laws to ensure openness doesn’t guarantee it-especially, it seems, in Pennsylvania. It takes constant vigilance by citizens and journalists. Recent bad behavior by self-anointed secrecy zealots in the Legislature reminds us of that. Two media organizations, The Caucus and Spotlight PA, requested records to uncover how the Pennsylvania Legislature-the country’s largest full-time legislature-spends $360 million a year in tax dollars. The officials’ response: The House provided expense records with many redactions. When the news organizations asked for additional records, the House continued to black out expense details. At first, Senate officials also blacked out expense details. But when the news organizations submitted a new request, officials took the unprecedented step of deletingthousands of expense explanations as though they’d never existed, without acknowledging they’d done so. The expense redactions and deletions provoked protest, not only from the media, but also from many legislators, for whom the arrogance and shamelessness of the move were too much. On March 5, the House relented. Officials restored many of the redacted expense details and said they would provide more information soon. The news organizations are still pursuing the complete Senate expense records. We don’t have room to include all the damning details here, but the redactions/deletions were little more than blatant attempts to skirt the Right to Know to hide what so far looks like totally innocuous information. For example, according to Spotlight PA, information initially blacked out on a $73.31 breakfast meeting during state budget negotiations had simply stated that staffers met with “Senate leadership” to discuss the “voting calendar for the week of 6/5/2017.” Trivial things are often covered up simply as a power exercise or worse, to inure us to larger future coverups. As PBS journalist Bill Moyers said, “Secrecy is the freedom zealots dream of … The secret government has no constitution. The rules it follows are the rules it makes up.” Pennsylvania lawmakers have long been “making it up,” by skirting the law requiring public access to information. The problem now readily apparent is that public officials who routinely operate outside the law undermine the credibility essential to enlisting public support and trust during crises such as the one we now face with coronavirus. That’s why “sunshine” in government matters. Online: https://bit.ly/2UeZbpa ___ Local dirt-track programs sent wrong message, should not have been held York Dispatch March 18 Look, we get it. No one likes to be cooped up inside for days on end, especially when the weather is nice. That’s especially true in times of crisis, when we are all in desperate need of distractions. The torrent of bad news, combined with the fact that we can’t leave our homes to get away from it, can certainly lead to anxiety and depression. Still, the prudent thing to do during the coronavirus pandemic is be overly cautious, not obstinately cavalier. That’s why the decisions of three area dirt tracks (Lincoln, Port Royal and Williams Grove speedways) to hold racing programs over the weekend were the wrong moves. Yes, the regional tracks had the right to race. At the time, there was no government mandate to ban racing programs. Early this week, however, Gov. Tom Wolf “strongly urged” the shuttering of all nonessential businesses. That would certainly include the dirt tracks, although Wolf has also said he would not force the tracks to shut down. Nevertheless, racing over the weekend sent the wrong message. Future racing would send an even worse message. Need for social distancing: Nearly all of our health experts are preaching about the absolute necessity of social distancing. That’s pretty hard to achieve when fans are sitting side by side in the grandstands while watching cars go roaring around a dirt track. In fact, Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that sporting events and other large gatherings of 50 or more be called off for the next eight weeks. There were certainly more than 50 people at each of the regional tracks. There were at least hundreds of folks at each of the facilities - maybe thousands. The arguments from the racing folks: We know the arguments that are coming from the folks who attended the races. It’s a free country and we had the right to go. The conronavirus outbreak hasn’t hit this region yet and has been overstated. We’re only endangering ourselves. Countering the arguments: They are right about the first point. It’s a free country and they had the right to go, but we really don’t know if the coronavirus has hit the region yet. Not everyone in the region who is sick has been tested. In fact, it’s very likely there are coronavirus victims in our midst and we just don’t know about them yet, and there will almost certainly be coronavirus victims detected here very soon. Finally, the folks at the track were not endangering just themselves. If they were infected with the coronavirus at the track, they would be exposing everyone they met after they left the track with the disease. That would most definitely include those nearest and dearest to those race fans - their friends and family members. That is simply not right. Your freedom to unencumbered assembly ends when you start putting the health of others at risk. Independent breed: Race-car fans and drivers are a hardy and independent sort. The drivers are certainly not risk-averse. And the fans and drivers definitely don’t like anyone telling them what to do. Many of the folks at the track probably feel that the extent of the outbreak has been vastly overstated and that we, as a nation, are in panic mode. That may very well be true, but in a situation such as this, we must err on the side of caution. Going against the tide in the sports world: The rest of the organized sports world seems to understand that. Nearly every national and local event was shut down over the weekend. That includes auto racing organizations such as NASCAR, IndyCar and the World of Outlaws. In fact, only five race tracks reportedly held programs nationally last weekend and three of them were in central Pennsylvania. The dirt-track fans in the stands this past weekend would likely look at that fact with pride - proof that they are unafraid of some pesky virus. They would be wrong. We should all be afraid and we should all be cautious.

An analysis of state responses to the crisis, by the financial services site WalletHub, found that Pennsylvania has the 21st-most aggressive program among the states. It’s an aggregate rank based on prevention and containment (22), reducing risk factors and quality of health care infrastructure (25), and limiting the financial impact (33). But the state is a laggard regarding funding for health care emergency preparedness, at 47th among the states in per-resident spending. That continues a long downward trend. Last July, a State Health Access Data Assistance Center analysis found that Pennsylvania ranked 45th among the states in health care spending per person, $13, through the end of 2017. The national average at that time was $36 per resident. It reached $13 per resident after a long, steady decline from 2005, when Pennsylvania spent $29 per resident on public health. (This year the state Department of Health received a modest budget increase, from $199 million to $203 million.) As the Wolf administration orchestrates its short-term response to the current crisis, it is not too early for lawmakers to commit themselves to making public health preparedness a higher priority. And for all the rhetoric about government priorities, the surest proof of those priorities is in the budget. Online: https://bit.ly/2xS2onj ___ Fare breaks are great, but SEPTA’s funding future still cloudy The Philadelphia Inquirer March 16 Mass transit advocates cheered last week when SEPTA announced a spending plan offering cheaper rides for many users of the system, which moves nearly half a million people daily around the Philadelphia region. As outlined in SEPTA’s proposed $1.5 billion budget for fiscal year 2021, the changes include: holding base fares at $2.50; making first transfers free for many riders; and cutting fares for kids between 5 and 11 years old. The new fare schedule aims to boost ridership as the project to revamp the 125-route bus network and its connections with subways, trolleys, and Regional Rail lines gets rolling this year. Given the 2019 PEW study’s finding that using SEPTA is often more expensive than transit in comparable cities, especially for low-income people, the agency’s focus on equity is admirable and necessary. SEPTA expects to make up the resulting $9 million annual revenue loss by cutting expenses elsewhere, without cutting service. But a far more significant budget concern looms: We’re less than two years away from the loss of $450 million in state funding for SEPTA that mostly comes from Pennsylvania Turnpike revenue, which is set to expire in 2022. That could put at risk SEPTA’s efforts to continue modernizing a 2,200-square-mile system that, flaws and all, is more essential to the economy of the city, the region, and the state than ever. SEPTA derives 37% of its revenue from fares. After decades of political wrangling that pitted Philadelphia-area elected officials against the rest of Pennsylvania, state legislatures in 2007 and 2012 wisely moved to stabilize operational and capital funding - though bashing SEPTA’s need for state subsidies has long been a tradition in Harrisburg. The 2012 legislation expires in 2022. Meaning that $450 million - an amount that’s helped double the agency’s capital budget - would have to come from the state’s general fund. This prospect is so unlikely that the transit agency and other stakeholders already are organized and lobbying to find alternatives. Among them: Fees for users of ride-sharing services like Uber, direct funding by the four suburban Pennsylvania counties served by SEPTA, congestion pricing, and other fees and taxes are under review by the group of stakeholders. The Southeast Partnership for Mobility, a three-agency transportation collaborative group, is officially agnostic about what proposals are most feasible. But the report it released last May cites options that would generate revenue through new taxes and fees. Such legislation also would authorize Philadelphia and the four counties to issue bonds to fund SEPTA capital improvements. Elected officials across Pennsylvania ought to recognize that capital improvements are not just essential for replacing antiquated infrastructure, such as the Crum Creek Viaduct in Delaware County. Modernizing the trolley system, redesigning the bus network, buying new rolling stock - including hybrid and electric buses - will help make SEPTA relevant for its ridership and, therefore, more likely to be economically sustainable. The improvements are an investment in capacity, and in an economic future that will depend on the mobility mass transit makes possible. When it comes to funding SEPTA, partisanship and parochialism ought to take a backseat. Online: https://bit.ly/33qrvJu ___ What are essential businesses in Pa.? Pittsburgh Tribune-Review March 17 What does “essential” mean? It’s a question everyone needs to ask after Gov. Tom Wolf’s announcement Monday that essential businesses in Pennsylvania need to close in response to the coronavirus pandemic. “We strongly urge nonessential businesses across the commonwealth to do their part by temporarily closing as we work to flatten the curve and protect the health and safety of all Pennsylvanians,” Secretary of Community and Economic Development Dennis Davin said in a statement released by the governor’s office. Of course, there are businesses that the state sees as essential. Health care is at the top of that list. The tech services that make all the remote work being done possible. Grocery stores and gas stations. Banking and trash collection and agriculture. That makes sense. If our world is a machine - like a car - then to keep it on the road, we need the absolute basics. The tires, the engine, the transmission, the brakes. But we shouldn’t think of our entire workforce in terms of “essential” and “nonessential.” We are about to see in stark terms exactly how necessary those less-urgently-necessary jobs are - both for the people who do them and the people who depend upon them. Within days, we will all probably be desperate for a pizza at our favorite local joint. A beer with friends. A movie with someone special. A concert so loud and crowded we feel the music more than we hear it. We will have stocked our homes with enough pasta and canned goods to last weeks, but will hunger to take our kids to the Carnegie Science Center. PNC Park may have a lot of empty seats over a normal summer, but as we approach what should be baseball season, people will start to think wistfully of ballpark hot dogs. No one has a nonessential job because our lives aren’t just about essentials. We need more than food, water, clothing and shelter. We need chipped ham and the Steelers and the morning paper and an evening glass of wine and birthday parties and holidays and other people to share it all. And that’s reflected in our economy. Closing businesses will hurt us all - not just the businesses locking their doors. It means that people who can’t pay their bills won’t pay their bills, which affects people in a domino chain that shows how essential all those nonessential businesses are. It isn’t going to be easy to just go with the stripped-down chassis of either our economy or our day-to-day lives. But it isn’t being done lightly or because it’s easy to strip out our morning coffee shop stop or cheering on the Penguins at a neighborhood sports bar. “We understand that businesses are an economic driver throughout Pennsylvania, and a temporary closure will be a financial and community disruptor. DCED is committed to working with the business community to provide helpful resources for financial assistance,” said Davin. It’s because the most essential part of our world and our economy are our people. We have to protect each other.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio often don’t see eye to eye — a trend that has spilled over to their respective responses to the coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Cuomo reiterated Wednesday that he is opposed to a strict “shelter in place” policy for New York cities and said the public should take a deep breath about  “rumors” such as people won’t be allowed to leave their homes. “That’s not going to happen,’” he said. Mr. de Blasio, meanwhile, said Wednesday that residents in his city should prepare for a “shelter in place” program while acknowledging that such a policy could only happen in concert with the state. “Get ready for the possibility,” Mr. de Blasio said on NBC. “It’s a decision we would only make with the state of New York, of course. “If we even get to shelter in place, we’re going to have to come up with huge new approaches to make sure that people have enough food and medicine, because they sure as hell don’t have income right now,” he said. The phrase is a bit nebulous, but San Francisco County and several other jurisdictions in California have adopted strict standards where people are generally restricted from leaving their homes except for essential services. Mr. Cuomo spoke about a scheme where food systems, health care systems and transportation services would be shut down. “It depends how you do it,” Mr. Cuomo said. “And you close down businesses when you do shelter in place.

"President Trump said his proposed $1 trillion economic rescue package for the coronavirus will “help everybody” in the country. “We have to help everybody,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. “It was nobody’s fault — certainly none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers, planes that had no passengers and cruise ships. They can’t be blamed for this. We want to keep those companies vibrant.” He said the administration is still looking at direct payments to most Americans. Under the proposal, checks of $1,000 or more could be sent out to people around April 6 and again around May 18. The cost to the government would be about $500 billion for the direct payments. “We’re talked about those numbers, and we’re also moving those numbers in both directions,” the president said, cautioning that no decisions have been made. The Treasury Department said the cash payouts would be means-tested, meaning the amounts would be based on income level and family size. Treasury’s written rescue plan calls for an airline industry bailout of $50 billion in secured loans to passenger and cargo carriers. Limits would be placed on executive pay increases until the loans were repaid. Another $150 billion would go to other affected industries in secured loans or loan guarantees. This group would likely include hotels and cruise lines. The plan also includes $300 billion for small-business interruption loans for companies with fewer than 500 employees. Recipients would have to keep paying all their employees for eight weeks from the date of the loan. The government would guarantee 100% of payroll for six weeks, capped at $1,540 per week per employee.  ",Trump says $1 trillion coronavirus relief package will 'help everybody'," -

"SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) - Police in Bulgaria say a well-known investigative journalist has been attacked by unknown assailants near his home in Sofia. Police said Wednesday that three men wearing masks used metal bars to beat Slavi Angelov, editor-in-chief of the weekly newspaper 168 Hours, and he was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. Angelov is known for his investigative reporting on political and environmental corruption issues. The assailants did not take any of Angelov’s possessions, and investigators are examining if the attack was linked to his reporting, police said. Other journalists and human rights groups called for a swift and thorough investigation. The media freedom representative for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Harlem Desir, said in a statement that Angelov was beaten unconscious and had a leg broken during the attack, which one of the masked assailants filmed.  “This is an unacceptable act of intimidation against the journalist, which could have ended in his death,” Desir said. “Such an attack against the press cannot be tolerated.” The assault took place as media freedom has been losing ground in Bulgaria, Desir said.

The reports about Mr. Sanders’ ending his bid spiked online Wednesday after the news website Axios sent out a breaking news alert that said he was suspending his campaign, which other outlets, including Fox Business, picked up. Axios later issued a correction and tweaked the headline to indicate that Mr. Sanders had suspended some Facebook ads. Following the results Tuesday, the Sanders campaign said the 78-year-old is reassuring his campaign.

"BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Legislation banning affirmative action for state agencies, state contracting and public education headed to the Idaho governor’s desk on Wednesday. The House voted 56-14 to approve the legislation that has already passed the Senate. The Senate amended the bill to avoid losing federal funding, meaning the House had to approve the amended version. The legislation adds a new section to laws that opponents say negates another section prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or age.  Backers say the measure is needed so that everybody will be treated equally. Opponents say Idaho has a history of discriminatory behavior against marginalized groups that persists, and the measure would allow that behavior to continue.

"SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) - A recent surge in white nationalism in the U.S. has led to a growing threat of violence by factions that embrace bloodshed and advocate for a race war, according to a report released Wednesday by an organization that tracks far-right extremists. The Southern Poverty Law Center’s annual report on extremist groups said its count of white nationalist groups has risen 55% over the past three years, from 100 in 2017 to 148 in 2018 to 155 in 2019. Many of these white nationalists are embracing “accelerationism,” a fringe philosophy that promotes mass violence to fuel society’s collapse, the law center said. “In their view, political activity is pointless, and escalating violence, on a broad scale, is the only way to bring down the pluralistic, democratic society they want to destroy,” its report says. The Montgomery, Alabama-based law center described another faction of U.S. white nationalism as “mainstreamers,” who often call themselves members of the “dissident right” and are trying to appeal to a wider audience. “Much of the movement’s energy lies in the growing accelerationist wing, which, for the most part, is organized in informal online communities rather than formal groups,” the report says. Over the past few months, the FBI has arrested a string of suspects linked to white supremacist groups, including The Base and Atomwaffen Division, that have advocated for violence and a race war. The man accused of attacking two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, and killing 51 people in March 2019 devoted a section of his manifesto to the concept of accelerationism. “There is little to suggest that the violence that has accompanied the surge in white nationalism in recent years will abate,” the report says. The total number of “hate groups” counted by the law center dropped by about 8%, from a record high of 1,020 in 2018 to 940 last year. But the law center said the decline “does not reflect a significant diminishment of the radical right” given an increased activity among white nationalist groups. The law center said Donald Trump’s first presidential campaign energized white nationalists “who saw him as an avatar of their grievances and their anxiety over the country’s demographic changes.” The conspiracy theory that white people are experiencing a “great replacement” by nonwhite populations is the most powerful force driving far-right extremism, according to the law center.  “Trump didn’t create the fear of nonwhite immigrants but rather harnessed it to win the White House in 2016 and continues to nurture it by fanning the flames of resentment within the most extreme elements of the Republican base,” the report says. White House spokesman Judd Deere said that, while the administration hasn’t seen the law center’s report, “President Trump has repeatedly condemned racism, bigotry, and violence of all forms and his policies have reduced violent crime and made communities safer.” Deere also said the law center is a “far-left smear organization that only wants to libel, slander, and defame this president with its lies.” “Their comments are disgusting, particularly while the president demonstrates unprecedented leadership to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Deere said in an email. In November, the law center reported on emails that White House senior adviser Stephen Miller sent to editors at far-right Breitbart News in 2015 and 2016. The emails revealed that Miller was ”steeped in white nationalist literature and ideas,” the law center says. “It’s clear that this administration continues to invite hate into the halls of power,” law center spokeswoman Lecia Brooks said Wednesday on a conference call with reporters. Critics have accused the law center of using overly broad criteria to compile its list of hate groups. Some groups on the list have unsuccessfully sued the law center over the designation. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., dismissed a lawsuit  that accused law center leaders of trying to financially destroy one of the organizations that it has labeled as a hate group, the Center for Immigration Studies. A federal judge in Virginia ruled that the First Amendment protected a charity tracking website’s use of the law center’s hate group labels. In 2018, however, the law center apologized to a London-based group, Quilliam, and its founder, Maajid Nawaz, and agreed to pay $3.4 million in an out-of-court settlement after labeling them as anti-Muslim extremists. The law center defines a hate group as an organization that “has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics” and vilifies others because of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.

"Despite Sen. Bernie Sanders‘ lackluster performance since Super Tuesday, the self-professed democratic socialist has beefed up his presence in Joe Biden’s boyhood home state of Pennsylvania. The Vermont lawmaker opened five offices in the key swing state and staffed them with about 20 staffers last week, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. The campaign acknowledged, though, that offices may be short-lived due to the spread of the coronavirus and the campaign’s transition to digital outreach through virtual rallies and town halls. The Pennsylvania primary is scheduled for April 28, but some states have been moving primary dates to June due to fears of increased transmission COVID-19 in crowded spaces. G. Terry Madonna, the director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College, said it’s unclear if Mr. Sanders will remain in the race given the extension of some primaries despite him lagging behind Mr. Biden by hundreds of delegates in the count towards the Democratic Party’s nomination. “I don’t know if Sanders looks at the change in the primary dates will have some long term meaning for him,” Mr. Madonna said, adding it is “hard to find a way in which he can win. You just can’t find a way.” Fernand Amandi, managing partner of the public opinion research and consulting firm Bendixen & Amandi, echoed Mr. Madonna’s take, noting Mr. Sanders stayed in the race in 2016 longer against Hillary Clinton because he was still winning primaries late in the game. “Bernie has no rationale to continue running whatsoever and he only invites greater scorn,” Mr. Amandi said. “He will get out of the race. The only question is when because every additional day and hour he stays in the race he prevents Joe Biden from formally being able to take control.” After losing the primaries in Illinois, Florida, and Arizona Tuesday, Mr. Sanders’s campaign has said it is re-assessing its efforts.

"The number of pro-life Democrats on Capitol Hill is dwindling. Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois became the latest casualty of the liberal push to remake the Democratic Party after Marie Newman declared victory over him in the state’s 3rd Congressional District primary race on Tuesday. It gave the far-left activists their first scalp of the 2020 election cycle and means the next Congress could have only three pro-life Democrats. Waleed Shahid, spokesman for Justice Democrats, a progressive group, celebrated Ms. Newman’s victory. “Lipinski opposed Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, abortion, and even opposed a $15 min wage up until 2018,” Mr. Shahid said on Twitter.  “He’s the third incumbent to lose to a @justicedems-backed primary challenger after @AOC and @AyannaPressley’s victories in 2018.” Mr. Lipinski, an eight-term member of Congress, had voted with President Trump 25% of the time, according to the running analysis of votes by FiveThirtyEight.com. Sens. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts were among the high-profile progressives who endorsed Ms. Newman, who tried and failed to defeat Mr. Lipinski in 2018. Pro-life groups lamented the outcome. “Congressman Lipinski has long been a profile in courage, bucking the sad trend of Democrat leaders vying to be the greatest advocate of abortion,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. The other pro-life House Democrats are Reps. Henry Cueller of Texas, who survived a liberal primary challenge earlier this month, Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Ben McAdams of Utah.

"The Senate passed the second coronavirus relief package ramping up benefits for workers hard hit by the economic aftershocks on Wednesday, sending it to the president’s desk for approval. The bill passed on a 90-8 vote. Before passage, the Senate defeated three amendments that would have sent the bill back to the House, which is currently out on recess. Democrats wanted to shore up paid leave benefits in the package, while Republicans were pushing for more support to small businesses under immense pressure to provide those benefits. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged his colleague’s concerns with the package but urged them to address those issues in a third economic bill that lawmakers are still working to craft. “In this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,” he said before the vote. The bill mandates free testing for the coronavirus, funds more unemployment programs and pays for sick leave for those that contract the virus or need to care for someone that does if they work for a company with a cap of 500 employees. It also shores up food security programs for vulnerable communities, like the elderly and children and bolsters state Medicaid programs so health providers can handle an influx of patients. A corrected version passed the House Monday evening, tweaking paid leave provisions. Though there is still no official price tag on the house bill, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it will cost nearly $105 billion.  ",Senate passes second coronavirus relief package ," -

"Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld ended his long-shot primary challenge to President Trump on Wednesday, a day after Mr. Trump racked up enough delegates to officially clinch the 2020 Republican nomination. “While I am suspending my candidacy, I want to be clear that I am not suspending my commitment to our nation and to the democratic institutions that set us apart,” Mr. Weld said. Mr. Weld, the Libertarian Party’s 2016 vice presidential nominee, never posed a serious threat to Mr. Trump as the president cruised to easy wins in states where Republicans didn’t cancel or curtail their nominating contests. He was one of three prominent GOP primary challengers to Mr. Trump, though none of them could muster much momentum against the unquestioned leader of the Republican Party. Former Rep. Joe Walsh ended his bid in February, shortly after the Iowa caucuses. Former Rep. Mark Sanford pulled the plug on his campaign in November after announcing in September he would enter the race.

"President Trump challenged a journalist on Wednesday after she accused an unnamed White House staffer of describing the coronavirus as the “Kung flu.” PBS Newshour reporter Yamiche Alcindor told Mr. Trump that “at least one White House official” had used the term, and asked him if it was wrong. “I wonder who said that,” the president replied evenly. “Do you know who said that?” “I’m not sure the person’s name,” Ms. Alcindor answered. “Say the term again,” Mr. Trump demanded. “A person at the White House used the term ‘Kung flu,’” she repeated. “Kung flu?” Mr. Trump asked. “Kung flu,” she said. “Do you think the term is wrong? And do you think using the term ‘Chinese virus’ puts Asian Americans at risk, that people will target them?” “No, not at all,” the president said, addressing her second question. “I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There’s nothing not to agree [with].” Mr. Trump then turned to the assembled reporters and said, “Okay, how about last question?” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway chided reporters who asked her about an anonymous official allegedly using the term “Kung flu.” “Excuse me!” Mrs. Conway said. “Of course it’s wrong. But you can’t just make an accusation and not tell us who it is.” A Trump campaign official, Andrew Clark, tweeted after the briefing that he “cannot stress enough how tone deaf these questions sound to literally anyone outside the press briefing room.”  ",Trump spars with reporter over accusation that staffer called coronavirus 'Kung flu',"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/trump-spars-reporter-over-accusation-staffer-calle/,washington_times
"President Trump said his proposed $1 trillion economic rescue package for the coronavirus will “help everybody” in the country. “We have to help everybody,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. “It was nobody’s fault — certainly none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers, planes that had no passengers and cruise ships. They can’t be blamed for this. We want to keep those companies vibrant.” He said the administration is still looking at direct payments to most Americans. Under the proposal, checks of $1,000 or more could be sent out to people around April 6 and again around May 18. The cost to the government would be about $500 billion for the direct payments. “We’re talked about those numbers, and we’re also moving those numbers in both directions,” the president said, cautioning that no decisions have been made. The Treasury Department said the cash payouts would be means-tested, meaning the amounts would be based on income level and family size. Treasury’s written rescue plan calls for an airline industry bailout of $50 billion in secured loans to passenger and cargo carriers. Limits would be placed on executive pay increases until the loans were repaid. Another $150 billion would go to other affected industries in secured loans or loan guarantees. This group would likely include hotels and cruise lines. The plan also includes $300 billion for small-business interruption loans for companies with fewer than 500 employees. Recipients would have to keep paying all their employees for eight weeks from the date of the loan. The government would guarantee 100% of payroll for six weeks, capped at $1,540 per week per employee.

"President Trump’s attempted truce with the media over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak has ended. After several days of offering unusual praise of the media for covering him fairly, Mr. Trump on Wednesday blasted the press for coverage portraying him as taking the pandemic seriously too late. He also challenged a journalist after she accused an unnamed White House staffer of describing the coronavirus as the “kung flu,” and dismissed repeated questions from reporters of alleged racism. “The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!” Mr. Trump tweeted. “I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the ‘borders’ from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved.” On camera, Mr. Trump seemed to be trying not to take the bait when reporters repeatedly asked if he was being “racist” for calling the virus “the Chinese virus.” The virus originated in Wuhan, China. “It’s not racist at all,” Mr. Trump said. “It comes from China.” PBS Newshour reporter Yamiche Alcindor told Mr. Trump that “at least one White House official” had used the term, and asked him if it was wrong. “I wonder who said that,” the president replied evenly. “Do you know who said that?” “I’m not sure the person’s name,” Ms. Alcindor answered. “Say the term again,” Mr. Trump demanded. “A person at the White House used the term ‘kung flu,’” she repeated. “Kung flu?” Mr. Trump asked. “Kung flu,” she said. “Do you think the term is wrong? And do you think using the term ‘Chinese virus’ puts Asian Americans at risk, that people will target them?” “No, not at all,” the president said, addressing her second question. “I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There’s nothing not to agree [with].” Said one White House staffer, “Any leader in this situation would want to project calm. We have something huge that we’re dealing with right now. He’s pushing back [with the media] where necessary. It’s a balance.” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway chided reporters who asked her about an anonymous official allegedly using the term “kung flu.” “Excuse me!” Mrs. Conway said. “Of course it’s wrong. But you can’t just make an accusation and not tell us who it is.” A Trump campaign official, Andrew Clark, tweeted after the briefing that he “cannot stress enough how tone deaf these questions sound to literally anyone outside the press briefing room.” White House aides also expressed frustration with the media’s priorities. One staffer called the questions about racism “petty and counterproductive.” “This [calling it the ‘Wuhan virus’] is not something that the left media hasn’t used,” the aide said. The developments quickly ended what might have qualified as a brief era of good feelings for Mr. Trump with the media. On Tuesday, the president had sounded generally pleased with the press coverage of his response to the pandemic. “We’re all in this together, including you, and we want to see fair press,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “And I tell you what: Generally speaking, I think it’s been — it’s been a great thing to see.” On Monday, he said of the press, “I think a lot of the media actually has been very fair.  I think people are pulling together on this.” The White House aide said Mr. Trump had been “trying to get them [the media] to work with us.” Several aides have noted that even Democratic governors who have been openly hostile to Mr. Trump, and vice versa, such as Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, have been largely complimentary of the president and cooperative in the crisis. “Even these people, who are so politically divided most of the time, can come together,” an aide said. But with the media, the president seemed to be back at a combative square one. The last question at the president’s coronavirus briefing came from a journalist who told the president that even “before the pandemic, there were a lot of Americans that were already alienated. We saw depths of despair increasing through suicide and other things.” With those same despondent Americans now self-isolating from the virus, he asked Mr. Trump, what was his message to them? “To those Americans who are going through a lot, we love them, we’re with them and we will not let them down,” Mr. Trump said.

"The vaunted U.S. military-industrial machine is venturing into the unknown as the coronavirus continues its spread across the country, sector leaders said Wednesday, with the global pandemic threatening to slow down innovation and disrupt key supply chains. Amid grumbling from some in the private sector, Pentagon officials and military contractors insist they have been in daily communication as they seek ways to keep the industry fully up and running and to ensure the Defense Department has access to the equipment it needs to protect U.S. national security. Top Pentagon officials this week instituted daily meetings with industry leaders, and military officials told reporters Wednesday that so far the coronavirus has not caused major slowdowns or otherwise harmed  operations. But the industry is bracing for a worst-case scenario, one in which the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic — coupled with the military’s diversion of resources toward helping the federal and state governments cope with rising numbers of patients and demands on the country’s medical infrastructure — stretches into the summer and beyond. Boeing, which has both commercial and defense operations, this week came out in favor of an emergency government loan and subsidy program of “a minimum of $60 billion” for the aerospace manufacturing industry. Lockheed Martin, told the Pentagon this week it has had to shut down a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Japan factory where the F-35 fighter jet is assembled for at least a week because of virus fears. “The unknown — if you look at the stock market, if you look at earnings, innovation, all of those things, there’s just a feeling of unknown. We don’t know,” said retired Air Force Gen. Herbert “Hawk” J. Carlisle, now the president and CEO National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA). “My belief is in the next two to three weeks [if] we’re able to flatten the curve, and we’re making progress on a vaccine going forward, and medication, and we’ve handled it appropriately … I think it’ll take a while for the economy to recover, but that to me is less concerning,” he told The Washington Times in an interview. “If it’s 10 to 12 months, I think we as a nation are going to have to work hard. And that concerns me more.” While top defense industry contractors such as Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and others say they’re open for business while also taking steps to protect employees and stop the spread of the virus, Gen. Carlisle concedes the industry has already felt blowback. He said key industry symposiums, conferences and events — often the most fertile ground for companies to pitch ideas to military officials and brainstorm new projects — have been canceled or postponed. The Pentagon’s laser-like focus on the coronavirus also means that there’s likely to be fewer opportunities over the next few months for military leaders to spend time meeting with industry representatives on new proposals and initiatives. For Pentagon leaders, the potential consequences are already crystal clear.Ellen Lord, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, on Tuesday asked NDIA, the Aerospace Industries Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a host of other organizations to be part of a core team that will meet daily with the goal of keeping the supply chain up and running.Military officials say that so far there’s been limited impact. “Right now, to date, we’ve not seen a limitation that’s caused us to pause or affect operations in any way. But this is a concern going forward,” Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein told reporters at the Pentagon Wednesday. “Companies have got to figure out how to keep their [production] lines open with their own social distancing and their own procedures to protect their work force.” Indeed, defense firms say they’re instituting the same kinds of safeguards and social distancing protocols that have become commonplace across the U.S. over the past several weeks. “Employees with potential exposure are instructed to work remotely and self-quarantine. We have provided guidance to employees and their managers to accommodate flexible work schedules and alternative arrangements where possible,” Lockheed Martin spokesman Trent Perrotto told Defense News this week. “We continue to follow travel guidance from the U.S. government and other countries where we do business, and are limiting all other international and domestic travel unless necessary for business.” Gen. Carlisle said those policies are in place across the sector. But he also cautioned that teleworking is difficult if not impossible for employees working on sensitive or classified projects. Social distancing inside production facilities, he said, also could lead to slowdowns, especially if the rules remain in place for months. “They’re probably going to separate people with social distancing, which will slow down production lines,” Gen. Carlisle said. “Industry is working hard to do the right thing.”  ",Defense industry braces for unknown fallout from virus,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/defense-industry-braces-unknown-fallout-virus/,washington_times

However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus,” he said in a statement. The House finished up work early Saturday morning and sent lawmakers home, but Mr. Diaz-Balart said he self-quarantined in Washington to protect his wife back in Florida. She has pre-existing conditions that put her at high risk should she contract the virus. Mr. Diaz-Balart did not say whether he knew from whom he contracted the disease.

"Sens. Marco Rubio, chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, and Susan Collins proposed a $300 billion relief package Wednesday to aid small businesses. “The goal is to keep employees connected to their employers,” Mr. Rubio, Florida Republican, said. The plan, which is still being written out, would provide federally guaranteed loans through approved banks for about six to eight weeks for employers to use for payroll and other typical expenses to stay afloat. The loans could potentially be forgiven at the end of the period, Ms. Collins, Maine Republican, said, if the funds were used to sustain employees. “We want to make sure that businesses that would otherwise be thriving and doing well make it through this pandemic that we are enduring,” she said. “When this crisis is over we want those employees to be able to go back to work at those small businesses.” Many small businesses across the nation are being shuttered to help enforce the social distancing practices urged by health professionals. This proposal would be part of the “phase three” coronavirus economic stimulus package, which lawmakers across Capitol Hill are still working to put together. The second bill just cleared the Senate Wednesday afternoon, with many Republicans unhappy with the pressure the worker benefits put on small businesses. Republicans are simultaneously working on drafting proposals to get more cash to the American public and shore up health care resources. The White House is also pushing for aid to hard-hit sectors like the airline and cruise industries. Democrats, however, are calling for Republicans to include them in the talks now, rather than waiting for negotiations further in the process. “Secretary Mnuchin says he wants legislation passed by the end of the week. The McConnell process will not get us there,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said. Mr. Schumer called for at least $750 billion that would go towards shoring up hospital resources, affordability of coronavirus treatment, fund public transportation and emergency child care and pause payments on loans immediately. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants the third bill to expand on benefits for workers, including ensuring first responders and health workers have paid leave if they need it. She also wants refundable tax credits for self-employed and gig economy workers. Mr. Rubio and Ms. Collins, however, said they’re trying to bring in Democrats on this proposal in the early stages. They’re aiming to circulate a draft of the bill by Thursday. “There’s no reason this should be a partisan exercise,” Ms. Collins said. “In fact, I would say if we cannot come together in a bipartisan way to form a response to such a serious threat to our public health and our economy than shame on us.” The Senate has vowed not to leave Washington until the next package is constructed and passed.

"Multiple news organizations continue to peddle the convenient narrative that the public is turning against President Trump as the stock market plummets. A major pollster says otherwise. “Coronavirus pandemic has yet to impact views on Trump’s handling of economy as half of voters back Trump’s economic performance, matching precrisis numbers from January,” reports Eli Yokely, a political analyst for Morning Consult. “Last week’s turmoil in the stock market and growing concerns about the long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. economy have not shaken voters’ views on President Trump’s chief selling point as he faces reelection this fall.” And the numbers: “a new Morning Consult/Politico poll, conducted March 13-16, found that half of voters approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, statistically similar to findings from polls conducted in the first two months of the year. The figure exceeds his overall approval rating by 7 percentage points and is driven by positive sentiment among nearly 9 in 10 Republicans and a plurality of independents,” Mr. Yokely said. The survey also found Mr. Trump enjoying a 6-point advantage over his presumptive challenger, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden on jobs and the economy — priority issues for large majority of voters. HERE’S WHY TRUMP SAYS ‘CHINESE VIRUS’ Some timely observations from former U.S. Attorney Andrew C. McCarthy, who cites the “manufactured controversy” over President Trump’s use of the terms “Wuhan” or “Chinese” virus. Journalists and other critics who object to the terms are overlooking an important legal aspect of the matter, he says — and the phrase does not suggest a racist attitude. “Congress has vested the president with this authority when a threat to the security and public health of any part of the United States is sufficiently grave to warrant a federal response. In our constitutional system, there are certain situations and categories of activity that automatically trigger federal authority. Most prominent among these are foreign relations, foreign incursions, border security, and matters related to foreign commerce, as well as commerce between the states — which, obviously, may be impacted by foreign commerce,” writes Mr. McCarthy in The Hill. “Consequently, the origination of the virus in China and its transcontinental spread across the globe are highly relevant. They rationalize the president’s authority to address the emergency with Washington’s awesome resources,” Mr. McCarthy says. “Not only did history and common sense justify the administration (among others) in noting the origin of the Wuhan coronavirus. Doing so was a legal necessity if the imperative of federal support for beleaguered state governments was to be fulfilled,” he advises. HABITUAL: NEWS MEDIA REMAINS RELENTLESS And so it continues. Some members of the press — including CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash — have offered guarded praise of President Trump’s response to the coronavirus. Most news organizations, however, continue to criticize the president, even at such a pivotal time. A few scant headlines from the last 24 hours: “Trump’s instincts undermine U.S. response to COVID-19” (The Atlantic); “Trump’s new pandemic drumbeat: ‘Chinese virus’” (Politico); “This is the biggest blunder in presidential history” (The Washington Post); “Trump’s ‘Chinese virus’ tweets echo his Mexico insults — with similar results” (NBC News); and “David Plouffe on potential second Trump term: We may not survive it” (MSNBC). THANK A TRUCKER Not overlooked: #ThankaTrucker — A new hashtag has emerged to praise American truck drivers who remain on the roads during the coronavirus crisis. “Truckers are an important link keeping hospitals, grocery stores and everything in between supplied in spite of the virus. They are moms and dads, husbands and wives. They are some of the hardest working, patriotic people in the country moving virtually all of the goods,” tweeted Sen. Mike Enzi, Wyoming Republican. ‘Next time you see a trucker, thank her or him,” the lawmaker said. The American Trucking Association in a statement: “We urge shippers and receivers to treat them with the courtesy, dignity and respect they deserve. We call on government officials to provide them with the flexibility and resources they need to get the job done,” the organization said. “But there’s one thing all Americans can do right now: Thank a trucker. Especially during trying times like these. Because without them, the disruptions we’re experiencing would be something much, much worse.” POLLSTERS STEP UP Even pollsters are rising to the coronavirus challenge. Ipsos, a major global polling firm, has partnered with news organization Axios to produce a “COVID-19 pandemic weekly tracking poll” to offer some insight. “We expect next week’s poll will reflect the drastic changes in behavior, as the reality of the virus modifies our day-to-day life,” the poll analysis noted. The debut survey found that 49% of Americans don’t have very much trust — or no trust at all — in cable news to provide accurate information on COVID-19. Another 74% feel the same way about social media. Another 53%, however, trust the federal government for accurate information. In addition, 64% of respondents have stopped shaking hands with others, 51% have not visited friends or relatives and 43% skipped going out to eat. The Axios/Ipsos poll of 1,092 U.S. adults was conducted March 13-16. POLL DU JOUR • 48% of U.S. voters think Sen. Bernard Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden should “cancel upcoming campaign events for the Democratic presidential nomination”; 48% of Republicans, 45% of independents, 50% of Democrats agree. • 27% of voters overall think Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden “should continue campaigning for the presidential nomination”; 27% of Republicans, 26% of independents and 29% of Democrats agree. • 25% overall don’t know or have no opinion; 26% of Republicans, 30% of independents and 21% of Democrats agree.

"The Senate approved a $105 billion bill Wednesday to provide sick leave from the COVID-19 pandemic while the administration forged ahead with a $1.3 trillion plan to help out-of-work Americans and to rescue the cratering economy, as stocks sustained another massive sell-off that halted trading briefly for the fourth time in two weeks. The Senate voted 90-8 to send the measure, considered “phase two” of the government’s response, to the president’s desk. It provides free coronavirus testing, two weeks of paid sick and family leave, increased funding for Medicaid and food stamps, and increased unemployment insurance. The deal also frees up the Senate to address what is likely to become one of the costliest emergency spending packages in history, to bail out industries shuttered by the pandemic and put cash into Americans’ pockets quickly. The flurry of activity in Washington showed no signs of reassuring Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,338 points, or 6.3%, to close at 19,898, although the index was down more than 2,000 points earlier in the day. The S&P 500 fell 5.1% and at one point dropped more than 7% to trigger an automatic trading halt for the fourth time in two weeks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 4.7%. Oil prices dropped 24% to an 18-year low on fears of the pandemic. The New York Stock Exchange also announced Wednesday that it was closing its famed “pit,” temporarily suspending in-person trading and requiring all transactions to be electronic, starting Monday. “The decision to temporarily close the trading floors represents a precautionary step to protect the health and well-being of employees and the floor community in response to COVID-19,” Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which runs the exchange, said in a statement. Hoping to stem the rout in stocks, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin scheduled an appearance on Fox Business Network with host Maria Bartiromo for Thursday morning before the markets were to open. He was expected to provide an update on negotiations for speeding up congressional action on the bailout plan. As for the rest of the economy, President Trump said his administration’s proposed $1.3 trillion fiscal rescue package will “help everybody” in the country. It calls for two rounds of direct payments to most Americans, in April and May, based on their income. “We have to help everybody,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. “It was nobody’s fault — certainly none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers, planes that had no passengers and cruise ships. They can’t be blamed for this. We want to keep those companies vibrant.” The downturn was accelerating. Ford and General Motors announced they would close at least through the end of the month. Fiat Chrysler was expected to follow suit. With the unemployment rate at 3.5% in February, Mr. Trump addressed a reported comment by Mr. Mnuchin in a private meeting with Senate Republicans that failure to enact the mammoth government rescue plan could risk a rise in unemployment to 20%. “I don’t agree with that,” Mr. Trump said. “That’s an absolute, total, worst-case scenario. We’re nowhere near it.” Under the administration’s proposal, checks of $1,000 or more would be sent to people around April 6 and again around May 18. The cost to the Treasury would be about $500 billion. “We’ve talked about those numbers, and we’re also moving those numbers in both directions,” the president said, cautioning that no decisions had been made. The Treasury Department said the cash payouts would be means-tested, meaning the amounts would be based on income level and family size. Treasury’s written rescue plan calls for an airline industry bailout of $50 billion in secured loans to passenger and cargo carriers. Limits would be placed on executive pay increases until the loans are repaid. Another $150 billion would go to other affected industries in secured loans or loan guarantees. This group would likely include hotels and cruise lines. Bus companies also made a plea for help. The American Bus Association said its operators will likely lose $8 billion over the next five months as charter and tour bus business evaporates at their busiest time of the year. The bailout plan also includes $300 billion for small-business interruption loans for companies with fewer than 500 employees. Recipients would have to keep paying all their employees for eight weeks from the date of the loan. The government would guarantee 100% of payroll for six weeks, capped at $1,540 per week per employee. The proposal has yet to gain the approval of Senate Republicans, much less House Democrats. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who acknowledged the rapidly shifting sands of the economic downturn, said the bailout package could still grow in cost. “If it takes more than that, we will do more than that,” he said on Fox News. “During crises or wars, you have to sort of not worry about borrowing.” David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth, called it “a responsible plan to provide assistance to struggling industry by offering loans instead of blindly handing over billions in taxpayer dollars in government grants.” Some were calling on the White House to take even more drastic action. Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, urged the president to shut down the country for 30 days to contain the coronavirus. He said it’s the only option to rescue the economy. “What’s scaring the American people and corporate America now is the gradual rollout,” Mr. Ackman said on CNBC. “We need to shut it down now. … This is the only answer. America will end as we know it. I’m sorry to say so, unless we take this option.” Mr. Trump held several conference calls and meetings with affected workers and businesses, including nurses. Vice President Mike Pence praised the health care providers for their service and said their safety is “in the forefront of the president’s mind.” The president also held a call with the Business Roundtable, which represents major companies nationwide with 15 million workers. The group told Mr. Trump in a letter that the rescue plan will have “enormous costs,” but “failure to act boldly now will impose far greater costs to our country and our future.” The Department of Housing and Urban Development on Wednesday authorized the Federal Housing Administration to freeze all foreclosures and evictions for single-family homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages for the next 60 days. “Today’s actions will allow households who have an FHA-insured mortgage to meet the challenges of COVID-19 without fear of losing their homes, and help steady market concerns,” said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. Voting against the paid leave bill were eight Republicans: Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, James M. Inhofe and James Lankford of Oklahoma, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Tim Scott of South Carolina. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, acknowledged his colleagues’ concerns with the package but urged them to address those issues in the third, larger economic bill that lawmakers are still crafting. “In this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,” he said before the vote.

"Pro-life Democrats say their party’s full embrace of abortion rights has them feeling alienated and considering sitting out the November election. That feeling accelerated this week after far-left activists and pro-choice groups helped power Marie Newman to victory over Rep. Dan Lipinski — one of the few remaining pro-life Democrats in the House. Kirsten Day, executive director of Democrats for Life of America, said pro-life Democrats already a bad taste in their mouth after Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said every Democrat should be pro-choice and the likely presidential nominee, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, reversed his longtime support of the Hyde Amendment legislation that bars the use of taxpayer funding for most abortions. “There is going to be a number of pro-life Democrats who are not going to go out and vote for Joe Biden,” Ms. Day said. “They may not vote for Trump but they are not going to come out for Biden.” “He doesn’t have the courage that Dan Lipinski has. Dan was pro-life and he just never caved, no matter how he was treated by his party,” she said. “Contrast that with Joe Biden — one day he said ‘yes, he still supports the Hyde Amendment’ and 12 hours later he flip-flopped.” “Where is the courage there?” she said. Mr. Lipinski was a top target of the liberal activists and powerful outside groups — including pro-choice groups such as Planned Parenthood Action Fund, NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC, and EMILY’s List. Such far-left party champions as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sens. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts backed her bid. Pro-Newman groups spent over $1.5 million on race, funneling roughly $600,000 into attacks that painted Mr. Lipinski as, among other things, an anti-abortion extremist. The other pro-life Democrats in the House are Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas, Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Ben McAdams of Utah. The Newman win gave liberal activists their first ouster of the year, and a reason to celebrate in an otherwise underwhelming election cycle for their cause. They tried and failed to unseat Mr. Cuellar. They also watched Ms. Warren’s presidential campaign end and Mr. Sanders’s presidential aspirations now on life support. “This is a critical victory for the progressive movement in showing that voters are ready for a new generation of progressive leadership in the Democratic Party,” said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats. “This isn’t just a loss for one incumbent,” she said. “It’s a defeat for machine politics and big corporate donors who want to stop our movement for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and reproductive rights.” Mr. Lipinski had voted with President Trump 25% of the time, according to a running analysis of votes by FiveThirtyEight.com. Pro-life groups lamented the outcome. “Congressman Lipinski has long been a profile in courage, bucking the sad trend of Democrat leaders vying to be the greatest advocate of abortion,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List.

"JERUSALEM (AP) - With the Israeli government enacting a series of emergency measures to stem the spread of the new coronavirus, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing growing accusations that he is exploiting the crisis to entrench himself in power and undermining the country’s democratic foundations. Amid a wave of sweeping restrictions that have put Israel in near shutdown mode, Netanyahu has managed to postpone his own pending criminal trial, authorize unprecedented electronic surveillance of Israeli citizens and block parliament from pressing ahead with legislation aimed at pushing him from office. The moves, on the heels of the country’s third inconclusive election in less than a year and under the shadow of Netanyahu’s corruption indictment, sparked leading opposition figure Yair Lapid to tell Israeli citizens that they “no longer live in a democracy.” “There is no judicial branch in Israel. There is no legislative branch in Israel. There is only an unelected government that is headed by a person who lost the election. You can call that by a lot of names, it isn’t a democracy,” he said in a recorded video.  The new coronavirus has spread to more than 100 countries, infected more than 217,000 people worldwide and killed more than 8,700. For most people, it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. Israeli health officials have diagnosed over 400 coronavirus cases, roughly a quarter of them detected in the last 24 hours.  With the numbers quickly rising, authorities have issued a series of tough guidelines that have brought the country to a standstill. People have been instructed to stay home, tens of thousands are in home quarantine and foreigners have been banned from entering the country. Most controversially, the Israeli government instructed the shadowy Shin Bet internal security service to start deploying the agency’s phone surveillance technology to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus in Israel by tracking the moves of the infected.  Israel uses phone surveillance in the occupied Palestinian territories, saying it’s an important tool to prevent attacks on Israelis, but critics say it’s also aimed at maintaining tight control. The surveillance in Israel has sparked widespread criticism from lawmakers and civil rights groups. Opponents planned to file a Supreme Court challenge on Thursday. Many of the measures are not unique to Israel. In neighboring Jordan, King Abdullah II has shut the country’s court system and parliament, as part of an effort to stem the outbreak. Abdullah, who is not elected, appears to have won wide public support for his handling of the crisis. The British government plans to introduce a bill in Parliament on Thursday that will give authorities stronger powers to respond to the pandemic. Many of these are relatively uncontroversial - like allowing retired doctors to return to work without taking a hit on their pensions. But critics have raised questions about some proposals, including a move to give police and immigration officers “powers to detain people and put them in appropriate isolation facilities if necessary to protect public health.” The emergency legislation is due to have a two-year time limit, but opposition lawmakers want a shorter cut-off date. In Israel, Netanyahu has thrived in the crisis, delivering stern televised addresses to the nation each evening.  Presenting himself as the responsible adult steering the country through an unprecedented crisis, he has defended the tough steps, including the electronic surveillance, as measures that he has reluctantly been forced to impose to save lives while his opponents are focused on petty politics.  In a televised interview Wednesday, Netanyahu said that during his 11 years as prime minister, he had previously always refused to use surveillance on Israeli citizens. He said there would be “maximum oversight” to protect privacy concerns. “The last thing I will do is harm democracy,” he said. The liberal Haaretz daily responded Wednesday with a lead editorial titled “An Epidemic of Surveillance.” “Under the cover of the battle against the spread of the coronavirus, Interim Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concentrating more and more power in his hands, with neither balances nor supervision,” it wrote. “At this time of emergency, and in order to keep from sliding down the slippery slope, it is critical to maintain proportionality and oversight.” Following the March 2 election, Netanyahu has the support of only 58 lawmakers, leaving him three short of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset. Sixty-one lawmakers have come out in support of his opponent, Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz, while one refuses to endorse either side.  Backed by a narrow majority, Gantz, a former military chief, was tasked by Israel’s president this week to try to form a new government.  In the meantime, Netanyahu has used a series of executive orders and other tactics to push forward his agenda while preventing parliament from convening. The phone-surveillance plan was approved by the Cabinet in the middle of the night, without the traditional parliamentary oversight that is customary for such decisions.  Blue and White politician Gabi Ashkenazi, another former military chief who was supposed to oversee the committee, called Netanyahu’s move a “heist in the dead of night.”  Blue and White has also taken aim at Netanyahu and his Likud party for preventing the newly elected parliament from convening under the guise of virus-related restrictions on public gatherings.  On Wednesday, Parliament Speaker Yuli Edelstein, a member of Likud, abruptly adjourned the Knesset, freezing Blue and White’s plans to appoint new committees and advance legislation that could limit Netanyahu’s time in office. President Reuven Rivlin warned the country’s democratic system was being threatened. Netanyahu and Gantz held an emergency meeting this week to discuss the possibility of establishing a unity government to end the prolonged political paralysis. But progress appeared unlikely as they continued to bicker. Earlier this week, Netanyahu’s hand-picked justice minister, in the middle of the night, declared a state of emergency in the court system a day before Netanyahu’s trial was to begin. The decree, citing the coronavirus crisis, postponed Netanyahu’s trial until May. In his TV interview, Netanyahu lashed back at his critics. “While I manage the war against the coronavirus and the fight for saving the lives of citizens of Israel,” he said, ”they are only planning how to depose a prime minister.” Netanyahu critics have suggested that the crisis landed on the prime minister’s lap at just the right time. “The coronavirus will pass at some point or another,” commentator Ben Caspit wrote in Maariv. “After we bury our dead, we are also going to have to administer last rites to our democracy.” ____ Follow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London and Omar Akour in Amman contributed to this report.

"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Iran’s top leader will pardon 10,000 more prisoners in an apparent effort to combat the coronavirus, state TV reported Thursday.  As part of steps to curb the spread of the new virus that has killed more than 1,100 people in Iran, the country has already released 85,000 prisoners on temporary leave.  Separately, the United Arab Emirates added to its list of people barred from entering all residents who are currently abroad. The decision impacts people whose homes, children, bank accounts and livelihoods are in the country, but who were traveling or outside the country. The ban goes into effect at mid-day Thursday for at least two weeks. Only Emirati citizens are allowed to return. The UAE, which is home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has 113 confirmed cases of the virus. It announced it was suspending all new labor permits, including those for drivers and domestic workers, until “further notice.”  The UAE is unique in that only about 10% of its population, or about 1 million people, are Emirati citizens. The other 90% are foreign residents who fuel its economy and keep the country running. They hold the vast majority of jobs in construction, transportation, hospitality, sales, medicine, education and other key sectors. The Middle East has some 20,000 cases of the virus, with most in Iran or originating from Iran.  For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. To encourage people to stay at home in Iran, Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour wrote on social media that the virus infects 50 Iranians on average every single hour and that “one dies every 10 minutes .” “Make smart decisions about travel, visits and meetings,” he wrote on Twitter, as highways remained crowded with people traveling to see family ahead of the Iranian New Year on Friday. State TV quoted judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili as saying that 10,000 prisoners - among them an unknown number of inmates whose cases are political and related to activism or speech - would be granted amnesty under a decree by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the occasion of the new year, called Nowruz. Occasionally Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, pardons prisoners. Last year, he pardoned more than 50,000 on the 40th anniversary of 1979 Islamic Revolution. Western nations have urged Iran to release dual nationals and others, alleging they are used as bargaining chips in negotiations. Among those temporarily freed was Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, an Iranian-British dual national long held on internationally criticized charges. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the charitable Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in 2016 on charges of trying to topple the government while traveling with her toddler daughter. In Pakistan, shrines of Sufi saints in the capital Islamabad and elsewhere were closed. Visits to museums, archaeological and tourist sites were banned as the number of cases of coronavirus jumped to 301, mostly among pilgrims returning from Iran.  Two people who were tested positive upon their return from Saudi Arabia and Dubai became the first victims of the virus in Pakistan when they died Wednesday in the northwest.  ___ Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The wife of Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that she’s facing the same problems as millions of other Californians who are dealing with empty store shelves, closed schools and home confinement as social distancing measures take hold to slow the spread of the coronavirus. “One rose amidst all of this - family dinners and no late night homework stress,” tweeted Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who has four young children. “And nice to not have kids shuffling home late from sports and activities. And yes, unfortunately the thorn - we run out of toilet paper, paper towels, and Kleenex tomorrow. I wish people had not hoarded.” Her remarks were met with scorn. Several critics responded with the famous line attributed to Marie Antoinette: “Let them eat cake!” “Yes, lovely isn’t it?,” replied another. “Shame about grandma’s hideous death, but we got some pajama time with the kiddos!” “And having to step over the homeless on your way to search for toilet paper must be an added stress for you,” said another respondent, who added an eye-rolling emoji. “Poor darling!” said another tweet. “Maybe you can send the state patrol out to appropriate some from the peasants.” Eleven Northern California counties and the Southern California city of Palm Springs have told residents to stay home, except to buy groceries, visit the doctor or do anything deemed essential. Virtually all schools around the state have closed classrooms for several weeks, and Gov. Newsom has said that they may need to remain shut for the rest of the school year. Newsom also has encouraged people 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions to stay indoors. He’s also called for the shutdown of bars, movie theaters, gyms and other gathering places, and for restaurants to only serve food to go - restrictions already in place in Los Angeles and several other major cities.

The group told Mr. Trump in a letter that the rescue plan will have “enormous costs,” but “failure to act boldly now will impose far greater costs to our country and our future.” The Department of Housing and Urban Development on Wednesday authorized the Federal Housing Administration to freeze all foreclosures and evictions for single-family homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages for the next 60 days. “Today’s actions will allow households who have an FHA-insured mortgage to meet the challenges of COVID-19 without fear of losing their homes, and help steady market concerns,” said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. Voting against the paid leave bill were eight Republicans: Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, James M. Inhofe and James Lankford of Oklahoma, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Tim Scott of South Carolina. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, acknowledged his colleagues’ concerns with the package but urged them to address those issues in the third, larger economic bill that lawmakers are still crafting. “In this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,” he said before the vote.

"BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Legislation that would compensate the wrongly convicted headed to the governor’s desk on Wednesday. The House voted 64-1 to approve the amended measure from the Senate that would pay $60,000 a year for wrongful incarceration and $75,000 per year on death row. Backers say the state needs to take responsibility when an innocent person is incarcerated. Idaho is one of 15 states that doesn’t compensate people sent to prison for crimes they didn’t commit. Idaho has several notable cases including Christopher Tapp. He was convicted of rape and murder following the 1996 death of Angie Dodge. He was released in 2017, and DNA evidence cleared him in 2019. Brian Leigh Dripps was arrested on DNA evidence last year and is charged with rape and murder in Dodge’s death. Another former inmate who could benefit from the legislation is Charles Fain.  Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder in 1983 following the death of 9-year-old Daralyn Johnson. In 1984 he was sentenced to death.  But DNA evidence not available at the time of the conviction later cleared him, and he was released in 2001. Johnson’s killer hasn’t been identified. The bill’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Doug Ricks, said six former inmates could benefit from the measure.

"The 2020 presidential race is the tale of two campaigns. First came the time before coronavirus — B.C., if you will — and then everything P.V., or post-virus. In B.C., President Trump was riding an economic boom and watching his approval ratings surge as a fractious Democratic field of opponents debated how far to tilt into socialism. Oddsmakers gave the president better-than-even chances of winning in November. Then the virus infected the political debate, the stock market shed 30% of its value and Mr. Trump stumbled through an Oval Office address that failed to calm things, sending his job approval ratings tumbling. And Democrats quickly settled their socialism debate, rallying around former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. Political analysts studying the race say there’s no way to predict what happens now. The only certainty P.V. is chaos. John J. Pitney Jr., a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College who’s written post-mortems on the last three presidential elections, said in the days before the virus he had given Mr. Trump “a decent chance at reelection.” “Now that a recession seems very likely, the advantage shifts to Biden,” he told The Washington Times. “The magnitude of a recession effect is hard to reckon. There have been very few presidential elections with economic conditions as dire as they are now.” Brian J. Gaines at the University of Illinois agreed the tanking economy deprives Mr. Trump of his best argument for re-election, but said there is also a tendency for voters to rally around a president at a time of crisis. “Whether the sense of crisis prevails for months and, if so, whether there is a rally that either carries on or dissipates is hard to guess,” he said. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College, said Mr. Trump had been nearing the 48% job performance mark, and no president has failed to get re-elected with that number. Now, however, he’s tumbled to about 44% when current polls are averaged. “I don’t think there’s any doubt we’re going to have one. The question is how deep is it, how long is it going to last, and is there sufficient recovery by the fall?” Mr. Madonna said. “It doesn’t matter whether you caused it or not … A president rises and falls on the economy.” But the uncertainties are huge. Candidates are canceling rallies and turning to online events to reach voters. Fundraising could look dramatically different. Turnout in the primaries is already being reshaped by COVID-19. “The virus is creating such havoc that I think all forecasts are up in the air,” Mr. Gaines said. “I hope that the weird quasi-curfew spring is a distant memory by November, but it seems likely that life will not be back to normal in all ways by then.” Before the virus struck, Mr. Biden was telling voters he would be able to put together the old Obama voter coalition that captured the White House in the 2008 and 2012 elections. But polling suggests his voters in a head-to-head match-up with Mr. Trump look more like Hillary Clinton’s 2016 coalition, which powered her to a 3 million vote lead in the popular vote — but which was too concentrated in coastal states, denying her the win where it counts, in the Electoral College. Mr. Biden has made new strides in wealthier voters. Those with annual incomes above $100,000 used to tend GOP, but in 2016 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump tied, according to exit polling. Now, Mr. Biden holds a lead, according to a set of new polls this month by The Economist/YouGov. A gender gap remains — Mr. Trump holds a slim lead among men, while Mr. Biden holds a wider advantage among women — and it gives Mr. Biden a lead in YouGov’s head-to-head match-ups. Mr. Biden has also eaten into the white vote totals Mr. Trump posted four years ago, though black and Hispanic voters are more skeptical of him at this point than they were of Mrs. Clinton in 2016, and far more skeptical than they were of Mr. Obama in 2012. Mr. Pitney said that the economic distress could help limit some of that shift, with Mr. Trump’s support among Hispanics weighed down. The president also faces some more fundamental demographic headwinds with older voters, who are a reliable GOP bock. Mortality rates mean a significant number of those who backed him in 2016 won’t be voting for him this year, even as the pool of younger voters, who are overwhelmingly Democratic, is restocked. In Florida, for example, Mr. Trump faces a net loss of more than 70,000 senior citizen voters, while Democrats are looking at a net gain of more than 150,000 young voters. That combines for a total net of more than 220,000 voters for Democrats, or about double Mr. Trump’s margin of victory in the state in 2016. None of that accounts for Mr. Trump being able to win over Clinton voters, or turn out new voters who didn’t cast ballots last time. Or the reverse could happen, with 2016 Trump voters fleeing him, and Democrats tapping voters who couldn’t pull the lever for Mrs. Clinton, but don’t mind Mr. Biden. But the same mortality math in Florida applies to other key states such as Pennsylvania, where Mr. Trump may cede about 45,000 votes due to demographics at the upper and lower ages — about equal to his margin of victory in the state last time. Analysts say they expect this year’s race to come down to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida — each of which Mr. Trump carried in 2016.

"NEW YORK — Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson says he felt a “moral obligation” to meet with President Donald Trump and warn him personally about the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. Carlson told Vanity Fair that “I didn’t feel it was my role” but was convinced by his wife to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on March 7. Two nights later on his Fox show, he issued a pointed warning to viewers to prepare for the coming storm. It speaks to both Fox News’ influence with the president and his supporters that a cable news host was able to contact the White House and successfully request the two-hour meeting. Carlson drove to the president’s resort from his Florida home, ironically on the day some guests at Mar-a-Lago were exposed to the virus. He declined a request to speak to The Associated Press about it on Wednesday, and the White House said it would not comment on a private meeting. Carlson had sounded the alarm about the coronavirus on his show earlier than this month. On Jan. 28, he criticized the media for spending more time on the impeachment trial than the virus and, on Feb. 3, told viewers that “you should be concerned.” Yet his blunt March 9 commentary was eye-opening, particularly in how it contrasted with attitudes expressed by some Fox colleagues. At the same time as he was talking, Trish Regan on the sister Fox Business Network was denouncing the “coronavirus impeachment scam,” suggesting the stories were an attempt to attack the president. Four days later, Fox shelved her show. “People you know will get sick,” Carlson said that night. “Some may die. This is real. That’s the point of this script - to tell you that.” Carlson said the nation’s leaders haven’t helped citizens take it seriously, criticizing liberals for saying it was racist to refer to “The Chinese Coronavirus” - words displayed on the screen behind him. “If we’re being honest, the other side has not been especially helpful, either,” Carlson said. “People you trust - people you probably voted for - have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem. It’s just partisan politics, they say, calm down. In the end this is just like the flu and people die of that every year.” It’s not, he said, noting that the death rate for the coronavirus was much higher. He named no names. His fellow Fox News host, Sean Hannity, has repeatedly brought up seasonal flu in connection with the coronavirus, to the point where Dr. Anthony Fauci implored him last week not to ignore the new disease’s lethality. Most people who get the coronavirus have only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. Fox confirmed that Carlson has not been tested for the disease and hasn’t experienced any symptoms. Carlson told Vanity Fair that he told Trump “exactly what I’ve said on TV, that this could be really bad.” He hasn’t talked about his meeting on television and wanted to keep it a secret, although it was revealed in a story by The New York Times. After weeks of trying to downplay the risk of the coronavirus, Trump has taken a more urgent tone in recent days and led daily briefings with federal leaders about developments. “I think a lot of people around him, and I mean broadly around him - particularly Republican members on Capitol Hill, in leadership, too - were determined to pretend this wasn’t happening,” he told the magazine. “I felt I had to do it, even though I suspected on some level it would probably hurt me if I did it.” Carlson said it’s hard to tell a straightforward story at a time people see most everything through a partisan or ideological lens. Polls have shown Democrats to be more concerned about the coronavirus than Republicans. “It’s hard to get people’s attention if you know you’re saying something that they suspect is political propaganda,” he said. “It’s something people have worried about for a long time - what if there’s a crisis, and no one will believe the coverage? Well, okay, that’s where we are.” He said a lot of people are to blame for that, “including probably me.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"A group of Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee raised “serious concerns” Wednesday about Americans abroad who are struggling to return to the U.S. amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the nine Democratic senators requested the department “step up” efforts to assist the U.S. nationals in returning home after receiving reports that some Americans have been unable to book flights or get in contact with U.S. embassies. “Providing support and assistance to Americans abroad and ensuring their safety and well-being are among the Department’s most fundamental responsibilities,” the senators wrote, citing concerns with Americans in Honduras, Morocco, Peru and Tunisia who have recently reported difficulties in obtaining support from American embassies and consulates. Committee Ranking Member Bob Menendez of New Jersey, along with Sens. Ben Cardin of Maryland, Chris Coons of Delaware, Tom Udall of New Mexico, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Cory Booker of New Jersey, urged Mr. Pompeo to explain efforts being made by the department to bring the Americans home. The letter comes amid reports that the State Department is cautioning Americans to not rely on the U.S. government to arrange travel back home. “Americans overseas should have full confidence that the State Department will support them when abroad and facilitate their efforts to return to the United States if they are seeking to evacuate from areas affected by COVID-19,” the senators added. “We recognize these are extraordinary times for the nation and the world. Yet this crisis calls for creative measures.”  ",Senate Dems raise 'serious concerns' about Americans stuck abroad amid coronavirus outbreak,"Wednesday, March 18, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/18/senate-dems-raise-serious-concerns-about-americans/,washington_times
"PHOENIX (AP) - Osvaldo Salas speaks a little English, but not proficiently. The suburban Phoenix man relies on Spanish-language TV and friends and family for information on the coronavirus because state and local officials haven’t posted any updates online in Spanish even as the global pandemic widens.  “Unfortunately, here in Arizona, they turn their backs on Hispanic people,” Salas, a restaurant cook, said in Spanish. “Here, many of us speak Spanish, thousands of us, and unfortunately sometimes they put us to the side.” As government officials across the country warn about the dangers of the coronavirus, they’re doing so predominantly in English. They’re potentially not reaching the millions of Spanish speakers in the U.S. who aren’t proficient in English to make sure they know how to stay healthy. Advocacy groups and Spanish-language media have stepped up to fill in the gaps as cities and states say they’re working to translate guidance about hand washing and the effects of closing schools and businesses into the second-most spoken language in the U.S. Univision was also dedicating more airtime to the coronavirus. In Arizona, where 30% of residents are Hispanic, the Department of Health Services has a webpage with coronavirus updates - but none of the information is in Spanish. The health department was still translating coronavirus updates, Director Cara Christ said Monday. By Wednesday, there was still no Spanish and the department didn’t respond to a request for comment on Salas’ concerns. No media briefings have been broadcast in Spanish, although health officials have done Spanish-language interviews with Hispanic media.  “This has been a rapidly evolving situation and so things update almost daily,” Christ said. “We are working on getting a lot of our hard materials translated into Spanish and working on getting Spanish in our social media.”  Salas, who’s his family’s primary breadwinner, said he’s worried about feeding his wife and four children, one of whom has a rare genetic disorder that requires full-time care. He says his restaurant is closing and he’s heard on the news that some shuttered school districts are still handing out free meals, but he has no idea if theirs is one of them because there’s been no outreach.  Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a civil rights organization, said he’s not surprised that some states are behind on Spanish-language messaging, especially those like Arizona, where immigrants and Hispanics have faced hostility from laws and raids meant to crack down on illegal immigration. He said Hispanic and immigrant communities already face barriers to health care, including fear of seeking treatment because of their immigration status.  “The lack of bilingual material sort of exacerbates some of those issues that create uneven access to information and services,” Saenz said.  To help, an advocacy group is providing workers at a day labor work center in Pasadena, California, with information in Spanish to help them reduce their risk of infection and be ready in case they get sick or the government orders a lockdown. The National Day Laborer Organizing Network also streamed a radio show on social media, addressing hygiene strategies, how to talk with children about the virus and the drastic drop in hirings the center has seen. “I prefer the information in Spanish because it is our language,” said Carlos, a day laborer who was getting information at the center and didn’t want to share his last name out of fear he would be targeted by immigration authorities. “They are advising us on how to act, and how to get ready to face this, especially those of us who have children, so that we don’t take this home because the children are out of school.” Spanish-language media outlet Noticias Telemundo says it’s adding a national weekday newscast focused on the coronavirus. It’s also expanding its morning show and midday newscast to include segments on the virus.  The outreach to Spanish-speaking communities has been mixed.  The federal government has done little, but the CDC has coronavirus information available in Spanish on its website, although it is hard to find. Critics say it’s taken too long to post updates in Spanish. For example, the CDC’s Spanish-language Twitter account hasn’t tweeted about the coronavirus, instead retweeting a message about the virus from the CDC Environment account Tuesday.  In Hispanic-heavy states like Florida, many news conferences held by state officials have been bilingual, and the Florida health department has Spanish-speaking agents available round the clock at its coronavirus call center, spokesman Alberto Moscoso said. In New Mexico, a day after The Associated Press asked the governor’s office about a lack of Spanish on the health department website, it’s Spanish-language site went live - though it’s difficult to find - and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham tweeted about it in Spanish. A purple-highlighted banner atop the main page has, in small letters, a link to Spanish updates. The nation’s most Hispanic state also has had a Spanish educator and health official at every news conference to do an interviews with Spanish-language media.  Washington state, which has had the most deaths in the U.S., has information and news releases posted in both English and Spanish on its health department website. Health officials are working with a translation firm and with independent translators to get the word out in over 40 languages, spokeswoman Kathleen Meehan said.  Meehan added that it’s the first time the state health department created a community engagement task force to address things like language barriers. And while government officials have had to communicate in other languages before, such as during wildfires, the virus outbreak is unprecedented, she said.  “Our messaging isn’t effective if people can’t understand it,” Meehan said.  In the California wine region of Sonoma County, officials are giving news updates in both languages, broadcasting them on Facebook Live.  And in El Paso, Texas, where roughly 80% of residents are Hispanic, authorities have conducted news conferences in both languages. Mayor Dee Margo posts updates in Spanish and English to his official Facebook page.  Raquel Terán, an Arizona lawmaker and longtime community activist, said she asked state officials two weeks ago whether information would be delivered in Spanish. Now, as the warnings ramp up - state officials have closed all schools and continue to urge people to stay home - messaging in more than just English is essential, Terán said.  She said the state should hire Spanish translators, noting that although not all Hispanics speak Spanish, many do.  The community wants “to hear a trusted voice,” Terán said. “They want the trusted messenger in Spanish. That’s the reality.” ___ Garcia Cano reported from Washington.

"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Iran’s top leader will pardon 10,000 more prisoners in an apparent effort to combat the coronavirus, state TV reported Thursday.  As part of steps to curb the spread of the new virus that has killed more than 1,100 people in Iran, the country has already released 85,000 prisoners on temporary leave.  Separately, the United Arab Emirates added to its list of people barred from entering all residents who are currently abroad. The decision impacts people whose homes, children, bank accounts and livelihoods are in the country, but who were traveling or outside the country. The ban goes into effect at mid-day Thursday for at least two weeks. Only Emirati citizens are allowed to return. The UAE, which is home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has 113 confirmed cases of the virus. It announced it was suspending all new labor permits, including those for drivers and domestic workers, until “further notice.”  The UAE is unique in that only about 10% of its population, or about 1 million people, are Emirati citizens. The other 90% are foreign residents who fuel its economy and keep the country running. They hold the vast majority of jobs in construction, transportation, hospitality, sales, medicine, education and other key sectors. The Middle East has some 20,000 cases of the virus, with most in Iran or originating from Iran.  For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. To encourage people to stay at home in Iran, Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour wrote on social media that the virus infects 50 Iranians on average every single hour and that “one dies every 10 minutes .” “Make smart decisions about travel, visits and meetings,” he wrote on Twitter, as highways remained crowded with people traveling to see family ahead of the Iranian New Year on Friday. State TV quoted judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili as saying that 10,000 prisoners - among them an unknown number of inmates whose cases are political and related to activism or speech - would be granted amnesty under a decree by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the occasion of the new year, called Nowruz. Occasionally Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, pardons prisoners. Last year, he pardoned more than 50,000 on the 40th anniversary of 1979 Islamic Revolution. Western nations have urged Iran to release dual nationals and others, alleging they are used as bargaining chips in negotiations. Among those temporarily freed was Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, an Iranian-British dual national long held on internationally criticized charges. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the charitable Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in 2016 on charges of trying to topple the government while traveling with her toddler daughter. In Lebanon, the last commercial flight arrived in Beirut’s international airport from Istanbul late Wednesday just before a lockdown went into effect at midnight for the next two weeks. The government shut down the airport, seaports and borders and ordered citizens to stay home as the small country of nearly 5 million people grappled with containing the virus. Lebanon has recorded four deaths and 133 cases infected cases. Most private businesses, restaurants and Lebanese government institutions were also ordered shut, leaving only bakeries, supermarkets and pharmacies open, as well as some banks. In Pakistan, shrines of Sufi saints in the capital Islamabad and elsewhere were closed. Visits to museums, archaeological and tourist sites were banned as the number of cases of coronavirus jumped to 301, mostly among pilgrims returning from Iran.  Two people who were tested positive upon their return from Saudi Arabia and Dubai became the first victims of the virus in Pakistan when they died Wednesday in the northwest.  ___ Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

"Rep. Ben McAdams, who announced on Wednesday that he tested positive for the coronavirus, on Thursday said Congress should consider allowing for remote voting amid the expanding outbreak. “I think there’s value, outside of the national emergency that we’re in, [in] having members of Congress come together and talk about bills before they vote on them,” the Utah Democrat said on NBC’s “Today” program. “But perhaps under a state of a declared national emergency that’s something that should be available to the Congress.” “It does place a limit on the ability of Congress to get stuff done,” he said. “Right now, I don’t think it approaches the level of having a quorum, but certainly where we [limit] social gatherings to more than 10, it’s something we should think about with Congress having 435 members and gathering for votes.” Mr. McAdams said he was feeling pretty bad but that he was getting by. He said a doctor initially said his symptoms of a fever and cough didn’t justify testing, but on Monday evening his symptoms took a turn for the worse. “I had a temperature of about 103. … My lungs were really constricted — [it] felt like I had a belt around my chest,” Mr. McAdams said. The doctor then said it made sense for the congressman to get tested, and he did so at a local clinic. Mr. McAdams said the House physician said anyone who had close contact with him from Friday onward “should be concerned and should probably take precaution[s].” “There aren’t a lot of members with whom I had close contact,” he said.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont on Wednesday made clear that he didn’t want to entertain questions about a potential time frame for his ending his presidential campaign, saying he’s dealing with the expanding coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Sanders’ campaign had forcefully denied a report Wednesday that said he was suspending his campaign, after a string of losses has given former Vice President Joseph R. Biden an almost insurmountable lead in delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Asked about his “time frame,” Mr. Sanders said: “Stop with this. I’m dealing with a f–ing global crisis. You know? We’re dealing with it and you’re asking me these questions.” “Right now I’m trying to do my best to make sure that we don’t have an economic meltdown and that people don’t die. Is that enough to you? To keep you busy for today?” he told reporters. Mr. Biden has 1,180 delegates and Mr. Sanders has 885, according to the latest tally from The Associated Press. Mr. Sanders’ team did say Wednesday that the senator would be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign and that his immediate focus would be on the COVID-19 outbreak. Mr. Biden cruised to wins in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday to build on his delegate lead.

"JERUSALEM (AP) - With the Israeli government enacting a series of emergency measures to stem the spread of the new coronavirus, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing growing accusations that he is exploiting the crisis to entrench himself in power and undermining the country’s democratic foundations. Amid a wave of sweeping restrictions that have put Israel in near shutdown mode, Netanyahu has managed to postpone his own pending criminal trial, authorize unprecedented electronic surveillance of Israeli citizens and block parliament from pressing ahead with legislation aimed at pushing him from office. The moves, on the heels of the country’s third inconclusive election in less than a year and under the shadow of Netanyahu’s corruption indictment, sparked leading opposition figure Yair Lapid to tell Israeli citizens that they “no longer live in a democracy.” “There is no judicial branch in Israel. There is no legislative branch in Israel. There is only an unelected government that is headed by a person who lost the election. You can call that by a lot of names, it isn’t a democracy,” he said in a recorded video.  Amid growing anger toward Netanyahu, police on Thursday blocked two convoys of cars from reaching the Knesset, or parliament, where activists planned to protest against the government moves.  Police stopped dozens of cars on a major highway as they made their way to Jerusalem, calling it an “illegal protest.” They also stopped dozens of cars inside Jerusalem from approaching the Knesset. Many of the cars hoisted black flags alongside Israeli flags and honked in protest. “With dictatorship we die,” read one poster. The new coronavirus has spread to more than 100 countries, infected more than 217,000 people worldwide and killed more than 8,700. For most people, it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. Israeli health officials have diagnosed over 400 coronavirus cases, roughly a quarter of them detected in the last 24 hours.  With the numbers quickly rising, authorities have issued a series of tough guidelines that have brought the country to a standstill. People have been instructed to stay home, tens of thousands are in home quarantine and foreigners have been banned from entering the country. Most controversially, the Israeli government instructed the shadowy Shin Bet internal security service to start deploying the agency’s phone surveillance technology to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus in Israel by tracking the moves of the infected.  Israel uses phone surveillance in the occupied Palestinian territories, saying it’s an important tool to prevent attacks on Israelis, but critics say it’s also aimed at maintaining tight control. The surveillance in Israel has sparked widespread criticism from lawmakers and civil rights groups. Opponents planned to file a Supreme Court challenge on Thursday. Many of the measures are not unique to Israel. In neighboring Jordan, King Abdullah II has shut the country’s court system and parliament, as part of an effort to stem the outbreak. Abdullah, who is not elected, appears to have won wide public support for his handling of the crisis. The British government plans to introduce a bill in Parliament on Thursday that will give authorities stronger powers to respond to the pandemic. Many of these are relatively uncontroversial - like allowing retired doctors to return to work without taking a hit on their pensions. But critics have raised questions about some proposals, including a move to give police and immigration officers “powers to detain people and put them in appropriate isolation facilities if necessary to protect public health.” The emergency legislation is due to have a two-year time limit, but opposition lawmakers want a shorter cut-off date. In Israel, Netanyahu has thrived in the crisis, delivering stern televised addresses to the nation each evening.  Presenting himself as the responsible adult steering the country through an unprecedented crisis, he has defended the tough steps, including the electronic surveillance, as measures that he has reluctantly been forced to impose to save lives while his opponents are focused on petty politics.  In a televised interview Wednesday, Netanyahu said that during his 11 years as prime minister, he had previously always refused to use surveillance on Israeli citizens. He said there would be “maximum oversight” to protect privacy concerns. “The last thing I will do is harm democracy,” he said. The liberal Haaretz daily responded Wednesday with a lead editorial titled “An Epidemic of Surveillance.” “Under the cover of the battle against the spread of the coronavirus, Interim Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concentrating more and more power in his hands, with neither balances nor supervision,” it wrote. “At this time of emergency, and in order to keep from sliding down the slippery slope, it is critical to maintain proportionality and oversight.” Following the March 2 election, Netanyahu has the support of only 58 lawmakers, leaving him three short of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset. Sixty-one lawmakers have come out in support of his opponent, Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz, while one refuses to endorse either side.  Backed by a narrow majority, Gantz, a former military chief, was tasked by Israel’s president this week to try to form a new government.  In the meantime, Netanyahu has used a series of executive orders and other tactics to push forward his agenda while preventing parliament from convening. The phone-surveillance plan was approved by the Cabinet in the middle of the night, without the traditional parliamentary oversight that is customary for such decisions.  Blue and White politician Gabi Ashkenazi, another former military chief who was supposed to oversee the committee, called Netanyahu’s move a “heist in the dead of night.”  Blue and White has also taken aim at Netanyahu and his Likud party for preventing the newly elected parliament from convening under the guise of virus-related restrictions on public gatherings.  On Wednesday, Parliament Speaker Yuli Edelstein, a member of Likud, abruptly adjourned the Knesset, freezing Blue and White’s plans to appoint new committees and advance legislation that could limit Netanyahu’s time in office. President Reuven Rivlin warned the country’s democratic system was being threatened. Netanyahu and Gantz held an emergency meeting this week to discuss the possibility of establishing a unity government to end the prolonged political paralysis. But progress appeared unlikely as they continued to bicker. Earlier this week, Netanyahu’s hand-picked justice minister, in the middle of the night, declared a state of emergency in the court system a day before Netanyahu’s trial was to begin. The decree, citing the coronavirus crisis, postponed Netanyahu’s trial until May. In his TV interview, Netanyahu lashed back at his critics. “While I manage the war against the coronavirus and the fight for saving the lives of citizens of Israel,” he said, ”they are only planning how to depose a prime minister.” Netanyahu critics have suggested that the crisis landed on the prime minister’s lap at just the right time. “The coronavirus will pass at some point or another,” commentator Ben Caspit wrote in Maariv. “After we bury our dead, we are also going to have to administer last rites to our democracy.” ____ Follow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London and Omar Akour in Amman contributed to this report.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The wife of Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that she’s facing the same problems as millions of other Californians who are dealing with empty store shelves, closed schools and home confinement as social distancing measures take hold to slow the spread of the coronavirus. “One rose amidst all of this — family dinners and no late night homework stress,” tweeted Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who has four young children. “And nice to not have kids shuffling home late from sports and activities. And yes, unfortunately the thorn - we run out of toilet paper, paper towels, and Kleenex tomorrow. I wish people had not hoarded.” Her remarks were met with scorn. Several critics responded with the famous line attributed to Marie Antoinette: “Let them eat cake!” “Yes, lovely isn’t it?” replied another. “Shame about grandma’s hideous death, but we got some pajama time with the kiddos!” “And having to step over the homeless on your way to search for toilet paper must be an added stress for you,” said another respondent, who added an eye-rolling emoji. “Poor darling!” said another tweet. “Maybe you can send the state patrol out to appropriate some from the peasants.” Eleven Northern California counties and the Southern California city of Palm Springs have told residents to stay home, except to buy groceries, visit the doctor or do anything deemed essential. Virtually all schools around the state have closed classrooms for several weeks, and Gov. Newsom has said that they may need to remain shut for the rest of the school year. Newsom also has encouraged people 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions to stay indoors. He’s also called for the shutdown of bars, movie theaters, gyms and other gathering places, and for restaurants to only serve food to go — restrictions already in place in Los Angeles and several other major cities.

"NEW YORK — Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson says he felt a “moral obligation” to meet with President Donald Trump and warn him personally about the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. Carlson told Vanity Fair that “I didn’t feel it was my role” but was convinced by his wife to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on March 7. Two nights later on his Fox show, he issued a pointed warning to viewers to prepare for the coming storm. It speaks to both Fox News’ influence with the president and his supporters that a cable news host was able to contact the White House and successfully request the two-hour meeting. Carlson drove to the president’s resort from his Florida home, ironically on the day some guests at Mar-a-Lago were exposed to the virus. He declined a request to speak to The Associated Press about it on Wednesday, and the White House said it would not comment on a private meeting. Carlson had sounded the alarm about the coronavirus on his show earlier than this month. On Jan. 28, he criticized the media for spending more time on the impeachment trial than the virus and, on Feb. 3, told viewers that “you should be concerned.” Yet his blunt March 9 commentary was eye-opening, particularly in how it contrasted with attitudes expressed by some Fox colleagues. At the same time as he was talking, Trish Regan on the sister Fox Business Network was denouncing the “coronavirus impeachment scam,” suggesting the stories were an attempt to attack the president. Four days later, Fox shelved her show. “People you know will get sick,” Carlson said that night. “Some may die. This is real. That’s the point of this script — to tell you that.” Carlson said the nation’s leaders haven’t helped citizens take it seriously, criticizing liberals for saying it was racist to refer to “The Chinese Coronavirus” - words displayed on the screen behind him. “If we’re being honest, the other side has not been especially helpful, either,” Carlson said. “People you trust — people you probably voted for — have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem. It’s just partisan politics, they say, calm down. In the end this is just like the flu and people die of that every year.” It’s not, he said, noting that the death rate for the coronavirus was much higher. He named no names. His fellow Fox News host, Sean Hannity, has repeatedly brought up seasonal flu in connection with the coronavirus, to the point where Dr. Anthony Fauci implored him last week not to ignore the new disease’s lethality. Most people who get the coronavirus have only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. Fox confirmed that Carlson has not been tested for the disease and hasn’t experienced any symptoms. Carlson told Vanity Fair that he told Trump “exactly what I’ve said on TV, that this could be really bad.” He hasn’t talked about his meeting on television and wanted to keep it a secret, although it was revealed in a story by The New York Times. After weeks of trying to downplay the risk of the coronavirus, Trump has taken a more urgent tone in recent days and led daily briefings with federal leaders about developments. “I think a lot of people around him, and I mean broadly around him - particularly Republican members on Capitol Hill, in leadership, too - were determined to pretend this wasn’t happening,” he told the magazine. “I felt I had to do it, even though I suspected on some level it would probably hurt me if I did it.” Carlson said it’s hard to tell a straightforward story at a time people see most everything through a partisan or ideological lens. Polls have shown Democrats to be more concerned about the coronavirus than Republicans. “It’s hard to get people’s attention if you know you’re saying something that they suspect is political propaganda,” he said. “It’s something people have worried about for a long time — what if there’s a crisis, and no one will believe the coverage? Well, OK, that’s where we are.” He said a lot of people are to blame for that, “including probably me.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on Thursday said he thinks Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin is open to expanded unemployment insurance benefits in the next tranche of federal spending to deal with the expanding coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Schumer, who said he hoped to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Thursday to talk about a path forward, said he wants to “massively expand unemployment insurance.” “You get full salary, you get it quickly, the application process is very, very simple, and it goes for a long period of time,” Mr. Schumer, New York Democrat, said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” He said he spoke to Mr. Mnuchin about it this week to stress the importance. “He seemed very open to it. I was very glad about that,” the senator said. But Mr. Schumer also said Mr. Mnuchin has something of a “Wall Street view.” “I don’t, and we’re going to have to make sure that is curbed, his view, in what we propose. But we got to move forward. We got to come together and move forward,” he said. Mr. Schumer also said Democrats will push for boosts in worker pay, paid sick and family leave, and expanded hospital capacity. President Trump on Wednesday signed into law a $105 billion bill that expands paid sick leave, allows for free coronavirus testing and boosts unemployment insurance. The administration is now eyeing a trillion dollar-plus plan to try to boost an economy that’s being ravaged by COVID-19, the diseased caused by the novel coronavirus.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday said President Trump must use a Korean War-era law to procure hospital gear immediately instead of waiting for the coronavirus crisis to worsen, saying there is “not a day to lose.” The California Democrat said the Defense Production Act is the right tool to rush much-needed ventilators, diagnostic tests, masks and other personal protective equipment to health workers who might be overrun and ill-equipped for the pandemic. The 1950 act gives the president broad powers to procure materials from private industries. “Right now, shortages of critical medical and personal protective equipment are harming our ability to fight the coronavirus epidemic, endangering frontline workers and making it harder to care for those who fall ill,” Mrs. Pelosi said. “The president must immediately use the powers of the Defense Production Act to mass-produce and coordinate distribution of these critical supplies before the need worsens and the shortages become even more dire.” Mr. Trump signed an executive order that paves the way for his invocation of the act, though he later tweeted that he will only use it in the worst-case scenarios, so “hopefully there will be no need.” Democrats who urged the president to invoke the Defense Production Act a week ago say the need is there. “There is not a day to lose,” Mrs. Pelosi said. “We must put more testing, more protective equipment and more ventilators into the hands of our frontline workers immediately.” The coronavirus causes a disease, COVID-19, which is mild in some but can cause several respiratory distress and death. It has infected more than 9,400 people in the U.S. and killed at least 150, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

"LONDON (AP) - An independent report sharply criticized Britain’s Conservative government on Thursday for the way it treated long-term U.K. residents who were wrongly caught up in a government drive to reduce illegal immigration. The report said the U.K. Home Office exhibited “institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness” towards the issue of race and the history of the mostly Caribbean immigrants involved that are “consistent with some definitions of institutional racism.” Those affected belong to the “Windrush generation,” named for the ship Empire Windrush, which in 1948 brought hundreds of Caribbean immigrants to Britain. The country was then seeking nurses, railway workers and others to help it rebuild after the devastation of World War II.  They and subsequent Caribbean migrants came from British colonies or ex-colonies and had an automatic right to settle in the U.K. But some became ensnared by tough new rules introduced beginning in 2012 that were intended to make Britain a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants.  In recent years, some of them, now elderly, were refused medical care or threatened with deportation because they could not produce paperwork proving their right to reside in the U.K. Some were even deported. Lead author Wendy Williams, a lawyer and former inspector of police, said “members of the Windrush generation and their children have been poorly served by this country. “They had every right to be here and should never have been caught in the immigration net,” she said. Home Secretary Priti Patel apologized to those caught up in the scandal, who endured “insensitive treatment by the very country they called home.” “There is nothing that I can say today which will undo the pain, the suffering and the misery inflicted upon the Windrush generation,” she told lawmakers in the House of Commons. “What I can do is say that on behalf of this and successive governments, I am truly sorry for the actions that spanned decades and I’m sorry that people’s trust has been betrayed.” Legal Windrush migrants had been denied housing, jobs or medical treatment because of requirements that landlords, employers and doctors in the U.K. check people’s immigration status. Others were told by the government that they were in Britain illegally and had to leave.  The scandal drew in former Prime Minister Theresa May, who was home secretary when the “hostile environment” policy was introduced. May apologized Thursday and said the government had to take heed of the report’s findings. “This generation came here, they were British, they were here legally, they worked to build our country and they should not have been treated in this way,” she said. Among 30 recommendations, Williams argued for a review of the hostile environment policy and said the Home Office should establish a race advisory board. A compensation scheme has been set up for with an estimated budget of at least 200 million pounds ($229 million). But campaigners have criticized the “paltry” number of people who have so far received payments and called the process “slow and onerous.” David Lammy, a lawmaker from the main opposition Labour Party whose parents came to Britain from Guyana, said in light of the coronavirus pandemic it was “hard to imagine” a worse time for this report to be published.  “For the sake of all those black British citizens who were deported, detained, made homeless, jobless, denied healthcare housing and welfare by their own government, we cannot allow this news to be buried,” he said in a tweet. ___ Follow all AP stories about British politics and Brexit negotiations at https://apnews.com/Brexit  ",UK government slammed for failing its Windrush immigrants,"Thursday, March 19, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/19/uk-government-slammed-for-failing-its-windrush-imm/,washington_times
"HOUSTON (AP) - A man died by apparent suicide at one of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s family detention centers, according to a legal group that was representing him.  The group, RAICES, did not identify the man, and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement late Wednesday, RAICES said it was representing the man while he was detained at the Karnes County Residential Center in South Texas. His death on Wednesday was the ninth to occur in ICE custody since the start of the governmental fiscal year in October, exceeding the eight deaths that occurred in the prior year.  It comes as advocates have called on ICE to reduce its detainee population and its operations to arrest migrants in the U.S. without authorization amid the coronavirus outbreak. ICE said Wednesday that it would scale back enforcement to detain “public safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds.”  “We anticipate that this won’t be the last death at Karnes unless ICE immediately releases all those detained at this detention center and in custody around the country,” Lucia Allain, a spokeswoman for RAICES, said in a statement. “A dirty and cramped detention center in the face of a pandemic is unsafe and inhumane.” In sworn legal declarations the group released Tuesday, two migrants reported getting sick from the drinking water they are provided at Karnes, which had 680 people in detention last week. Another migrant said detainees are denied access to hand sanitizer. They are instead told to use body wash in the showers to clean their hands at all times. ICE said in a statement that the facility has hand soap dispensers that are checked twice daily and detained migrants are “encouraged” to report any shortages. The agency also said it provides free water, milk, and juice.  Already, illnesses spread quickly in Karnes and other detention centers, said Andrea Meza, director of family detention services for RAICES. “When you’re there, all the kids are coughing,” she said. “Everybody has a runny nose and a sore throat and diarrhea.”  ",Man dies by apparent suicide in ICE family detention center,"Thursday, March 19, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/19/man-dies-by-apparent-suicide-in-ice-family-detenti/,washington_times
"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - After questioning the seriousness of COVID-19, defying his own health ministry’s recommendations and denouncing a “certain hysteria,” Brazil’s president is now projecting himself as leading the nation’s response to the coronavirus crisis in what has become one of the biggest challenges to his presidency.  President Jair Bolsonaro provoked the ire of many Brazilians and even former political allies with his blasé attitude to the global pandemic and insistence on shaking supporters’ hands at a protest. One of Brazil’s most popular news sites, UOL, reported Bolsonaro had suggested the Chinese government caused the coronavirus outbreak - a claim later voiced publicly by his son, a lawmaker. China’s embassy rebuffed the allegations, saying on Twitter they were “extremely irresponsible.” While countries around Latin America and the world have closed borders, quarantined millions, canceled international flights, and shut down schools, Brazil has done none of these things, except for closing a stretch of its vast border with Venezuela. Flights continue in and out of the country. No lockdowns have been ordered and state governments and municipalities have taken the lead in telling people to stay home. “Coronavirus in Brazil is acting as a kind of catalyst, channeling all this discontent and accelerating the process” against Bolsonaro, said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at the Insper University in Sao Paulo. “When he came out to the streets for the protests, he made a very big, very serious mistake. Now he is trying to regain control.”  Faced with a growing backlash, a concerned-looking Bolsonaro, flanked by many of his ministers, on Wednesday gave his first press conference on the coronavirus at Brazil’s presidential palace. During the two-hour event, Bolsonaro said he would redouble efforts to fight COVID-19, but did not announce any new measures. For the first time since the outbreak, he thanked lawmakers for their efforts and called on them to approve a “state of calamity,” which would allow the government to spend more than the annual budget allows, with funds going toward health and job preservation. But the press conference conveyed mixed messages about how to deal with the pandemic. While vowing to fight the outbreak, he sat shoulder-to-shoulder with his ministers in a violation of the social distancing prescribed by international authorities. Government officials wore white masks, but several of them, including Bolsonaro, removed them repeatedly when speaking. “As the head of the executive I have to be in the front lines with my people,” Brazil’s president said. “Don’t be surprised if you see me entering a crowded bar in Sao Paulo, a ferry from Niteroi to Rio or in a bus in Belo Horizonte.” Critics say Bolsonaro’s about-face on the virus follows U.S. President Donald Trump’s example. But for many, it is too little, too late. Brazil’s president had until recently remained largely absent from press conferences, leaving them to ministers or top health officials. Over the weekend, he was seen meeting and shaking hands with a group of supporters. His decision to come into physical contact with the crowd while awaiting final results of his second COVID-19 test contradicted the recommendations his health minister previously issued about avoiding large gatherings. “How does a man who is possibly infected go into the middle of a crowd?” Janaina Paschoal told fellow lawmakers in Sao Paulo’s legislature. “This man has to leave the Presidency of the Republic, let (vice-president Hamilton) Mourão, who understands matters of defense, lead the nation.” Paschoal, a conservative who was once in the running to be Bolsonaro’s vice-president, had criticized the president but never before demanded he step down. Multiple members of Bolsonaro’s administration have contracted the coronavirus. His top national security adviser, Gen. Augusto Heleno, confirmed Tuesday he tested positive after attending a recent trip to the U.S. along with Bolsonaro. According to online news site G1, more than a dozen members of a delegation who met with President Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago have also received positive test results. So far more than 400 people have been infected in Brazil, and four have died, with officials expecting that number to rise significantly in the coming days. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority recover. Lawmaker Alexandre Frota, another close ally turned critic, said Monday he has prepared an impeachment request he will send to congress. Bolsonaro maintains a strained relationship with the speaker of the lower house, Rodrigo Maia, but it is unlikely congress would consider an impeachment request amid the crisis. Even his intellectual guru, Olavo de Carvalho, a conservative Brazilian writer who lives in the U.S., posted a Facebook message suggesting Bolsonaro was on the wrong course and poorly advised. “From the beginning of his term I told the president he should disarm his enemies before trying to solve any ‘national problem.’ He did the opposite,” Carvalho wrote. “I am sorry. Now it may be too late to react.” On Tuesday and Wednesday night, Brazilians in cities including Sao Paulo, Rio and Brasilia protested Bolsonaro in one of the few ways possible at a time of social distancing: leaning from their windows and banging pots and pans. Some shouted “Bolsonaro out!”  On his official Twitter account, Bolsonaro complained the media had failed to communicate a counter pots-and-pans protest in favor of his administration, which took place a half hour later. That demonstration wasn’t nearly as loud or as long, and participants were shouted at by those in neighboring buildings. –– AP reporter Mauricio Savarese contributed to this report from Sao Paulo and David Biller from Rio.

"The average family of four will receive $3,000 from the government next month under the economic relief plan proposed by the White House to counter the coronavirus pandemic. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Thursday the direct payments in April would include $1,000 per adult and $500 per child. He said the checks would go out three weeks after Congress approves the plan. A second round of payments would go out in May if the president hasn’t lifted his national disaster declaration. “We’ve told the House and the Senate we need to get this done quickly,” Mr. Mnuchin told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “This needs to be done by the beginning of next week.” Senate Republicans are working with the White House on the package, which is expected to total about $1.3 trillion. It includes guaranteed loans for small businesses and affected industries such as airlines. Mr. Mnuchin said he also has been conferring this week with Democratic leaders. The House isn’t in session this week, and plans to convene next week. President Trump on Wednesday night signed emergency legislation that provides more than $100 billion for free coronavirus testing, expanded unemployment insurance, paid sick and family leave and expanded food security programs. Mr. Mnuchin didn’t reject a suggestion by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow that the government is considering asking corporations for equity stakes in return for aid from taxpayers. “We’re looking at making secured loans on market terms,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “We’ll see whether that includes equity or doesn’t include equity. We’re not going to force things on people, but people who need liquidity, we’re going to make sure that the taxpayers are compensated fairly.” The Treasury secretary, citing action by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Agency to suspend foreclosures and evictions, urged private banks to follow suit. “My expectation is … the banks will follow,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “We do not want to be foreclosing on people during this 90-day period.” HUD said Wednesday it will suspend foreclosures and evictions for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration until the end of April, a move that will affect about 8.1 million mortgages. The Federal Housing Finance Agency also ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the companies behind about half of all mortgages in the nation, to suspend foreclosures and evictions for any single-family mortgages for at least 60 days.

"A group of “pop-up” super PACs successfully concealed nearly $24 million in spending between last month’s Nevada caucuses and the March 17 primaries, according to a new analysis from the Center for Responsive Politics’ OpenSecrets.org. Super PACs are required by law to disclose their donors, but by carefully timing their launch and quickly spending their war chest just before an election, they can skirt disclosing donors until after election day, leading campaign-finance watchers to tag them as “pop-up” operations. The Center for Responsive Politics found ‘at least’ 11 different groups deploying this method in presidential, Senate, and House races leading into the March 17 primaries. “The current reporting rules were crafted more than four decades ago, when committee treasurers typed their reports with typewriters and mailed their disclosures to the [Federal Election Commission],” wrote Karl Evers-Hillstrom at the Center for Responsive Politics. “Now, campaigns and outside groups maintain electronic databases of their contributions and spending, making it easy to file reports quickly. But the rules have not been updated to keep up with technological changes.” Persist PAC, a super PAC supporting Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s now-defunct presidential campaign, accounted for $14.8 million of the nearly $24 million tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics. Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s since-shuttered presidential campaign benefited from the practice as well, with Kitchen Table Conversation spending $2.7 million and using similar methods, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Some groups that comply with disclosure requirements by filing reports on a monthly basis rather than in pre-primary reports will not need to reveal their February donors until Friday.

"Ford O’Connell, a Republican candidate running in southwest Florida to replace retiring GOP Rep. Francis Rooney, suspended his campaign Thursday due to the spread of COVID-19, making it too difficult to run a thorough campaign. “After much thought and careful consideration, it is with a heavy heart I announce that I have decided to withdraw my candidacy for the FL-19 U.S. congressional seat,” Mr. O’Connell announced in a press release. The Republican strategist said lives are at stake during the global pandemic, which weighed on his decision. “As a result of the Chinese coronavirus outbreak, we cannot run the type of campaign we wanted to run; one where we go to local events and meetings, schools and libraries, museums and restaurants, and speak to voters and hear about the issues that matter to them, where we get our message out face-to-face with citizens at the grassroots level through an exchange of ideas, having real conversations that matter, rather than in 30-second TV ads,” he said. “Public safety is paramount, and an election where voters’ health may be endangered to run a campaign by, for, and of the people is not one in which I can in good conscience continue,” Mr. O’Connell added. He said he will donate a portion of his campaign funds to the American Red Cross and the Harry Chapin Food Bank of Southwest Florida. His move comes days after a 24-year-old Christy McLaughlin entered the field, also running on a pro-Trump platform. Florida state Reps. Heather Fitzenhagen and Dane Eagle are also competing for the seat. The primary for Florida’s 19th Congressional District is scheduled for August.

"The top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday condemned China’s recent move to expel 13 American journalists in response to a new visa limit imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese state-owned media in the U.S. In a letter to the ambassador of the People’s Republic of China, Cui Tiankai, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas slammed what he called “ill-advised and dangerous” actions and called on the Chinese government to reverse the decision banning the journalists. “By attempting to silence our journalists, you are serving only to build up their resolve to expose the truth; the truth you continue to obfuscate,” he wrote. “What the Foreign Ministry may believe is a projection of the CCP’s strength, is viewed in Washington and around the world as the actions of an insecure regime afraid of accountability and sunlight.” The ranking member warned the journalist’s expulsion will have harsh implications on “one of the world’s most important bilateral relationships and undermining global security,” pointing to China’s initial efforts to downplay the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement earlier Thursday accusing the United States of “discrimination and politically-motivated oppression” against Chinese media outlets. Mr. McCaul defended the U.S.’s visa limits and said the move seeks to “reasonably limit operations by China’s propaganda agencies in the United States.” “They did not limit legitimate news organizations ability to operate and were long overdue,” he continued, adding praise of the State Department’s move.

"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii on Thursday pulled the plug on her presidential campaign and endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. “Today, I’m suspending my presidential campaign and offering my full support to Vice President Joe Biden in his quest to bring our country together,” Ms. Gabbard said. Ms. Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran, had run on a staunchly anti-interventionist platform and consistently warned against the destabilizing effects of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East. But her bid failed to gain traction in what had once been a crowded 2020 Democratic field. She won two delegates based on her performance in the American Samoa caucuses, but in recent contests was finishing behind candidates who had already suspended their campaigns. Ms. Gabbard’s exit means that Mr. Biden and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont are the only two major Democratic contenders still actively seeking the nomination. She said after Tuesday’s primary results, “it’s clear” that primary voters have picked Mr. Biden to be the candidate who will take on President Trump. Mr. Biden is on the cusp of putting Mr. Sanders away after racking up comfortable wins in Florida, Illinois and Arizona this week. “Although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know that he has a good heart, and he’s motivated by his love for our country and the American people,” Ms. Gabbard said. She said she was grateful to have called Mr. Biden’s late son Beau, who like Ms. Gabbard served in the National Guard, a friend. Ms. Gabbard said she extended “best wishes” to Mr. Sanders, his team and his supporters. “I have such a great appreciation for Senator Sanders’ love for our country and the American people and his sincere desire to improve the lives of all Americans,” she said. Ms. Gabbard had resigned her post as a Democratic National Committee vice chair in 2016 to endorse Mr. Sanders over Hillary Clinton in that year’s Democratic presidential primary contest. She called on Americans to come together in the face of the coronavirus threat in the way the country did after 9/11. “It is once again time, as Americans and as neighbors in this global community, that we stand together … and work hand in hand to defeat this new enemy — the coronavirus,” she said. Ms. Gabbard had said in October that she wouldn’t seek reelection to the House, which raises questions about her future plans. Her failed run did elevate her profile nationally as she earned a reputation as a maverick Democrat willing to defy her party. Ms. Gabbard frequently criticized the DNC and the metrics the party used to determine which candidates qualified for the debate stages. She has irked Democrats with such criticisms, as well as with her quizzical relationship with leaders such as Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. The congresswoman broke with her party to vote “present” in December on the two articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump. Ms. Gabbard also sued Mrs. Clinton earlier this year, saying the former secretary of state defamed her by calling her a “Russian asset” in a podcast interview last year. In a court filing last week, Mrs. Clinton’s legal team moved to dismiss the case and suggested that Ms. Gabbard was doing it for publicity. “This lawsuit — which seeks $100 million in damages for a single passing remark made by Secretary Clinton in a 40-minute podcast interview about the 2020 election — is an effort by Rep.

"President Trump said Thursday he directed the Food and Drug Administration to approve the use of drug therapies that might work against coronavirus, including an anti-malarial drug. Mr. Trump said the drug, hydroxychloroquine, had a “very encouraging” impact on patients with the virus and is “not going to kill anybody,” since it is a well-established treatment for malaria. With FDA’s blessing, states can now administer the drug to coronavirus patients through a prescription. “We’re going to be able to make the drug available almost immediately,” Mr. Trump said. The president also cited the promise of another drug, remdesivir, from Gilead Sciences and separate work from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals on alternatives. The FDA is expanding the “compassionate use” of drugs that aren’t fully licensed for use against the coronavirus so that patients can try them amid the crisis. “They’re already approved for other diseases,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said. The coronavirus has infected more than 9,400 Americans and killed at least 150, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Testing is ramping up, however, so the full extent of the situation is unknown. China, meanwhile, reported zero local infections for the first time since the start of the outbreak — a major breakthrough, though many people do not trust the numbers from the communist government. Mr. Trump complained that Beijing’s reluctance to identify and trumpet their epidemic out of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in December and January resulted in the global crisis. “It could have been stopped right where it came from, China,” Mr. Trump said. The administration is pleading with Americans to stay home when possible, avoid groups of 10 or more and to enjoy takeout instead of entering restaurants, many of which have closed, anyway. Changes have affected the White House itself. Reporters have their temperatures checked at the gate and must sit with seats in between them in the briefing room. “With social distancing, the media has been much nicer,” Mr. Trump said.

"Two senators on Thursday pushed a bipartisan measure to move toward remote voting as lawmakers continue to try and balance legislating and the health risks posed by the coronavirus outbreak. On Thursday, Sens. Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, and Rob Portman, Ohio Republican, introduced a resolution that would change the Senate’s rules to allow for remote voting during a national crisis. “In times of a national emergency, the Senate must be able to convene and act expeditiously even if we can’t be together in person. It’s during times like this, when we have a pandemic affecting every corner of society and we are asking people to stay in their homes, that we should have the ability to convene the Senate and get our work done even if we can’t be in the Capitol,” Mr. Portman said in a statement. Mr. Durbin stressed that changing the rules would bring the chamber, rooted in tradition, up to the task of facing 21st century threats. On Sunday, Mr. Durbin warned that members shouldn’t have returned from recess — putting them and their staff at risk of exposure — and pass the second coronavirus package unanimously. Mr. McConnell was not open to the idea earlier this week. “We’ll not be doing that. There are a number of different ways to avoid getting too many people together,” he said. To mitigate the risk, senators have an extended 30-minute window to vote, with the leader urging members not to congregate and practice social distancing as they enter and leave the chamber. On the House side, Democratic leadership has delayed their return from this one-week recess until there is legislation their chamber needs to vote on. The push to allow members to join the majority of the country working from home comes as the coronavirus hits Capitol Hill. As of Wednesday, two lawmakers — Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, Florida Republican, and Rep. Ben McAdams, Utah Democrat — announced they had tested positive for the coronavirus. Both were at the House’s vote last Saturday. Some staffers in both the Senate and House offices have revealed they’ve also tested positive for the coronavirus, and dozens of lawmakers have closed their offices and sent staffers to work from home.

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell outlined the Republican priorities for the phase three coronavirus economic spending package that lawmakers are feverishly working on across Capitol Hill. A four-part plan, Republicans aim to extend loans to small businesses; checks to the American public; major support to hard-hit industries; and more funds to the overly strained health care system. In all, the phase three bill is expected to cost more than $1 trillion.  “These are not ordinary policies. This is no ordinary time,” the Kentucky Republican said. Mr. McConnell highlighted the $300 billion small business relief planned rolled out by Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Susan Collins of Maine on Wednesday. It would provide loans to qualifying companies to go toward payroll and other operating expenses. “No massive new bureaucracy. We want to let qualified small businesses get liquidity through familiar institutions — their own community banks, credit unions or nationwide lenders,” Mr. McConnell said. “But more broadly, we need to help keep as many Americans as possible on the job and connected to their employers,” he added. Republicans, led by Sen. Charles E. Grassley, are finalizing a proposal to get money directly into the pockets of the U.S. public to either help cover bills as their works shutter or give more security to spend in the struggling economy. The administration has called for sending checks to American families across the country — $1,000 for every adult and $500 per child — starting in April. A third part of the stimulus package would go toward hard-hit sectors of the economy that have all but ground to a halt in light of the coronavirus — particularly the airlines and cruise industries. Mr. McConnell stressed that he did not want to consider these policies as bailouts, as members have been skittish with revisiting the controversial policies of the early 2000s. “We are not talking about a taxpayer-funded cushion for companies that made mistakes,” he said. “We are talking about loans, which must be repaid, for American employers whom the government itself is temporarily crushing for the sake of public health.” The package will also shore up resources for the straining health care system, which is struggling to have enough equipment and funds to address the influx of patients. Even in laying out this third massive economic package, Mr. McConnell is looking ahead to a fourth piece of legislation — an appropriation package to keep health departments and programs funded. “The legislation I’ve just laid out will not be the last word. As I said, we’ll need to turn right away to a bipartisan appropriations process,” Mr. McConnell said. Democrats have criticized Republicans for not looping them in on the negotiations from the start, calling for a “four corners” process that would bring the four-party leaders on Capitol Hill together to hammer out a deal.

"President Trump on Thursday directed the Food and Drug Administration to repurpose an anti-malarial drug for use against the coronavirus and told states to order ventilators instead of relying on him, saying his administration is “not a shipping clerk.” He blamed China for the spread of the virus, amid claims he was not prepared, and pledged to “live with” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s decision on whether to postpone the Summer Games in Tokyo. Mr. Trump said the malaria drug — hydroxychloroquine — had a “very encouraging” impact on patients with the virus and it is “not going to kill anybody,” since it is a well-established treatment. The Food and Drug Administration says states can administer the drug to coronavirus patients through a prescription. “We’re going to be able to make the drug available almost immediately,” Mr. Trump said. The president also cited the promise of another drug, remdesivir, from Gilead Sciences. Remdesivir has been used in Washington state under “compassionate use,” a process in which drugs that aren’t fully licensed for use can be wielded against new threats. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said he’s accelerating that process for a range of existing drugs, though clinical trials and widespread use could be months away. “They’re already approved for other diseases,” he said. Mr. Trump is scrambling to keep up with a coronavirus that has infected more than 9,400 Americans and killed at least 150, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Testing is ramping up, however, so the full extent of the situation is unknown. Deborah Birx, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, said testing is unveiling many more cases, though the proportion of people coming back positive is about 10% to 11%. “That means that 90% of the illnesses out there, even the severe ones, are not COVID-19,” she said. She said about half of the U.S. cases are concentrated in 10 counties, as hot spots in Washington state, California and New York take stringent measures to restrict public movement. “I think they actually are doing a lot. I know New York has been doing a lot,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re all working very hard to quarantine.” Mr. Trump insisted his administration was prepared for the pandemic, despite widespread reports of shortages of medical equipment and testing. “Nobody in their wildest dreams would have ever thought that we need tens of thousands of ventilators,” Mr. Trump said. A New York Times report on Thursday said government exercises, including one run last year, warned the U.S. was unprepared for a pandemic like the one that’s unfolding now. “We were very prepared. The only thing we weren’t prepared for is the media,” Mr. Trump said, arguing he didn’t get credit for his early decision to restrict travel from China. The president also said he hasn’t used the Defense Production Act, despite preparing to invoke it Wednesday, because he expects states to order things like ventilators first. He said he will use federal power to direct procurement as needed. “The states are supposed to get it, but we’re helping the states,” Mr. Trump said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Mr. Trump should use the full powers of the Korean War-era law immediately, saying there isn’t a day to lose as hospitals complain of shortages. Some health workers were told to use bandannas in lieu of masks. China, meanwhile, reported zero local infections for the first time since the start of the outbreak — a major breakthrough, though many people do not trust the numbers from the communist government. Mr. Trump complained that Beijing’s reluctance to identify and trumpet their epidemic out of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in December and January resulted in the global crisis. “It could have been stopped right where it came from, China,” Mr. Trump said.

"President Trump’s reelection campaign on Thursday released a detailed timeline of White House actions against the coronavirus outbreak, moving to blunt criticism that his response to the crisis was slow or inadequate. The timeline begins with China’s Dec. 31 report of discovering the novel coronavirus and lists 56 steps the Trump administration took to protect Americans over the ensuing two and half months. The early moves included the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice for Wuhan, China, where the virus erupted, within a week of the Dec. 1 report. The campaign described the timelines as “decisive actions to combat the coronavirus.” The liberal news media and the president’s political foes, including likely Democratic presidential nominee Joseph R. Biden, have accused Mr. Trump of not moving fast enough to protect the U.S. “Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,” Mr. Biden said last week. “Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president fueled by adversarial relationship with the truth that he continues to have.” Mr. Biden, a former vice president, also accused Mr. Trump of rejecting an offer of coronavirus testing kits from the World Health Organization. The independent fact-checking organization PolitiFact rated Mr. Biden’s claim “mostly false.” Mr. Trump frequently cites his early decision to restrict visitors from China as helping slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus known as COVID-19. He also has bristled at the negative news coverage of the efforts. “It amazes me when I read the things that I read,” Mr. Trump said at a daily briefing Thursday, calling out The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post. “They use different slogans and different concepts almost every week, trying to catch something. Last week it was ‘chaos.’ You see me. I’m the one telling everyone to be calm. There’s no chaos in the White House.” Key events in the campaign’s timeline included: • January 7: The CDC established a coronavirus incident management system to better share and respond to information about the virus. • January 17: The CDC began implementing public health entry screening at the 3 U.S. airports that received the most travelers from Wuhan – San Francisco, New York JFK, and Los Angeles. • January 20: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health’s infections disease institute, announces the efforts to develop a vaccine. • January 21: The CDC activated its emergency operations center to provide ongoing support to the coronavirus response. • January 31: Mr. Trump declared a public health emergency, announced Chinese travel restrictions, and suspended entry into the U.S. for foreign nationals at risk of transmitting the virus. • February 4: Mr. Trump vowed in the State of the Union Address to “take all necessary steps” to protect Americans from the coronavirus. • February 11: The Department of Health and Human Services expanded a partnership with Janssen Research & Development to “expedite the development” of a coronavirus vaccine. • February 24: The administration sent a letter to Congress requesting at least $2.5 billion to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. • February 29: The administration announced a level 4 travel advisory to areas of Italy and South Korea, barred all travel to Iran, barred the entry of foreign citizens who visited Iran in the last 14 days. • March 3: The CDC lifted federal restrictions on coronavirus testing to allow any American to be tested “subject to doctor’s orders.” • March 13: Mr. Trump announced public-private partnerships to open drive-through testing sites, a pause on interest payments on federal student loans, and an order to the Department of Energy to purchase oil for the strategic petroleum reserve. • March 18: Mr. Trump announced a temporary closure of the U.S.-Canada border to non-essential traffic and plans to invoke the Defense Production Act in order to increase the number of necessary supplies needed to combat coronavirus. The U.S. death toll from the virus rose to 160 on Thursday with more then 10,700 cases reported, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally of the viruses spread around the globe.

The detentions came as the Egyptian government tries to maintain its firm grip on dissent amid a burgeoning world health crisis. According to human rights groups, there are tens of thousands imprisoned in Egypt for their political views.  The four detained women included three family members of jailed prominent Egyptian activist, Alaa Abdel Fattah - his mother, aunt and sister. On Wednesday, the four stood in front of the Cabinet headquarters in downtown Cairo with small signs calling for prisoners to be released because of the virus.  Abdel Fattah’s sister Mona Seif live -streamed a video of herself and the other three as they held up the signs.  “In normal circumstances, Egyptian prisons are epicenters of diseases. Can you imagine how bad things must be now in the midst of an epidemic?” she said in the video. Minutes later, the live stream was cut when police seemed to stop the filming. A prosecutor accused them of violating the country’s strict protest ban with their gathering. Mona Seif, her aunt and the fourth activist were released Thursday evening, 15 hours after posting bail, said another sister, Sanaa Seif, who did not attend the protest, in a Facebook post. She said her mother, Laila Soueif, was taken to a prosecutors’ office for further questioning. Abdel Fattah’s family have all been vocal rights activists in Egypt. Alaa Abdel Fattah, a 38-year-old software engineer, grew into a figurehead of the pro-democracy protest movement on social media during the 2011 uprising that removed longtime President Hosni Mubarak. He served a five-year prison sentence for violating Egypt’s protest ban, and in September, not long after his release, he was arrested again amid a widespread crackdown that followed small protests demanding current President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi step down - though he did not participate in the protests.  Egyptian authorities could not be immediately reached for comment. El-Sissi has maintained in the past that the country has no political prisoners, but tens of thousands have been arrested and handed prison sentences for breaking the protest ban or on vague charges of spreading false news. In recent months, his government has led several press tours of prisons that show them in gleaming condition with modern health facilities. But inmates and rights workers tell a different story, of packed cells with little sunlight.  Egypt has so far registered 210 confirmed cases and six deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic, none of them inside the prison system. The government has taken several precautionary measures to prevent its spread including the suspension of schools, halting of air travel, a partial shut-down of recreational places and the reduction of the workforce in government offices as well as private businesses. It has also stopped family visits to prisons.  Rights groups say that’s not enough for the thousands who shouldn’t be behind bars in the first place, citing examples of releases elsewhere. Iran has let 85,000 prisoners go on temporary leave. Also in Bahrain, hundreds of prisoners were pardoned last week to reduce congestion in prisons.  “Prisoners cannot take their own precautionary measures. They cannot isolate or sanitize themselves. So it is the government’s responsibility to protect them,” said Mohamed Lofty, executive director of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms.

"President Trump accused liberal U.S. media outlets of “siding with China” on Thursday in the coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. During a press briefing at the White House, the president agreed wholeheartedly with a journalist from One America News Network who asked him about “major left-wing news media, even in this room, [who] have teamed up with the Chinese Communist Party narratives and they’re claiming you’re racist …” “They are siding with China,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re siding with many others — China is the least of it. If we had an honest media in this country, our country would be an even greater place.” The president has been hammered by some media outlets in recent days for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” because it originated in Wuhan, China. Mr. Trump has rejected the accusation that he’s being racist. “It amazes me when I read the things that I read,” Mr. Trump said, calling out The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post. “They use different slogans and different concepts almost every week, trying to catch something. Last week it was ‘chaos.’ You see me. I’m the one telling everyone to be calm. There’s no chaos in the White House.” China announced Tuesday that it was expelling journalists from The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post. The president said he is dealing with “corrupt news.” “They write stories without calling anybody. They never call me, ever — at least nobody tells me,” the president said. “We’ve done a phenomenal job on this [pandemic].”  ",Trump accuses liberal media of 'siding with China' on coronavirus pandemic,"Thursday, March 19, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/19/trump-accuses-liberal-media-siding-china-coronavir/,washington_times
"HOUSTON (AP) - A 27-year-old Honduran man died by apparent suicide at one of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s family detention centers, authorities said Thursday.  ICE said the man was pronounced dead at about 12:30 a.m. Wednesday after being found unresponsive at the Karnes County Residential Center in South Texas, which detains about 700 parents and children. ICE did not identify the man. The legal group RAICES says it was representing the man and called his death “devastating.” The death was the ninth to occur in ICE custody since the start of the governmental fiscal year in October, exceeding the eight deaths that occurred in the prior year.  Advocates have called on ICE to reduce its detainee population and its operations to arrest migrants in the U.S. without authorization amid the coronavirus outbreak, which could pose a special risk to people jailed in close quarters.  ICE said Wednesday that it would scale back enforcement to detain “public safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds.”  “We anticipate that this won’t be the last death at Karnes unless ICE immediately releases all those detained at this detention center and in custody around the country,” Lucia Allain, a spokeswoman for RAICES, said in a statement. “A dirty and cramped detention center in the face of a pandemic is unsafe and inhumane.” In sworn legal declarations the group released Tuesday, two migrants reported getting sick from the drinking water they are provided at Karnes, which had 680 people in detention last week. Another migrant said detainees are denied access to hand sanitizer. They are instead told to use body wash in the showers to clean their hands at all times. ICE said in a statement that the facility has hand soap dispensers that are checked twice daily and detained migrants are “encouraged” to report any shortages. The agency also said it provides free water, milk, and juice.  Already, illnesses spread quickly in Karnes and other detention centers, said Andrea Meza, director of family detention services for RAICES. “When you’re there, all the kids are coughing,” she said. “Everybody has a runny nose and a sore throat and diarrhea.”  ",Man dies by apparent suicide in ICE family detention center,"Thursday, March 19, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/19/man-dies-by-apparent-suicide-in-ice-family-detenti/,washington_times
"Free-market principles in Washington have run smack into the election-year coronavirus pandemic. President Trump and Senate Republicans were trying hard on Thursday to portray the biggest economic rescue plan in history, including proposals of $500 billion in cash payouts to families and the possibility of the government becoming temporary part owner of private corporations, as something other than the bailouts of the financial crisis in 2008 or the Obama administration’s much-mocked “stimulus” plan of 2009. That stimulus plan cost taxpayers roughly $820 billion. The TARP aid for banks and auto companies, plus bailouts for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, was about $634 billion, although the companies eventually paid back the loans. The proposal being negotiated by the White House and Senate Republicans is in the neighborhood of $1.3 trillion. “We are not talking about so-called ‘bailouts’ for firms that made reckless decisions,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican. “We are talking about loans, which must be repaid, for American employers whom the government itself is temporarily crushing for the sake of public health.” The idea of throwing hundreds of billions of dollars at corporate America, even in an unprecedented crisis, is making some conservatives squirm. “When it comes to grants or bailouts for big companies, especially at this stage of the game or the ‘phase three,’ there are going to be many of us who harken back to 2008 and won’t be comfortable with that,” said Sen. Mike Braun, Indiana Republican. “You’re picking winners and losers, and it gets very complicated.” As unemployment claims rose 33% last week to 281,000, the president said he’s trying to keep people from losing their jobs and companies from going under. In Ohio, jobless claims rose 48,000 in the first two days of this week, compared to 1,825 for the same two days last week. “We don’t want to pick winners and losers,” Mr. Trump said. “We want everybody to benefit. We want, I think more than anything else, the workers to benefit. If the company goes out of business, no fault of their own, those workers aren’t going to be able to receive a check.” Mr. Trump also said he supports having the federal government take equity stakes in private companies that receive coronavirus aid. “I do, I really do,” he said when asked whether he would approve of the government owning a stake in private companies. But he said he might take a less charitable approach with companies that have used excess cash for stock buybacks to boost the price of their own shares, instead of investing in new equipment. “In some cases, where they did certain things over the course of the years, including by buying back stock, you know, they bought back stock and they paid a high price for it,” Mr. Trump said. “Maybe I view that as a little bit differently than somebody that didn’t, and somebody that built plants all over the United States.” He also said barring companies from using the aid for executive bonuses or stock buybacks “would be OK with me.” The administration’s proposal also would provide hundreds of billions for sectors of the economy that have come to a virtual standstill, such as airlines and hotels. “We will be helping the airline industry. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry,” Mr. Trump said. “You don’t want to lose industries like this. These are incredible industries. You can’t lose them. So we’ll be focused on many industries.” Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Thursday that many of the companies will pay back any loans. “This isn’t about bailing out bad businesses. This isn’t about banks that made bad loans,” Mr. Mnuchin told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “These are about very, very good companies that have been instructed to shut down, so they need liquidity. That’s what they need. In most cases, my expectation is they will be able to pay back these loans.” In the case of small businesses, he said, “if they can’t afford to pay back those loans, we’ll forgive them. I don’t consider that a bailout. I consider that an incentive to keep workers hired.” The U.S. Travel Association, which represents mostly small businesses, said companies in the non-airline travel sector will lose 4.6 million jobs by the end of April. “The only thing that’s going to protect them is aggressive financial relief right now,” said U.S. Travel President and CEO Roger Dow, who spoke with Mr. Trump Tuesday. “We’re witnessing the shutdown of travel.” He said numerous companies are trying to help their employees, but added, “the cold reality is they can’t support their employees if they don’t have any customers, and they don’t have any customers because of the actions needed to halt the spread of coronavirus.” Mr. McConnell outlined Senate Republicans’ four-part plan: $300 billion in loans to small businesses, checks to the American public, major support to hard-hit industries, and more funds to the overly strained healthcare system. The small business relief would give loans to qualifying companies for payroll and other operating expenses. “No massive new bureaucracy. We want to let qualified small businesses get liquidity through familiar institutions — their own community banks, credit unions or nationwide lenders,” Mr. McConnell said. The average family of four would receive $3,000 from the government next month under the economic relief plan proposed by the White House. Mr. Mnuchin said the direct payments in April would include $1,000 per adult and $500 per child, to be delivered three weeks after Congress approves the plan. A second round of payments would go out in May if the president hasn’t lifted his national disaster declaration. “We’ve told the House and the Senate we need to get this done quickly,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “This needs to be done by the beginning of next week.” Under the plan introduced by Senate Republicans late Thursday, the government would provide about $1,200 to Americans making up to $75,000, with another $500 per child. The handouts would then be scaled down between $75,000 and $99,000. It includes a $230 billion loan plan for eligible small businesses to go toward payrolls and other operating expenses to help the companies stay afloat and keep their employees. To aid sectors of the economy devastated by the virus, the package includes $208 billion in loans: $50 billion for airlines, $8 billion for cargo air carriers and $150 billion for other eligible entities. The president sounded unconcerned about the short-term costs to the government, emphasizing the need to get beyond the crisis. “We’re paying a lot of money to stop things [commerce and activities], because we don’t want people to be together,” he said. “But we’re doing the right thing. It’s not a financial war, it’s a medical war.” Mr. Trump also showed some impatience for those dwelling on the harm being inflicted on the economy. When a reporter prefaced his question by pointing out that the economy has “essentially ground to a halt,” Mr. Trump cut in, “Thanks for telling us. We appreciate it.” The reporter continued, “Stores have closed, travel has slowed down …” The president jumped in again. “What’s the rest of your question? Everybody in the room knows that,” he snapped. Stocks posted modest gains on Thursday, recovering from a three-year low as cheap oil prices jumped the highest ever in a single day and Mr. Trump highlighted possible coronavirus therapies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 188 points, or 0.9%, to close at 20,087. The tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 2.3%, and the S&P 500 rose 0.47%. U.S. oil prices surged 23%, posting its best day ever and recovering about half of Wednesday’s losses. The Fed also said late Wednesday it would start a new lending facility to support U.S. money-market mutual funds. Mr. Mnuchin said the move “will enhance the liquidity and smooth functioning of money markets, support the flow of credit to hard-working Americans, and help stabilize the broader financial system.” • Gabriella Muñoz contributed to this article, which is based in part on wire-service reports.

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced the GOP’s coronavirus phrase three package Thursday afternoon. “As our nation confronts this health crisis and the economic crisis it is spawning, Senate Republicans have prepared a bold legislative proposal,” the Kentucky Republican said. “We hope this bold new proposal will find a similar degree of bipartisan respect and mutual urgency on the other side of the aisle, and across the Capitol.” In all, the phase three bill is expected to cost over $1 trillion. In the four-part plan, Republicans aim to extend loans to small businesses, checks to the American public, major support to hard-hit industries and more funds to the overly strained healthcare system. Under this proposal, the government would provide about $1,200 to Americans making up to $75,000. The handouts would then be scaled down between $75,000 and $99,000 and provide $500 per child. The bill also delays the tax filing deadline from April 15 to July 15. It includes a $230 billion loan plan for eligible small businesses to go towards payrolls and other operating expenses to help these companies stay afloat and keep their employees. To aid the certain sectors of the economy devastated by the virus, the package includes $208 billion in loans. That figure breaks down to $50 billion for airlines, $8 billion for cargo air carriers and $150 billion for other eligible entities. However, the Republican leadership still needs to get Democrats on board with its plan. The group of senators Mr. McConnell tasked with crafting the legislation — leadership from four economic committees and the Senate’s health committee — are set to discuss the proposals with the Democrats on their panel. “These are urgent discussions and they need to happen at a member level, starting now,” Mr. McConnell said. Democrats, who still need to review the nearly 250-page bill, are putting their focuses on expanding benefits to workers — particularly paid leave and a “dramatic bolstering” unemployment insurance. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer has called for a “Marshall plan” to shore up resources for the strained healthcare system. However, while Democrats are supportive of aiding small business, Mr. Schumer said he was concerned about the proposal for aid to the hard-hit sectors of the economy. “We don’t want these industries to go under, but we certainly don’t want the dollars that are put there to go to corporate executives or shareholders,” he said. “Our plan says no bailout that goes to people at the top.” Senate leadership has vowed not to leave Congress until this third economic plan is passed.

"Americans are more worried about their finances than getting the coronavirus, as the pandemic hamstrings major sectors of the U.S. economy. A survey released Tuesday by FinanceBuzz.com found “Americans are more worried about unexpected expenses (79%) and paying their bills (68%) than catching COVID-19 (63%).” To assess the personal economic impact of the outbreak, the alphabet provides a key. “Is this going to be a ‘V’ or a ‘U’ or an ‘L’ shaped event?” asked Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the Chamber of Commerce. “All those scenarios look the same in the beginning: a huge drop in economic activity. We all have hopes for a ‘V’ shape, although it’s looking more like a ‘U’ shape, but whatever we can do now to keep it from being ‘L’ shaped is worth it.” Famed investor Ray Dalio estimated global corporate losses from the virus will top $12 trillion, with $4 trillion of that in the U.S., meaning a trickle-down impact on wallets is unavoidable. On Thursday afternoon, Todd Christensen, education manager at MoneyFit.org, held a webinar on personal finance to offer some advice for those worrying about the hit to the pocketbook the virus may pack. “One of the things I recommend is obviously don’t panic,” Mr. Christensen told The Washington Times. “We see people already spending on their credit cards and emptying store shelves, but we may look back at this as the great toilet paper crisis of 2020 and people will have all this ‘corona’ debt over their heads for years to come. Now is the time to save money, not spend it.” A survey by WalletHub found 67 million Americans “anticipate trouble paying their credit card bills due to the economic impact of the coronavirus,” although companies such as AmericanExpress and Capital One are reportedly offering interest-free months. A new card offered by Goldman Sachs, the Apple Card, will allow a skipped payment with no interest, the company announced. Congress scrambled to craft new regulations that would help small businesses in the crunch. In particular, senators were putting together a $1 trillion stimulus bill that would target small businesses and emphasize employment. “What we are discussing are FORGIVEABLE loans,” Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican tweeted. “Whatever they take out from this assistance program & use for payroll & business and rent/lease/mortgage will NOT have to be repaid.” “This is NOT some traditional SBA direct loan or program,” Mr. Rubio stressed, adding that lawmakers are aiming to run the programs through community banks and lenders rather than the government. “The goal is straightforward: Get cash to small business as fast & easy as possible so they don’t have to lay people off & if they use it for that purpose doesn’t have to be paid back.” Some businesses taking the hit have begun to seek legal remedies. On Thursday, Oceana Grill in New Orleans’ French Quarter became the first to seek legal protection, according to The Wall Street Journal. The restaurant asked a state court to ensure its policy with Lloyds of London would “cover lost revenue due to civil authority actions,” such as ordered restaurant closings. New Orleans, which finished its massive Carnival celebration on Feb. 25 and is one of the nation’s biggest ports, has emerged as one of the virus’s myriad epicenters. Two-thirds of the state’s 347 coronavirus cases as of Thursday were in Orleans Parish, officials said. “New Orleans same case/1,000 as Italy with the 3rd highest rate of COVID per capita in the country,” tweeted Christine Petrin, a Tulane University Medical School student. “I fear we are not just an epicenter of spread for the state but for the nation.” The city has canceled its traditional April French Quarter Festival. JazzFest, a two-week celebration that attracts hundreds of thousands from around the world, has been postponed. Florida’s economy took a big hit when Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis closed the state’s beaches and restaurants Thursday, a move critics said should have been made earlier. “The message I think for spring breakers is the party’s over in Florida,” Mr. DeSantis said. That means a big loss for beach communities along the Gulf Coast for whom spring break is a financial windfall. With many schools shutting down, college kids had flocked to hot spots from South Padre Island, a barrier island in Texas, to Miami. Nevertheless, the Panhandle, the Sunshine State’s top drive-in destination after Orlando, remained something of a bright spot Thursday in a dim economy. “That’s the weird thing, the entire country is on lockdown but our resorts down here are all 100% occupied,” said Nathan Abbott, a real estate agent in Miramar Beach. “I’m all about tourism, and I’m grateful people love our beaches, but there’s also this mindset that, ‘I’m young, nothing will happen to me.’” The situation is less promising across the country in Seattle, another coronavirus epicenter. As small and midsize businesses grapple with possible layoffs and closings, particularly in the hospitality and entertainment sectors, Seattle has become something of a ghost town, said Tom Pierson, CEO of the Tacoma Chamber of Commerce. “We’re still deep into this and you can get around any part of the town at any time now,” he said. “They might as well get rid of traffic signals.”  ","Americans more worried about finances than catching virus, survey says","Thursday, March 19, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/19/americans-more-worried-about-finances-than-catchin/,washington_times
"Cities run by Democrats across the country have begun the mass release of low-level offenders amid the coronavirus pandemic, a move police groups condemn as the start of a nationwide crime wave. Civil liberty groups and left-leaning prosecutors say correction facilities are a breeding ground for the coronavirus because of unsanitary health conditions and inmates’ proximity to each other. They say an outbreak would spread rapidly, endangering prisoners, guards and staff. Police disagree. “If you put convicted, but not yet rehabilitated criminals out on the streets where large swaths of the business world are shut down, you can expect an increase in property crimes from looting to robbery,” said James Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police. “You run the risk of exacerbating the problem.” Some cities have released scores of prisoners who have been convicted of non-violent crimes, have sentences scheduled to lapse within the next year or are among the elderly population most at risk from the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Since the pandemic began, Los Angeles County released more than 600 inmates early and Cleveland let go more than 200. More get-out-of-jail-free cards could be on the way. Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby on Wednesday urged Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, to release certain low-level inmates. Chicago and New York are mulling similar measures. Police associations have slammed the idea as poorly conceived, saying releasing more inmates into society will tax already beleaguered departments. “The idea of releasing individuals, who by definition are not safe to be among the public, in the name of improving public welfare is nonsensical,” said William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations. Prosecutors defended the practice, saying those released don’t pose a threat to society because their crimes range from petty thefts to failure to pay child support. Mr. Johnson counters that keeping low-level offenders off the streets frees the police to focus on violent crimes. He pointed to former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani’s approach to policing in which the police targeted small-time offenders, creating an atmosphere that prevented more serious crimes. “New York City is a great example where you used to have the ‘broken windows’ model of policing where you went after the low-level stuff and improved the overall quality of life for the entire city,” he said. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said he supports releasing some low-level offenders amid the coronavirus outbreak, but the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis. The blanket releases of prisoners is a major threat to public safety, including child molesters who tend to skew older but remain dangerous nonetheless, Mr. Acevedo said. “We’ve got to be thoughtful and not use broad brushes,” he told The Washington Times. “The last thing you want to do is release a large number of criminals onto our streets that have been not been assessed before they return to society.” Prosecutors see it differently. They’ve urged their governors and state officials to act quickly on mass release because of the rate that the virus is spreading. “Now is not the time for a piecemeal approach where we go into court and argue one by one for the release of at-risk prisoners,” Ms. Mosby, the Baltimore prosecutor, wrote in her letter. “Decisive action is needed and it can only be taken by the executive branch.” Law enforcement officials don’t know if the pandemic has increased crime or if a larger number of people self-isolating has reduced potential targets for perpetrators. Mr. Acevedo said his call volume has tabled. His officers are keeping an eye on crimes like domestic violence with some families tightly holed up in their homes but have not seen a noticeable uptick. Law enforcement groups say the mass releases do more than threaten public safety, but also public health. They point out that a released prisoner exposed to the coronavirus while incarcerated will exacerbate its spread. “A sizable number of medical experts believe the majority of Americans will be exposed to the virus and if that’s true, you are removing prisoners from incarceration to the general public where you have no control over their movement or they will be exposed to,” Mr. Johnson said. The police groups also worry law enforcement could be the most at risk since they will be the ones coming into contact with the newly released offenders. More than 80% of police forces across the country have fewer than 10 officers, according to the Fraternal Order of Police. If two officers were exposed to the coronavirus, the impact could devastate a small town force. It also would raise questions such as who will cover their shift, will they be paid for their time at home, and how a short-staffed department can meet the needs of their community. “We are in unchartered territory,” Mr. Pasco said.

"A free online service to help Americans determine whether they need to visit a doctor or be tested for coronavirus is set to launch universally this week. The telehealth company Ro built the online tool called the Coronavirus Telehealth Assessment and expects to take it nationwide within days. “If an individual thinks they may be experiencing signs or symptoms of the novel coronavirus, they can complete Ro’s online assessment and, if appropriate, Ro will connect them with a provider, who will follow up via secure messaging, phone or video consultation,” CEO Zachariah Reitano wrote on Medium. The company usually provides services tailored to men’s health, women’s health and fighting addiction. But the coronavirus pandemic prompted the company to team with infectious disease specialists and provide its services to Americans wondering if they have contracted the virus. A Ro spokesman said the medical providers on its platform are U.S.-licensed internists, hospital physicians and general practitioners who have coronavirus training following the latest guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, and local health departments. Ro decided to build the tool on a Friday night in late February when it recognized COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was becoming a threat to the U.S. A team of 40 people worked through the weekend to create the product, which went live March 4 at covid.ro.co. Ro says it has facilitated 4 million patient-physician interactions in two-and-a-half years, so it has the infrastructure necessary to handle patient demand and unburden others in the health care system. “As we learn more about the novel coronavirus, we’ll continue to rapidly build features for providers and patients on top of our platform to help in whatever way we can,” said a Ro spokesperson. “We will dedicate whatever resources it takes to be there for our patients.” The company also is working with the federal government as part of the tech sector’s push to help defeat the coronavirus. Many technology companies and employees are reprioritizing their work to focus on the coronavirus or to help ease the burden of healthcare and government officials responding to the crisis. Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter and YouTube have partnered to fight misinformation about the virus on their platforms. The cybersecurity company Criticalstart’s employees are working to better simulate the complex protein folding that occurs in viruses to expedite the search for a vaccine. “The technical community is ready and willing to aid when we can and where we can,” said Quentin Rhoads, the company’s director of professional services.

"It’s not just the liberal news media which is criticizing President Trump and his administration. Democratic nonprofits and political action committees are joining the fray, politicizing the coronavirus despite nationwide unease over the pandemic. The Washington Post reports that one group alone — Pacronym — is dropping $5 million on attack ads directed at Mr. Trump’s response to coronavirus. Other groups and consultants also are pushing messages about “Trump’s incompetence,” including Arabella Advisors and New Venture Fund, the Post said. Some fault both the timing and the content of this pricey push. “Arabella is sending funds down through its spider web of nonprofits to politicize a time of fear and instability before the 2020 election,” writes Madeline Osburn, a staff editor at The Federalist. “Crises like this one should be a time for national unity, and instead, this large left-wing dark money group is taking advantage of the coronavirus to score cheap political points against the president,” Adam Laxalt, outside counsel of Americans For Public Trust, told Ms. Osburn. Mr. Laxalt went on to say that while the White House is trying to secure financial support for Americans and small businesses, the Democratic groups are “secretly” shelling out many millions of dollars on political campaigns. “It’s beyond the pale. There is plenty of time for politics down the road — but now is the time to focus on coming together,” Mr. Laxalt advised. “The Capital Research Center reports that between 2013 and 2017, the Arabella network received a whopping $1.6 billion in contributions. While the source of their funding remains unknown, it’s clear they are willing to stop at nothing to attack Trump, even if it means politicizing the growing fears, illnesses, and deaths of American citizens,” Ms. Osburn concludes. SOME TRUTH: A HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE A veteran physician offers terse insight into the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus. “The way we have transitioned from a peacetime to a wartime setting in the last two weeks has been remarkable. It took four to six months to get this far after Pearl Harbor. I think an excellent job is being done,” Dr. William Fisher, 73, tells Fox News. The Houston-based emergency physician is currently tending COVID-19 patients — and is well-versed in emerging, unusual situations. He served as a NASA astronaut providing medical support for multiple space missions, logging some 170 hours in space himself. He is also the father of Fox News correspondent Kristin Fisher, who posted a photo of her dad in protective gear on Twitter, on Friday recalling the gripping moment when the “gravity of the situation” facing the nation hit her. “Everyone has their moment. This was mine,” she says. IN SUMMATION: THE LIBERAL PRESS Media tirades against President Trump continue during a critical time in the nation’s history. Not every news organization is guilty, of course. But there are some loud voices that continue to undermine Mr. Trump as the coronavirus crisis escalates. That may not be prudent. “This was the media’s time to shine, a moment when we needed clear, objective information delivered by intelligent people who asked the important questions people care about so Americans could protect themselves and their families. It was a critical juncture when the media could step up and show us all that yes, the media is still important. It still matters. It still deserves our respect,” writes Townhall columnist Kurt Schlichter. “Instead we got, ‘Mr. President, isn’t accurately pointing out that the coronavirus originated in China racist?’ Really. That was a thing. Pointing out that the Wuhan flu came from Wuhan is racist. I wish I was joking,” he says.

The practice is both proper and helpful in these times, but also brings an extra personal dimension to video conferences linking homebound employees — so much so that the business publication Fast Company is chronicling the new work culture. “Farts, cats, naked bodies: People are failing hilariously at working from home.

"OLYMPIA, Wash. — Washington Lt. Gov. Cyrus Habib said Thursday that he is not running for re-election and will join the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church to start the process of becoming a priest. Habib, the state’s first blind lieutenant governor, said the decision comes after “two years of careful and prayerful discernment.” A Democrat who has served in the position since 2017, Habib previously served in the state House and Senate. He said he understood why many constituents and supporters may be surprised and wondering why he “would trade a life of authority for one of obedience.” “But over the past couple of years, I have felt called to a different vocation, albeit one that is also oriented around service and social justice,” he wrote in a statement in America, a Jesuit magazine. “I have felt a calling to dedicate my life in a more direct and personal way to serving the marginalized, empowering the vulnerable, healing those who suffer from spiritual wounds and accompanying those discerning their own futures.” The second highest position in the state, the lieutenant governor is best known as the president of the Senate and presides over that chamber during the legislative sessions, ensuring that protocol is followed and weighing in on parliamentary questions that arise during debate. When Habib joined the House in 2013, he was given a Braille reader and software on his laptop that provided both Braille and text-to-speech translation for the multitude of bills, emails and news stories he reads daily. He was elected to the Senate in 2014, and before he was sworn in as lieutenant governor in January 2017, the Senate underwent a makeover that incorporated Braille into that chamber’s floor sessions. The desks of 49 senators got upgraded with a system that allows Habib to know by the touch of his finger which lawmaker is seeking to be recognized to speak. Habib, 38, completely lost his eyesight to cancer at age 8. He went on to become a Rhodes Scholar and an editor of the law review at Yale before becoming an attorney. Gov. Jay Inslee called Habib’s life and career “an inspiration to many.” “While the news was unexpected, anyone who knows Cyrus is not surprised by his commitment to faith,” Inslee said in a written statement. “I have no doubt his future in the Jesuit priesthood will bring much good to a world that needs it right now”.

"HONG KONG (AP) - Hong Kong low-cost airline HK Express, part of the Cathay Pacific Group, said Friday it was suspending all flights through the end of April due to falling demand amid the coronavirus outbreak. The decision adds to a wave of flight cancelations by Asian airlines as demand plunges amid travel curbs. HK Express, which normally flies 25 routes throughout Asia, said it tentatively plans to resume flying May 1. The suspension is “essential in order to ensure we see ourselves through this extremely difficult period,” said CEO Mandy Ng in a statement. Cathay’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways, earlier suspended 90% of its flights. The airline has staff to take unpaid leave. Airlines already were suffering from a downturn in visitors due to political protests last year.

"RIO RANCHO, N.M. (AP) - The first attempt of the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965, led to police violence against peaceful African American demonstrators. The beatings, known as “Bloody Sunday,” generated anger across the nation 55 years ago this month and prompted President Lyndon Johnson to push the Voting Rights Act through Congress. It was one of the most significant moments in U.S. history but remains almost absent from public schools’ social studies lessons. A new online project by the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University and a coalition of foundations hopes to change that. The center this month unveiled Selma Online ​ - a free, online teaching platform that seeks to transform how the civil rights movement is taught in middle and high schools across the country. The project uses footage from Ava DuVernay’s 2014 movie “Selma” and attempts to show students how events in 1965 shaped voting rights. Harvard scholar and documentary filmmaker Henry Louis Gates Jr. helped create an interactive website with the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Teaching Tolerance program and Left Field Labs. Its release comes as schools across the U.S. have closed because of the coronavirus and many students are in need of educational material to learn at home.  “It’s perfect timing, unfortunately, because of the crisis we are in,” Gates told The Associated Press on Wednesday. “Not only is the timing optimal for teachers who are developing online lesson plans but also for families.” Gates said the website can be broken up into quick lessons or over a semester. The idea for it followed the release of DuVernay’s film. William Lewis Jr., co-chairman of investment banking at New York City-based Lazard, and other black business leaders raised money so 500,000 children in 33 cities could see the historical drama for free. The film follows the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., played by David Oyelowo, as he and other civil rights leaders push for voting rights in Selma, Alabama. Marches are soon met with violence by police, which eventually leads to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. After the success of the fundraiser for kids to see the movie, former Time Warner CEO Richard “Dick” Parsons reached out to Gates about developing the website using “Selma” to teach the history of voting rights and the civil rights movement. “It was such a novel idea, I said “OK,’” Gates said.  The Rockefeller Foundation soon awarded the project a grant. In 2019, organizers tested the website after years of development with teachers and students in schools in Chicago, Kansas, Kentucky, Alabama and California. Developers incorporated suggestions in time for the 55th anniversary of the violence this month. The website comes as educators in various states push for more lessons in ethnic studies amid demographic changes in public schools. In New Mexico, for example, scholars and teachers are working on getting Chicano studies and Mexican American history into public high schools around Albuquerque. Gates said he sees Selma Online​ as a test run for similar projects around African American history, including slavery.  “You change the curriculum, you change civic behavior,” Gates said.  ___ Russell Contreras is a member of The Associated Press’ race and ethnicity team.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday ordered the state’s 40 million residents to stay at home, restricting non-essential movements to control the spread of the coronavirus that threatens to overwhelm the state’s medical system. “This is a moment we need to make tough decisions,” Newsom said. “We need to recognize reality.” His move came after counties and communities covering about half the state’s population already had issued similar orders. People may still leave their homes for walks and exercise and for essential needs such as food and medical care. Restaurant meals can still be delivered to homes. Newsom earlier in the day asked the president to deploy a U.S. Navy medical ship to help the state expand its medical capacity and warned that more than half of California’s residents could contract the new coronavirus. Newsom asked President Donald Trump to send the USNS Mercy Hospital Ship to the port of Los Angeles for use through Sept. 1, in a letter dated Wednesday. California has disproportionately aided people returning to the U.S. from foreign countries and needs the ship to help “decompress” its health care delivery system as infection rates climb, Newsom wrote. The ship is based in San Diego. He said infection rates are doubling every four days in some parts of the state and issued the dire prediction that 56% of California’s population could contract the virus over the next eight weeks. His spokesman later confirmed that number does not take into account aggressive mitigation efforts underway across the state. Many large counties had already been issuing shelter-in-place orders aimed at keeping Californians confined to their homes and Newsom had directed the closure of bars, gyms and other gathering spaces statewide. “This projection shows why it’s so critical that Californians take action to slow the spread of the disease - and those mitigation efforts aren’t taken into account in this projection,” spokesman Nathan Click said in an emailed statement. Newsom’s letter to Trump said 25.5 million people could be infected. But the state’s population is estimated to be just shy of 40 million, meaning 56% of the population would be closer to 22.4 million people. The governor’s office did not respond to questions about his calculation or offer a prediction that considers efforts to stop the spread of the infection. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. It can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, for some people, especially older adults and those with existing health problems. Most people recover - those with mild illness in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks, according to the World Health Organization. In a separate letter, Newsom on Thursday asked U.S. House and Senate leaders for $1 billion to support surge planning for state and local health systems. He said that money would be needed to do things like set up state-run and mobile hospitals, housing options to help people socially distance and testing and treatment for people without health insurance. He also asked for assistance so the state can extend unemployment benefits beyond the usual 26-week limit, expand food assistance programs, resources for the homeless and tribal communities and boost childcare programs. He further asked for assistance for schools, aid to local and state budgets and transportation relief. “While California has prudently built a sizable Rainy Day Fund over the past ten years, the economic effects of this emergency are certain to mean that the state and its 58 counties will struggle to maintain essential programs and services,” he wrote. It warned many California households “may fall into poverty” without a “substantial economic intervention.” Meanwhile, not everyone was following orders to stay home. In a Northern California county where officials have ordered residents to stay home and non-essential businesses to close because of the coronavirus pandemic, a gun shop is refusing. Alameda County Sheriff’s Sgt. Ray Kelley said Thursday that a gun shop called Solar Tactical remains open, despite the order. He said officers have advised the shop to close. “We’ll start out nice,” Kelley said. “Then we’ll post a notice to close and then we will take enforcement.” Solar Tactical did not answer phone calls nor immediately respond to messages sent through its website. A message on its Facebook page said the store is now operating on an appointment-only basis and urged customers to call local police to protest the effort to close it. “Your 2nd Amendment right is no longer considered essential during forced shelter in place,” the shop said. “Please share and get the word out. Call your local officials, news stations, and Alameda County Sheriffs office to let them know how you feel about your 2nd Amendment rights being taken away.” Gun sales have spiked as consumers who worried that people are becoming desperate and unpredictable amid the outbreak rushed to buy weapons and ammunition.

"One of Fox News Channel’s flagship primetime hosts called for a Republican senator to resign over claims that the lawmaker dumped stocks on the eve of the coronavirus hitting the U.S. with full force. Tucker Carlson commented on Thursday’s show about a story earlier in the day from Pro Publica that said that Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina sold between $628,000 and $1.72 million of his holdings on Feb. 13 in 33 separate transactions. Tucker Carlson calls for Senator Burr to resign and await prosecution for insider trading if he cannot provide a reasonable explanation for his actions. He goes on to say it appears that Senator Burr betrayed his country in a time of crisis pic.twitter.com/q7yJa5wjuA Mr. Burr made the stock sales shortly before giving a dire speech about the potential damage the coronavirus could do to the U.S. economy and American society, prompting accusations of insider trading. “He dumped his shares in hotel stocks so he wouldn’t lose money and then he stayed silent,” Mr. Carlson said of Mr. Burr, who is co-chairman of the Senate intelligence committee. “He had inside information about what could happen … which is now happening.” Mr. Carlson said there could be “an honest explanation for what he did. If there is, he should share it with the rest of us immediately. “Otherwise, he must resign from the Senate and face prosecution for insider trading. There’s no greater moral crime than betraying your country in a time of crisis. That appears to be what happened,” he concluded. While it was no secret in February that coronavirus was devastating China and starting to spread abroad, its impact on the U.S. looked uncertain then. Just a month later, American daily life has been upended as cities and states are going into lockdown mode, sports leagues have been canceled, and the stock market has cratered. According to the NPR report, Mr. Burr gave a speech Feb. 27 — a time when President Trump was regularly downplaying the threat and even Mr. Burr himself had recently written a calming op-ed — in which the North Carolina senator warned the Capitol Hill Club of a society-wrenching pandemic. “There’s one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history,” he said, according to a secret recording of the remarks obtained by NPR. “It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic” of Spanish flu. In a Twitter thread Thursday evening, Mr. Burr denounced the NPR story as “a tabloid-style hit piece” in which the liberal-leaning network “knowingly and irresponsibly misrepresented a speech I gave last month about the coronavirus threat.” In a tabloid-style hit piece today, NPR knowingly and irresponsibly misrepresented a speech I gave last month about the coronavirus threat. Let me set the record straight. 1/ He said it was a public speech, not a secret pow-wow with insiders, and also said it was consistent with the warnings that many public officials were giving about the possible future impact. Later in the day, Pro Publica reported that the speech came a couple of weeks after the stock sales, which NPR did not mention. “As the head of the intelligence committee, Burr, a North Carolina Republican, has access to the government’s most highly classified information about threats to America’s security. His committee was receiving daily coronavirus briefings around this time,” Pro Publica wrote. His spokesman told Pro Publica that the lawmaker made the sales “before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak.”  ",'No greater moral crime': Tucker Carlson calls for Richard Burr's resignation,"Thursday, March 19, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/19/tucker-carlson-calls-richard-burr-resign/,washington_times
"Avowed socialist Bernard Sanders may be losing the Democratic presidential race, but the senator from Vermont has won the ideological war. Look no further than the party’s presumed nominee, Joseph R. Biden. The former vice president seems to have turned the corner in the presidential race and headed into the homestretch armed with a series of Sanders-style talking points and policy positions that were viewed as too extreme just a few years ago. “Without a doubt, Vice President Biden is sounding more Sanders-esque — like all the other candidates did,” said Kerri Evelyn Harris, a liberal activist from Delaware. “People have piggybacked off of his health care, education, criminal justice, the Green New Deal. You name it, people have taken his position and tweaked it a little bit to make it their own.” Indeed, Mr. Biden adopted some of the Sanders proposals for tuition-free college and the plan of Sanders acolyte Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to make bankruptcy laws more consumer-friendly. Where Mr. Biden falls short of the Sanders measuring stick on single-payer health care or get-tough climate change policies, polls show most Democratic voters back Mr. Sanders’ position even if they cast their primary vote for the former vice president. Mr. Sanders’ presidential odyssey began in late April of 2015 when he announced his run for the Democratic nomination in a race most believed was the inevitable coronation of Hillary Clinton. Mr. Sanders relentlessly campaigned against the “rigged” economy. He criticized Mrs. Clinton’s record on foreign interventionism and trade while pushing for a “Medicare for All” government-run health care system, free public college and new taxes on Wall Street and the most wealthy Americans. He took a similar tack in 2020, by which time public opinion had moved dramatically in his direction. Ashley Kirzinger, associate director of the Public Opinion and Survey Research at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said there has long been support for more government involvement in health care but it never translated into majority support for putting all Americans under a single government health care plan until Mr. Sanders came along. “That is until 2016, during which Senator Sanders made ‘Medicare-for-all’ a hallmark of his primary campaign,” Ms. Kirzinger said. “Since 2016, we have consistently found a slight majority of Americans say they favor such a plan.” The group’s most recent tracking poll showed that 52% of the public favors a Medicare-for-all plan, including 74% of Democrats, half of independents and 20% of Republicans. “While there has been a slight increase in the public’s support for Medicare-for-all, we consistently find a more incremental change, such an optional government-administered health care plan or public option, garners more support among the public overall, including Democrats, independents, and Republicans,” she said. At least half of the voters that turned out for primaries in the 24 states where exit poll data is available said they supported the government health care plan over private insurance, which is akin to the Medicare for All plan that Mr. Sanders has made the centerpiece of his campaign. In the half-dozen states where voters were asked whether they support tuition-free public college, more than six in 10 voters said they did — including states such as North Carolina and Tennessee that Mr. Sanders lost in a landslide. Meanwhile, 60% of the voters in Maine said they had a favorable view of “socialism.” Most voters, though, were not prepared to cast a ballot for Mr. Sanders and instead concluded that Mr. Biden is best prepared to defeat President Trump in a one-on-one matchup in the November election. Mr. Biden has a 99% chance of being the party’s nominee, according to FiveThirtyEight.com. It is a stark turn of events from a month ago, when Mr. Sanders claimed the front-runner mantle after steamrolling his way to victory in Nevada, building on the momentum he carried out of his strong second-place showing in Iowa and a victory in New Hampshire. Mr. Biden has since won 19 of the 26 contests and holds a 1,181 to 885 delegate lead over Mr. Sanders. Still, the exit poll findings could help explain why Mr. Biden over the weekend announced he now supports making public colleges tuition-free for all families with incomes below $125,000 — marking a shift in his thinking and offering an olive branch to Sanders supporters. Mr. Biden has yet to embrace Medicare for All, but he has made it clear that he supports the broader drive toward making health care more affordable and universally available. “Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision for the need to provide affordable health care for all Americans, reduce income inequality that has risen so drastically to tackling the existential threat of our time: climate change,” Mr. Biden said this week after sweeping contests in Arizona, Florida and Illinois. “Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. Together, they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country,” he said.

"LIMA, Peru (AP) - The coronavirus pandemic has provided a silver lining for a former Peruvian president who has been in U.S. custody while he fights extradition back home to face trial on corruption charges. A U.S. judge ruled Thursday that Alejandro Toledo should be released on $1 million bail because the pandemic has reduced his flight risk. “The court’s concern was that Toledo would flee the country,” Magistrate Judge Thomas S. Hixson wrote in his decision. “But international travel is hard now.” The judge had previously denied Toledo bail after prosecutors pointed out that officials found a suitcase with $40,000 in cash when he was arrested.  But noting that Toledo is 74, Hixson agreed the virus could present a risk of serious illness or death.  “The risk that this vulnerable person will contract COVID-19 while in jail is a special circumstance that warrants bail,” Hixson ruled. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, like a fever and cough. But it can cause more severe illness for some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems. The judge added that a treaty requires U.S. authorities to “deliver him to Peru alive.” “Maybe the risk of COVID-19 is worth it if he can make a run for it and get away,” Hixson wrote. “The government says he faces the prospect of life in prison if he is convicted in Peru. But escape is riskier and more difficult now.” The former president is wanted in his home country on accusations of taking million in bribes from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht. He denies the charges.  Toledo was Peru’s president from 2001 to 2006 and has lived in California in recent years, defying orders from Peru’s courts to return to face charges. The Odebrecht scandal has upended politics in Peru, putting some of the country’s most prominent politicians behind bars. The company acknowledged in a 2016 plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department that it paid $800 million to officials largely in Latin America in exchange for lucrative public works contracts. In order to be released from jail, Hixson said Toledo must first post $500,000 in cash bail and his wife must surrender her passports. It was not immediately clear how quickly Toledo’s bail might be posted. Friends have promised to help with part of the bail. Authorities in California had previously ordered about 7 million people in the San Francisco area to stay home in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and they extended the order to the whole state late Thursday. Toledo will be on a different sort of lockdown - court-ordered home confinement - and required to wear a GPS tracking device as part of his release.

"SEATTLE (AP) - A federal judge in Seattle on Thursday declined to order the release of immigration detainees who may be especially vulnerable to the new coronavirus because they are old or have underlying health conditions. The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project sought the release of nine detainees at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Northwest detention center in Tacoma.  U.S. District Judge James L. Robart denied their request for a temporary order releasing them while the case proceeds. Robart said he was aware of the gravity and rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 crisis, but that there is no evidence of an outbreak at the privately run, 1,575-bed jail. Nor had the plaintiffs shown that ICE’s precautions, which include suspending visitation and assessing detainees for symptoms, are inadequate, he said. In an emailed statement the groups said they would continue fighting to free the detainees. “I just hope our clients do not succumb to severe illness or death before we can procure their release,” said Matt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.

"President Trump has canceled plans to hold the Group of 7 summit at Camp David in June, and has opted instead to meet by video teleconference due to the coronavirus, White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said Thursday. “In order for each country to focus all of its resources on responding to the health and economic challenges of COVID-19 and at President Trump’s direction, National Economic Council Director and U.S. Sherpa for the 2020 G7 Larry Kudlow has informed his Sherpa colleagues that the G7 Leaders’ Summit the U.S. was set to host in June at Camp David will now be done by video-teleconference,” Mr. Deere said in a statement.

"President Trump on Thursday directed the Food and Drug Administration to repurpose an anti-malarial drug for use against the raging coronavirus pandemic and told states to order badly needed ventilators instead of relying on him, saying his administration is “not a shipping clerk.” The president is scrambling to keep up with a coronavirus that has infected more than 10,750 Americans and killed about 160, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. In yet another sign of how the virus crisis has upended virtually every aspect of normal life, The State Department issued its highest level travel advisory Thursday, warning Americans against going to any country as the world races to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The Level 4: Do Not Travel warning, which has been used by the department sparingly in recent years to advise against traveling to war zones, or nations experiencing disease or financial crises, cautions U.S. citizens to avoid “all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19.” “If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe,” the department warns on its travel website. Mr. Trump told reporters that the malaria drug — hydroxychloroquine — has been around for a long time, so “it’s not going to kill anybody,” and that is has shown promise against the coronavirus. The FDA says states can administer the drug to coronavirus patients through a prescription. “We’re going to be able to make the drug available almost immediately,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump said he’s excited about another drug — remdesivir — from Gilead Sciences. It’s being used in Washington state under the “compassionate use” standard, a process in which drugs that aren’t fully licensed for use can be deployed against urgent new threats. “I think it’s going to be very exciting. I think it could be a game-changer, and maybe not,” Mr. Trump said. “Based on what I see, it could be a game-changer.” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said clinical trials will be necessary to make sure the drugs are effective before they become widely available. However, Dr. Hahn did express the hope that drug therapies could blunt the epidemic while the world develops a vaccine, which can take up to 18 months. “The vaccine, by its nature, you have to have long tests,” Mr. Trump said. “You have to make sure what goes into somebody’s body is not going to do destruction, do bad things.” Gerard Anderson, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said if existing drugs prove to be effective against the coronavirus “it is possible to have production begin rather quickly, but it will take a while to manufacture in quantity.” The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, and has spread to six continents, forcing European nations to lock down their citizenry, except for emergencies or trips to grocery stores. Countries such as Italy, Spain and Iran have been particularly hard hit, but U.S. authorities say the virus is far from its peak here. The State Department also bumped up its warnings for U.S. citizens to “arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period.” Separately, the Veterans Administration was bracing for a huge drain on the system from aging veterans exposed to the virus, and is seeking $16.6 billion in emergency funding from Congress, the Associated Press reported. Federal role Mr. Trump, meanwhile, is contending with criticisms that the U.S. is falling behind in getting much-needed equipment to hospitals that might be overrun by the pandemic in the coming days or weeks. The president hasn’t used the Defense Production Act to speed the production of things such as ventilators or personal protective equipment, despite preparing to invoke the 1950 law Wednesday. Mr. Trump said he expects states to act first, meaning he will only use federal power to direct procurement as needed later on. “The federal government’s not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping — you know, we’re not a shipping clerk,” Mr. Trump said. “The governors are supposed to be doing it. We’ll help out, and we’ll help out wherever we can.” But Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Mr. Trump should use the Korean War-era act immediately, saying time is being lost as hospitals complain of shortages and some governors appeal for a more coordinated, federally-led approach. Some health workers were told to use bandannas instead of masks. “There is not a day to lose. We must put more testing, more protective equipment and more ventilators into the hands of our frontline workers immediately,” Mrs. Pelosi said. The U.S. is trying to avoid the fate of Italy, where the death toll reached over 3,400 Thursday, surpassing that of China, where the outbreak began. China, on the other hand, reported zero new cases of local transmission in a 24-hour period for the first time since the start of the outbreak in December. The World Health Organization called that an “amazing achievement,” though critics say figures from the communist government in Beijing should be taken with a grain of salt. Mr. Trump continued to blame China for allowing the virus to spread at the outset in late 2019, saying it put the U.S. and other countries at a disadvantage. “It could have been stopped right where it came from, China,” Mr. Trump said. However, a New York Times report on Thursday said government exercises, including one run last year, warned the U.S. was unprepared for a pandemic like the one that’s unfolding now. Mr. Trump insists his administration was on top of things, and his 2020 campaign released a timeline of his “critical” actions since the start of the outbreak. “The only thing we weren’t prepared for is the media,” Mr. Trump said, arguing he didn’t get credit for his early decision to restrict travelers from China coming to the U.S. A lack of diagnostics has been a blind spot in the response, with the U.S. far behind other countries in the rate at which suspected victims are being examined. The administration says testing is ramping up, a move almost certain to bring a sharp rise in the number of confirmed infections in the country. “You can see the dramatic increases in the number of new cases based on our ability to test additional people. This will continue over the next two to three days as we begin to have backlogs reduced,” said Deborah Birx, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator. Dr. Birx said many asymptomatic people are heeding official advice to leave tests to people who show signs of illness. However, the proportion of people coming back positive is around 10% to 11%. “That means that 90% of the illnesses out there, even the severe ones, are not COVID-19,” she said. She said about half of the U.S. cases are concentrated in 10 counties, as hot spots in Washington state, California and New York take stringent measures to restrict public movement. “I think they actually are doing a lot. I know New York has been doing a lot,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re all working very hard to quarantine.” Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all “non-life-sustaining” businesses to close their physical locations late Thursday, meaning only places like grocery stores, drugstores, gas stations and those offering home supplies can stay open. The Democrat said the state will enforce the rules against businesses that don’t comply, starting Saturday. The administration is pleading with Americans to stay home when possible, avoid groups of 10 or more and enjoy takeout instead of entering restaurants, many of which have closed, anyway. Changes have impacted the White House itself. Reporters have their temperatures checked at the gate and must sit with seats in between them in the briefing room. “With social distancing,” Mr. Trump said, “the media has been much nicer.”  ",Trump taps anti-malarial drug for coronavirus fight,"Thursday, March 19, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/19/hydroxychloroquine-anti-malarial-drug-tapped-coron/,washington_times
"A political fundraiser will plead guilty to a bribery charge for coordinating a $500,000 payment in 2017 to gain the help of a Los Angeles City Council member in advancing a major real estate development, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said Thursday. In addition to the plea, Justin Jangwoo Kim, 53, agreed to cooperate with an ongoing investigation of public corruption, the office said. Federal prosecutors in the Kim case did not identify the council member or say whether the person was still in office. Last week, former Councilman Mitch Englander surrendered to FBI agents, charged with trying to cover up gifts given to him during June 2017 trips to Las Vegas and Palm Springs. The person who gave him the gifts was only identified as Businessperson A, who operates companies involving major development projects.  In the Kim case, the elected official is only identified in court documents as “Councilmember A,” who was a member of the city’s Planning and Land use Management Committee. Kim, a real estate appraiser and consultant, was a top fundraiser for Councilmember A and a close political ally of a member of the councilmember’s staff, court documents said. Prosecutors said Kim admitted he supported a plan by Councilmember A and a council staffer to ensure the election of a relative of the councilmember.   “Kim was motivated to help Councilmember A maintain power because Kim would be poised to financially benefit from potential illicit schemes in Councilmember A’s district,” prosecutors said. The bribery scheme developed in 2016 when a labor organization filed an appeal that claimed a real estate project violated the California Environmental Quality Act. That appeal prevented the project from progressing through processes requiring planning committee and City Council approval, prosecutors said. A person identified as “Developer C” then allegedly called Kim and asked him to obtain Councilmember A’s assistance with the appeal on that project. Kim, the developer and the unidentified councilmember met on Sept. 1, 2016, to resolve the issue, prosecutors said. Eventually a $500,000 bribe was negotiated, they said.  Prosecutors noted that while Kim agreed to plead guilty to the bribery offense, he did not to admit all of the allegations in a charging document. He is scheduled to appear in federal court on March 31 to enter the guilty plea. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

"While the political jockeying gets more attention, candidates in the 2020 Democratic presidential race are advancing serious policy proposals. The Washington Times takes a weekly look at how the candidates’ proposals stack up against each other. With a focus on the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis, the candidates have offered new proposals on that front. Sanders Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont on Tuesday proposed that the government send $2,000 monthly cash payments to every single American for as long as the coronavirus crisis lasts, as part of a set of “principles” that added up to at least $2 trillion. “In this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together,” Mr. Sanders said. “We must guarantee that everyone who needs care can get it for free, ensure that all workers continue to receive paychecks so they can make ends meet, and stop giant corporations and Wall Street from profiting off the outbreak.” The senator proposed setting up an “Emergency Economic Crisis Finance Agency” that would work with businesses to cover payroll costs to avoid layoffs and make 0% loans and loan guarantees to businesses. He also wants to aggressively crack down on price-gouging and ban stock buybacks and bonuses for company executives. Mr. Sanders’ plan would expand unemployment insurance so that people who lose their job through no fault of their own would qualify for benefits totaling 100% of their prior salary, capped at $75,000 per year. He would waive student loan payments during the emergency, put a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures, and utility shutoffs, and suspend payments on mortgage loans for primary residences and utility bills. Mr. Sanders, who has made a government-run “Medicare for All” health care system a cornerstone of his campaign, called for free coronavirus-related health care for everyone, including testing, treatment, and any eventual vaccine. The senator’s proposal would use the Defense Production Act to scale up production of critical supplies like masks and ventilators. Biden Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden on Wednesday called on President Trump to waive certain antitrust laws, if necessary, so that industries could work together and remove barriers to speed production of key medical supplies that will be needed to deal with the pandemic. It was part of a series of proposals Mr. Biden called on the current administration to take immediately to respond to the growing threat. “Americans are already making sacrifices and readjusting their lives, and I know that as a people, we are capable of meeting this challenge, coming together, caring for one another, and saving lives,” Mr. Biden said. “We just need President Trump and his administration to demonstrate the same level of dedication and aggressive leadership at the federal level to mount an effective national response.” Mr. Biden said that essential supplies should have a “priority call” above other contracts or orders, in collaboration with the health community, so that the federal government doesn’t “strip the private sector” of needed supplies. Mr. Biden said that loans, purchase commitments, or other incentives could be used to expand domestic production without disrupting things too much. He called on Mr. Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to step up the domestic production of critical medical equipment, like ventilators.

"Evangeline Lilly is publicly rejecting calls for social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak, saying she prefers her freedom and doesn’t trust the government. The actress who starred in “Lost” and portrays Wasp in the Marvel movies, posted on Instagram earlier this week photos of “business as usual,” including dropping off her children at a gymnastics camp. When people asked her on her account why she would be doing this at the peak of a worldwide epidemic, she brushed off their concerns. “Some people value their lives over freedom, some people value freedom over their lives. We all make our choices,” she said. Ms. Lilly added that she is “immune compromised at the moment” and is living with her father, who has stage 4 leukemia. In later posts and comments she called the COVID-19 illness simply a “respiratory flu” and an excuse for a busybody government. “Where we are right now feels a lot too close to Marshall Law [sic] for my comfort already, all in the name of a respiratory flu,” Ms. Lilly wrote. “It’s unnerving … Let’s be vigilant right now. And kind. Watchful and gracious — keeping a close eye on our leaders, making sure they don’t abuse this moment to steal away more freedoms and grab more power.” She added a brief allusion to suspicions of the government, since 2020 is a presidential election year. “There’s ‘something’ every election year,” she wrote.

"HOPKINTON, N.H. — Three people who planned to attend political and religious events in the next few weeks are challenging New Hampshire’s statewide emergency ban on gatherings of 50 people or more to prevent spread of the coronavirus. David Binford, Eric Couture and Holly Rae Beene filed a lawsuit Tuesday, the day after Republican Gov. Chris Sununu issued the order prohibiting large scheduled gatherings for social, spiritual and recreational activities. They argue there is no emergency, and that the governor is violating their constitutional rights. “We can choose to assemble if that is our desire. What cannot occur is one man in a position of power deciding to strip us of our rights in the name of safety and without due process,” Couture said in press release. A judge on Wednesday denied the group’s request for an immediate order halting enforcement of the ban and scheduled a hearing for Friday in Merrimack County Superior Court. A spokesman for Sununu said Thursday that the emergency order is consistent with actions taken across the country and is clearly within the governor’s authority. “We are confident the court will agree,” said Ben Vihdstadt. In their complaint, the plaintiffs describe a variety of events they planned to attend, including meetings of the Grafton County Republican committee, services and Sunday school at a Baptist church and a Meetup group to discuss “petitioning the government for redress of grievances.” The complaint also mentions buying food at a supermarket, though the order does not apply to shopping for food. It does, however, prohibit on-site dining at restaurants. “We ask others to let the governor’s office know that they are opposed to living under a government that controls the people, instead of the other way around,” said the plaintiffs’ attorney, Daniel Hynes. Nearly 40 people have tested positive in New Hampshire for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough, and the vast majority recover. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. In Ohio, where Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has taken one of the more aggressive anti-virus approaches, businesses and civic groups have largely supported the closure of restaurants and bars, part of one of the most aggressive anti-virus approaches nationally. Those include the state Chamber of Commerce, Manufacturers’ Association and an alliance of mayors. ____ Associated Press writers Julie Carr Smyth in Columbus, Ohio, and Kathy McCormack in Concord, New Hampshire, contributed to this report.

"Free-market principles in Washington have run smack into the election-year coronavirus pandemic. President Trump and Senate Republicans were trying hard on Thursday to portray the biggest economic rescue plan in history, including proposals of $500 billion in cash payouts to families and the possibility of the government becoming temporary part owner of private corporations, as something other than the bailouts of the financial crisis in 2008 or the Obama administration’s much-mocked “stimulus” plan of 2009. That stimulus plan cost taxpayers roughly $820 billion. The TARP aid for banks and auto companies, plus bailouts for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, was about $634 billion, although the companies eventually paid back the loans. The proposal being negotiated by the White House and Senate Republicans is in the neighborhood of $1.3 trillion. “We are not talking about so-called ‘bailouts’ for firms that made reckless decisions,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican. “We are talking about loans, which must be repaid, for American employers whom the government itself is temporarily crushing for the sake of public health.” The idea of throwing hundreds of billions of dollars at corporate America, even in an unprecedented crisis, is making some conservatives squirm. “When it comes to grants or bailouts for big companies, especially at this stage of the game or the ‘phase three,’ there are going to be many of us who harken back to 2008 and won’t be comfortable with that,” said Sen. Mike Braun, Indiana Republican. “You’re picking winners and losers, and it gets very complicated.” As unemployment claims rose 33% last week to 281,000, the president said he’s trying to keep people from losing their jobs and companies from going under. In Ohio, jobless claims rose 48,000 in the first two days of this week, compared to 1,825 for the same two days last week. “We don’t want to pick winners and losers,” Mr. Trump said. “We want everybody to benefit. We want, I think more than anything else, the workers to benefit. If the company goes out of business, no fault of their own, those workers aren’t going to be able to receive a check.” Mr. Trump also said he supports having the federal government take equity stakes in private companies that receive coronavirus aid. “I do, I really do,” he said when asked whether he would approve of the government owning a stake in private companies. But he said he might take a less charitable approach with companies that have used excess cash for stock buybacks to boost the price of their own shares, instead of investing in new equipment. “In some cases, where they did certain things over the course of the years, including by buying back stock, you know, they bought back stock and they paid a high price for it,” Mr. Trump said. “Maybe I view that as a little bit differently than somebody that didn’t, and somebody that built plants all over the United States.” He also said barring companies from using the aid for executive bonuses or stock buybacks “would be OK with me.” The administration’s proposal also would provide hundreds of billions for sectors of the economy that have come to a virtual standstill, such as airlines and hotels. “We will be helping the airline industry. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry,” Mr. Trump said. “You don’t want to lose industries like this. These are incredible industries. You can’t lose them. So we’ll be focused on many industries.” Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Thursday that many of the companies will pay back any loans. “This isn’t about bailing out bad businesses. This isn’t about banks that made bad loans,” Mr. Mnuchin told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “These are about very, very good companies that have been instructed to shut down, so they need liquidity. That’s what they need. In most cases, my expectation is they will be able to pay back these loans.” In the case of small businesses, he said, “if they can’t afford to pay back those loans, we’ll forgive them. I don’t consider that a bailout. I consider that an incentive to keep workers hired.” The U.S. Travel Association, which represents mostly small businesses, said companies in the non-airline travel sector will lose 4.6 million jobs by the end of April. “The only thing that’s going to protect them is aggressive financial relief right now,” said U.S. Travel President and CEO Roger Dow, who spoke with Mr. Trump Tuesday. “We’re witnessing the shutdown of travel.” He said numerous companies are trying to help their employees, but added, “the cold reality is they can’t support their employees if they don’t have any customers, and they don’t have any customers because of the actions needed to halt the spread of coronavirus.” Mr. McConnell outlined Senate Republicans’ four-part plan: $300 billion in loans to small businesses, checks to the American public, major support to hard-hit industries, and more funds to the overly strained healthcare system. The small business relief would give loans to qualifying companies for payroll and other operating expenses. “No massive new bureaucracy. We want to let qualified small businesses get liquidity through familiar institutions — their own community banks, credit unions or nationwide lenders,” Mr. McConnell said. The average family of four would receive $3,000 from the government next month under the economic relief plan proposed by the White House. Mr. Mnuchin said the direct payments in April would include $1,000 per adult and $500 per child, to be delivered three weeks after Congress approves the plan. A second round of payments would go out in May if the president hasn’t lifted his national disaster declaration. “We’ve told the House and the Senate we need to get this done quickly,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “This needs to be done by the beginning of next week.” Under the plan introduced by Senate Republicans late Thursday, the government would provide about $1,200 to Americans making up to $75,000, with another $500 per child. The handouts would then be scaled down between $75,000 and $99,000. It includes a $230 billion loan plan for eligible small businesses to go toward payrolls and other operating expenses to help the companies stay afloat and keep their employees. To aid sectors of the economy devastated by the virus, the package includes $208 billion in loans: $50 billion for airlines, $8 billion for cargo air carriers and $150 billion for other eligible entities. The president sounded unconcerned about the short-term costs to the government, emphasizing the need to get beyond the crisis. “We’re paying a lot of money to stop things [commerce and activities], because we don’t want people to be together,” he said. “But we’re doing the right thing. It’s not a financial war, it’s a medical war.” Mr. Trump also showed some impatience for those dwelling on the harm being inflicted on the economy. When a reporter prefaced his question by pointing out that the economy has “essentially ground to a halt,” Mr. Trump cut in, “Thanks for telling us. We appreciate it.” The reporter continued, “Stores have closed, travel has slowed down …” The president jumped in again. “What’s the rest of your question? Everybody in the room knows that,” he snapped. Stocks posted modest gains on Thursday, recovering from a three-year low as cheap oil prices jumped the highest ever in a single day and Mr. Trump highlighted possible coronavirus therapies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 188 points, or 0.9%, to close at 20,087. The tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 2.3%, and the S&P 500 rose 0.47%. U.S. oil prices surged 23%, posting its best day ever and recovering about half of Wednesday’s losses. The Fed also said late Wednesday it would start a new lending facility to support U.S. money-market mutual funds. Mr. Mnuchin said the move “will enhance the liquidity and smooth functioning of money markets, support the flow of credit to hard-working Americans, and help stabilize the broader financial system.” • Gabriella Muñoz contributed to this article, which is based in part on wire service reports.

"A free online service to help Americans determine whether they need to visit a doctor or be tested for coronavirus is set to launch universally this week. The telehealth company Ro built the online tool called the Coronavirus Telehealth Assessment and expects to take it nationwide within days. “If an individual thinks they may be experiencing signs or symptoms of the novel coronavirus, they can complete Ro’s online assessment and, if appropriate, Ro will connect them with a provider, who will follow up via secure messaging, phone or video consultation,” CEO Zachariah Reitano wrote on Medium. The company usually provides services tailored to men’s health, women’s health and fighting addiction. But the coronavirus pandemic prompted the company to team with infectious disease specialists and provide its services to Americans wondering if they have contracted the virus. A Ro spokesman said the medical providers on its platform are U.S.-licensed internists, hospital physicians and general practitioners who have coronavirus training following the latest guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, and local health departments. Ro decided to build the tool on a Friday night in late February when it recognized COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was becoming a threat to the U.S. A team of 40 people worked through the weekend to create the product, which went live March 4 at covid.ro.co. Ro says it has facilitated 4 million patient-physician interactions in two-and-a-half years, so it has the infrastructure necessary to handle patient demand and unburden others in the health care system. “As we learn more about the novel coronavirus, we’ll continue to rapidly build features for providers and patients on top of our platform to help in whatever way we can,” said a Ro spokesperson. “We will dedicate whatever resources it takes to be there for our patients.” The company also is working with the federal government as part of the tech sector’s push to help defeat the coronavirus. Many technology companies and employees are reprioritizing their work to focus on the coronavirus or to help ease the burden of healthcare and government officials responding to the crisis. Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter and YouTube have partnered to fight misinformation about the virus on their platforms. The cybersecurity company Criticalstart’s employees are working to better simulate the complex protein folding that occurs in viruses to expedite the search for a vaccine. “The technical community is ready and willing to aid when we can and where we can,” said Quentin Rhoads, the company’s director of professional services.

"CAIRO (AP) - The mother of a prominent Egyptian activist was released from detention after her arrest the previous day for staging a protest demanding that prisoners be released amid the coronavirus pandemic, her daughter said. Laila Soueif, the mother of imprisoned 38-year-old activist Alaa Abdel Fattah, was released late Thursday after being arrested a day earlier along with her daughter, sister and another female activist. The women had rallied outside the headquarters of Egypt’s Cabinet in downtown Cairo raising banners reading: “Release prisoners.”  The four women were charged with violating the country’s strict ban on protests with their small gathering and of spreading false news about Egypt’s over-crowded correctional facilities.  The prosecutor ordered the release of the four detainees late Wednesday on bail. However, Soueif remained in custody and was taken to the State Security Prosecutors’ office for further questioning before she, too, was released, her youngest daughter, Sanaa Seif, wrote on her Facebook page. Seif did not participate in the protest.  A government press officer did not return phone calls seeking comment. Abdel Fattah’s family have all been vocal rights activists in Egypt. Abdel Fattah, a 38-year-old software engineer, grew into a figurehead of the pro-democracy protest movement on social media during the 2011 uprising that removed longtime President Hosni Mubarak. Abdel Fattah served a five-year prison sentence for violating Egypt’s protest ban. In September, not long after his release, he was arrested again amid a widespread crackdown that followed minor protests demanding current President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi step down, although he did not participate in them.  Human rights advocates around the globe are echoing demands to reduce incarceration arguing that prisons can be breeding grounds for the spread of the virus, which leads to the disease COVID-19. Several Middle Eastern countries that were hit by the novel virus have already started releasing prisoners, including Iran and Bahrain.  So far, Egypt’s government has registered seven fatalities among 256 confirmed cases of the infectious disease, none of them inmates.

"Less than three months ago came the first reports of cases of pneumonia related to a virus first detected in Wuhan, China. The outbreak of the virus that causes COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruptions that have brought an unparalleled shock to the global economy.  Following are developments Friday related to the outbreak, efforts by governments to stabilize their economies, companies that must navigate through an altered landscape, and the millions of people affected.  _______ AIRLINES: The Hong Kong low-cost airline HK Express, part of the Cathay Pacific Group, is suspending all flights through the end of April due to falling demand from the coronavirus outbreak. The airline said it tentatively plans to resume flying May 1. HK Express normally flies 25 routes throughout Asia. The decision adds to a wave of flight cancellations by Asian airlines as demand plunges amid travel curbs. Cathay’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways, has cut 90% of flights and asked staff to take unpaid leave. Airlines already were suffering from a downturn in visitors due to political protests last year. Meanwhile, American Airlines said it will operate cargo-only flights between the US and Europe. FedEx and UPS were expecting a greater share of cargo as ￼passenger airlines cut flights using their planes, which carry cargo in their bellies. In the U.S. and elsewhere, airlines are lobbying for taxpayer cash to keep flying through the virus outbreak, despite failing to win White House support for $29 billion in grants. Thirty airline-industry groups appealed Thursday to congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for immediate and long-term help “in the form of grants, unsecured loans and limited tax measures. The survival of our industry depends on it.” President Donald Trump’s administration is supporting $50 billion in secured loans, but not endorsing grants or billions more in tax relief. Consumer advocates and many Democrats in Congress want to tie any help for the airlines to specific measures including aid for workers, limits on ticket-change fees, and a ban on stock buybacks. MARKETS: Asian stock markets were mostly higher Friday after Wall Street gained on hopes government aid and central banks can shield the global economy against the rising impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Benchmarks rose in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Sydney. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P; 500 index rose 0.5% in a relatively modest change compared with violent price swings over the past week. Investors were encouraged after seeing more steps by the Federal Reserve and other central banks as well as governments to support credit markets and the economy. Forecasters say a global recession looks increasingly likely. RETAIL RIGORS: Department store chain Kohl’s Corp. said late Thursday that it has fully drawn its $1 billion unsecured credit facility to bolster its cash and ”preserve its financial flexibility.” The chain, based in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is withdrawing its fiscal full year and first-quarter guidance and slashing its inventory and expenses. Kohl’s has announced temporary closures of its 1,100 stores through at least April 1. It and many other major chains are temporarily closing stores to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Several other chains like Nordstrom and Abercrombie & Fitch have also withdrawn their guidance given so much uncertainty.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard  Burr, R-N.C., sold as much as $1.7 million in stocks just before the  market dropped in February amid fears about the coronavirus epidemic. Senate records show that Burr and his wife sold between roughly  $600,000 and $1.7 million in more than 30 separate transactions in late  January and mid-February, just before the market began to fall and as  government health officials began to issue stark warnings about the  effects of the virus. Several of the stocks were in companies that own  hotels. The stock sales were first reported by ProPublica and The Center for  Responsive Politics. Most of them came on Feb. 13, just before Burr made  a speech in Washington, D.C., in which he predicted severe consequences  from the virus, including closed schools and cutbacks in company  travel, according to audio obtained by National Public Radio and  released Thursday. Burr told the small North Carolina State Society audience that the  virus was “much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that  we have seen in recent history” and “probably more akin to the 1918  pandemic.” Burr’s remarks were much more dire than remarks he had made publicly,  and came as President Donald Trump was still downplaying the severity  of the virus. There is no indication that Burr had any inside information as he  sold the stocks and issued the private warnings. The intelligence panel  did not have any briefings on the pandemic the week when most of the  stocks were sold, according to a person familiar with the matter. The  person declined to be identified to discuss confidential committee  activity. Burr said on Twitter Thursday that Americans were already being  warned about the effects of the virus when he made the speech to the  North Carolina State Society. “The message I shared with my constituents is the one public health  officials urged all of us to heed as coronavirus spread increased,” Burr  wrote. “Be prepared.” Burr sent out the tweets before reports of his stock sales. A  spokesperson for the senator said in a statement that Burr “has been  deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on  our economy” and supports congressional efforts to help the economy.  The spokesperson declined to be identified in order to share the  senator’s thinking. The North Carolina senator was not the only lawmaker to sell of  stocks just before the steep decline due to the global pandemic. Georgia  Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a new senator who is up for reelection this year,  sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in late  January, as senators began to get briefings on the virus, also according  to Senate records. In the weeks that followed, Loeffler urged her constituents to have  faith in the Trump administration’s efforts to prepare the nation. “@realDonaldTrump & his administration are doing a great job  working to keep Americans healthy & safe,” Loeffler tweeted Feb. 27. The Daily Beast first reported that Loeffler dropped the stock in  late January. The senator is married to Jeffrey Sprecher, the chairman  and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock  Exchange. __ This story has been corrected to show that Burr’s speech was in Washington, D.C., not North Carolina.

"Sen. Joni Ernst is calling for more than $350 million sitting in an unused fund to be deployed to the Department of Health and Human Services to purchase face masks and other personal protective equipment for health care workers and those on the front lines combating COVID-19. The $357 million being held in the Presidential Election Campaign Fund would go to the department’s Strategic National Stockpile that stores and disburses emergency medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. “It’s going to take an all hands on deck approach to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. I’ve heard directly from Iowa state officials and our health care providers about the need for additional masks and personal protective equipment,” the Iowa Republican said. “Right now, there’s more than $350 million in unused cash sitting around in the obsolete and outdated presidential election campaign fund. This is simple. We should immediately move that money to where it’s critically needed: Let’s put it toward more masks and personal protective equipment for the health care workers who are on the front lines of this pandemic,” she added. The money in the fund had historically been set aside for presidential party nominating conventions and has been dispersed in the past for pediatric research by the National Institutes of Health.

"President Trump’s approval rating is on the rise for how he is managing the COVID-19 crisis, according to an ABC News poll published Friday. The survey showed 55 percent of Americans approve of Mr. Trump’s strategy compared to 43 percent who disapprove. The ratings show a reversal from last week where 54 percent had disapproved, but 43 percent had liked the president’s handling of the crisis.

"Republicans are eager to hear from Senate colleagues who sold stock shares before the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic that sent the economy spiraling south. Sen.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard  Burr, R-N.C., sold as much as $1.7 million in stocks just before the  market dropped in February amid fears about the coronavirus epidemic. Senate records show that Burr and his wife sold between roughly  $600,000 and $1.7 million in more than 30 separate transactions in late  January and mid-February, just before the market began to fall and as  government health officials began to issue stark warnings about the  effects of the virus. Several of the stocks were in companies that own  hotels. The stock sales were first reported by ProPublica and The Center for  Responsive Politics. Most of them came on Feb. 13, just before Burr made  a speech in Washington, D.C., in which he predicted severe consequences  from the virus, including closed schools and cutbacks in company  travel, according to audio obtained by National Public Radio and  released Thursday. Burr told the small North Carolina State Society audience that the  virus was “much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that  we have seen in recent history” and “probably more akin to the 1918  pandemic.” Burr’s remarks were much more dire than remarks he had made publicly,  and came as President Donald Trump was still downplaying the severity  of the virus. There is no indication that Burr had any inside information as he  sold the stocks and issued the private warnings. The intelligence panel  did not have any briefings on the pandemic the week when most of the  stocks were sold, according to a person familiar with the matter. The  person declined to be identified to discuss confidential committee  activity. Burr said on Twitter Thursday that Americans were already being  warned about the effects of the virus when he made the speech to the  North Carolina State Society. “The message I shared with my constituents is the one public health  officials urged all of us to heed as coronavirus spread increased,” Burr  wrote. “Be prepared.” Burr sent out the tweets before reports of his stock sales. A  spokesperson for the senator said in a statement that Burr “has been  deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on  our economy” and supports congressional efforts to help the economy.  The spokesperson declined to be identified in order to share the  senator’s thinking. The North Carolina senator was not the only lawmaker to sell of  stocks just before the steep decline due to the global pandemic. Georgia  Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a new senator who is up for reelection this year,  sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in late  January, as senators began to get briefings on the virus, also according  to Senate records. In the weeks that followed, Loeffler urged her constituents to have  faith in the Trump administration’s efforts to prepare the nation. “@realDonaldTrump & his administration are doing a great job  working to keep Americans healthy & safe,” Loeffler tweeted Feb. 27. The Daily Beast first reported that Loeffler dropped the stock in  late January. The senator is married to Jeffrey Sprecher, the chairman  and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock  Exchange. __ This story has been corrected to show that Burr’s speech was in Washington, D.C., not North Carolina.

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell laid out a timeline for his chamber to push through negotiations on the third economic coronavirus bill, teeing up a vote for Monday. Senators from both sides of the aisle met with Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and other key White House officials to begin talks to finalize the coronavirus stimulus package based off the proposal Republicans introduced Thursday. “I tasked these bipartisan teams to reach an agreement by the end of today, tonight,” he told reporters. Mr. McConnell plans to file the bill on Saturday — after lawmakers spend the day drafting —  setting the Senate clock up for a full vote on Monday. Going into the meeting, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer voiced his concerns with the Republican package, particularly with the aid to hard-hit sectors of the economy. “Senator McConnell’s bill is not pro-worker at all. It puts corporations ahead of people,” he said. “We are not going to go for any bailouts unless they are worker-friendly. The money goes to workers, employees and no stock buybacks — none of that is in the bill.” Democrats also want to see a robust surge in unemployment benefits and more funds for the overly stressed health care system. In all, the phase three bill is expected to cost more than $1 trillion. In the four-part plan, Republicans aim to extend loans to small businesses; checks to the American public; major support to hard-hit industries; and more funds to the overly strained health care system. Under this proposal, the government would provide about $1,200 to Americans making up to $75,000. The handouts would then be scaled down between $75,000 and $99,000 and provide $500 per child. It includes a $230 billion loan plan for eligible small businesses to go toward payrolls and other operating expenses to help these companies stay afloat and keep their employees. To aid certain sectors of the economy devastated by the virus, the package includes $208 billion in loans. That figure breaks down to $50 billion for airlines, $8 billion for cargo air carriers and $150 billion for other eligible entities.

"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - A man convicted of taking hostages at a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign office in New Hampshire in 2007 has been denied a request to be re-located closer to home to complete his sentence on a later charge.  Leeland Eisenberg was sentenced in 2017 to five years in prison for robbing a bank in Manchester and possessing cocaine. Incarcerated in Indiana, Eisenberg recently asked to serve the rest of his sentence at a facility in Massachusetts. He argued it was better equipped to monitor his heart condition and that he’d be closer to family.  A judge on Thursday said she lacked jurisdiction to grant Eisenberg’s request. She also noted that the Bureau of Prisons is currently reassessing his medical classification to determine whether a transfer to a different facility is appropriate. Eisenberg is scheduled to finish his sentence in November, followed by supervised release. Eisenberg spent at least two years in prison for a five-hour standoff at Clinton’s Rochester, New Hampshire, campaign office during her first run for president. No one was hurt.

"Less than three months ago came the first reports of cases of pneumonia related to a virus first detected in Wuhan, China. The outbreak of the virus that causes COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruptions that have brought an unparalleled shock to the global economy.  Following are developments Friday related to the outbreak, efforts by governments to stabilize their economies, companies that must navigate through an altered landscape, and the millions of people affected.  _______ GROUNDED: The lowest number of passengers ever recorded at U.S. airports is being reported by the Transportation Security Administration. Nearly 624,000 people passed through its outbound checkpoints on Thursday, the TSA said. That compares with 2.4 million on the same day a year earlier. It’s the lowest number of outbound passengers ever recorded by an agency created in November 2001 in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The CEO and labor leaders at American Airlines wrote to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and congressional leaders Friday imploring them to quickly approve aid for airlines or else workers will lose their jobs. The company says it will accept “appropriate conditions” on government aid. Frankfurt airport operator Fraport AG has put 18,000 of its 22,000 employees on shortened schedules, saying that “traffic has come almost to a halt.” Wages will be partly covered by the German government’s short-work policy. The company said it would add payments to ensure at least 75% of pay. Fraport also took its northwest landing runway out of service. It will instead be used to park unused airplanes.  An air traffic control supervisor in Indianapolis tested positive, the Federal Aviation Administration reported. Some work areas were closed Thursday night, but the center remained open Friday while crews cleaned work areas. It’s the third FAA facility affected by COVID-19. Earlier this week, airport towers in Chicago and Las Vegas closed temporarily, leading to hundreds of canceled and delayed flights.  The Hong Kong low-cost airline HK Express, part of the Cathay Pacific Group, is suspending all flights through the end of April with millions of potential travelers shutting in. HK Express normally flies 25 routes throughout Asia. Cathay’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways, has cut 90% of its flights and asked staff to take unpaid leave.  American Airlines is initiating cargo-only flights between the US and Europe. FedEx and UPS were expecting to absorb a greater share of cargo typically carried by commercial airlines, which have severely cut capacity. Air Canada is laying off more than 5,000 flight attendants, about 60% of that staff, according to a union official, as the country’s largest airline grounds its planes. Wesley Lesosky, who heads the Air Canada component of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said the layoffs include 3,600 Air Canada employees, as well as 1,549 at Rogue, Air Canada’s discount carrier. The layoffs will take effect by April. Air Canada says the layoffs are temporary. The Montreal company said earlier this week that it will suspend the majority of its international and U.S. flights by the end of the month. THE STORES: With outbreak-related layoffs expected to surge, at least two major retailers are hiring in a big way. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, said late Thursday that it plans to hire 150,000 U.S. hourly workers for its stores and distribution centers through the end of May as online orders surge with households stocking up. The jobs are temporary, but many will become permanent, said spokesman Dan Bartlett. He said that the company is reaching out to industry groups in the restaurant and hospitality industry, both of which are getting slammed by lockdowns and travel bans. Amazon this week said it would hire 100,000 people across the U.S. to keep up with a crush of orders hires.  CLOSE TO HOME: The chairman and CEO of Marlboro-maker Altria Group has contracted COVID-19. The company said in a regulatory filing that Howard Willard is on medical leave. Chief Financial Officer William Gifford, Jr. will lead the company in Willard’s absence. The company is also suspending operations at its plant in Richmond, Virginia, for two weeks after two employees contracted the COVID-19 virus. Some domestic operations at its John Middleton Co. subsidiary will also be suspended due to supply chain issues. The tobacco giant said employees will continue to receive regular pay during the two-week shutdown. FIREWALL: Companies across almost every sector are raising cash to ride out the outbreak.  Kohl’s has fully drawn its $1 billion unsecured credit facility. The department store chain, based in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is slashing inventory and expenses. Kohl’s Corp. has closed its 1,100 stores for at least the rest of the month. It and many other major chains are temporarily closing stores to curb the spread of the coronavirus.  AT&T; cancelled a $4 billion accelerated stock buyback program scheduled for the second quarter. The company said in a regulatory filing that it’s also canceling any other stock repurchases so it can have financial flexibility and continue to invest in its business. AT&T; said it’s currently unable to estimate the impact the virus will have on its financial and operational results. FUTURE UNKNOWN: Coca-Cola Co. no longer expects to reach previously set financial goals for the year. Coke said in a regulatory filing that restaurant closures, suspended NHL, NBA and MLB seasons, reduced travel, social distancing, and more people working from home is straining operations. The Atlanta company said that it cannot reasonably estimate the negative impact the virus will have.  Kohl’s withdrew its full-year and first-quarter forecasts. Several other chains like Nordstrom and Abercrombie & Fitch have also withdrawn their guidance given so much uncertainty. FACTORIES GO DARK: Thousands of businesses have ordered employees to work remotely. It’s obviously not an option for a number of sectors and the impact on heavy industry has been immense. All major U.S. automakers, including Tesla, have shut down their factories.  Volvo Cars said Friday that its Swedish and U.S. plants will close on Thursday and will remain closed until mid-April. Office employees are being ordered to work remotely with reduced hours. The company said it reopened four manufacturing plants in China earlier this month after an extended closure.  STREAMING LOGJAM: YouTube is reducing its streaming quality in Europe as more users self-isolate at home.  The company, owned by Google, said Friday it would “temporarily default all traffic in the U.K. and the EU to Standard Definition,” instead of high definition. The measure will be in place for 30 days and users will still be able to manually adjust their video quality. YouTube follows Netflix, which said Thursday that it expects the video bit rate reduction to cut its European traffic by a quarter. The companies are responding to a call by the European Union’s internal market commission, which urged streaming services and network operators to help prevent network congestion as more people use their home internet connection to work or learn remotely or for entertainment. iHOARDING: Apple is allowing people to buy only two iPhones online. It may be attempting to prevent the large purchase and resale of its technology at higher prices. Apple is facing a potential demand decline and supply chain issues due to the virus pandemic spreading across the globe. It closed all retail stores outside of China to help fight the spread. Apple did not return a request for comment Friday. Apple announced  a new iPad Pro and MacBook Air on Wednesday. It made no mention of new iPhones during the announcement.

"Five months after Hurricane Dorian devastated Marsh Harbour, Abaco, the sounds of children giggling and running echo through the once eerily silent island air. The children play on an unpaved driveway that runs along the side of the New Haitian Mission Baptist Church. The church stands as one of the few remaining buildings after the monster Category 5 storm tore through the tiny Bahamian island. For the community, it’s a sanctuary and home to those who lost everything. A handful of families who settled at the church after Dorian washed away their homes take refuge between rows of beige tents. Keline, 9, separates herself from the others and flips through some vocabulary workbooks, sounding the words out as she reads. “Be - be - beee - ” Keline and the other children haven’t attended school since Sept. 1, when Hurricane Dorian wiped out all of the schools in Marsh Harbour. The only schools operating on the island are privately run. Her family came over from Haiti for a better life, but they are poor and can’t afford private school. Keline’s dad, Lucner, is heartbroken that Keline cannot attend school. She’s a vivacious learner and reader. Some days, she begs him to go back. She wants to become a nurse and take care of her family. He knows how much potential she has and that’s what hurts him the most. Lucner asked Fresh Take Florida to only use his first name out of fear of retribution. He worries his work visa will not be renewed and his family could be deported. Weeks after the storm, The Ministry of Education ordered residents to come to Nassau to enroll in schools there and in Freeport. Those families who could, made the trip, but Lucner stayed in Marsh Harbour hoping that schools there would eventually open up. His work is in Marsh Harbour. He didn’t want to uproot his family. They waited for months, but no schools ever reopened. Lucner eventually tried taking Keline to Nassau to enroll, but the ministry told him it was too late; she would have to wait until next year. Keline can be quiet sometimes, and in those moments, she thinks about her old life. When she thinks about the storm, she wants to cry. “I didn’t want to die. And I scared to die, because I don’t know where I going.” But other times, missing school pulls her out of her shell to play teacher in the yard with the other kids. She drags a crate along the rocky, dirt path and plops in front of the children. She lectures with authority. “Here, color this,” she demands. “It’s time to sing your ABCs,” she says, “You need to practice.” “I don’t want to,” the other kids whine. They want to play. Keline knows most kids don’t think about their future, they’re focused on games. But she isn’t like the other kids - she thinks about it all the time. What will she become? How will she get there? Lucner and Keline can’t return to their home in “The Mudd,” a former shantytown on the northeast side of Marsh Harbour, home to the poorest of the poor, many of them undocumented Haitian immigrants. The land was obtained from squatter’s rights that allowed the Haitians to first move in beginning in the 1970s. It was one of the first areas targeted by the government for cleanup. The government scraped The Mudd clean of all remnants of life and fenced it off so no one could build on it. Many Haitians immigrated to the Bahamas to escape the oppressive regime of President Jean-Claude Duvalier in Haiti and began pursuing agricultural jobs in the area. They moved mostly into shantytowns with poorly constructed homes and illegal electricity prone to fires. By 2018, Abaco’s shantytowns had grown to over 900 residences, according to a government report. There was growing animosity and disdain toward Haitians living in The Mudd. Before the storm hit, the government of the Bahamas already had plans to relocate all shantytown residents, according to Lesley Johnson from the Bahamas Disaster Reconstruction Authority. Tensions were high. Many Haitians lived in fear of deportation. Some Abaco residents say the government used the storm as an excuse to clear The Mudd and move out the immigrants. In their eyes, clearing The Mudd was prioritized over rebuilding schools and infrastructure. Now, those who used to live in The Mudd have nowhere to live. Johnson said as long as the Haitians are coming in legally, they won’t face discrimination. Lucner has legal status from a work permit, but he still lives in fear. The renewal is never guaranteed and they currently live in limbo - in a tent outside the church. Peering out from the dark shade of her tent, Keline thinks of a longer life. A life as a nurse, caring for her family and others. She wants to see what her family is like years later and how they’re doing, where they might be living. She dreams of college, but for now her school is in the dirt with her books, and she is the teacher. ___ This story was produced by Fresh Take Florida, a news service of the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications.

"Failed Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg announced Friday he will transfer $18 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic National Committee to help beat President Trump. Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire media mogul, said he was making good on his promise to bankroll efforts to beat Mr. Trump regardless of whom Democrats nominate as their standard-bearer. “There is no greater threat to our Democracy than the current occupant in the White House, and Mike launched his campaign with the fundamental goal of defeating him and energizing Democratic victories up and down the ballot,” the Bloomberg campaign said in a statement. The Bloomberg 2020 campaign also will transfer several of its former field offices to state parties and help accelerate the hiring pace for important positions in organizing, data and operations across key battleground states. Mr. Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor and the king of the Bloomberg News empire, is a longtime foe of Mr. Trump. He pinned his White House ambitions on claims that he was uniquely suited to beat the president. His campaign continued to take shots at Mr. Trump in announcing the money transfer, including slamming the president’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “The existential threat posed by Trump has become abundantly clear in his complete mismanagement of the Coronavirus crisis — a crisis that has profound implications for our economy, our public health and our way of life. But we should also not assume that Trump’s incompetence will be enough to make him a one-term President,” it said. “Trump’s ability to lie and propagate misinformation, particularly using digital tools and other means with swing voters in battleground states, will continue to ensure a close race in November. Every decision we make as Democrats must account for this.” The $18 million will likely benefit former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who emerged as the party establishment favorite and is closing in on the nomination despite a dogged challenge by avowed socialist Sen. Bernard Sanders. Mr. Bloomberg jumped in late to the Democratic presidential race and argued that his no-nonsense management style would save the party from a crowded field of flawed candidates. Sitting out the first several nominating contests, his self-financed campaign spent more than $500 million on an advertising blitz focused on the Super Tuesday primaries on March 3. He failed to win any of the 14 states that voted on Super Tuesday. He dropped out the next day.  ",Bloomberg sends $18 million to DNC to help beat Trump," -

"Less than three months ago came the first reports of cases of pneumonia related to a virus first detected in Wuhan, China. The outbreak of the virus that causes COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruptions that have brought an unparalleled shock to the global economy.  Following are developments Friday related to the outbreak, efforts by governments to stabilize their economies, companies that must navigate through an altered landscape, and the millions of people affected.  _______ GROUNDED: The lowest number of passengers ever recorded at U.S. airports is being reported by the Transportation Security Administration. Nearly 624,000 people passed through its outbound checkpoints on Thursday, the TSA said. That compares with 2.4 million on the same day a year earlier. It’s the lowest number of outbound passengers ever recorded by an agency created in November 2001 in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The CEO and labor leaders at American Airlines wrote to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and congressional leaders Friday imploring them to quickly approve aid for airlines or else workers will lose their jobs. The company says it will accept “appropriate conditions” on government aid. Frankfurt airport operator Fraport AG has put 18,000 of its 22,000 employees on shortened schedules, saying that “traffic has come almost to a halt.” Wages will be partly covered by the German government’s short-work policy. The company said it would add payments to ensure at least 75% of pay. Fraport also took its northwest landing runway out of service. It will instead be used to park unused airplanes.  An air traffic control supervisor in Indianapolis tested positive, the Federal Aviation Administration reported. Some work areas were closed Thursday night, but the center remained open Friday while crews cleaned work areas. It’s the third FAA facility affected by COVID-19. Earlier this week, airport towers in Chicago and Las Vegas closed temporarily, leading to hundreds of canceled and delayed flights.  The Hong Kong low-cost airline HK Express, part of the Cathay Pacific Group, is suspending all flights through the end of April with millions of potential travelers shutting in. HK Express normally flies 25 routes throughout Asia. Cathay’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways, has cut 90% of its flights and asked staff to take unpaid leave.  American Airlines is initiating cargo-only flights between the US and Europe. FedEx and UPS were expecting to absorb a greater share of cargo typically carried by commercial airlines, which have severely cut capacity. Air Canada is laying off more than 5,000 flight attendants, about 60% of that staff, according to a union official, as the country’s largest airline grounds its planes. Wesley Lesosky, who heads the Air Canada component of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said the layoffs include 3,600 Air Canada employees, as well as 1,549 at Rogue, Air Canada’s discount carrier. The layoffs will take effect by April. Air Canada says the layoffs are temporary. The Montreal company said earlier this week that it will suspend the majority of its international and U.S. flights by the end of the month. THE STORES: With outbreak-related layoffs expected to surge, at least two major retailers are hiring in a big way. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, said late Thursday that it plans to hire 150,000 U.S. hourly workers for its stores and distribution centers through the end of May as online orders surge with households stocking up. The jobs are temporary, but many will become permanent, said spokesman Dan Bartlett. He said that the company is reaching out to industry groups in the restaurant and hospitality industry, both of which are getting slammed by lockdowns and travel bans. Amazon this week said it would hire 100,000 people across the U.S. to keep up with a crush of orders hires.  CLOSE TO HOME: The chairman and CEO of Marlboro-maker Altria Group has contracted COVID-19. The company said in a regulatory filing that Howard Willard is on medical leave. Chief Financial Officer William Gifford, Jr. will lead the company in Willard’s absence. The company is also suspending operations at its plant in Richmond, Virginia, for two weeks after two employees contracted the COVID-19 virus. Some domestic operations at its John Middleton Co. subsidiary will also be suspended due to supply chain issues. The tobacco giant said employees will continue to receive regular pay during the two-week shutdown. FIREWALL: Companies across almost every sector are raising cash to ride out the outbreak.  Kohl’s has fully drawn its $1 billion unsecured credit facility. The department store chain, based in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is slashing inventory and expenses. Kohl’s Corp. has closed its 1,100 stores for at least the rest of the month. It and many other major chains are temporarily closing stores to curb the spread of the coronavirus.  AT&T; cancelled a $4 billion accelerated stock buyback program scheduled for the second quarter. The company said in a regulatory filing that it’s also canceling any other stock repurchases so it can have financial flexibility and continue to invest in its business. AT&T; said it’s currently unable to estimate the impact the virus will have on its financial and operational results. FUTURE UNKNOWN: Coca-Cola Co. no longer expects to reach previously set financial goals for the year. Coke said in a regulatory filing that restaurant closures, suspended NHL, NBA and MLB seasons, reduced travel, social distancing, and more people working from home is straining operations. The Atlanta company said that it cannot reasonably estimate the negative impact the virus will have.  Kohl’s withdrew its full-year and first-quarter forecasts. Several other chains like Nordstrom and Abercrombie & Fitch have also withdrawn their guidance given so much uncertainty. FACTORIES GO DARK: Thousands of businesses have ordered employees to work remotely. It’s obviously not an option for a number of sectors and the impact on heavy industry has been immense. All major U.S. automakers, including Tesla, have shut down their factories.  Volvo Cars said Friday that its Swedish and U.S. plants will close on Thursday and will remain closed until mid-April. Office employees are being ordered to work remotely with reduced hours. The company said it reopened four manufacturing plants in China earlier this month after an extended closure.  STREAMING LOGJAM: YouTube is reducing its streaming quality in Europe as more users self-isolate at home.  The company, owned by Google, said Friday it would “temporarily default all traffic in the U.K. and the EU to Standard Definition,” instead of high definition. The measure will be in place for 30 days and users will still be able to manually adjust their video quality. YouTube follows Netflix, which said Thursday that it expects the video bit rate reduction to cut its European traffic by a quarter. The companies are responding to a call by the European Union’s internal market commission, which urged streaming services and network operators to help prevent network congestion as more people use their home internet connection to work or learn remotely or for entertainment. iHOARDING: Apple is allowing people to buy only two iPhones online. It may be attempting to prevent the large purchase and resale of its technology at higher prices. Apple is facing a potential demand decline and supply chain issues due to the virus pandemic spreading across the globe. It closed all retail stores outside of China to help fight the spread.

"Georgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler’s stock trades before the coronavirus cratered the U.S. stock markets have quickly complicated her re-election effort. Her top GOP opponent, Rep. Doug Collins, reminded Peach State voters of Ms. Loeffler’s dubious financial maneuvers via Twitter less than 24 hours after the trades were revealed. “People are losing their jobs, their businesses, their retirements, and even their lives and Kelly Loeffler is profiting off their pain?” Mr. Collins tweeted. “I’m sickened just thinking about it.” Ms. Loeffler says she had no personal involvement in the trades, which were made Jan. 24 and involved her and her husband. The couple sold stocks that have dived and bought one that has risen slightly since the virus that emerged in Wuhan, China, went global and has wreaked havoc on financial markets worldwide. She said the moves were made by advisers and that she was not informed of them until mid-February, weeks after they were made. She is one of at least four lawmakers reported to have sold large blocks of shares in the stock market at the same time most Washington officials were seeking to reassure Americans the coronavirus would not prove catastrophic. The contrast between their public positions and their sales, which saved them millions of dollars combined, has given rise to calls for their resignations and possible prosecution for insider trading. The moves, which were included in personal financial reports lawmakers are required to file, were first reported by ProPublica and the Center for Responsive Politics. In addition to Ms. Loeffler, the politicians identified are Republican Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, and California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. All have denied wrongdoing. Ms. Loeffler took her seat in January after longtime Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson retired for health reasons. She was appointed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who picked the wealthy businesswoman and WNBA owner over Mr. Collins, a vociferous ally of President Trump. Since Mr. Kemp’s choice, the Republican establishment has largely fallen in behind Ms. Loeffler, with the National Republican Senatorial Committee throwing its full support behind her re-election bid. All potential challengers, and Mr. Collins in particular, were urged not to complicate the election. The NRSC has not been shy about attacking them since they chose to ignore the party’s wishes.

"Republicans are eager to hear from Senate colleagues who sold stock shares before the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic that sent the economy spiraling south. Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican, said Friday lawmakers are expected to live by the law. His comments come after a report emerged that Sen. Richard Burr, North Carolina Republican, and Sen. Kelly Loeffler, Georgia Republican, sold off stock interests in February ahead of the Dow taking a plunge due to the economic upheaval caused by quarantines and fear of the virus spread. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, and Sen. James Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican, have also been accused of selling off interests before the market crash. The timing of the sales came as lawmakers were being briefed about the pandemic on Capitol Hill, but weeks before President Trump declared a national emergency. “I expect to hear from each of them today,” Mr. Barrasso told “Fox & Fridays.” Mr. Burr, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, sold about $1.7 million in January and February, according to The Associated Press. Several of the stocks were in hotel industry companies. ProPublica and The Center for Responsive Politics first published the information. Mr. Burr’s sales came just prior to a speech he gave in February where he predicted schools would close and travel would be curtailed due to the coronavirus. The audio of the speech was released by National Public Radio. The AP reported there is no information that Mr. Burr had inside information, and his committee did not have any briefings during the week when the stocks were sold. Mr. Burr took to Twitter to blast the “tabloid-style hit piece,” saying NPR misrepresented his speech and that he relayed public information during his remarks. “The message I shared with my constituents is the one public health officials urged all of us to heed as coronavirus spread increased: Be prepared,” Mr. Burr said. Mr. Burr on Friday said he’s requested the Senate Ethics Committee to review his sales, according to Politico. Ms. Loeffler, who is up for reelection, sold off stock in January as lawmakers were being briefed about the crisis. She has dismissed allegations of wrongdoing. “This is a ridiculous and baseless attack. I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband’s knowledge or involvement,” she said on Twitter. “As confirmed in the periodic transaction report to Senate Ethics, I was informed of these purchases and sales on February 16, 2020 — three weeks after they were made.” The senator appeared on Fox News on Friday, again denying allegations of trading on inside information. Ms. Loeffler said reports note that she is informed of her transactions several weeks after they occur. “I’m not involved in the decisions around buying and selling,” she said. “Like any other trades, you can’t see into the future.” The New York Times, meanwhile, reported that Ms. Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, sold off between $1.5 million and $6 million in a California biotech company in January and February. Her spokesperson dismissed any wrongdoing. “All of Senator Feinstein’s assets are in a blind trust,” said Tom Mentzer, Ms. Feinstein’s spokesman. “She has no involvement in her husband’s financial decisions.” Mr. Trump said he didn’t know a lot about it and declined to criticize the senators. “They said they did nothing wrong,” Mr. Trump said. “I find them, the entire group, honorable people.” Mr. Trump emphasized the fact that Ms. Feinstein was among the senators mentioned, elevating a Democrat over Mr. Burr and Ms. Loeffler. Marc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, downplayed the suggestion that senators were receiving insider information from coronavirus briefings. Mr. Pence chairs the task force. “I think that the [pandemic] presentations have been largely of where we stand in the health crisis, nothing beyond that,” Mr. Short told reporters Friday. Millennial socialist darling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took to Twitter to express concerns over the reports. “Members of Congress should not be allowed to own individual stock. We are here to serve the public, not to profiteer. It’s shocking that it’s even been allowed up to this point,” the New York lawmaker tweeted. • Dave Boyer and Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this report.

"WARSAW, Poland (AP) - A popular Warsaw entertainment center looks empty and closed amid a government ordered shutdown from the coronavirus, but inside, cook Bozena Legowska is busy. One hot pizza after another is lifted out of the oven, boxed and whisked to a nearby hospital for a hungry staff of doctors who are working harder than ever under the pressure of the spreading virus. The pizza boxes are inscribed with upbeat messages, including, “You are our heroes.”  The Ale Zebra center in northern Warsaw has joined a growing nationwide network of restaurants and eateries showing their appreciation for the doctors, nurses and other medical professionals by bringing them free meals. Last week, the government imposed a “national quarantine” that closed schools, universities, restaurants and culture centers, asking everyone to stay home if possible. But that order doesn’t apply to health care workers, who face a time of incessant, intensified effort. A nation of 38 million, Poland has 378 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections. Five of the patients have died. While restaurants are closed to the public to try to keep the virus from spreading, they can still do takeout orders and deliveries. That has prompted #gastropomaga - “Gastronomy is helping” - and similar actions on social media to alleviate at least some of the worries for hospital workers who have no time to get a tasty meal. “At least the doctors don’t go hungry or worry where and how to get food,” said Iwona Sobczak, a secretary at the rescue ward of the Bielany Hospital, as she came out into the parking lot to collect the 10 offered pizzas. While those infected with the coronavirus are being treated at another facility, the Bielany Hospital is under greater pressure than usual as other patients are transferred there. Other messages on the pizza boxes for the doctors read: “We are with you” and “Zebra is helping.” Maciej Kolacinski, the host-manager at Ale Zebra, said the “feeling of joy one has when doing something good for the others is hard to describe.” His usually bustling Ale Zebra club caters to all ages with its pizza parlor that can host a party for 120 people, and features laser tag, billiards, slot machines and even an “Escape Room” where players are locked in and must hunt for clues to try to find a way out. It’s all empty and quiet now. Hand disinfectants are next to a wash basin and on the counter. A customer collects his order of two pizzas through a small window from the outside and pays with a touch card. “Our financial situation is not a comfortable one,” Kolacinski said. “We are making no money, but this is true for every one now. We are trying to do something positive.” On March 11, the government announced a “shield program” worth 212 billion zlotys ($52 billion; 47 billion euros) for businesses hit by the pandemic. The bailout includes state contributions to wages, postponement of social insurance payments and an injection of cash for infrastructure and education investments. The “meals for medics” campaign has been joined by many others in Warsaw. The Indian Taste restaurant is among those delivering food to the contagious diseases hospital on Wolska street, where coronavirus patients are treated. One of the deliverymen wearing a scarf across his face carried a container of spicy food with lots of garlic and ginger.  “I live nearby. Maybe I also catch the virus and I will have to be hospitalized here,” he told the OKO.press independent news portal in a video interview. The campaign to provide free food for medics began last week in the eastern city of Bialystok and has spread nationwide. Magdalena Rothe, owner of the Futu Sushi bar in Bialystok, was among the first to call hospitals to ask how she can help. Now a group of restaurants and bakeries have organized a schedule of deliveries to hospitals to avoid overlapping. “We will not feed the entire hospital, but those 15 meals will allow the doctors to sit down for a while and eat something,” Rothe told The Associated Press by phone. “It is a spontaneous gesture of thanks for their very stressful work these days.” In other acts of social solidarity during an uncertain time in Poland, people are posting notices for elderly neighbors, offering to go shopping or walk their dogs so the vulnerable can stay home and isolate themselves from infection. An ambulance station that is on the front line of the virus crisis was another recipient of the free pizzas from Ale Zebra. Paramedic Jozef Grygo took to social media to thank them, saying a “full rescuer is a good rescuer.” — While nonstop global news about the effects of the coronavirus have become commonplace, so, too, are the stories about the kindness of strangers and individuals who have sacrificed for others. “One Good Thing” is an AP continuing series reflecting these acts of kindness. — Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

"Failed Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg announced Friday he will transfer $18 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic National Committee to help beat President Trump. Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire media mogul, said he was making good on his promise to bankroll efforts to beat Mr. Trump regardless of whom Democrats nominate as their standard-bearer. “There is no greater threat to our Democracy than the current occupant in the White House, and Mike launched his campaign with the fundamental goal of defeating him and energizing Democratic victories up and down the ballot,” the Bloomberg campaign said in a statement. The Bloomberg 2020 campaign also will transfer several of its former field offices to state parties and help accelerate the hiring pace for important positions in organizing, data and operations across key battleground states. Mr. Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor and the king of the Bloomberg News empire, is a longtime foe of Mr. Trump.

The outbreak of the virus that causes COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruptions that have brought an unparalleled shock to the global economy.

The layoffs will take effect by April. Air Canada says the layoffs are temporary. The Montreal company said earlier this week that it will suspend the majority of its international and U.S. flights by the end of the month. Airlines are continuing to push for cash – not just loans – from taxpayers to cope with the virus outbreak. Faye Malarkey Black, president of a trade group for smaller airlines, said Friday that Senate Republicans’ proposal for $58 billion in loans “does not help save the regional airline industry or our 70,000 employees.” She said regional airlines, which operate flights under brand names Delta Connection, American Eagle and United Express, won’t survive without direct financial aid or unsecured loans in which amounts spent to keep workers are forgiven. A White House proposal called for $50 billion in unsecured loans but no grants. Some lawmakers and critics want limits on a bailout for airlines that made tens of billions in profit over the previous decade and spent much of it on shareholder dividends and buying back their own stock. HELP NEEDED: With outbreak-related layoffs expected to surge, at least two major retailers are hiring in a big way. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, said late Thursday that it plans to hire 150,000 U.S. hourly workers for its stores and distribution centers through the end of May as online orders surge with households stocking up.

Amazon this week said it would hire 100,000 people across the U.S. to keep up with a crush of orders hires.  Target Corp. said Friday it will give a $2 an hour wage increase to its 300,000-plus workers who have been scrambling to help customers. The pay bump will be effective at least through May 2. It’s also begun offering workers who are pregnant, 65 years old or older, or who have underlying health risks, access to paid leave for up to 30 days. Target joins Amazon and Walmart which are offering extra incentives like cash bonuses or a temporary wage bump as they try to manage the crush of customers while simultaneously looking to keep their workers happy. NOT HIRING: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government has received 500,000 applications for employment insurance compared to just 27,000 for the same week last year. Trudeau says they are receiving a historic number of calls from concerned Canadians amid the pandemic. This week, the U.S. reported the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits surged by 70,000 to the highest level in more than two years. The British government has unveiled a massive economic support package to protect workers through the shock of the coronavirus pandemic. For the first time, the government may help pay wages in the private sector. The so-called coronavirus job retention scheme will involve companies applying for a grant 80% of the salaries of these retained workers, up to 2,500 pounds per month. Companies will be able to add to this if they wish. Sunak also announced further support measures for those who have lost their jobs and for those who are self-employed. A series of taxes, including those on sales, have been deferred while a business interruption loan scheme, worth 330 billion pounds, is now to be interest free for 12 months. CLOSE TO HOME: The chairman and CEO of Marlboro-maker Altria Group has contracted COVID-19. The company said in a regulatory filing that Howard Willard is on medical leave. Chief Financial Officer William Gifford, Jr. will lead the company in Willard’s absence. The company is also suspending operations at its plant in Richmond, Virginia, for two weeks after two employees contracted the COVID-19 virus. Some domestic operations at its John Middleton Co. subsidiary will also be suspended due to supply chain issues. The tobacco giant said employees will continue to receive regular pay during the two-week shutdown. NBC News reported Friday that an employee who worked at the company’s 30 Rockefeller Plaza headquarters in New York has died from COVID-19. According to his wife, Larry Edgeworth had other health issues before contracting the coronavirus. Edgeworth died Thursday.

All major U.S. automakers, including Tesla, have shut down their factories.  Mercedes-Benz is one of the latest automakers to announce that it’s pausing production. The company says Friday its auto plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and a van factory in Charleston, South Carolina, will start to wind down production Monday, for at least two weeks. The company says it’s following recommendations of authorities and that it will monitor the situation and “take further measures as required” to help contain the spread of the virus. Jaguar Land Rover is suspending production at its U.K. plants. The company said in a statement that production will be temporarily halted over the course of next week, with the intention of resuming on April 20, subject to a review of the “rapidly-changing circumstances.” Though it is shuttering its plants in the U.K., its manufacturing plants in Brazil and India continue operating. The company’s joint venture plant in China reopened around a month ago. Des Quinn, an official from the Unite union, said as a result of previous agreements with the company workers will continue to be fully paid. Other firms including BMW, Honda and Toyota have already halted production in the U.K. Volvo Cars said Friday that its Swedish and U.S. plants will close on Thursday and will remain closed until mid-April. Office employees are being ordered to work remotely with reduced hours. The company said it reopened four manufacturing plants in China earlier this month after an extended closure.

Bill Lee announced Friday that his administration is working on allowing local officials to meet electronically, rather than in person, to mitigate the risk of spreading the new coronavirus. “We need to provide open government and at the same time provide logistics for these governments to meet in the midst of this crisis so they don’t gather together in groups that create a public health hazard,” Lee told reporters. Lee didn’t reveal specifics about what exactly his team was considering regarding open meeting exemptions, but said he would soon release an executive order once everything had been fleshed out. The Republican governor’s administration has been forced to step in and find a way to help local governments meet safely amid a global pandemic after the GOP-dominated Statehouse failed to do so the day before temporarily recessing Thursday. Lawmakers had spent the majority of this week scrambling to approve a drastically scaled-back spending plan for the upcoming fiscal year so they could recess until June 1. While members advanced a handful of other non-budget measures deemed “mission critical,” disagreements swirled around how much tweaking the open meeting law was needed to help cities and counties meet electronically. Multiple versions surfaced, but ultimately, the House and Senate could not find a compromise. Specifically, the Senate’s version included restricted local officials from conferencing in electronically for essential business that could not be “reasonably delayed.” The House didn’t contain such limits. Additionally, the Senate version required a governor-declared state of emergency to be in place if the public was not going to be given the option of attending. The House left that requirement out. “Note to local officials in (Tennessee): we will be looking to see if there are statutory or administrative alternatives to allow safe conduct of meetings with transparency and public access,” said Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Democrat from Nashville, in a tweet on Thursday. “Sorry it didn’t get done tonight.” Lee has already issued several COVID-19 related executive orders targeting relief to small business and relaxing a wide-range of regulations in order to speed up emergency response to those affected by the virus. On Friday, Lee said his daughter was among those workers who lost their job in a restaurant that has closed. But he focused on the example of her two coworkers, a married couple with four children, who lost their jobs. He said the possibility of mandating businesses to close, which he has not required statewide so far, means eliminating paychecks, so he’s trying to strike a balance during the ongoing health crisis. “I believe to the degree that we can curb behavior and change behavior and find responsible behavior taking place across our state, to the degree that we can do that without mandates, it’s better for everyone,” Lee said. Meanwhile, as the number of confirmed cases jump across the state, cities like Nashville and Memphis have limited restaurants to take-out orders, drive-thru service, curbside pickup, and delivery service. Most have ordered gyms to close. Lee has held off from enforcing any statewide mandates, but said his administration is starting up an economic task force to discuss ways to help reeling businesses and workers. He says he’s seeking guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services about possibly using Medicaid to cover uninsured people’s treatment for the coronavirus. For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For people with existing health problems and older adults, it can cause more severe illness requiring hospitalization at a time when beds and supplies are scarce. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. Tennessee has more than 260 confirmed cases as of Friday. Shelby County Health Department Director Alisa Haushalter said Friday that there are 30 confirmed cases, up from 10 the day before. Cases have been spread by travelers, and in social groups and in the workplace, she said. Shelby County Schools Superintendent Joris Ray said food preparations and community-wide food distribution have been suspended indefinitely in response to the rising number of cases, as well as a central nutrition services employee testing positive for the virus. Ray said the district has begun working to identify people the employee had been in contact with. In the interim, he asked for the help from the community, including food pantries, to feed children while schools are closed. Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland said Friday that a Memphis Police Department employee has tested positive for the virus. ___ Correspondent Adrian Sainz contributed to this report from Memphis. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"MOSCOW (AP) - Activists in Moscow vowed Friday to persist with their campaign against plans to bulldoze a highway through a radioactive waste site, despite a police crackdown and mass detentions.  The campaign started two months ago as a small grassroots effort, and made national headlines on Thursday night after riot police stormed the protesters’ make-shift command post near the site and detained more than 60 people.  On Friday, several dozen people gathered near the site once again. “We will continue to fight. Of course, we’re not willing to give up,” Larisa Bodrova, one of the activists, told The Associated Press before the meeting.  Awareness about environmental issues has been growing in Russia in recent years. In a poll released in December 2019 by the Levada independent pollster, 48% of Russians named environmental pollution as the number one threat of the 21st century, prioritizing it over terrorism. Environmental activism has been on the rise too. In 2018-2019, spontaneous environmental campaigns across the country - mostly against toxic landfills operating at capacity - accounted for the biggest non-political protests. Bodrova and dozens of other activists live in residential blocks in southeast Moscow, where city authorities plan to build a multi-lane motorway. Part of it is supposed to go through a plot of land where at least 60,000 tons of nuclear waste are buried, according to Russia’s public health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor.  Digging into this contaminated land is dangerous as it would stir up a huge amount of radioactive dust, Alexei Ozerov, a physicist supporting the activists, told the AP. “People will be inhaling it, and (the dust) will spread quite far - 10-15 kilometers (around the site),” Ozerov said.  Radiation levels on the surface of the soil in the area are already several times higher than normal, activists who regularly take measurements argue.  Construction work was supposed to start in early January, but the activists blocked the entrance to the contaminated area, not letting workers and trucks in. Since then, they have been camping out there 24/7, keeping warm in an old used minivan they all chipped in to buy.  “I don’t have another home, I don’t have a place I could move to,” activist and local resident Katya Maksimova told the AP in February. “Neither do other residents, so we (continue to) keep the vigil.”  In late January, Moscow officials acknowledged the problem and admitted the area had “minor traces” of contamination. They promised to start removing the contaminated earth in the spring, but the activists continued their 24/7 watch, demanding a through investigation into the levels of contamination first.  As the starting date for earth removal works loomed, the police turned up the pressure on the activists and tried to clear out the make-shift camp this week. Their first attempt on Tuesday night to tow away the minivan and fence off the area was unsuccessful: the activists, supported by dozens of local residents, blocked the tow truck and refused to go away despite the presence of a riot squad. The resistance continued on Wednesday, and on Thursday resulted in mass detentions. By Friday morning, almost all of those detained were let go. The minivan was towed away, and the area where the activists used to gather was fenced off, but the group called for a gathering nonetheless.  “Yes, it is scary,” Maksimova said, recalling clashes with the police on Thursday. “But we’re not prepared to throw in the towel.”   ",Moscow activists vow to fight on after clashes with police,"Friday, March 20, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/20/moscow-activists-vow-to-fight-on-after-clashes-wit/,washington_times
"The former White House intern whose affair with then-President Bill Clinton led to his impeachment doesn’t approve of the current White House occupant’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. And Monica Lewinsky gave her 750,000 Twitter followers an idea for sharing that disapproval. Ms. Lewinsky, whose recent public persona has been as an anti-bullying #MeToo activist “asked” her followers to mail their body waste to the White House. “They’ve now decided they will test EVERYONE for the Covid-19 Virus. Please send a stool sample to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500,” she wrote. It wasn’t clear from Ms. Lewinsky’s feed what she disliked about the White House coronavirus response.

"Like a baseball catcher thrown into left field, Sean Spicer found himself facing the White House podium on Friday instead of directing the action in the briefing room. Mr. Spicer served as President Trump’s first press secretary but only made it the summer of 2017 after a turbulent run. He wrote a book and appeared on “Dancing with the Stars,” but now he’s got a show on Newsmax TV, so he posted up in the seat reserved for the outlet and One America News Network at Mr. Trump’s daily coronavirus briefing. “In the back, please,” Mr. Trump said as he called on Mr. Spicer, treating him like any other reporter. Mr. Spicer asked about small businesses that are concerned they’ll only survive “weeks, not months,” amid the coronavirus crisis. He also asked whether the president is concerned about the U.S. senators who’ve been accused of using private coronavirus briefings to make stock trades. “I find them all to be honorable people,” Mr. Trump told his former spokesman. “They say they did nothing wrong,”  ",Sean Spicer returns to White House briefing room... as a reporter,"Friday, March 20, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/20/sean-spicer-returns-white-house-briefing-room-repo/,washington_times
"President Trump’s job approval rating jumped 4 percentage points in under one week, according to a new Harris Poll. Mr. Trump’s approval rating jumped to 53% in Harris’ national surveys conducted March 17 and 18, Tuesday and Wednesday, which was up from 49% in polling taken on March 14 and 15. Support for the president is tied to the public’s view of his handling the coronavirus outbreak and his approach to foreign affairs. Approval of Mr. Trump’s management of the coronavirus crisis rose 5 percentage points to 56% in polling conducted this week. His handling of foreign affairs rose 3 percentage points to 52% in the same timeframe. Harris Insights and Analytics surveyed 2,050 American adults online in two waves — on March 14 and 15 and later on March 17 and 18. Alongside growing support for the president’s job approval in this time frame is a growing propensity of the American people to get news about the coronavirus from Mr. Trump. The percentage of respondents turning to Mr. Trump for information rose 11 percentage points to 44% in the second wave of polling. Similarly, the percentage of respondents turning to their state’s governor jumped 9 percentage points to 37%. The Harris Poll also found a majority of respondents do not fear dying from the coronavirus. Seventy-two percent of respondents said they do not fear they could die as a result of contracting the virus.

"Less than three months ago came the first reports of cases of pneumonia related to a virus first detected in Wuhan, China. The outbreak of the virus that causes COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruptions that have brought an unparalleled shock to the global economy.  Following are developments Friday related to the outbreak, efforts by governments to stabilize their economies, companies that must navigate through an altered landscape, and the millions of people affected.  _______ GROUNDED: The lowest number of passengers ever recorded at U.S. airports is being reported by the Transportation Security Administration. Nearly 624,000 people passed through its outbound checkpoints on Thursday, the TSA said. That compares with 2.4 million on the same day a year earlier. It’s the lowest number of outbound passengers ever recorded by an agency created in November 2001 in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The CEO and labor leaders at American Airlines wrote to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and congressional leaders Friday imploring them to quickly approve aid for airlines or else workers will lose their jobs. The company says it will accept “appropriate conditions” on government aid. Frankfurt airport operator Fraport AG has put 18,000 of its 22,000 employees on shortened schedules, saying that “traffic has come almost to a halt.” Wages will be partly covered by the German government’s short-work policy. The company said it would add payments to ensure at least 75% of pay. Fraport also took its northwest landing runway out of service. It will instead be used to park unused airplanes.  An air traffic control supervisor in Indianapolis tested positive, the Federal Aviation Administration reported. Some work areas were closed Thursday night, but the center remained open Friday while crews cleaned work areas. It’s the third FAA facility affected by COVID-19. Earlier this week, airport towers in Chicago and Las Vegas closed temporarily, leading to hundreds of canceled and delayed flights.  American Airlines is initiating cargo-only flights between the US and Europe. FedEx and UPS were expecting to absorb a greater share of cargo typically carried by commercial airlines, which have severely cut capacity. Air Canada is laying off more than 5,000 flight attendants, about 60% of that staff, according to a union official, as the country’s largest airline grounds its planes. Wesley Lesosky, who heads the Air Canada component of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said the layoffs include 3,600 Air Canada employees, as well as 1,549 at Rogue, Air Canada’s discount carrier. The layoffs will take effect by April. Air Canada says the layoffs are temporary. The Montreal company said earlier this week that it will suspend the majority of its international and U.S. flights by the end of the month. Airlines are continuing to push for cash – not just loans – from taxpayers to cope with the virus outbreak. Faye Malarkey Black, president of a trade group for smaller airlines, said Friday that Senate Republicans’ proposal for $58 billion in loans “does not help save the regional airline industry or our 70,000 employees.” She said regional airlines, which operate flights under brand names Delta Connection, American Eagle and United Express, won’t survive without direct financial aid or unsecured loans in which amounts spent to keep workers are forgiven. A White House proposal called for $50 billion in unsecured loans but no grants. Some lawmakers and critics want limits on a bailout for airlines that made tens of billions in profit over the previous decade and spent much of it on shareholder dividends and buying back their own stock. HELP NEEDED: With outbreak-related layoffs expected to surge, at least two major retailers are hiring in a big way. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, said late Thursday that it plans to hire 150,000 U.S. hourly workers for its stores and distribution centers through the end of May as online orders surge with households stocking up. The jobs are temporary, but many will become permanent, said spokesman Dan Bartlett. He said that the company is reaching out to industry groups in the restaurant and hospitality industry, both of which are getting slammed by lockdowns and travel bans. Amazon this week said it would hire 100,000 people across the U.S. to keep up with a crush of orders hires.  Target Corp. said Friday it will give a $2 an hour wage increase to its 300,000-plus workers who have been scrambling to help customers. The pay bump will be effective at least through May 2. It’s also begun offering workers who are pregnant, 65 years old or older, or who have underlying health risks, access to paid leave for up to 30 days. Target joins Amazon and Walmart which are offering extra incentives like cash bonuses or a temporary wage bump as they try to manage the crush of customers while simultaneously looking to keep their workers happy. NOT HIRING: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government has received 500,000 applications for employment insurance compared to just 27,000 for the same week last year. Trudeau says they are receiving a historic number of calls from concerned Canadians amid the pandemic. This week, the U.S. reported the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits surged by 70,000 to the highest level in more than two years. The British government has unveiled a massive economic support package to protect workers through the shock of the coronavirus pandemic. For the first time, the government may help pay wages in the private sector. The so-called coronavirus job retention scheme will involve companies applying for a grant 80% of the salaries of these retained workers, up to 2,500 pounds per month. Companies will be able to add to this if they wish. Sunak also announced further support measures for those who have lost their jobs and for those who are self-employed. A series of taxes, including those on sales, have been deferred while a business interruption loan scheme, worth 330 billion pounds, is now to be interest free for 12 months. CLOSE TO HOME: The chairman and CEO of Marlboro-maker Altria Group has contracted COVID-19. The company said in a regulatory filing that Howard Willard is on medical leave. Chief Financial Officer William Gifford, Jr. will lead the company in Willard’s absence. The company is also suspending operations at its plant in Richmond, Virginia, for two weeks after two employees contracted the COVID-19 virus. Some domestic operations at its John Middleton Co. subsidiary will also be suspended due to supply chain issues. The tobacco giant said employees will continue to receive regular pay during the two-week shutdown. NBC News reported Friday that an employee who worked at the company’s 30 Rockefeller Plaza headquarters in New York has died from COVID-19. According to his wife, Larry Edgeworth had other health issues before contracting the coronavirus. Edgeworth died Thursday. FIREWALL: Companies across almost every sector are raising cash to ride out the outbreak.  Kohl’s has fully drawn its $1 billion unsecured credit facility. The department store chain, based in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is slashing inventory and expenses. Kohl’s Corp. has closed its 1,100 stores for at least the rest of the month. It and many other major chains are temporarily closing stores to curb the spread of the coronavirus.  AT&T; canceled a $4 billion accelerated stock buyback program scheduled for the second quarter. The company said in a regulatory filing that it’s also canceling any other stock repurchases so it can have financial flexibility and continue to invest in its business. AT&T; said it’s currently unable to estimate the impact the virus will have on its financial and operational results. FUTURE UNKNOWN: Coca-Cola Co. no longer expects to reach previously set financial goals for the year. Coke said in a regulatory filing that restaurant closures, suspended NHL, NBA and MLB seasons, reduced travel, social distancing, and more people working from home is straining operations. The Atlanta company said that it cannot reasonably estimate the negative impact the virus will have.  Kohl’s withdrew its full-year and first-quarter forecasts. Several other chains like Nordstrom and Abercrombie & Fitch have also withdrawn their guidance given so much uncertainty. FACTORIES GO DARK: Thousands of businesses have ordered employees to work remotely. It’s obviously not an option for a number of sectors and the impact on heavy industry has been immense. All major U.S. automakers, including Tesla, have shut down their factories.  Mercedes-Benz is one of the latest automakers to announce that it’s pausing production. The company says Friday its auto plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and a van factory in Charleston, South Carolina, will start to wind down production Monday, for at least two weeks. The company says it’s following recommendations of authorities and that it will monitor the situation and “take further measures as required” to help contain the spread of the virus. Jaguar Land Rover is suspending production at its U.K. plants. The company said in a statement that production will be temporarily halted over the course of next week, with the intention of resuming on April 20, subject to a review of the “rapidly-changing circumstances.” Though it is shuttering its plants in the U.K., its manufacturing plants in Brazil and India continue operating. The company’s joint venture plant in China reopened around a month ago. Des Quinn, an official from the Unite union, said as a result of previous agreements with the company workers will continue to be fully paid. Other firms including BMW, Honda and Toyota have already halted production in the U.K. Volvo Cars said Friday that its Swedish and U.S. plants will close on Thursday and will remain closed until mid-April. Office employees are being ordered to work remotely with reduced hours. The company said it reopened four manufacturing plants in China earlier this month after an extended closure.  STREAMING LOGJAM: YouTube is reducing its streaming quality in Europe as more users self-isolate at home.  The company, owned by Google, said Friday it would “temporarily default all traffic in the U.K. and the EU to Standard Definition,” instead of high definition. The measure will be in place for 30 days and users will still be able to manually adjust their video quality. YouTube follows Netflix, which said Thursday that it expects the video bit rate reduction to cut its European traffic by a quarter. The companies are responding to a call by the European Union’s internal market commission, which urged streaming services and network operators to help prevent network congestion as more people use their home internet connection to work or learn remotely or for entertainment. iHOARDING: Apple is allowing people to buy only two iPhones online. It appears to be attempting to prevent the large purchase and resale of its technology at higher prices. Apple is facing a potential demand decline and supply chain issues due to the virus pandemic spreading across the globe. It closed all retail stores outside of China to help fight the spread. Apple did not return a request for comment Friday. Apple announced  a new iPad Pro and MacBook Air on Wednesday. It made no mention of new iPhones during the announcement.

"Editorials from around New England:  CONNECTICUT  In coronavirus crisis, there are no haves and have-nots Stamford Advocate March 20 We must do better. A person’s soul can be defined by how they respond to others in crisis. Dueling impulses of empathy and selfishness are at a crossroads in 2020. We’ve seen hopeful gestures during a health crisis unlike any the world has seen in more than a century. These acts of kindness have been next door (neighbors bringing groceries to the elderly) and corporate (Disneyland donating supplies to a food bank). There have been many such acts here in Connecticut, home of the widest wealth gap in the nation, such as nonprofits banding together to create fund drives for residents thrust into a financial abyss. Alas, there have already been collisions at that crossroad. The planned execution of testing for the virus is relatively simple. Perhaps not as simple as “drive-thru” might suggest for fast food regulars, but users sign up online, confirm an appointment after a physician’s approval and are tested while remaining in their car. Results are processed within five days, sometimes within 48 hours. What could go wrong? Well, the evergreen Not In My Backyard (NIMBY) response took hold. A Greenwich location was shut down and Stamford and Stratford locations were changed. “The problem here is the tenants that are complaining,” Dr. Steven A. R. Murphy said in Stamford. “They are afraid they’re going to get coronavirus.” It took just four hours to lapse between Darien First Selectman Jayme Stevenson releasing plans for testing at town hall and following up with an announcement the site would be moved. Her emailed explanation underscored the conflict of residents who didn’t want to leave town to be tested, but don’t want others to do so anywhere nearby. “Folks want the ability to be tested and prefer to stay close to home rather than going to a nearby hospital or other out-of-town site,” Stevenson wrote. At lunchtime Friday, Stamford Mayor David Martin announced a new strategy for testing. In the wake of closing a makeshift parking lot site on Bedford Street in the city’s downtown, hours were set up in the more accessible Cummings Park on the waterfront. “I believe Stamford’s testing demand could grow to 10,000 tests a week,” Martin predicted Friday. Stratford also relocated, and will open a new location Monday at the Honeywell Plant parking lot. Many people are, understandably, scared. They need the reliability of knowing locations remain where they are announced by community leaders. People need the reassurance that they can’t catch coronavirus by looking out the window at phlebotomists in masks and gowns. It may not be a pleasant sight to see specimens collected by swapping mouths and noses, but that’s today’s reality. Having it take place out of sight doesn’t make it go away. Coronavirus does not distinguish between the haves and the have-nots. No one wants it, but anyone can get it. Any roadblocks to helping someone get tested is potentially self-destructive. Let’s do better. Online: https://bit.ly/3a7JEhR ___ MAINE Feeding low-income kids remains crucial during coronavirus outbreak Bangor Daily News March 15 Government officials, from the president to Gov. Janet Mills, are scrambling to contain the coronavirus. These efforts, rightly, focus on public health measures - such as cancelling large events and curtailing travel - and on economic stability. As with other disasters or unforeseen events, those at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder are most harmed by these disruptions. A missing paycheck because they were forced to stay home without paid leave or a school or daycare closure can spell economic disaster for many Americans. It also means that many children could go hungry. As schools around the country close in an attempt to control the spread of coronavirus, many children were in danger of losing their primary - and in some cases their only - source of food. That’s why it’s good news that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has granted states waivers to continue food service programs even if schools are closed.The waivers allow schools to provide meals at remote locations and for the meals to be picked up and taken home. Currently, nearly 80,000 Maine kids - more than 43 percent of the state’s school population - rely on free or low-cost school breakfast, lunch and after-school meals for their basic food needs. If schools closed, as they have in several states, as part of an effort to stop the spread of coronavirus, those children could go hungry. “Our schools are often a critical partner of Maine families to ensure that our children receive nutritious and consistent meals” Maine Department of Education Commissioner Pender Makin said in a statement Wednesday. “I am grateful for the advocacy of the Child Nutrition Team and for the response from USDA, allowing our schools to continue with this important work, regardless of any interruption that may occur due to school closings.” Mills has not recommended K-12 school cancellations in Maine, but the waivers mean that children are protected in case schools are temporarily shuttered. During a House Appropriations Committee hearing on Tuesday, Rep. Chellie Pingree pressed Agriculture Secretary Sonny Purdue for a commitment that these waivers would be granted. He said the department could not issue blanket waivers without being asked, but that waivers would granted. “If you ask, we are going to say yes,” Purdue said during the hearing. “For the one in five Maine children experiencing food insecurity, their school meal is often the only one that they receive each day,” Pingree said in a statement. “As schools across the nation take precautions to prevent exposure to COVID-19, it’s vital that states have flexibility to continue providing meals to students off-site. I am grateful that the USDA has moved swiftly to approve Maine’s waiver and to prevent kids from going hungry during this public health emergency.” This is one example of the many small, but meaningful, steps that governments - at the federal, state and local level, will need to take to ensure that families don’t face unnecessary hardships as the U.S. seeks to minimize the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Online: https://bit.ly/2vEiDn9                 ___               MASSACHUSETTS  Citizen access still key in local government The Newburyport Daily News March 20 It has been a week since Gov. Charlie Baker’s emergency order allowed the Bay State’s thousands of city and town boards to bypass many of the provisions of the state’s Open Meeting Law. The move was designed for our new, hopefully temporary, reality. Municipal buildings are closed in response to the deepening coronavirus pandemic, and residents — including elected and appointed officials — are being asked to practice social distancing and stay at home as much as possible. The order, signed March 12, lets board members attend meetings via phone or video conferencing. It also allows councils, committees and boards to meet without the public in the room provided they make accommodations for citizen access through “adequate, alternative means.” For some boards, that means web-based meeting sites such as Zoom and GoToMeeting. For others, it’s streaming live on cable access TV, or using audio conferencing. To be sure, these are extraordinary times, and keeping government officials and employees safe while preventing the spread of the virus is an important priority. But so too is ensuring citizens can participate in self-governance. Using freedom bestowed to make timely decisions on the response to the pandemic can be seen as reasonable, as long as a good faith effort is made to have the public involved, and as long as the work being done relates to the vital function of government in a time of crisis. It should not be used, say, to select a new superintendent. But that’s just what the Peabody School Committee did Wednesday night, after holding two days of interviews with six candidates. It was a decision made without a visit to the schools by the candidates. Committee members, including Mayor Ted Bettencourt, said they moved to hire Revere Assistant Superintendent Joshua Vadala, a Peabody resident acquainted with members of the board, because they were worried he’d take an offer elsewhere. Expediency doesn’t equal emergency. Committee members should be much more worried that their vote took place in an empty Higgins Middle School library. Here’s hoping officials from across the region don’t try to follow their lead. Citizen access is central to the proper functioning of government; it’s not an add-on that can be discarded when times are tough. Online: https://bit.ly/2QA1bY1 ___ NEW HAMPSHIRE Awareness is the biggest key to virus Nashua Telegraph March 20  It is likely our awareness of how widespread COVID-19 is in the United States represents only the tip of the iceberg. Until widespread testing kicks in, many among us made by carrying the virus unknowingly, both to themselves and the rest of us. Still, paying attention to what information we do have is important. Self-defense experts advise the most important thing we can do to protect ourselves against any threat is to practice situational awareness. That is, know what hazards are present and how serious they are. As of Sunday evening, 3,244 Americans had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Sixty-two of them had died. Of the deaths, 40 had been in Washington State, most at a hard-hit nursing home. Nearly two-thirds of the COVID-19 cases New York (729), Washington (642), California (374), Massachusetts (138) and Florida (115). Most other states were reporting COVID-19 in single or double digits. One, West Virginia, had no confirmed patients. For now, then, the greatest danger appeared to be in a handful of states. Again, however, appearances can be deceiving. Large-scale testing may alter the picture. But - and this is an enormously important “but” - large numbers of COVID-19 infections probably occurred in the hardest-hit states before awareness of the coronavirus had spread and before tens of millions of Americans began taking steps to minimize exposure to those infected by it. So the message on situational awareness is mixed. At first glance, it appears Americans in many states may have little about which to worry from COVID-19. That could change. For now, then, both public and individual measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 are critical. Local, state and federal government restrictions will help. Keeping ourselves and our families safe, however, is up to us. So, stay aware. We at this newspaper will keep you informed of developments, with emphasis on the local area. For additional information, check the state and federal websites focusing on COVID-19. Stay informed - and stay well. This is a situation in which knowledge really is power. Online: https://bit.ly/3dckAIp ___ RHODE ISLAND  Don’t forget our civil liberties Providence Journal March 19 In a society that prides itself on its openness and transparency, U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts (so-called “FISA Courts”) stick out like a sore thumb. We never want the government to wantonly abuse the rights of citizens, or train its power against the people because of their political views. The First Amendment is designed to protect against such abuses. First established in 1978, FISA court proceedings are held in secret. To some degree, this makes sense; FISA courts are ostensibly designed to grant surveillance warrants - FISA warrants - against those suspected of being foreign spies. Most often sought by the National Security Agency and FBI, FISA courts seem heavily stacked in law enforcement’s favor; between 1979 and 2004, for instance, nearly 19,000 warrant requests were granted. Four - yes, four - were rejected. Because of their very nature - secret courts, favorable judges - FISA courts are perhaps uniquely prone to abuses. The process clearly lacks sufficient safeguards to protect Americans’ civil rights. In 2016, for example, FISA warrants granted on false grounds permitted surveillance against members of then-candidate Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The FISA courts permitted officials of an administration to effectively spy on the campaign of a political rival. We wrote in December about the findings of the so-called Horowitz Report, the chilling 434-page Justice Department report outlining the FISA abuses that occurred over the course of the campaign. Inspector General David Horowitz detailed the means used to obtain warrants from the secret FISA court. Opposition research funded by Democrats and filled with unsubstantiated rumors was used to commence an investigation. When the investigation turned up no evidence of wrongdoing, and significant problems with the research’s accuracy came to light, that was hidden from the court. In the wake of the report, the FISA court itself issued a rare rebuke of the FBI for its shoddy surveillance practices. Ultimately, it will be up to Congress (which established FISA in the first place) to fix this mess and put protections of Americans’ civil liberties in place. The Senate had a chance to do that recently, but punted for now. Over the weekend, authority for the FISA courts and other surveillance activities lapsed. On Monday, senators approved a 77-day extension. This bridge “until the end of May gives lawmakers breathing room to debate surveillance and privacy issues after the immediate threat of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided,” The Hill reported. When the Senate returns to this issue, it should make the continuation of the courts contingent on protecting Americans’ privacy and First Amendment rights. Among other things, the courts should not be able to grant FISA warrants to spy on U.S. citizens unless investigators can show such citizens are actually agents of a foreign power or involved in terrorism or clandestine activities that threaten the public. Protecting the public from foreign attacks is perhaps the number one job of government. But protecting our liberties is crucial too. Too many brave men and women died securing our freedoms to let them be dispensed with by secret courts.

But public health experts agree: To slow the growth of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus, people need to stay at home and limit social interaction unless it’s essential. As this crisis grows, social distancing will grow in scope and severity. California, with 40 million people and the world’s fifth-largest economy, woke up Friday to a near-total lockdown. And experts are warning that for maximum effectiveness, to protect human life and prevent the healthcare infrastructure from collapse, those lockdowns might need to last months, not weeks. For people dealing with anxiety, reassurances that everything is going to be OK can ring hollow, especially when the bad news comes in waves. For those in recovery from addiction, human interaction with counselors and fellow survivors is an important ingredient in maintaining sobriety. For those who find comfort and reassurance in faith, many congregations have ceased holding regular services. What to do? Fortunately, mental health professionals in southern Vermont are offering timely advice to help us all weather this storm. It’s very important for citizens to remain informed. But too much of that isn’t good for people dealing with anxiety. In a Washington Post article, psychologist Kathy HoganBruen advised anxious readers to “really try to limit the news consumption or just staring at your phone and your computer, because for most of us that makes mental health worse rather than better.” Indeed, mental health experts recommend that we use technology to connect with others, to safely break down the social distancing that will help us slow down this epidemic. They’re advising that we take care of our physical health, getting exercise and enough sleep, and maintain normal routines, especially for children. And they’re recommending we take advantage of the fresh air and natural beauty around us, for our physical and mental well-being. In dealing with children, experts advise being age-appropriate with information you share and consume around them. Offer reassurances about the steps you’re taking as a family to keep safe, listen to their concerns, and provide empathy. Last, and most importantly, people should contact a mental health provider if they’re feeling overwhelmed, if anxiety feels more like panic, if they’re feeling depressed, or experiencing other symptoms of increased mental health issues. We are all in this together. We might be forced to remain apart in our own homes for weeks at a time - perhaps longer than any of us know. But our collective effort will make all the difference. And together, when this challenge overwhelms us, we can help each other through. Remember this: We are in new and uncharted territory, and it’s not a sign of weakness to reach out for help. It’s the same as calling an electrician when you don’t know how to fix the wiring, or summoning a plumber when there’s a problem with the pipes.

"America’s top agriculture official offered thanks on Friday to workers up and down the food chain — acknowledging that farmers and other employees along the “food chain” can’t work remotely during the coronavirus crisis. “You know, we’re spoiled in America,” said USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue, in a video posted to Twitter. “You’ve provided such abundant, healthy, wholesome, available food. That we take you for granted.” Mr. Perdue, a former Republican governor of Georgia, offered his gratitude to a litany of workers, from grocery store employees stocking shelves to vendors selling fertilizer and farmers growing the food. “I know there’ been a lot of confusion about teleworking and all that kind of stuff,” said Mr. Perdue. “You have jobs that can’t tele-work.” The announcement comes a day after the Associated Press reported USDA officials would abide by a coronavirus relief package passed by Congress and signed by President Trump on Wednesday, preventing anyone from losing access to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Last week, a federal judge ruled USDA could not begin enforcing new food stamps rules requiring eligibility be linked to employment.

"Liberal nonprofits are spending millions of dollars on ads attacking President Trump’s and Senate Republicans’ response to the coronavirus crisis. And the new watchdog group Americans for Public Trust, led by former Nevada attorney general Adam Laxalt, is working to expose the coronavirus campaigning. Pacronym, which previously said it would spend $75 million fighting Mr. Trump this election cycle, told The Washington Post it would dedicate $5 million on digital ads weaponizing the coronavirus crisis against Mr. Trump. The progressive American Bridge has spent thousands of dollars on Facebook ads in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin attacking Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, according to Facebook’s Ad Library. The group reportedly plans to cut new ads targeting Mr. Trump’s response to the crisis. Elsewhere, Protect Our Care, a group dedicated to defending Obamacare, spent $250,000 to attack Sen. Steve Daines because of the Montana Republican’s response to coronavirus. Mr. Laxalt, counsel to Americans for Public Trust, said he believes the groups are “recklessly using this pandemic to go after the president.” He said he’s digging into where the groups are finding resources and connects it back to the liberal group Arabella Advisors, which has disclosed connections to groups such as Protect Our Care in the past. “The Arabella network is far bigger than anybody realizes,” Mr. Laxalt said. “It’s Pacronym today, but you know these groups basically just shift around and they swap ‘em out and it’s been going on for many years. “It is a very coordinated Democrat attack machine,” he said. “That’s what the network does. If there’s a hole in the Democratic apparatus to win campaigns they fill it with some sort of nonprofit or outside group.” Mr. Laxalt’s group, Americans for Public Trust, is a few months old and looks to expose ethical issues through complaints and other means to put a spotlight on issues that others are ignoring. Americans for Public Trust declined to discuss the resources it has, citing the “privacy and security of our donors,” and would not put a figure on the number of lawyers and researchers working on its staff. Mr. Laxalt emphasized that he is not opposed to outside groups’ spending, but wanted to shine a spotlight on the process to make it more transparent. “This is in some respects the tip of the iceberg,” he said.

"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A 73-year-old man in Nashville with underlying health conditions has become Tennessee’s first fatality linked to the new coronavirus, authorities said Friday.  “This is a tragic loss of life, and we extend our heartfelt condolences with the family,” Nashville Mayor John Cooper said in confirming the first virus-related death in the state.  Tennessee had more than 260 confirmed cases as of Friday as the state confronted the  global pandemic that is reshaping American life. In a sign of the times, Elvis Presley’s Graceland is temporarily closing because of the outbreak. The Memphis, Tennessee-based tourist attraction announced no the Graceland website Friday that tours of Presley’s former home-turned-museum have been called off. Graceland said it will remain closed from Saturday through April 3. The tourist attraction devoted to the late singer Presley, who died in Memphis in 1977 at age 42, draws about 500,000 people every year. In other developments Friday, Gov. Bill Lee took action to allow local officials to meet electronically rather than in person to blunt the spread of the coronavirus. Lee’s executive order requires that local governments meeting electronically make a reasonable effort to allow public access to the meeting live. If that’s not possible, they would have to make audio or video recordings available as quickly as possible and no later than two business days after meeting.  The order - backed by the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government - runs until May 18.  “We need to provide open government and at the same time provide logistics for these governments to meet in the midst of this crisis so they don’t gather together in groups that create a public health hazard,” Lee told reporters before signing the order. The Republican governor’s administration was forced to step in to help local governments meet safely amid a global pandemic after the GOP-dominated Statehouse failed to do so before temporarily recessing Thursday. Lawmakers had spent most of this week scrambling to approve a drastically scaled-back spending plan for the coming fiscal year so they could recess until June 1. While members advanced a handful of other non-budget measures deemed “mission critical,” disagreements swirled around how much tweaking the open meeting law needed to help cities and counties meet electronically. Multiple versions surfaced, but ultimately, the House and Senate couldn’t find a compromise. Lee already has issued several COVID-19 related executive orders targeting relief to small business and relaxing a wide-range of regulations in order to speed up emergency response to those affected by the virus. On Friday, Lee said his daughter was among workers who lost jobs in a restaurant that closed. But he focused on the example of her two coworkers, a married couple with four children, who lost their jobs. He said the possibility of mandating businesses to close, which he has not required statewide so far, means eliminating paychecks. But he said he is trying to strike a balance during the crisis. “I believe to the degree that we can curb behavior and change behavior and find responsible behavior taking place across our state, to the degree that we can do that without mandates, it’s better for everyone,” Lee said. Meanwhile, cities like Nashville and Memphis have limited restaurants to take-out orders, drive-thru service, curbside pickup, and delivery service. Most have ordered gyms to close. Lee has held off from enforcing any statewide mandates, but said his administration is launching an economic task force on ways to help reeling businesses and workers. He said he’s seeking guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services about possibly using Medicaid to cover coronavirus treatment for the uninsured. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For people with existing health problems and older adults, it can cause more severe illness requiring hospitalization. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In Memphis, Shelby County Health Department Director Alisa Haushalter said Friday that there are 30 confirmed cases, up from 10 the day before. Cases have been spread by travelers, and in social groups and in the workplace, she said. The Mid-South Food Bank said late Friday that it plans to increase its mobile distribution pantries in response to the school district’s decision. The pantries provide frozen meat, bakery items and fresh produce, food bank president Cathy Pope said. ___ Correspondent Adrian Sainz contributed to this report from Memphis. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - Under fire from business groups and Republican lawmakers and facing lawsuits over a broad shutdown order designed to slow the spreading of the coronavirus, Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration defended its actions as critical to preventing hospitals from being overwhelmed, but it also made a series of concessions. Wolf defended the order - issued late Thursday to sharpen an earlier directive - by citing big, daily upticks in the number of coronavirus cases and declaring, “I cannot allow these surging numbers to overwhelm our people, our health care workers and our hospitals.”  Forcing tens of thousands of businesses to shutter their doors indefinitely will mean that fewer Pennsylvanians will become sick and fewer will die, he said. Even before Thursday’s order, skyrocketing unemployment compensation filings in Pennsylvania this week smashed the state record, underscoring how many businesses had already closed or shed workers. Wolf, a Democrat, said his “heart goes out to everybody in our commonwealth,” but he also said difficult decisions now will make it easier later. “These are uncharted waters and, in this situation, we’re not going to do everything perfectly, but we’re going to do the best we can to prevent our hospital system from crashing,” Wolf said in a news conference. On Thursday evening, Wolf directed all “non-life-sustaining” businesses to close their physical locations, and said state government would enforce the edict.  It was among the toughest actions by a U.S. governor to combat the spread of COVID-19, coming after he has discouraged people from leaving home, if they can avoid it, and ordered schools shut through March, at least. But it drew loud complaints that it threatened critical supply chains and economic devastation, and a law firm and a gun store challenged it in court. By Friday evening, Wolf’s administration issued new guidance that granted exceptions to the timber industry, coal mining, hotels, accountants, laundromats and law firms permitted by the courts. It also delayed enforcement from Saturday to Monday. Wolf also said there’s a “robust waiver process” for businesses that believe they should be exempt from the shutdown order. Still, it remained unclear Friday whether cities, counties or towns would go along with the order and use police or sanctions to close businesses that defied Wolf’s order.  ___ CASES AND HOSPITALS The Health Department reported a sharp rise in the number of confirmed cases on Friday, adding 83 in the past day for a total of more than 260 in 26 counties. There has been one death from COVID-19 in the state. Health Secretary Rachel Levine said cases will continue to surge. The Wolf administration is working to determine hospitals’ capability to handle it and exploring options to add bed space, staffing and supplies, she said. One possibility is creating beds in hotels for patients with less serious ailments, while Wolf’s administration told hospitals to postpone elective procedures.  Still, western Pennsylvania’s biggest hospital system, UPMC, on Friday said that it would not put off elective surgeries. Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, said he did not see “widespread community transmission yet.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover.  ___ JOBLESS CLAIMS Pennsylvania’s jobless claims filed this week set a state record, the state Department of Labor and Industry said.  A review of weekly data going back to 1987 shows a high point of 61,000 in early 2010, when the effects of the Great Recession were taking hold.  The department fielded more than 170,000 claims filed Monday through Wednesday, including 70,000 on Tuesday alone.  The agency is not releasing figures for Thursday and Friday, saying the federal government has embargoed this week’s figures until next Thursday. ___ LAWSUITS A Harrisburg-area law firm is challenging the governor’s power to shutter law offices throughout Pennsylvania. By ordering law firms to close, Wolf deprived citizens of their right to counsel, lawyer William Costopoulos argued in court papers. Costopoulos’ petition noted that the high court, in ordering the closure of state courts this week, created exceptions for emergency petitions involving custody, protection from abuse and other matters. In an interview, Costopoulos said the executive branch doesn’t have a right to meddle in the judicial branch. “The governor, though his intentions are well meaning in light of this pandemic, does not have the authority to usurp either the Supreme Court or the Constitution when it comes to the practice of law,” Costopoulos said. In the second suit, a law firm, a gun shop and a would-be gun buyer asked the state Supreme Court to stop Wolf from shuttering businesses determined to be not “life-sustaining,” arguing he lacks that authority under state law. The suit said the state’s gun shops “have been left with insufficient guidance as to their potential status as ‘life sustaining.’” It also challenges Wolf’s order on Second Amendment and other constitutional grounds, saying the right to bear arms “is the epitome of life-sustaining.” ____ ENFORCEMENT Wolf’s order Thursday night said more than 150 types of businesses had to close their physical locations. By Friday, that shrank to about 140. Friday’s guidance also gave more detail about enforcement. Closures are enforceable through criminal penalties, including under health, safety and liquor laws, Wolf’s administration said. Discipline would be progressive, beginning with a warning, and focused on businesses where people congregate.  ___ OPEN AND CLOSED Among those allowed to stay open are gas stations, grocery stores, beer distributors, drugstores, funeral homes and building materials stores. It also clarified that emergency building, highway, utility and bridge repairs are still permitted. Restaurants and bars can continue to offer carry-out, delivery and drive-thru food and drink service, but not dine-in service. Businesses under shutdown orders range from vending machine operators to building contractors to many types of manufacturers, along with professional offices, such architects and engineers.  Retailers ordered to close include car dealers, bookstores, clothing stores, furniture stores, florists, office supply stores and lawn and garden stores. One category went from open to closed: civic and social organizations. __ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"CAIRO (AP) - Authorities released a prominent political activist Friday amid calls for Egypt to let thousands of others go free to prevent the new coronavirus from spreading among the prison population. According to human rights groups, there are tens of thousands jailed in Egypt for their political views.  The wife of Shady el-Ghazaly Harb, a doctor who was at the forefront of Egypt’s 2011 pro-democracy protest movement, wrote on her Facebook page that her husband was out after spending nearly two years in detention over charges of insulting Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi. Fatma Hisham Murad posted a picture of them hugging upon his release.  It was not immediately clear if Harb’s release was a response to a campaign calling for political prisoners’ release amid the pandemic.  On Thursday, state prosecutors ordered the release of Harb along with 14 other prominent critics of Egypt’s government, according to Nasser Amin, a member of the government-appointed National Council for Human Rights. The remaining detainees are expected to be released soon after completing all necessary paperwork, Amin told The Associated Press.  “The government has heeded the demands of the human rights movement but it is still not enough,” said Amin. a human rights lawyer. “This step should be followed immediately and quickly by the release of all other people held in pre-trial detention.”  According to rights groups, thousands are held in Egypt’s jails awaiting trials. Over 3,000 people were arrested in September alone in the most recent crackdown on dissent that followed a rare few protests demanding el-Sissi to step down.  Also on Friday, Egypt’s health ministry announced that the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases has reached 285 including eight deaths. The number of recovered patients that were discharged from the quarantine has reached 39, added the statement posted on an official government Facebook page.  The mother of a prominent Egyptian activist was released from detention after her arrest the previous day for staging a protest demanding that prisoners be released amid the coronavirus pandemic, her daughter said. Laila Soueif, the mother of imprisoned 38-year-old activist Alaa Abdel Fattah, was released late Thursday after being arrested a day earlier along with her daughter, sister and another female activist. The women had rallied outside the headquarters of Egypt’s Cabinet in downtown Cairo raising banners reading: “Release prisoners.”  The four women were charged with violating the country’s strict ban on protests with their small gathering and of spreading false news about Egypt’s over-crowded correctional facilities.  The prosecutor ordered the release of the four detainees late Wednesday on bail. However, Soueif remained in custody and was taken to the State Security Prosecutors’ office for further questioning before she, too, was released, her youngest daughter, Sanaa Seif, wrote on her Facebook page. Seif did not participate in the protest.  A government press officer did not return phone calls seeking comment. Abdel Fattah’s family have all been vocal rights activists in Egypt. Abdel Fattah, a 38-year-old software engineer, grew into a figurehead of the pro-democracy protest movement on social media during the 2011 uprising that removed longtime President Hosni Mubarak. Abdel Fattah served a five-year prison sentence for violating Egypt’s protest ban. In September, not long after his release, he was arrested again amid a widespread crackdown that followed minor protests demanding current President el-Sissi step down, although he did not participate in them.  Human rights advocates around the globe are echoing demands to reduce incarceration, arguing that prisons can be breeding grounds for the spread of the virus, which leads to the disease COVID-19. Several Middle Eastern countries that were hit by the novel virus have already started releasing prisoners, including Iran and Bahrain.

"Less than three months ago came the first reports of cases of pneumonia related to a virus first detected in Wuhan, China. The outbreak of the virus that causes COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruptions that have brought an unparalleled shock to the global economy.  Following are developments Friday related to the outbreak, efforts by governments to stabilize their economies, companies that must navigate through an altered landscape, and the millions of people affected.  ___ GROUNDED: The lowest number of passengers ever recorded at U.S. airports is being reported by the Transportation Security Administration. Nearly 624,000 people passed through its outbound checkpoints on Thursday, the TSA said. That compares with 2.4 million on the same day a year earlier. It’s the lowest number of outbound passengers ever recorded by an agency created in November 2001 in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The CEO and labor leaders at American Airlines wrote to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and congressional leaders Friday imploring them to quickly approve aid for airlines or else workers will lose their jobs. The company says it will accept “appropriate conditions” on government aid.  Frankfurt airport operator Fraport AG has put 18,000 of its 22,000 employees on shortened schedules, saying that “traffic has come almost to a halt.”  An air traffic control supervisor in Indianapolis tested positive, the Federal Aviation Administration reported. It’s the third FAA facility affected by COVID-19. Earlier this week, airport towers in Chicago and Las Vegas closed temporarily, leading to hundreds of canceled and delayed flights.  American Airlines is initiating cargo-only flights between the US and Europe. FedEx and UPS were expecting to absorb a greater share of cargo typically carried by commercial airlines, which have severely cut capacity. Air Canada is laying off more than 5,000 flight attendants, about 60% of that staff, according to a union official, as the country’s largest airline grounds its planes. Ethiopian Airlines, Africa’s largest carrier, canceled flights to 30 countries on Friday and CEO Tewolde Gebremariam said it has lost $190 million due to disruptions related to the coronavirus.  HELP NEEDED: With outbreak-related layoffs expected to surge, at least two major retailers are hiring in a big way. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, said late Thursday that it plans to hire 150,000 U.S. hourly workers for its stores and distribution centers through the end of May as online orders surge with households stocking up. The jobs are temporary, but many will become permanent, said spokesman Dan Bartlett. He said that the company is reaching out to industry groups in the restaurant and hospitality industry, both of which are getting slammed by lockdowns and travel bans. Amazon this week said it would hire 100,000 people across the U.S. to keep up with a crush of orders hires.  Target Corp. said Friday it will give a $2 an hour wage increase to its 300,000-plus workers who have been scrambling to help customers. The pay bump will be effective at least through May 2. It’s also begun offering workers who are pregnant, 65 years old or older, or who have underlying health risks, access to paid leave for up to 30 days. Target joins Amazon and Walmart which are offering extra incentives like cash bonuses or a temporary wage bump as they try to manage the crush of customers while simultaneously looking to keep their workers happy. Starbucks said it will pay its workers for the next 30 days, whether they come to work or stay home. The coffee chain also said it is temporarily closing access to its stores across the U.S., and reducing services to drive thru and delivery only.  NOT HIRING: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government has received 500,000 applications for employment insurance compared to just 27,000 for the same week last year. Trudeau says they are receiving a historic number of calls from concerned Canadians amid the pandemic. This week, the U.S. reported the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits surged by 70,000 to the highest level in more than two years. CLOSE TO HOME: The chairman and CEO of Marlboro-maker Altria Group has contracted COVID-19. The company said in a regulatory filing that Howard Willard is on medical leave. Chief Financial Officer William Gifford, Jr. will lead the company in Willard’s absence. The company is also suspending operations at its plant in Richmond, Virginia, for two weeks after two employees contracted the COVID-19 virus. Some domestic operations at its John Middleton Co. subsidiary will also be suspended due to supply chain issues. The tobacco giant said employees will continue to receive regular pay during the two-week shutdown. NBC News reported Friday that an employee who worked at the company’s 30 Rockefeller Plaza headquarters in New York has died from COVID-19. According to his wife, Larry Edgeworth had other health issues before contracting the coronavirus. Edgeworth died Thursday. FIREWALL: Companies across almost every sector are raising cash to ride out the outbreak.  Kohl’s has fully drawn its $1 billion unsecured credit facility. The department store chain, based in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is slashing inventory and expenses. Kohl’s Corp. has closed its 1,100 stores for at least the rest of the month. It and many other major chains are temporarily closing stores to curb the spread of the coronavirus.  AT&T; canceled a $4 billion accelerated stock buyback program scheduled for the second quarter.  FUTURE UNKNOWN: Coca-Cola Co. no longer expects to reach previously set financial goals for the year. Coke said in a regulatory filing that restaurant closures, suspended NHL, NBA and MLB seasons, reduced travel, social distancing, and more people working from home is straining operations.  Kohl’s withdrew its full-year and first-quarter forecasts. Several other chains like Nordstrom and Abercrombie & Fitch have also withdrawn their guidance given so much uncertainty. FACTORIES GO DARK: Thousands of businesses have ordered employees to work remotely. It’s obviously not an option for a number of sectors and the impact on heavy industry has been immense. All major U.S. automakers, including Tesla, have shut down their factories.  Mercedes-Benz and BMW are the latest automakers to announce that they’re pausing production due to the coronavirus threat, bringing almost the entire U.S. auto industry to a halt. Mercedes said Friday its auto plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and a van factory in Charleston, South Carolina, will start to wind down production Monday, likely for two weeks. BMW also said Friday that it will shut down its huge manufacturing complex near Spartanburg, South Carolina, starting April 3. The closure will run through April 19. Earlier this week Honda, General Motors, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan, Subaru, Volkswagen, Hyundai-Kia and Tesla said they would suspend production.  Jaguar Land Rover is suspending production at its U.K. plants but its manufacturing plants in Brazil and India continue operating. The company’s joint venture plant in China reopened around a month ago. Other firms including BMW, Honda and Toyota have already halted production in the U.K. Volvo Cars said Friday that its Swedish and U.S. plants will close on Thursday and will remain closed until mid-April. Office employees are being ordered to work remotely with reduced hours. The company said it reopened four manufacturing plants in China earlier this month after an extended closure.  STREAMING LOGJAM: YouTube is reducing its streaming quality in Europe as more users self-isolate at home. The company, owned by Google, said Friday it would “temporarily default all traffic in the U.K. and the EU to Standard Definition,” instead of high definition. The measure will be in place for 30 days and users will still be able to manually adjust their video quality. YouTube follows Netflix, which said Thursday that it expects the video bit rate reduction to cut its European traffic by a quarter. The companies are responding to a call by the European Union’s internal market commission, which urged streaming services and network operators to help prevent network congestion as more people use their home internet connection to work or learn remotely or for entertainment. iHOARDING: Apple is allowing people to buy only two iPhones online. It appears to be attempting to prevent the large purchase and resale of its technology at higher prices. Apple is facing a potential demand decline and supply chain issues due to the virus pandemic spreading across the globe. It closed all retail stores outside of China to help fight the spread. Apple did not return a request for comment Friday. Apple announced  a new iPad Pro and MacBook Air on Wednesday. It made no mention of new iPhones during the announcement.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders’ presidential campaign raised more than $2 million in 48 hours for efforts to combat the coronavirus outbreak, Mr. Sanders’ team said on Saturday. Robin Curran, the campaign’s digital fundraising director, said there have been more than 50,000 donations. The campaign had sent texts and emails to raise funds for Meals on Wheels, No Kid Hungry, Restaurant Workers’ Community Foundation COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund, One Fair Wage Emergency Fund, and the National Domestic Workers Alliance. Mr. Sanders is facing a daunting deficit to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary contest — a race that has now ground to a halt due to the expanding COVID-19 outbreak. Mr. Biden held a virtual fundraiser on Friday evening with New Jersey donors through a Zoom video conference, after several recent fundraising events had been put off because of the coronavirus. “My thoughts are with the families who have been suffering, for anyone who has been ill, and or God forbid, anyone who has passed,” he said, according to a pool report of the event. “There’s an awful lot of people who are just scared to death, separated from their loved ones.” Mr. Biden also thanked the audience for allowing him to “stay in the game” and said President Trump’s team hopes he won’t have the money to respond to attacks. “I feel good about what we’ve done so far, people are rallying to the cause,” Mr. Biden said. “We’ve raised a fair amount of money and I think we’re going to be able to be competitive, in no small part because of your help, although a lot of online money is being raised as well.” After a recent string of victories, Mr. Biden now has 1,201 delegates to the Democratic National Convention compared to Mr. Sanders’ 896, according to the latest tally from the Associated Press. The former vice president needs to win about 46% of the remaining delegates to hit the magic number of 1,991 delegates, which is needed to clinch the party’s nomination on the first ballot. Mr. Sanders needs to win about 64% — a task made more difficult by Democrats’ proportionality rules for delegate distributions. A number of states are also postponing their nominating contests now due to concerns over COVID-19.

"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama’s bicentennial is over, but a new book will highlight 200 years of African American history in the state.  A coffee table book titled “The Future Emerges from the Past: Celebrating 200 Years of Alabama African American History and Culture” is being published by the Alabama Bicentennial Commission, which announced the book in a statement Friday. The book will look at the period of slavery through the Civil War and into the modern civil rights movement. It highlight topics including the recent discovery near Mobile of the Clotilda, the last ship to bring African captives to the United States for enslavement.  “This is a culmination of Alabama history from the perspective of those who seldom had an opportunity to tell their stories,” said Nettie Carson-Mullins, state educator who contributed to the book. The book costs $19.95, and the commission said proceeds will go to the United Negro College Fund Birmingham. The state officially ended its 200th birthday celebration with an event in December.

"A fundraising email from Rep. Ilhan Omar criticized her Republican counterparts for allegedly using the coronavirus outbreak for their personal gain. Mrs. Omar’s fundraising pitch distributed to supporters came with the subject line, “Imagine profiting of [sic] a global tragedy like this,” and the body of the email directed the Minnesota Democrat’s fans to “Donate once” or “Donate monthly” to her campaign. The emailed fundraising pitch takes aim at GOP Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia. Mr. Burr and Ms. Loeffler sold stocks before the coronavirus outbreak landed its largest blows against the American economy, and Ms. Loeffler separately purchased stock in a teleconferencing company. Both senators have asserted they did nothing wrong. Mrs. Omar’s email called for the two Republican senators’ resignation and said, “Members of Congress are supposed to be public servants — not profiteers.” “For too long, privileged politicians have abused their power at the expense of working people,” read Mrs. Omar’s fundraising email. “That ends now. We must demand accountability from our leaders — and that starts with rooting out corruption at every turn.” Mrs. Omar’s fundraising pitch also directs supporters to sign a petition against the Republican senators and assures her supporters that their activism is making a difference. The congresswoman’s full fundraising pitch has been preserved in the Defending Democracy Together Institute’s archive of political emails.

"President Trump on Saturday pushed back against a new report in the Washington Post that said U.S. intelligence agencies were warning in January and February about the global danger posed by the coronavirus. “It’s a very inaccurate story,” Mr. Trump said at a White House briefing on COVID-19. “From many people, I get a lot of credit for having closed our country very early to a very heavily infected country — China. Unfortunately, China.” “I wish China would have told us more about what was going on in China long prior to us reading about it,” he said. He said it’s terrible that China kicked the Washington Post and other outlets out of the country recently. “But I also think it’s terrible when people write inaccurately about you, and they write inaccurately about me every single day, every single hour,” he said. https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-intelligence-reports-from-january-and-february-warned-about-a-likely-pandemic/2020/03/20/299d8cda-6ad5-11ea-b5f1-a5a804158597_story.html  ",Trump pushes back on Washington Post report about intel warnings about coronavirus,"Saturday, March 21, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/21/trump-pushes-back-washington-post-report-about-int/,washington_times
"Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday said he and Second Lady Karen Pence will be tested for the coronavirus after a staffer in Mr. Pence’s office tested positive. Mr. Pence said the White House doctor has indicated there’s no reason to believe Mr. Pence was exposed and that there was no need to be tested. “Given the unique position that I have as vice president and as the leader of the White House coronavirus task force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon,” Mr. Pence said. Mr. Pence said the staffer is doing “well” and had “mild, cold-like systems” for about a day and a half. “Neither the president nor I had contact with that staff person,” he said.

Mr. Pence and other members of the administration were speaking at the White House to give an update on the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. He said testing is “expanding rapidly” across the U.S. but that people who aren’t displaying symptoms need to help preserve resources for Americans in need. “If you don’t have symptoms, don’t do a test,” he said.

"An NBC news division medical report promoted the possible benefits of an anti-malarial drug in subduing the coronavirus the day before its White House reporter questioned President Trump for talking up the same medicine. NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander at Friday’s White House briefing asked if Mr. Trump was up stirring up “a false sense of hope” by endorsing chloroquine. It’s a decades-old anti-malaria drug that lab tests show could defeat the virus first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in December. “Is it possible ….that your impulse to put a positive spin on things may be giving Americans a false sense of hope  and misrepresenting the preparedness right now?” Mr. Alexander said. Mr. Trump, who has ordered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate chloroquine, said he was an optimist on chloroquine as are Tesla automaker Elon Musk and some physicians. Cable business channel CNBC, which like NBC News is a unit of NBC Universal’s news division, published a story on Thursday  headlined,  “Here’s why Trump and Elon Musk see potential in a drug called chloroquine to treat coronavirus.” A sub-headline stated, “The early data is promising, scientists and biotech experts say. But there are still many unknown.” The story quotes Dr. Kristian Olson, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and an internal medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. “It has been found in mice to be effective to treat a variety of viruses,” Dr.  Olson says. “It also appears it’s active in vitro (via test tube experiments) against COVID-19.” The story continued, “Some of the early data is promising.  A group of researchers in France are testing a less toxic derivative of the chloroquine drug called hydroxychloroquine on a few dozen patients with COVID-19, and early reports of the trial indicate that the drug might help shorten the amount of time that people with the disease are infectious.” As far back as 2005, the National Institutes of Health’s  National Center for Biotechnology Information published a laboratory study that said chloroquine could be a “potent” remedy for SARS. The disease, like the current pandemic COVID-19, is another coronavirus disease and was first noted in 2002 in China. “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread,” said the study by six American and Canadian researchers at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the Laboratory of Biochemical Neuroendocrinology in Montreal. “Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV),” the article states. “No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. We report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.” Like the current COVID-19, SARS also came from a wild animal market in China, with the source believed to be bats who either infected another animal or humans. The Wuhan Virus is believed to be bat-carried, first noticed in December. China health officials in January said the first five infected people worked or shopped at the Wuhan wild animal market subsequently closed on Jan. 1. NBC’s Mr. Alexander asked a followup question of Mr. Trump, citing the U.S. infection cases and deaths and asking him to address Americans who might be “scared.” Mr. Trump bristled at the question.  Liberal pundits blamed Mr. Trump for the disease’s spread. A New York Times columnist urged the country to name the virus after Mr. Trump. An MSNBC analyst said the president should be brought up on criminal charges. Mr. Trump, who constantly battles the “fake news” liberal media,  responded to Mr. Alexander, “I say you’re a terrible reporter.”  ",NBC article touted 'promising' drug as its reporter bashed Trump for 'false sense of hope',"Saturday, March 21, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/21/nbc-article-touted-promising-drug-its-reporter-bas/,washington_times
"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - Pennsylvania’s coronavirus death toll rose by one on Saturday as lawyers for Gov. Tom Wolf asked a court to dismiss lawsuits challenging his authority to shutter “non-life-sustaining” businesses, declaring that unprecedented action is needed to combat a global pandemic they called “perhaps the biggest catastrophe of our lifetimes.” The Allegheny County Health Department confirmed the death Saturday but did not release details, other than to say the victim was an adult who had been hospitalized. More than 370 coronavirus cases and two deaths have been reported in Pennsylvania. In a legal filing late Friday, the state attorney general’s office said Wolf is empowered by the state’s Emergency Management Services Code to shutter businesses and restrict people’s movements in a disaster. “COVID-19 presents an extraordinary challenge that requires extraordinary measures to combat. The governor was empowered by law to combat precisely this challenge,” the filing said. The state Supreme Court did not immediately rule on lawsuits challenging aspects of Wolf’s authority to shut down gun shops and law firms.  Wolf has justified his edict that tens of thousands of businesses shutter their doors indefinitely by citing big, daily upticks in the number of coronavirus cases that health officials say threaten to overwhelm hospitals and spike the death toll.  Under pressure from Republicans and business groups, Wolf agreed to delay enforcement of the shutdown order until Monday. His administration also agreed to exempt additional businesses from the shutdown, including the timber industry, coal mines, hotels, accountants and laundromats. A Harrisburg-area law firm challenged the governor’s power to shutter law offices, declaring Wolf had no right to meddle in the judicial branch. In a second suit, also filed Friday, a gun shop said Wolf’s edict violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms and other constitutional rights. Wolf’s lawyers said that nothing in his order prevents an attorney from practicing law or a citizen from owning a gun. “Petitioners’ argument that the global COVID-19 pandemic is somehow not a disaster demonstrates a dangerous level of myopathy about the effect this pandemic could have on the citizens of the commonwealth and our health care system if the spread of this disease is not arrested,” the attorney general’s office wrote. Wolf’s administration has steadfastly refused to confirm to The Associated Press whether gun shops are covered by his shutdown order. Its legal filing said the governor’s office used industry codes generated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to construct its list of businesses covered by the shutdown order. “Any business would already know which sector it occupies and its corresponding NAICS code,” the filing said. On Saturday, Joshua Prince, a lawyer challenging the governor’s edict, called the legal filing “merely another smoke and mirrors response by the commonwealth, as it is acutely aware that there is no NAICS code relative to the sale, manufacture or transfer of firearms and ammunition.” He said the coding issue arises frequently for federal firearms licensees when they attempt to procure financing, “as there is no applicable code.” Wolf’s legal team also said that voluntary requests for Pennsylvanians to stay away from one another and for businesses to close their doors and have employees work from home proved ineffective at slowing the spread of the disease, requiring more drastic action. “Pennsylvanians refused to voluntarily engage in ‘social distancing’ to prevent the spread of COVID-19, leaving Governor Wolf with no option other than to close nonessential businesses to ‘lessen the curve’ of the disease,” the filing said. — CASES Allegheny County health officials on Saturday confirmed the death of a person. The county health department said in a statement that it was an adult who had been hospitalized. No details were provided. That brings to two the deaths reported in the state. Health officials said Saturday that more than 100 new cases had been reported, for a total of more than 370, with about 40 people requiring hospitalization. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. — TRANSIT LOSSES The Philadelphia-area transit system says it is projecting a budget deficit of at least $150 million and is considering further service reductions following “massive, sudden ridership losses” amid the coronavirus outbreak. General manager Leslie Richards of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority said other measures aimed at stemming the losses also include a hiring freeze, elimination of overtime and a 10% pay cut for top executives.  SEPTA said it estimates a budget deficit of at least $150 million by the end of the current fiscal year on June 30 due to revenue losses. The authority said it had a $7.3 million budget surplus as recently as the end of February. The authority said it was working closely with state and local officials and staying in touch with members of Congress on “a possible federal relief package for public transportation.” A letter sent to employees said further service reductions on Regional Rail and Transit were being considered. ___ Rubinkam reported from northeastern Pennsylvania.

"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) - First, Oklahoma lawmakers excluded the public from the Capitol because of coronavirus concerns.  Then with the public gone, lawmakers made an emergency change to the state’s open-meetings law to let all governmental entities meet via video or teleconference, so long as people can watch or listen remotely. Across the U.S., numerous governors, lawmakers, mayors and county officials have made similar decisions to keep the public away from public meetings - all for the sake of public health. Ironically, the sudden policy shift has played out during the annual observation of “Sunshine Week,” a seven-day period intended to highlight the importance of open-government policies. “Public participation in our democracy is really fundamental to the health of our democracy,” said David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, a California-based nonprofit that promotes government transparency. “I think government agencies need to be very careful not to unduly restrict the public’s ability to see what government is doing and, maybe more importantly, to participate in what the government’s doing,” he said. On Friday, 132 state and national groups backing open-government policies released a joint statement urging officials at all levels of government to “not retrench” from their duties for public involvement because of the coronavirus. “Government bodies should not opportunistically take advantage of the public’s inability to attend large gatherings to make critical decisions affecting the public’s interest if those decisions can reasonably be postponed,” the statement said. All U.S. states require open government meetings. Some mandate that a majority of government officials be physically present to meet. Others already allow officials to meet by video or phone, with accommodations for the public to watch or listen from a designated room.  Those mandates for in-person access have been suspended or ignored as an increasing number of governments have instructed people to stay home and avoid public gatherings to help prevent the spread of the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease. The move toward seclusion has posed some practical and technological challenges. When the Oklahoma Senate passed a bill this week authorizing public bodies to hold teleconference or video meetings through March 1, 2021, open-government advocates couldn’t enter the closed Capitol to voice their concerns about the duration of the emergency rules. Andy Moore, executive director of Freedom of Information Oklahoma, had been watching a live stream of the legislative debate on his computer. He posted his objections on social media. A House member then got in touch with him via text, and the House passed a new version that shortened the remote meeting policy until Nov. 15. It worked out OK, Moore said, but “anything that kind of clamps down on the flow of information makes it more difficult for the public to stay involved.” Legislators in Maine and Tennessee also excluded the public from their buildings. South Carolina lawmakers asked lobbyists and visitors to stay away.  The Pennsylvania House and Senate each voted to change their rules this past week to allow members to participate and vote remotely. And New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, signed a bill Thursday letting the Legislature meet remotely using technology. Some open-government advocates worry that it may become harder for the remote-viewing public to interact with elected officials or fully understand what’s going on.  “Video conference meetings are great, but there’s really no substitute for physical presence,” Snyder said.  In Rhode Island, technical glitches frustrated some people trying to watch the first significant state meeting to be live-streamed after Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo loosened the state’s public meetings law. Those following the Board of Elections via the agency’s Facebook page complained that the feed froze. The Rhode Island chapters of Common Cause and the American Civil Liberties Union said Friday that governmental bodies meeting virtually should be required to pause their proceedings if the video or audio stream is interrupted. They also said all documents discussed should be shared online in advance of the meeting. In Waterville, Maine, the city solicitor warned Thursday that a new panel formed to address the coronavirus had been illegally meeting in secret and making decisions, including to suspend the city’s plastic bag ban. Sigmund Schutz, a lawyer for MaineToday Media, told the state attorney general’s office that urgent guidance is needed for compliance with the Freedom of Access Act. Restrictions on public meetings have been implemented without resistance in some states. But Republicans in Michigan objected to actions by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Her order temporarily allows public bodies to conduct their meetings electronically, by phone or video conference, as long as they allow public access and participation. “Older Michiganders are most at risk during these times. They are also the least likely to have the technology necessary to access public meetings electronically,” Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey said. “In a time of crisis, citizens should have more access to their elected officials, not less.”  Critics said Shirkey’s comments were hypocritical. Michigan is one of two states that wholly exempt both legislators and the governor’s office from disclosing communications and other information to the public. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, published a legal opinion saying public meetings could be conducted remotely as long as there was plenty of notice and a means for the public to observe. He suggested that public bodies provide technical support for people who have difficulty dialing in to a phone conference or watching a video conference. “Transparency is the core of legality,” Brnovich wrote. “Throughout any circumstance, the government must remain accountable to the people.” Daniel Bevarly, executive director of the National Freedom of Information Coalition, said he understands the need to restrict access to meetings during the coronavirus pandemic. If governmental bodies continue to live-stream their meetings even after re-opening their doors, the current crisis ultimately could lead to long-term benefits, he said. “This is an opportunity for us to re-examine this whole public engagement in a digital world,” Bevarly said.  ___ Associated Press writers Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey; Jonathan J.

"BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) - Newly released documents show a coastal Georgia resort violated labor laws more than 500 times and collectively underpaid employees by more than $1 million.                 The Brunswick News obtained the documents relating to violations at the Sea Island Resort earlier this month through a Freedom of Information Act request of the U.S. Labor Department. The investigation into the resort lasted for more than two years. It found 240 violations of record keeping for workers younger than 18, 167 instances of failure to pay overtime, 98 violations of failure to pay minimum wage and one occurrence of failure to keep accurate records. There was $45,849.20 in unpaid overtime and $1,073.25 in unpaid minimum wages. Documents show Sea Island told investigators in October 2017 that the company wasn’t aware that it needed to have documents proving how old its workers were on hand. Sea Island told the department in March 2018 that its own review showed it owed employees $60,000 for unpaid overtime. According to the Labor Department the enforceable total was $46,922.45, which Sea Island agreed to pay by April 20, 2018. Sea Island declined to add to a 2018 statement by CEO Scott Steilen. At the time, he said, “While I am convinced that this was an isolated incident, we are now conducting more frequent, random audits and providing additional training on existing policies to avoid any future occurrences.”  ",Documents: Georgia resort underpaid workers more than $1M,"Saturday, March 21, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/21/documents-georgia-resort-underpaid-workers-more-th/,washington_times
"Rep. French Hill bucked charges that the more than $1 trillion coronavirus economic rescue package teed up for Senate passage next week is a bailout or stimulus bill and a retreat from his Republican Party’s fiscal conservatism. “This is not an economic stimulus bill, this is an economic preservation bill,” he told The Washington Times. “We’re not attempting to stimulate the economy. We’re attempting to save the economy from a black swan, external shock.” Mr. Hill, an Arkansas Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, said policies such as loan guarantees and helping businesses access capital are in line with conservative economic philosophy, particularly when financial hardships arise from a public health crisis rather than irresponsible business practices. Mr. Hill called the onslaught of spending in the Republican-controlled Senate’s legislation “a reasonable response from Congress.” “You’re in a global public health pandemic. It hasn’t been faced in the developed world certainly in my lifetime,” he said. “This is not an opportunity to create more government permanent spending.” The Republicans’ four-part plan would extend loans to small businesses, send checks to the American public, provide major support to hard-hit industries and deliver more taxpayer funds to the overly strained healthcare system. Under the proposal, the government would provide about $1,200 to Americans making up to $75,000 a year. The handouts would then be scaled down for those earning between $75,000 and $99,000 and would provide $500 per child. A $230 billion loan plan would help eligible small businesses make payroll and cover other operating expenses to keep the companies and their employees afloat. Another $208 billion in loans would go to industries hardest hit by the crisis: $50 billion for airlines, $8 billion for cargo air carriers and $150 billion for other eligible entities. In all, the phase-three bill is expected to cost more than $1 trillion. That’s on top of the billions spent in the first two packages. The first preparedness and response bill was signed into law by President Trump on March 6 and cost $8.3 billion. The second package that targeted relief at workers was signed by the president Wednesday and cost more than $100 billion. Mr. Hill said he was open to “creative” solutions such as the cash handouts, but he would prefer Congress focus on supporting small businesses, especially through local banks and other financial institutions. That way, he argued, there’s less need to funnel money into unemployment benefits and ensure workers keep their jobs. “So I think the most important thing we can do is get money in the hands of the job creators and in the hands of employers so they can keep more people working and they don’t have to be laid off, but we’re behind the curve on that,” he said. Mr. Hill said Republican lawmakers in the House are looking at lowering interest rates for small business loans, eligible refinancing, and express loans for small businesses. Mr. Hill is also concerned that small businesses will face overwhelming issues with troubled debt restructuring as they try to move around their limited funds, so he’s calling for regulatory direction to mitigate that in the stimulus package. Working in the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush, Mr. Hill saw first hand how that type of regulatory approach had a “cascading negative effect” during the 1991 recession. But to pass any new package, lawmakers are faced with balancing the health risks posed by the very virus they need to legislate against. As of this week, two lawmakers — Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida and Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams of Utah — announced they had tested positive for the coronavirus. Both were at the House’s vote last Saturday. Staffers in Senate and House offices have revealed they tested positive for the disease and dozens of lawmakers have closed their offices and told staff to work from home. In both chambers, rank-and-file members are pushing leadership to find ways for them to vote remotely, though Democratic and Republican leadership are reluctant to make such dramatic rule changes. Congress’ rules forbid remote voting under any circumstances and it has never occurred in the more than 230-year history of the institution. Mr. Hill, for one, isn’t concerned about in-person voting conflicting with social distancing guidelines. He said new voting procedures allow for members to trickle into the chamber rather than gathering all at once. “I think people know how to take good care of themselves from a hygiene point of view and the travel back and forth,” he said. “If they have good basic health and don’t have any health conditions personally that would compromise that I think we can conduct our constitutional duties and do it in a safe way.”  ","Coronavirus recovery bill doesn’t violate conservative principles, says Arkansas GOP congressman","Saturday, March 21, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-recovery-bill-doesnt-violate-conservat/,washington_times
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said late Saturday that lawmakers are close to striking a final deal on a coronavirus stimulus package, and he said they’re plowing ahead with plans for a first test vote Sunday afternoon. The Kentucky Republican said committee chairs were putting the details in legislative language and he hoped senators would have something in hand later Saturday, to prepare for the 3 p.m. vote. “The past two days of intense bipartisan talks are very close to a resolution. I believe we are poised to deliver the significant relief that Americans need with the speed that this crisis demands,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement. Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer’s spokesman said there isn’t a final agreement, and Democrats haven’t even seen “large parts” of the GOP bill. “Democrats very much want to reach a bipartisan agreement to address this major health and economic crisis,” said Justin Goodman, the spokesman. “We look forward to reviewing their first draft and negotiating a bipartisan compromise.” If a deal is struck, it would be the third coronavirus bill to clear Congress. An initial $8.3 billion infusion of cash was followed last week by a bill to grant sick leave protections to those forced out of work by COVID-19. This third measure is supposed to try to lessen the virus’s blow to the economy — at a cost of perhaps $2 trillion, which would be by far the largest immediate price tag for any single piece of legislation in history. “We could get there,” Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer told CNN Saturday evening. “We may not get that high. It’s going to be certainly amply more than $1 trillion, $1.4 trillion.” All sides on Capitol Hill agree on the need for the government to pump cash into Americans’ hands. The disagreements are over how much, and how best to deliver the money. Sunday’s vote is to head off the chance of an initial filibuster. Senate leaders say they want to have a final vote to pass the bill on Monday. It would then need House approval. Mr. Schumer said he’s been in touch with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to keep her in the loop on negotiations. Mr. McConnell said the measure they’re finalizing bill meets the broad goals he laid out days ago: “It will send direct relief to the American people, deliver historic assistance to small businesses so workers can keep getting paid, help secure our economic foundations and prevent layoffs, and ­surge more resources onto the front lines of our brave healthcare professionals’ fight to defend Americans and defeat the virus.”  ",McConnell says Senate close to deal on coronavirus stimulus bill,"Saturday, March 21, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/21/mcconnell-says-senate-close-deal-coronavirus-stimu/,washington_times
"JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel’s prime minister Saturday said he is ready to step down next year as part of a proposed power-sharing agreement with his chief rival meant to steer the country through the coronavirus crisis and end a year-long political deadlock. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made his proposal during a nationally televised interview, calling for the formation of a three-year “emergency” unity government with the rival Blue and White Party.  Netanyahu told Channel 12 TV that he would remain as prime minister for the first year and a half, and allow Blue and White leader Benny Gantz to assume the post for a second year-and-a-half term in September 2021. He said each party would have an equal number of seats in the Cabinet.  “I will give up the prime minister’s post in another year and a half,” Netanyahu said. Yair Lapid, a senior Blue and White leader, dismissed Netanyahu’s unity offer as insincere. “Next week, we will go to choose a new parliament speaker and work to battle coronavirus for the good of the people,” he said. Israel is facing a growing threat from the coronavirus pandemic. It has detected nearly 900 cases and on Friday reported its first death. With the public largely confined to their homes, the economy appears to be in great danger, with tens of thousands of people losing their jobs. Blue and White has accused Netanyahu of using the coronavirus crisis to undermine the country’s democratic institutions and try to derail his scheduled trial on corruption charges. Senior members of Gantz’ party have expressed skepticism at previous power-sharing overtures by Netanyahu, concerned that he would not follow through on his promises to cede power. Israel this month held its third inconclusive election in under a year. Netanyahu’s Likud emerged as the largest single party, but fell short of securing a required parliamentary majority. A slim majority of lawmakers has endorsed Gantz as their choice for prime minister, though it is unclear whether he will be able to cobble together a governing coalition either. Gantz now has just over three weeks to form a new government. In the meantime, he is trying to push through legislation in parliament that would in effect prevent Netanyahu from serving as prime minister in the future. The legislation would impose term limits on the prime minister and bar a politician indicted on criminal charges, like Netanyahu, from being prime minister. Last week, parliament Speaker Yuli Edelstein, a member of Likud, suspended the parliament’s activities, preventing the newly elected legislature from choosing a new speaker and forming the committees needed to push through Blue and White’s legislative agenda.  Netanyahu’s hand-picked justice minister last week also shut down most of the court system, delaying the prime minister’s trial until at least May. Netanyahu’s opponents have accused him and his surrogates of undermining the country’s democratic institutions. Blue and White planned to file a Supreme Court challenge on Sunday requiring parliament to resume its activities. With the public ordered to stay at home, tens of thousands of people tuned in on social media late Saturday to a “virtual protest,” accusing Netanyahu of endangering the country’s democratic foundations. Former directors of the Mossad and Shin Bet security agencies were among the speakers. “Benjamin Netanyahu, get yourself together and release us from being your hostages,” said Yuval Diskin, a former Shin Bet director. “Do it for the good of the country and the people.” More than 275,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus worldwide. The virus has killed more than 11,000 people, while more than 88,000 have recovered. Most people only experience minor flu-like symptoms from the coronavirus and recover within a few weeks, but the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by those who appear well. It can cause severe illness, including pneumonia, in some patients, particularly the elderly and those with underlying health problems.

"President Trump on Saturday said the private sector was stepping up its efforts and doing its part to help combat the coronavirus spread and expressed hope that several drugs could provide relief to people while scientists work on a vaccine long-term. Mr. Trump spoke as the federal government grapples with the expanding outbreak. The number of U.S. cases surpassed 21,000 on Saturday, with more than 260 coronavirus-related deaths in the country. Italy, one of the hardest-hit countries, also reported 793 new deaths on Saturday The worldwide cases topped 280,000, with more than 12,000 deaths in total. Mr. Trump said that testing in the U.S. was going “very well,” despite persistent stories from doctors and members of the public about a lack of availability of tests around the country. “It’s an invisible enemy, and we will be successful — very successful — hopefully very much sooner than people would even think,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re going to be celebrating a great victory in the not too distant future.” The Food and Drug Administration has given emergency authorization to Cepheid, a California-based company, for a point-of-care coronavirus test the company said had a detection time of about 45 minutes. The company said shipments will start next week. The administration is urging people to avoid congregating in groups of more than 10, to postpone or cancel elective surgeries, and to stay home if at all possible to try to avoid spreading the disease. Several states, including California and New York, have taken drastic steps on their own to restrict people from leaving their homes except for essential services. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy signed such an order on Saturday that bans public gatherings and shuts down non-essential businesses starting at 9 p.m. Mr. Trump said the time hadn’t yet come to invoke the Defense Production Act, which allows the president broad latitude to order the procurement of certain goods, because the private sector was stepping up on its own to fill demand needs for protective masks, ventilators, and other equipment. “We have the act to use in case we need it, but we have so many things being made right now by so many — they’ve just stepped up,” he said. Mr. Trump also said Hanes is retrofitting manufacturing capabilities to produce protective masks. And General Motors said Friday that it would be working with Ventec Life Systems to try to ramp up the production of ventilators. Ventilators are a critical part of the response, with many people who test positive reporting difficulty breathing or tightness in the chest, in addition to other symptoms like a fever and a persistent cough. Congressional Democrats have pushed the president to immediately invoke the Korean War-era law to ramp up the production of needed supplies. Congress is working on a spending package that could end up topping $2 trillion to try to respond to and mitigate the economic effects of the virus. The House and Senate have already passed legislation that boosts federal health funding, as well as another bill that includes items like free testing for people who need it and increased unemployment and other government benefits. Vice President Mike Pence said on Saturday that people who aren’t displaying symptoms shouldn’t get tested so that resources wouldn’t be diverted from people who truly need the help. Still, Mr. Pence said that he and First Lady Karen Pence would be tested after a staff member in his office did test positive. Mr. Pence said the White House doctor has indicated there’s no reason to believe Mr. Pence was exposed and that there was no need to be tested. “Given the unique position that I have as vice president and as the leader of the White House coronavirus task force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon,” Mr. Pence said. Though experts say a coronavirus vaccine won’t be developed in the near future, Mr. Trump said he sees great promise in several drugs to have more immediate positive effects in helping combat the spread of the disease. “As the expression goes, what do we have to lose?” Mr. Trump said. “I feel very good about it.” Earlier this week, Mr. Trump directed the Food and Drug Administration to repurpose hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, for use against the coronavirus. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said earlier in the day that his state was going to start conducting drug trials with hydroxychloroquine and zithromax, an antibiotic, and that the FDA was going to accelerate the delivery of 10,000 doses to his state. Earlier in the day, the president said that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, taken together, have a real chance “to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.” “The FDA has moved mountains - Thank You!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. “Hopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents)…be put in use IMMEDIATELY. PEOPLE ARE DYING, MOVE FAST, and GOD BLESS EVERYONE!” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Saturday that there may be “anecdotal” instances of such drugs having a positive effect. “They may be true, but they’re anecdotal,” he said. “If you really want to definitively know if something works…you got to do the kind of trial that you get the good information.” “The president is talking about hope for people, and it’s not an unreasonable thing to hope for people,” Dr. Fauci said.

"Though he is currently confined to his own home Delaware due to the coronavirus pandemic, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden plans to offer “shadow briefings” on the the national emergency. In a press call Friday, Mr. Biden announced he was in the process of upgrading space in his house to include enough high tech equipment to livestream his coronavirus commentary via the internet. The former vice president also has renewed his pushback against President Trump — advising him to “stop saying false things” about the health crisis. “Biden is planning a regular shadow briefing on coronavirus to start as  early as Monday to show how he would handle the crisis and address what  he calls the lies and failures of President Trump,” said a Politico report. “In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells  them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that  president. For months, he falsely told us we had nothing to worry about  while praising China’s response for managing the coronavirus,” Mr. Biden  said in a recent tweet — possibly to answer #WhereisJoeBiden, a previously trending Twitter hashtag questioning his whereabouts during the pandemic. The former vice president is not holding back now — and debuted an online “CoVid-19 Breakdown” video with Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response coordinator. The video went online Saturday afternoon. Mr. Biden’s criticisms may fall on deaf ears, though. The majority of Americans approve of how Mr. Trump is handling the pandemic. In a new poll released Friday, ABC News found that 55% of the respondents gave him a thumbs up — up from 43% just a week ago. A Morning Consult survey had similar findings.

"President Trump on Saturday pushed back against a new report in the Washington Post that said U.S. intelligence agencies were warning in January and February about the global danger posed by the coronavirus. “It’s a very inaccurate story,” Mr. Trump said at a White House briefing on COVID-19. “From many people, I get a lot of credit for having closed our country very early to a very heavily infected country — China. Unfortunately, China.” “I wish China would have told us more about what was going on in China long prior to us reading about it,” he said. He said it’s terrible that China kicked the Washington Post and other outlets out of the country recently. “But I also think it’s terrible when people write inaccurately about you, and they write inaccurately about me every single day, every single hour,” he said.    ",Trump pushes back on Washington Post report about intel warnings about coronavirus,"Saturday, March 21, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/21/trump-pushes-back-washington-post-report-about-int/,washington_times
"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - Pennsylvania’s coronavirus death toll rose by one on Saturday as lawyers for Gov. Tom Wolf asked a court to dismiss a lawsuit challenging his authority to shutter “non-life-sustaining” businesses, declaring that unprecedented action is needed to combat a global pandemic they called “perhaps the biggest catastrophe of our lifetimes.” The Allegheny County Health Department confirmed the death Saturday and described the person as an adult in the late 60s who had been hospitalized. More than 370 coronavirus cases and two deaths have been reported in Pennsylvania. Health Secretary Rachel Levine said the state is seeing a spike in cases because more people are getting infected, not because testing has expanded. She also revealed Saturday that Wolf’s administration is considering a “shelter in place” order to ensure people stay at home. Wolf has already discouraged people from going out, if they can avoid it, and ordered schools shut through March, at least. In a legal filing late Friday, the state attorney general’s office said Wolf is empowered by the state’s Emergency Management Services Code to shutter businesses and to restrict people’s movements in a disaster. “COVID-19 presents an extraordinary challenge that requires extraordinary measures to combat. The governor was empowered by law to combat precisely this challenge,” the filing said. The state Supreme Court did not immediately rule on a lawsuit challenging Wolf’s authority to shut down gun shops and other companies. A second lawsuit, filed by a Harrisburg-area law firm, was withdrawn Saturday, one day after the Wolf administration relaxed its blanket closure of law offices. Wolf has justified his edict that tens of thousands of businesses shutter their doors indefinitely by citing big, daily upticks in the number of COVID-19 cases that health officials say threaten to overwhelm hospitals and spike the death toll.  Under pressure from Republicans and business owners, Wolf agreed to delay enforcement of the shutdown order until Monday. His administration also agreed to exempt additional businesses from the shutdown, including the timber industry, coal mines, hotels, accountants and laundromats. A gun shop claimed in a lawsuit that Wolf’s edict violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms and other constitutional rights. Wolf’s lawyers said that nothing in his order prevents a citizen from owning a gun. “Petitioners’ argument that the global COVID-19 pandemic is somehow not a disaster demonstrates a dangerous level of myopathy about the effect this pandemic could have on the citizens of the commonwealth and our health care system if the spread of this disease is not arrested,” the attorney general’s office wrote. Wolf’s administration has steadfastly refused to confirm to The Associated Press whether gun shops are covered by his shutdown order. Its legal filing said the governor’s office used industry codes generated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to construct its list of businesses covered by the shutdown order. “Any business would already know which sector it occupies and its corresponding NAICS code,” the filing said. On Saturday, Joshua Prince, a lawyer challenging the governor’s edict, called the legal filing “merely another smoke and mirrors response by the commonwealth, as it is acutely aware that there is no NAICS code relative to the sale, manufacture or transfer of firearms and ammunition.” He said the coding issue arises frequently for federal firearms licensees when they attempt to procure financing, “as there is no applicable code.” Wolf’s legal team also said that voluntary requests for Pennsylvanians to stay away from one another and for businesses to close their doors and have employees work from home proved ineffective at slowing the spread of the disease, requiring more drastic action. “Pennsylvanians refused to voluntarily engage in ‘social distancing’ to prevent the spread of COVID-19, leaving Governor Wolf with no option other than to close nonessential businesses to ‘lessen the curve’ of the disease,” the filing said. — CASES Allegheny County’s death brought to two the deaths reported in the state. State health officials on Saturday reported more than 100 new cases in Pennsylvania, for a total of more than 370, with about 40 people requiring hospitalization. Philadelphia Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said the city had confirmed its first positive case in a nursing home resident. Levine said people with mild symptoms do not necessarily need to get tested, and, after calling their doctor, they may be able to stay home, rest, take fluids and anti-fever medication. Testing is being prioritized for symptomatic people who are health care providers, elderly, have chronic medical conditions or are very ill, Levine said.  For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. ___ NURSING LICENSES Wolf’s administration on Saturday suspended a number of administrative requirements for nurses, including some licensing requirements and temporarily extending license expiration dates as it tries to find ways to boost staffing levels at hospitals to deal with a surge of patients stricken with the new virus.  ___ TAX DEADLINE State officials say the deadline for taxpayers to file 2019 Pennsylvania personal income tax returns has been extended to July 15. The Internal Revenue Service earlier extended the federal tax filing deadline to July 15. The state Department of Revenue said Saturday that it will also waive penalties and interest on 2019 personal income tax payments through the new deadline of July 15. Under Pennsylvania law, the filing deadline for personal income tax returns is tied to the federal income tax due date, officials said. — TRANSIT LOSSES The Philadelphia-area transit system says it is projecting a budget deficit of at least $150 million and is considering further service reductions following “massive, sudden ridership losses” amid the coronavirus outbreak. General manager Leslie Richards of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority said other measures aimed at stemming the losses also include a hiring freeze, elimination of overtime and a 10% pay cut for top executives.  SEPTA said it estimates a budget deficit of at least $150 million by the end of the current fiscal year on June 30 due to revenue losses. The authority said it had a $7.3 million budget surplus as recently as the end of February. The authority said it was working closely with state and local officials and staying in touch with members of Congress on “a possible federal relief package for public transportation.” A letter sent to employees said further service reductions on Regional Rail and Transit were being considered. ___ Rubinkam reported from northeastern Pennsylvania.

"BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) - Newly released documents show a coastal Georgia resort violated labor laws more than 500 times and collectively underpaid employees by more than $46,000.                 The Brunswick News obtained the documents relating to violations at the Sea Island Resort earlier this month through a Freedom of Information Act request of the U.S. Labor Department. The investigation into the resort lasted for more than two years. It found 240 violations of record keeping for workers younger than 18,167 instances of failure to pay overtime, 98 violations of failure to pay minimum wage and one occurrence of failure to keep accurate records. There was $45,849.20 in unpaid overtime and $1,073.25 in unpaid minimum wages. Documents show Sea Island told investigators in October 2017 that the company wasn’t aware that it needed to have documents proving how old its workers were on hand. Sea Island told the department in March 2018 that its own review showed it owed employees $60,000 for unpaid overtime. According to the Labor Department the enforceable total was $46,922.45, which Sea Island agreed to pay by April 20, 2018. Sea Island declined to add to a 2018 statement by CEO Scott Steilen.

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s supreme leader refused U.S. assistance Sunday to fight the new coronavirus, citing an unfounded conspiracy theory that the virus could be man-made by America. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s comments come as Iran faces crushing U.S. sanctions blocking the country from selling its crude oil and accessing international financial markets. But while Iranian civilian officials in recent days have increasingly criticized those sanctions, 80-year-old Khamenei instead chose to traffic in the same conspiracy theory increasingly used by Chinese officials about the new virus to deflect blame for the pandemic. “I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?” Khamenei said. “Possibly your medicine is a way to spread the virus more.” He also alleged without offering any evidence that the virus “is specifically built for Iran using the genetic data of Iranians which they have obtained through different means.” “You might send people as doctors and therapists, maybe they would want to come here and see the effect of the poison they have produced in person,” he said. There is no scientific proof offered anywhere in the world to support Khamenei’s comments. However, his comments come after Chinese government spokesman Lijian Zhao tweeted earlier this month that it “might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe(s) us an explanation!” Lijian likewise offered no evidence to support his claim, which saw the U.S. State Department summon China’s ambassador to complain. Wuhan is the Chinese city where the first cases of the disease were detected in December. In recent days, the Trump administration has increasingly referred to the virus as the “Chinese” or “Wuhan” virus, while the World Health Organization used the term COVID-19 to describe the illness the virus causes. Even a U.S. senator from Arkansas has trafficked in the unfounded conspiracy theory it was a man-made Chinese bioweapon. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. Scientists have not yet determined exactly how the new coronavirus first infected people. Evidence suggests it originated in bats, which infected another animal that spread it to people at a market in Wuhan. The now-shuttered Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market advertised dozens of species such as giant salamanders, baby crocodiles and raccoon dogs that were often referred to as wildlife, even when they were farmed. An article published last week in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Medicine similarly said it was “improbable” that the virus “emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus.” Khamenei made the comments in a speech in Tehran broadcast live Sunday across Iran marking Nowruz, the Persian New Year. He had called off his usual speech at Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad over the virus outbreak. His comments come as Iran has over 21,600 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus amid 1,685 reported deaths, according to government figures released Sunday. Iran is one of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the new virus. Across the Mideast, Iran represents eight of 10 cases of the virus and those leaving the Islamic Republic have carried the virus to other countries. Iranian officials have criticized U.S. offers of aid during the virus crisis as being disingenuous. They have accused the Trump administration of wanting to capitalize on its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since withdrawing from the nuclear deal in May 2018. However, the U.S. has directly offered the Islamic Republic aid in the past despite decades of enmity, like during the devastating Bam earthquake of 2003. Reassigning blame could be helpful to Iran’s government, which faced widespread public anger after denying for days it shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, killing 176 people. Widespread economic problems as well has seen mass demonstrations in recent years that saw hundreds reportedly killed. Iranian hard-liners have supported conspiracy theories in the past when it suited their interests. Following the Sept. 11 attacks, some publicly doubted al-Qaida’s role and state TV promoting the unfounded conspiracy theory that the Americans blew up the building themselves. Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad similarly raised doubt about the Sept. 11 attack, calling it a “big lie,” while also describing the Holocaust as a “myth.” Meanwhile on Sunday, Iran imposed a two-week closure on major shopping malls and centers across the country to prevent spreading the virus. Pharmacies, supermarkets, groceries and bakeries will remain open. In Saudi Arabia, the kingdom said its armed forces are now taking part in combating the virus, setting up mobile hospitals in various cities. And in Kuwait, authorities have instituted a nightly curfew from 5 p.m. to 4 a.m., warning violators face up to three years in prison and fines of $32,000 if arrested and convicted. ___ Associated Press writer Aya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"LONDON — To offset the crushing costs of trying to stem a global epidemic, the World Bank and partners announced the creation of “pandemic bonds” several years ago: the idea was to leverage private capital from Wall Street firms that would help stricken poor countries. But since the bonds were launched in 2014, backed by about $190 million in promised financing from donor countries, investors have reaped more profits than countries battling epidemics. And even in the current pandemic, any payout to stricken countries would barely make a dent into what the outbreak has cost them. Former World Bank chief economist Lawrence Summers has described the bonds as “financial goofiness.” The bonds were launched in the aftermath of the devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and the current coronavirus outbreak is exposing flaws in their design. “The countries that need help are not the ones getting the funds,” said Felix Stein of the University of Cambridge, who has researched the bonds. “It’s the Wall Street investors that are benefiting.” The bonds are a form of disaster insurance and work essentially like this: the World Bank sells bonds to private sector investors, who get a yearly return, partly paid for by donor countries. If an epidemic occurs, the investors lose the capital they initially used to buy the bonds. That money is sent as aid to countries affected by the epidemic. The problem, experts say, is that investors like Baillie Gifford and Amundi and Oppenheimer were getting high returns - as much as 11% a year. And the bonds required a certain number of people to die before countries receive any payout, among other conditions, complicating any immediate efforts to snuff out the virus. Upon their launch, the bonds were described by the World Bank as a way “to help prevent a high-severity infectious disease outbreak from becoming a pandemic” by making essential financing available to key responders. According to the bonds’ criteria, 12 weeks must pass before a payout for a coronavirus epidemic can be made. The outbreak must also be sustained, have affected at least two countries, and have caused at least 250 deaths. The World Bank said that date would be met on March 23 and that a decision for a payout would then be made by an independent agency. The bank said the maximum potential payout was about $196 million. Only the world’s poorest countries are eligible for funds, making any immediate pay-out unlikely, as the hardest-hit countries include China, Italy, Iran, Spain and South Korea. Taxpayers in Australia, Germany and Japan and the International Development Association, meanwhile, have put up about $176 million so far to back the bonds. In a 2019 paper published in the BMJ, Clare Wenham of the London School of Economics and a colleague found that as of last year, the pandemic bonds had paid nearly $115 million to investors while providing only $61 million via a “cash window” mechanism to Congo, for its most recent Ebola epidemic. Wenham said the payout conditions are too arbitrary and long. “By the time the required number of people die in a certain number of countries, the pandemic is clearly going to have spread quite significantly,” she said, describing the mechanism as “flawed” and overcomplicated. To date, the new coronavirus has infected more than 307,000 people and killed over 13,000. The illness has been deemed a pandemic by the World Health Organization, meaning it will likely reach every country in the world. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Some 92,000 have already recovered from the virus, mostly in China. Wenham said the bonds might work better if the payout was linked to another trigger, like when the WHO declares a global health emergency like it did in late January. “If the whole idea is to help prevent a pandemic, it doesn’t make sense to wait until the pandemic is spreading before paying out,” she said. Olga Jonas, an economist at Harvard University who previously worked at the World Bank, says it’s unclear why the pandemic bonds are even necessary. “The World Bank has ample financial capacity to finance responses to outbreaks because it has $29 billion of liquid assets,” she said. Earlier this month, the World Bank announced it would make $14 billion available to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank declined to say if the pandemic bonds would be continued in another form after COVID-19. • The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"SEOUL, South Korea — President Donald Trump sent a personal letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, seeking to maintain good relations and offering cooperation in fighting the viral pandemic, Kim’s sister said Sunday. The latest correspondence came as Kim observed the firing of tactical guided weapons over the weekend, drawing criticism from South Korea, as the nuclear talks remain deadlocked. In a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency, Kim’s sister and senior ruling party official, Kim Yo Jong, praised Trump for sending the letter at a time when “big difficulties and challenges lie ahead in the way of developing ties” between the countries. In the letter, she said Trump explained his plan to “propel the relations between the two countries … and expressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work” in an apparent reference to the global coronavirus outbreak. She said her brother expressed his gratitude for Trump’s letter. North Korea has repeatedly said there hasn’t been a single case of the coronavirus on its soil. Some foreign experts question that claim and say an outbreak in the North could cause a humanitarian disaster because of its poor medical infrastructure. Last month, the State Department expressed concerns about North Korea’s vulnerability to a potential coronavirus outbreak and said it was ready to support efforts by aid organizations to contain the spread of the illness in the North. There was no immediate comment from the White House. Kim Yo Jong said Trump’s letter is “a good example showing the special and firm personal relations” between the North Korean and U.S. leaders. But she said it’s not a good idea to “make hasty conclusion or be optimistic about” the prospect for bilateral relations. “In my personal opinion, I think that the bilateral relations and dialogue for them would be thinkable only when the equilibrium is kept dynamically and morally and justice ensured between the two countries,” she said. “Even at this moment we are working hard to develop and defend ourselves on our own under the cruel environment which the U.S. is keen to ‘provide.’” Earlier, Trump sent birthday greetings to Kim Jong Un, who was believed to have turned 36 on Jan. 8. Senior North Korean official Kim Kye Gwan said at the time that the birthday messages won’t lead his country to return to talks unless the U.S. accepts its demands. Kim and Trump have met three times and exchanged letters and envoys on many occasions since 2018, when they launched talks on the fate of Kim’s advancing nuclear arsenal. The two leaders have avoided harsh language against each other and Trump once said he and Kim “fell in love.” But their diplomacy has largely come to a standstill since the breakdown of their second summit in Vietnam in February 2019, when Trump rejected Kim’s demands for broad sanctions relief in return for a partial disarmament step. Kim pressed Trump to come up with new proposals to salvage the negotiations by the end of last year. Kim later vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent, unveil “a new strategic weapon” and warned he would no longer be bound by a major weapons test moratorium. In recent weeks, North Korea has fired a slew of artillery and other rockets into the sea in what experts say is an attempt to improve its military capabilities. The weapons were all short range and did not pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland. A resumption of long-range missile or nuclear weapons tests by Kim would likely completely scuttle diplomacy with Trump, experts say. KCNA said Kim watched the test firing of tactical guided weapons on Saturday with Kim Yo Jong and other top officials. South Korea’s military called the demonstration “very inappropriate” at a time when the world is struggling with the coronavirus pandemic. South Korea’s military said Saturday it detected two presumed short-range ballistic missiles that flew from a site in western North Korea across the country and landed in the waters off the east coast. The weapons flew 410 kilometers (255 miles), according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.  ",North Korea praises Trump for coronavirus outreach," -

"OAKLAND, Calif. — Most Californians stayed at home on a Saturday that was unlike any its 40 million residents had ever seen before. Less than 48 hours after Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an unprecedented stay-at-home order to help curb the coronavirus spread, shopping centers and streets were empty. Churches were closed. Playgrounds deserted. However, stores and farmer markets were bustling, and many people took advantage of the beautiful spring weather and rushed to the outdoors. At beaches and parks, not everyone heeded calls to practice social distancing, prompting Newsom to call them out. “Those young people are still out there on the beaches thinking it’s time to party. It’s time to grow up, time to wake up,” he said at an evening news conference. “Time to recognize that it’s not just about the old folks, it’s about your impact on their lives. Don’t be selfish.” The governor’s effort to curb the pandemic in the nation’s most populous state was by far the most sweeping and was followed Friday by similar announcements in New York and Illinois. California is one of the hardest-hit states, with 1,382 confirmed cases confirmed cases and 25 deaths as of Saturday. Los Angeles County Health Director Barbara Ferrer urged people to stay home and only go out for essential needs. Those who have been tested and come back negative shouldn’t have a false sense of security. “You can be negative today and positive tomorrow,” she said. “Stay home as much as possible. You are safer at home.” Newsom has said infection rates of the COVID-19 virus are doubling every four days in some areas and projected that 56% of the state’s population - about 22 million people - could contract the virus in the next two months if aggressive prevention isn’t taken. On Saturday night, the Los Angeles County Public Health Department announced two deaths from coronavirus and 59 new cases. On Saturday, he ordered spending $42 million in emergency funding to allow the state to lease two hospitals - Seton Medical Center in Daly City and St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles - for three months to provide care for patients with COVID-19. The emergency fund will also be used to buy or refurbish ventilators, provide more patient transportation service and expand testing capacity at a state laboratory. California’s 416 hospitals have a combined 78,000 beds for patients, Newsom said, and the state was working to set up 10,000 additional beds by converting hotels and convention centers into quasi hospitals to meet the potential demand. The Santa Clara Convention Center, for example, will accommodate 250 patients. Residents have been told to stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from others, not gather in groups and wash their hands frequently. They can go out to get food, fill prescriptions, seek medical care, care for vulnerable relatives or neighbors and get exercise, such as walking. In general, people seemed to be heeding state and local orders to stay home as much as possible. Normally congested freeways in California were truly free - of traffic - and city streets remained mostly empty in areas usually bustling with cars, bikes, scooters and commuters emerging from rail stations and stopping at coffee shops and bakeries. Yosemite National Park closed to visitors Friday, the latest of California’s top tourist destinations to do so. Most retail businesses and virtually all schools were closed and those that could were having employees work from home. Gas stations, supermarkets and convenience stores were open along with auto repair shops and those providing essential services, such as plumbers and electricians, were still on the job. But restaurants were only delivering or providing take-out. At the same time, people were sweeping grocery store shelves bare despite government pleas that hoarding was unnecessary because there were no shortages. Toilet paper was universally in short supply. Up to 500 members of the California National Guard were activated Saturday to help with humanitarian aid. Most of them are providing help in distributing food at food banks, whose volunteer base has declined during the crisis while the need for them has soared because many people are losing work. A farmer’s market near Oakland’s Lake Merritt was bustling on a Saturday morning with shoppers waiting in line at a produce stand to buy beets, strawberries and kale. Most stood several feet apart, but the spacing didn’t appear to be enough for one woman who walked by and yelled “6 feet!” to remind everyone the rule for keeping a safe distance. Some vendors required shoppers to order produce instead of picking them out themselves. One farmer posted a sign that said: “Don’t touch what you won’t buy please.” “If you’re not wearing rubber gloves and a mask, you shouldn’t be here,” said Jeff Hyde, who had both on while selling smoked fish. At the farmers market in Pasadena, people appeared to be trying to stay 6 feet apart while waiting in line. The stalls, however, were directly next to each other. and shoppers picked out produce close together. The Huntington Beach pier is typically full on a sunny weekend morning, but there was plenty of room Saturday for walkers, joggers and roller skaters to stay far apart. Down below, dozens of surfers bobbed in the water where sets of waist-high waves rolled in. The bright skies, or perhaps the threat of rain on Sunday, drew many people to Venice Beach. Most took care to stay well away from each other on the sand. But spacing became an issue in popular areas like the pier and the boardwalk. North of San Francisco, the Marin County Sheriff’s office shut down access to the Mount Tamalpais Watershed “due to the astronomical amount of people NOT practicing social distancing and home sheltering.” Authorities there said there was back-to-back traffic to coastal attractions and parking lots to beaches were full. Newsom said he expected social pressure - not policing - to help enforce his stay-at-home order. He said he doesn’t want to shut down parks or beaches, and that National Guard troops will only be deployed to help law enforcement “make sure all our logistics are operational.” Authorities were looking into releasing non-violent inmates from jails to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in close confinement. The state prison system reported its first three cases among employees at different institutions, but no inmate has yet contracted it. For most people, COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. It can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, for some people, especially older adults and those with existing health problems. The vast majority of people recover.

"SEOUL, South Korea — President Donald Trump sent a personal letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, seeking to maintain good relations and offering cooperation in fighting the viral pandemic, Kim’s sister said Sunday. The latest correspondence came as Kim observed the firing of tactical guided weapons over the weekend, drawing criticism from South Korea, as the nuclear talks remain deadlocked. In a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency, Kim’s sister and senior ruling party official, Kim Yo Jong, praised Trump for sending the letter at a time when “big difficulties and challenges lie ahead in the way of developing ties” between the countries. In the letter, she said Trump explained his plan to “propel the relations between the two countries … and expressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work” in an apparent reference to the global coronavirus outbreak. She said her brother expressed his gratitude for Trump’s letter. North Korea has repeatedly said there hasn’t been a single case of the coronavirus on its soil. Some foreign experts question that claim and say an outbreak in the North could cause a humanitarian disaster because of its poor medical infrastructure. Last month, the State Department expressed concerns about North Korea’s vulnerability to a potential coronavirus outbreak and said it was ready to support efforts by aid organizations to contain the spread of the illness in the North. There was no immediate comment from the White House. Kim Yo Jong said Trump’s letter is “a good example showing the special and firm personal relations” between the North Korean and U.S. leaders. But she said it’s not a good idea to “make hasty conclusion or be optimistic about” the prospect for bilateral relations. “In my personal opinion, I think that the bilateral relations and dialogue for them would be thinkable only when the equilibrium is kept dynamically and morally and justice ensured between the two countries,” she said. “Even at this moment we are working hard to develop and defend ourselves on our own under the cruel environment which the U.S. is keen to ‘provide.’” Earlier, Trump sent birthday greetings to Kim Jong Un, who was believed to have turned 36 on Jan. 8. Senior North Korean official Kim Kye Gwan said at the time that the birthday messages won’t lead his country to return to talks unless the U.S. accepts its demands. Kim and Trump have met three times and exchanged letters and envoys on many occasions since 2018, when they launched talks on the fate of Kim’s advancing nuclear arsenal. The two leaders have avoided harsh language against each other and Trump once said he and Kim “fell in love.” But their diplomacy has largely come to a standstill since the breakdown of their second summit in Vietnam in February 2019, when Trump rejected Kim’s demands for broad sanctions relief in return for a partial disarmament step. Kim pressed Trump to come up with new proposals to salvage the negotiations by the end of last year. Kim later vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent, unveil “a new strategic weapon” and warned he would no longer be bound by a major weapons test moratorium. In recent weeks, North Korea has fired a slew of artillery and other rockets into the sea in what experts say is an attempt to improve its military capabilities. The weapons were all short range and did not pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland. A resumption of long-range missile or nuclear weapons tests by Kim would likely completely scuttle diplomacy with Trump, experts say. KCNA said Kim watched the test firing of tactical guided weapons on Saturday with Kim Yo Jong and other top officials. South Korea’s military called the demonstration “very inappropriate” at a time when the world is struggling with the coronavirus pandemic. South Korea’s military said Saturday it detected two presumed short-range ballistic missiles that flew from a site in western North Korea across the country and landed in the waters off the east coast. The weapons flew 410 kilometers (255 miles), according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.

"LONDON - Sunday is Mother’s Day in Britain, and the government has a stark message for millions of citizens: A visit to your mother could be life-threatening. In a message to the nation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson implored Britons to forego family visits and Sunday lunches. He said “we cannot disguise or sugar coat the threat” that “if your mother is elderly or vulnerable, then I am afraid all the statistics show that she is much more likely to die from coronavirus.” On Friday, Johnson said that he hoped to see his 77-year-old mother on Mother’s Day. His office later said that he would speak to her on Skype. The U.K. government is scrambling to toughen its response to the coronavirus outbreak amid criticism it did not act quickly enough to close schools, pubs and restaurants. Britain has 5,018 confirmed cases of the virus, including 233 deaths. The government says Britain will be facing a crisis on the scale of Italy’s in two weeks if people do not heed instructions to stay home and avoid contact with others.

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s supreme leader refused U.S. assistance Sunday to fight the new coronavirus, citing an unfounded conspiracy theory that the virus could be man-made by America. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s comments come as Iran faces crushing U.S. sanctions blocking the country from selling its crude oil and accessing international financial markets. But while Iranian civilian officials in recent days have increasingly criticized those sanctions, 80-year-old Khamenei instead chose to traffic in the same conspiracy theory increasingly used by Chinese officials about the new virus to deflect blame for the pandemic. “I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?” Khamenei said. “Possibly your medicine is a way to spread the virus more.” He also alleged without offering any evidence that the virus “is specifically built for Iran using the genetic data of Iranians which they have obtained through different means.” “You might send people as doctors and therapists, maybe they would want to come here and see the effect of the poison they have produced in person,” he said. There is no scientific proof offered anywhere in the world to support Khamenei’s comments. However, his comments come after Chinese government spokesman Lijian Zhao tweeted earlier this month that it “might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe(s) us an explanation!” Lijian likewise offered no evidence to support his claim, which saw the U.S. State Department summon China’s ambassador to complain. Wuhan is the Chinese city where the first cases of the disease were detected in December. In recent days, the Trump administration has increasingly referred to the virus as the “Chinese” or “Wuhan” virus, while the World Health Organization used the term COVID-19 to describe the illness the virus causes. Even a U.S. senator from Arkansas has trafficked in the unfounded conspiracy theory it was a man-made Chinese bioweapon. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. Scientists have not yet determined exactly how the new coronavirus first infected people. Evidence suggests it originated in bats, which infected another animal that spread it to people at a market in Wuhan. The now-shuttered Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market advertised dozens of species such as giant salamanders, baby crocodiles and raccoon dogs that were often referred to as wildlife, even when they were farmed. An article published last week in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Medicine similarly said it was “improbable” that the virus “emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus.” Khamenei made the comments in a speech in Tehran broadcast live Sunday across Iran marking Nowruz, the Persian New Year. He had called off his usual speech at Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad over the virus outbreak. His comments come as Iran has over 21,600 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus amid 1,685 reported deaths, according to government figures released Sunday. Iran is one of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the new virus. Across the Mideast, Iran represents eight of 10 cases of the virus and those leaving the Islamic Republic have carried the virus to other countries. Iranian officials have criticized U.S. offers of aid during the virus crisis as being disingenuous. They have accused the Trump administration of wanting to capitalize on its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since withdrawing from the nuclear deal in May 2018. However, the U.S. has directly offered the Islamic Republic aid in the past despite decades of enmity, like during the devastating Bam earthquake of 2003. Reassigning blame could be helpful to Iran’s government, which faced widespread public anger after denying for days it shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, killing 176 people. Widespread economic problems as well has seen mass demonstrations in recent years that saw hundreds reportedly killed. Iranian hard-liners have supported conspiracy theories in the past when it suited their interests. Following the Sept. 11 attacks, some publicly doubted al-Qaida’s role and state TV promoting the unfounded conspiracy theory that the Americans blew up the building themselves. Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad similarly raised doubt about the Sept. 11 attack, calling it a “big lie,” while also describing the Holocaust as a “myth.” Meanwhile on Sunday, Iran imposed a two-week closure on major shopping malls and centers across the country to prevent spreading the virus. Pharmacies, supermarkets, groceries and bakeries will remain open. In Saudi Arabia, the kingdom said its armed forces are now taking part in combating the virus, setting up mobile hospitals in various cities. And in Kuwait, authorities have instituted a nightly curfew from 5 p.m. to 4 a.m., warning violators face up to three years in prison and fines of $32,000 if arrested and convicted. ___ Associated Press writer Aya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"LONDON — To offset the crushing costs of trying to stem a global epidemic, the World Bank and partners announced the creation of “pandemic bonds” several years ago: the idea was to leverage private capital from Wall Street firms that would help stricken poor countries. But since the bonds were launched in 2014, backed by about $190 million in promised financing from donor countries, investors have reaped more profits than countries battling epidemics. And even in the current pandemic, any payout to stricken countries would barely make a dent into what the outbreak has cost them. Former World Bank chief economist Lawrence Summers has described the bonds as “financial goofiness.” The bonds were launched in the aftermath of the devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and the current coronavirus outbreak is exposing flaws in their design. “The countries that need help are not the ones getting the funds,” said Felix Stein of the University of Cambridge, who has researched the bonds. “It’s the Wall Street investors that are benefiting.” The bonds are a form of disaster insurance and work essentially like this: the World Bank sells bonds to private sector investors, who get a yearly return, partly paid for by donor countries. If an epidemic occurs, the investors lose the capital they initially used to buy the bonds. That money is sent as aid to countries affected by the epidemic. The problem, experts say, is that investors like Baillie Gifford and Amundi and Oppenheimer were getting high returns - as much as 11% a year. And the bonds required a certain number of people to die before countries receive any payout, among other conditions, complicating any immediate efforts to snuff out the virus. Upon their launch, the bonds were described by the World Bank as a way “to help prevent a high-severity infectious disease outbreak from becoming a pandemic” by making essential financing available to key responders. According to the bonds’ criteria, 12 weeks must pass before a payout for a coronavirus epidemic can be made. The outbreak must also be sustained, have affected at least two countries, and have caused at least 250 deaths. The World Bank said that date would be met on March 23 and that a decision for a payout would then be made by an independent agency. The bank said the maximum potential payout was about $196 million. Only the world’s poorest countries are eligible for funds, making any immediate pay-out unlikely, as the hardest-hit countries include China, Italy, Iran, Spain and South Korea. Taxpayers in Australia, Germany and Japan and the International Development Association, meanwhile, have put up about $176 million so far to back the bonds. In a 2019 paper published in the BMJ, Clare Wenham of the London School of Economics and a colleague found that as of last year, the pandemic bonds had paid nearly $115 million to investors while providing only $61 million via a “cash window” mechanism to Congo, for its most recent Ebola epidemic. Wenham said the payout conditions are too arbitrary and long. “By the time the required number of people die in a certain number of countries, the pandemic is clearly going to have spread quite significantly,” she said, describing the mechanism as “flawed” and overcomplicated. To date, the new coronavirus has infected more than 307,000 people and killed over 13,000. The illness has been deemed a pandemic by the World Health Organization, meaning it will likely reach every country in the world. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Some 92,000 have already recovered from the virus, mostly in China. Wenham said the bonds might work better if the payout was linked to another trigger, like when the WHO declares a global health emergency like it did in late January. “If the whole idea is to help prevent a pandemic, it doesn’t make sense to wait until the pandemic is spreading before paying out,” she said. Olga Jonas, an economist at Harvard University who previously worked at the World Bank, says it’s unclear why the pandemic bonds are even necessary. “The World Bank has ample financial capacity to finance responses to outbreaks because it has $29 billion of liquid assets,” she said. Earlier this month, the World Bank announced it would make $14 billion available to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank declined to say if the pandemic bonds would be continued in another form after COVID-19. • The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday said the administration and Congress are close to a massive stimulus deal to rescue the American economy from the coronavirus. “I think we have a fundamental understanding and I look forward to wrapping it up today,” Mr. Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday. The package is expected to inject nearly $2 trillion into the U.S. economy. It includes small business “retention loans,” meaning firms will get two weeks of cash flow to pay and retain workers so the economy is up and running when the virus is defeated. “If you do that, those loans will be forgiven,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The plan also calls for direct payments to Americans. The average family of four would get a direct deposit of $3,000 as a “bridge for them to get through this quickly.” Third, it enhances unemployment insurance for people who’ve been laid off due to the coronavirus. And finally, the plan calls on the Federal Reserve to offer $4 trillion in liquidity to prop up the economy through broad lending programs. “I think we are injecting a lot of liquidity into the system,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “And hard-working Americans know that the president wants to protect them.” The plan also calls for about $110 billion to support hospitals on the front lines of the battle. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It’s infected over 300,000 people worldwide, resulting in over 13,000 deaths. The U.S. has seen nearly 27,000 infections and about 350 deaths, prompting governors to place severe limits on commerce so that people stay apart and break lines of transmission. Those limits have led to massive layoffs and fears that many businesses will not survive the crisis. If the fight against the virus hasn’t been won 10 weeks from now, Mr. Mnuchin said, “we’ll go back to Congress again.” “I think we are injecting a lot of liquidity into the system,” he said. “And hard-working Americans know that the president wants to protect them.”  ","Mnuchin: Administration, Congress close on coronavirus stimulus deal","Sunday, March 22, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/22/steven-mnuchin-congress-close-coronavirus-stimulus/,washington_times
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said the Trump administration’s failure to invoke the Defense Production Act is “going to cost lives” as hospitals in her district see a shortfall in masks, gowns and other equipment during the coronavirus crisis. President Trump says many companies are stepping forward voluntarily, so he hasn’t used the 1950 law that empowers him to direct production from the private sector. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a well-known progressive Democrat, said it’s great that companies are pitching in but that greater production is necessary. “It is absolutely needed,” she told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We are nowhere near the beds and capacity that we need in this country.” New York City Bill de Blasio issued a similar warning Sunday, saying increased production is a matter of life and death. “The president of the United States is from New York City and he will not lift a finger to help his hometown. And I do not get it. I do not get it,” Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Right now I have asked repeatedly for the military to be mobilized, for the Defense Production Act be used to the fullest to get us things like ventilators. So people can live who would have died otherwise.” The New Yorkers spoke as Congress scrambles to boost the economy and extend a lifeline to those who’ve already lost their jobs due to widespread business closures and quarantine orders. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said there is no reason for include corporate bailouts in the emerging emergency bill. She also said Congress needs to “stop the bleeding” by sending cash directly to households while stopping payments for things like mortgages and utilities, so families aren’t seeing an outflow of cash at the same time. She said Congress should mail checks out to everyone immediately and then “tax it back” from richer people who didn’t need them. That way, lawmakers can act fast instead of figuring out a complicated system in the middle of the crisis.  ",AOC: Trump’s failure to invoke Defense Production Act ‘going to cost lives’," -

We’re going to continue to be aggressive and we’re continually monitoring what the next move we can make is,” she said on ABC’s “This Week.” “Frankly a patchwork strategy of each state doing what they can is - we’re going to do it if we have to but it would be nice to have a national strategy.” She said she doesn’t want to fight with the White House, but said a point will come in which failures will need to be examined. Michigan has reported 787 cases in total of COVID-19. Eight people have died. Whitmer has also signed an executive order that closes “non-essential personal care services” for three weeks. The services include nail and hair salons, tattoo and piercing shops, and spas, as well as other services that “require individuals to be within 6 feet of each other.” The order goes into effect Sunday and runs through April 13. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. • The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Senate Democrats and environmentalists want to tack climate-change mandates onto proposed federal aid to major airlines and cruise lines reeling from the novel coronavirus outbreak. In a letter to the House and Senate leadership, eight Senate Democrats said that any financial assistance to the travel industry “should be paired with requirements that companies act in a more responsible fashion” by reducing their carbon footprint. “If we given the airline and cruise industries assistance without requiring them to be better environmental stewards, we would miss a major opportunity to combat climate change and ocean dumping,” said the Wednesday letter. At the same time, more than 200 environmental and wildlife groups urged Congress to place a cap on greenhouse gases from U.S. air fleets, which would require the industry to reduce emissions by 20% per decade from 2020 levels. “Climate change damages will wreak havoc on a scale even greater than the coronavirus,” said the Friday letter headed by the Center for Biological Diversity. “It is time to stop repeating the mistakes of the past and ensure that any bailout of the aviation industry puts it on a path to address its threat to our climate, workers and communities.” We’re trying! It is possible to accomplish two goals at once, even in Congress. https://t.co/hLsuy5tPYH Which is really strange because everyone is with them on this https://t.co/90qnsbulY6 pic.twitter.com/hIcd0G41FX The U.S. airline industry is pushing for $50 billion in financial assistance—about half in zero-interest loan guarantees, half in cash grants—as air travel nosedives in reaction to COVID-19, while the Senate GOP package as introduced includes loans but not grants. The risk for Democrats lies with the optics of holding up critically needed aid over climate concerns. United Airlines and its unions warned Friday that layoffs would be necessary to account for next month’s anticipated 60% drop in planned flights without federal help. Climate Depot’s Marc Morano blasted the effort to insert climate change into the pandemic response, saying that the “last thing U.S. businesses or the economy need are more punishing climate-based mandates to satisfy the Democrat Party base.” “Democrats know that they should never let a crisis go to waste,” said Mr. Morano, author of “The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change.” “They are pouncing on any opportunity to inject climate into the Covid-19 issue. Trying to make sure that any federal stimulus bills include going in the ‘right direction toward decarbonization’ is not the way to proceed.” Climate-change activists have increasingly targeted greenhouse gas emissions from airplane travel, engaging in “flight shaming” to discourage frequent flyers, a phenomenon has wound up embarrassing Green New Deal advocates like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren over their private-jet travel. In their letter, the Democrats said that airline travel accounts for 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions, a figure expected to triple by 2050, while cruise ships “burn heavy fuel oil, one of the dirtiest fuels.” “Business leaders are themselves increasingly recognizing that their companies must make positive contributions to society or risk losing their social license,” said the letter. “This is particularly true when companies ask American taxpayers for financial assistance.” The industry group Airlines for America said on its website that U.S. planes improved their efficiency between 1978 and 2018 by 130%, resulting in nearly five billion metric tons of “carbon dioxide savings,” while carriers continue to invest in alternative fuels. The Democrats who signed the letter were Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island; Martin Heinrich of New Mexico; Jeffrey Merkley of Oregon; Cory Booker of New Jersey; Edward Markey of Massachusetts; Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut; Tina Smith of Minnesota, and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.

"The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is calling on President Trump to take “extraordinary measures” to help American citizens abroad who are struggling to find flights back to the U.S. amid the global coronavirus outbreak. In a letter to Mr. Trump Sunday, Sen. Bob Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, called for the administration to take “all necessary steps” to provide travel assistance to tens of thousands of Americans around the world trying to return home. “No American should ever have to worry that they might be abandoned abroad by our government … we must provide Americans overseas the support that they need,” Mr. Menendez wrote, pointing to the rapidly increasing number of cancelled commercial flights into the U.S. and new measures to close borders. Mr. Menendez suggested the Pentagon “explore” making military aircraft available to evacuate stranded American citizens and called on Mr. Trump to authorize the use of the Civil Reserve Airfleet (CRAF) to charter commercial flights for this purpose. “At a time when U.S. commercial carriers are seeking unprecedented financial assistance from U.S. taxpayers — and while much of the airline fleet is otherwise idle — we would expect that U.S. airlines, including those participating in the CRAF program, will be willing and able to step into the breach and work with the Department of State to provide the necessary support to bring American citizens home,” Mr. Menendez wrote. The letter comes just days after the State Department issued its highest travel advisory — level 4 — warning Americans not to travel internationally amid the health pandemic. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday said his department is working with the Pentagon and commercial and private airlines to fly U.S. citizens to an undisclosed destination in the U.S., while other Americans could find themselves flying back on a Defense Department flight “where there is space available.” A handful of lawmakers have raised “serious concerns” in recent days about Americans abroad who are struggling to return after U.S. citizens in Honduras, Morocco, Peru and Tunisia reported difficulties booking flights or obtaining support from American embassies and consulates.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said the Trump administration’s failure to invoke the Defense Production Act is “going to cost lives” as hospitals in her district see a shortfall in masks, gowns and other equipment during the coronavirus crisis. President Trump says many companies are stepping forward voluntarily, so he hasn’t used the 1950 law that empowers him to direct production from the private sector. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a well-known progressive Democrat, said it’s great that companies are pitching in but that greater production is necessary. “It is absolutely needed,” she told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We are nowhere near the beds and capacity that we need in this country.” New York City Bill de Blasio issued a similar warning Sunday, saying increased production is a matter of life and death. “The president of the United States is from New York City and he will not lift a finger to help his hometown. And I do not get it. I do not get it,” Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Right now I have asked repeatedly for the military to be mobilized, for the Defense Production Act be used to the fullest to get us things like ventilators. So people can live who would have died otherwise.” The New Yorkers spoke as Congress scrambles to boost the economy and extend a lifeline to those who’ve already lost their jobs due to widespread business closures and quarantine orders. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said there is no reason for include corporate bailouts in the emerging emergency bill. She also said Congress needs to “stop the bleeding” by sending cash directly to households while stopping payments for things like mortgages and utilities, so families aren’t seeing an outflow of cash at the same time. She said Congress should mail checks out to everyone immediately and then “tax it back” from richer people who didn’t need them. That way, lawmakers can act fast instead of figuring out a complicated system in the middle of the crisis.

"SAN DIEGO (AP) - One by one, asylum-seekers from El Salvador and Honduras who are waiting in Mexico for court hearings in the United States appeared before Judge Lee O’Connor to explain why, after months of effort, they couldn’t find an attorney. One man said he repeatedly tried names on a list of free or low-cost attorneys that U.S. Customs and Border Protection provides. No one answered, and he began looking for attorneys in Tijuana, who struck him as dishonest. The judge warned that Mexican attorneys may not be licensed to practice in the U.S. Through sobs, a Salvadoran woman with three children said phone calls “rang and rang and rang and nothing happened.” She said no one responded to a voicemail and she once heard nothing but music. “Our law is very complicated,” O’Connor told her in November before offering her a third extension to try to track down an attorney. “Immigration law is considered one of the most complicated areas of the law there is. … Even lawyers struggle.” Such courtroom exchanges are common under the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” policy, which forces asylum-seekers to wait across the southern border in often dangerous cities as their cases wind through backlogged immigration courts. The policy, which has been applied to about 60,000 people, has become a key plank of U.S. border enforcement. The Supreme Court ruled this month that it could stay in effect during a legal challenge. Only 5.3% of asylum-seekers subject to the Migrant Protection Protocols, as the policy is officially known, had lawyers through the end of January, compared with 85% for asylum-seekers nationwide, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.  The scarcity of attorneys helps explain why only 4% of Remain in Mexico decisions resulted in asylum, while the nationwide grant rate was 29% during the 2019 fiscal year. The coronavirus presents more hurdles as lawyers contend with potential exposure in small courtrooms and a ban on nonessential travel to Mexico for least 30 days. The Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review has closed many courts but continued with Remain in Mexico hearings. Hearings in San Diego were canceled without explanation Friday, hours after California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered 40 million residents to stay home indefinitely, but the court remained open. The San Diego judges postponed hearings through next Friday due to the coronavirus, said Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, which has called for a complete shutdown. She didn’t know if judges in other border courts canceled hearings. The courts, asked about the cancellations, said in a statement that it doesn’t comment on whether judges violate law or policy or deny rights to those “seeking to have their day in court.”  Before the virus struck, The Associated Press contacted all 21 attorney’s offices on U.S. government lists of free and low-cost providers in courts that handle Remain in Mexico cases and found only two have taken on a large load. Jewish Family Service of San Diego has represented 68 people and Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, has taken 76 cases.  Some legal aid groups on the lists have taken a small number of cases, and a few offer free “know your rights” talks. Jewish Family Service suspended those talks held inside San Diego courtrooms due to the pandemic and prohibited staff from going to Mexico.  To make the list, an office must commit to 50 hours of free service a year. The Justice Department, which vets applicants, lists seven in San Antonio, six in El Paso, five in San Diego and three in Harlingen, Texas. Asylum-seekers who are sent back to Mexico and given hearing dates at a tent court in Laredo, Texas, get the list for San Antonio, more than two hours’ drive away. None of the seven legal organizations there take Remain in Mexico cases, but they stay on the list to avoid being cut off from other clients. Phones ring regularly with pleas from asylum-seekers. Employees sift through hundreds of calls and messages. Their families in the U.S. spend hours calling and following up. “It’s a waste of everyone’s time,” said Erica Schommer of the St. Mary’s University School of Law Immigration and Human Rights Clinic, one of the San Antonio providers. “I feel worse for the people who are calling here to have their case placed.” Asylum-seekers are entitled to hire attorneys but, unlike criminal court, the government won’t pay for anyone who can’t afford it. A private attorney typically charges around $7,000. For attorneys, meeting clients in Mexico is a huge commitment. O’Connor, the San Diego judge, quizzed an attorney on how long she waited in her car to cross back to the U.S. after a client visit, marveling that it took two hours. El Paso attorney Taylor Levy, who takes limited cases referred by Mexican migrant shelters, said she rushed to Ciudad Juarez to help a client who just escaped kidnappers. U.S. authorities allowed the client to remain in the U.S. but they spent more than three hours in line on the Mexican side of a border bridge while the woman’s kidnappers sent her text messages, threatening to pursue her. There are a host of other obstacles, from lack of malpractice insurance in Mexico to safety concerns. Some asylum-seekers don’t have phones and move often. Jewish Family Service of San Diego, which fields 20 to 30 calls a week from Remain in Mexico asylum-seekers, requires employees to go to Tijuana in pairs for safety. Finding a safe place to meet can be challenging. Kate Clark, the group’s senior director of immigration services, once went to a Tijuana shelter to meet four families who were clients and found many more demanding to know why she couldn’t represent them.  “It’s difficult because you’re most likely going to have to say no,” she said.  Fatigue is also a factor. A U.N. survey taken last fall of around 650 asylum-seekers waiting in Mexico found 6% reported being kidnapped. Reports of migrants being raped or assaulted are common.  “I’ve had a lot of lawyers tell me they will not take these cases anymore because they’re gut-wrenching,” Levy said.  A group of Homeland Security officials last November made improved access to attorneys one of its recommendations to address the policy’s shortcomings. Asked last month for an update, acting Secretary Chad Wolf told lawmakers that authorities began showing a “know your rights” video on immigration law. Rep. Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat, told him she watched the video on a small television at a Laredo, Texas, holding facility over fans “so loud that it was very difficult to hear or understand.” Wolf promised to look into it.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday said states are “savaging” other states and those in need face rampant price gouging as they scramble to find medical gear to combat the coronavirus. The Democrat said the federal government ought to intervene by using the Defense Production Act immediately. The 1950 law empowers the president to order up production from the private sector. Mr. Cuomo said the president should direct apparel companies to make gowns. Other companies could make masks or ventilators. “I think it is appropriate. If I had the power, I would do it in New York,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Because the situation is that critical.” He said the ability to get equipment will be the difference between “life and death.” President Trump took preliminarily measures to invoke war-scale production but hasn’t compelled any firms to produce materials. He says many are coming forward voluntarily, including automakers who will attempt to make ventilators. Many governors and mayors would like Mr. Trump to be more forceful, saying their hospitals face a critical shortfall in personal protective equipment. The Trump administration has been discussing the use of the act for weeks. “We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary to enable that our contracts go to the front of the line on contracting. So that is an authority that we have, and we intend to use it to acquire anything that we need to acquire,” Health Secretary Alex Azar told reporters Feb. 28. “We won’t use it unnecessarily, of course. We don’t want to be disruptive if that’s not needed. But if we need to, we will use it.  We won’t hesitate.”      ",Cuomo: Trump should use Defense Production Act immediately,"Sunday, March 22, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/22/cuomo-trump-should-use-defense-production-act-imme/,washington_times
"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s supreme leader refused U.S. assistance Sunday to fight the new coronavirus, citing an unfounded conspiracy theory that the virus could be man-made by America. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s comments come as Iran faces crushing U.S. sanctions blocking the country from selling its crude oil and accessing international financial markets. But while Iranian civilian officials in recent days have increasingly criticized those sanctions, 80-year-old Khamenei instead chose to traffic in the same conspiracy theory increasingly used by Chinese officials about the new virus to deflect blame for the pandemic. “I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?” Khamenei said. “Possibly your medicine is a way to spread the virus more.” He also alleged without offering any evidence that the virus “is specifically built for Iran using the genetic data of Iranians which they have obtained through different means.” “You might send people as doctors and therapists, maybe they would want to come here and see the effect of the poison they have produced in person,” he said. There is no scientific proof offered anywhere in the world to support Khamenei’s comments. However, his comments come after Chinese government spokesman Lijian Zhao tweeted earlier this month that it “might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe(s) us an explanation!” Lijian likewise offered no evidence to support his claim, which saw the U.S. State Department summon China’s ambassador to complain. Wuhan is the Chinese city where the first cases of the disease were detected in December. In recent days, the Trump administration has increasingly referred to the virus as the “Chinese” or “Wuhan” virus, while the World Health Organization used the term COVID-19 to describe the illness the virus causes. Even a U.S. senator from Arkansas has trafficked in the unfounded conspiracy theory it was a man-made Chinese bioweapon. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. Scientists have not yet determined exactly how the new coronavirus first infected people. Evidence suggests it originated in bats, which infected another animal that spread it to people at a market in Wuhan. The now-shuttered Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market advertised dozens of species such as giant salamanders, baby crocodiles and raccoon dogs that were often referred to as wildlife, even when they were farmed. An article published last week in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Medicine similarly said it was “improbable” that the virus “emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus.” Khamenei made the comments in a speech in Tehran broadcast live Sunday across Iran marking Nowruz, the Persian New Year. He had called off his usual speech at Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad over the virus outbreak. His comments come as Iran has over 21,600 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus amid 1,685 reported deaths, according to government figures released Sunday. Iran is one of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the new virus. Across the Mideast, Iran represents eight of 10 cases of the virus and those leaving the Islamic Republic have carried the virus to other countries. Iranian officials have criticized U.S. offers of aid during the virus crisis as being disingenuous. They have accused the Trump administration of wanting to capitalize on its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since withdrawing from the nuclear deal in May 2018. However, the U.S. has directly offered the Islamic Republic aid in the past despite decades of enmity, like during the devastating Bam earthquake of 2003. Reassigning blame could be helpful to Iran’s government, which faced widespread public anger after denying for days it shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, killing 176 people. Widespread economic problems as well has seen mass demonstrations in recent years that saw hundreds reportedly killed. Iranian hard-liners have supported conspiracy theories in the past when it suited their interests. Following the Sept. 11 attacks, some publicly doubted al-Qaida’s role and state TV promoting the unfounded conspiracy theory that the Americans blew up the building themselves. Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad similarly raised doubt about the Sept. 11 attack, calling it a “big lie,” while also describing the Holocaust as a “myth.” Meanwhile on Sunday, Iran imposed a two-week closure on major shopping malls and centers across the country to prevent spreading the virus. Pharmacies, supermarkets, groceries and bakeries will remain open. In Saudi Arabia, the kingdom said its armed forces are now taking part in combating the virus, setting up mobile hospitals in various cities. And in Kuwait, authorities have instituted a nightly curfew from 5 p.m. to 4 a.m., warning violators face up to three years in prison and fines of $32,000 if arrested and convicted. ___ Associated Press writer Aya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 307,200 people and killed more than 13,000. The COVID-19 illness causes mild or moderate symptoms in most people, but severe symptoms are more likely in the elderly or those with existing health problems. More than 92,000 people have recovered so far, mostly in China.  TOP OF THE HOUR: - Fauci insists he has no disagreement with Trump over potential drug to treat virus.  - North Macedonia has announced the first death from the COVID-19 virus. - Greece to go into lockdown Monday morning.  ___ WASHINGTON - The government’s top infectious disease expert insists he has no disagreement with President Donald Trump over whether a drug to treat COVID-19 is actually at hand. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tells CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Trump had heard anecdotal reports that a malaria drug could be used for the coronavirus and so was expressing the hope “that if they might work, let’s try and push their usage.” Last week, Trump asserted that tests had provided evidence the drug is useful for COVID-19, a statement Fauci contradicted during televised White House briefings. Trump also falsely suggested that the FDA had just cleared the drug specifically for the viral pandemic, when it had not. On Sunday, Fauci explained that Trump’s views reflected a layperson who was “trying to bring hope to the people” whereas his own job is to “prove definitively from a scientific job that they do work.” ___ SKOPJE, North Macedonia - North Macedonia has announced the first death from the COVID-19 virus. Health minister Venko Filipce said Sunday the victim was a 57- year old woman from the town of Kumanovo. Her health deteriorated rapidly at the hospital, but cause of death was only determined after. Filipce did not specify when the woman died. Filipce said 29 people have tested positive on virus over the past 24 hours, all but seven from the capital Skopje. This brings the number of confirmed cases to 114. North Macedonia has imposed a 9 pm curfew that begins Sunday night. Two regions in the west of the country, near the border with Albania, have been sealed off for 30 days. More then 7,600 people are quarantined. ___ ATHENS, Greece - Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced a lockdown, starting at 6 a.m. Monday. All citizens and residents must stay at home or risk a fine. There are specific exemptions to the lockdown such as going to work, visiting a doctor, shopping, exercise and walking the dog. Everyone must carry an ID or passport with them. Also, people returning to their permanent place of residence are exempt from the measure as they travel. Other government officials will specify the measures and their enforcement. Mitsotakis thanked “the vast majority of citizens” who followed the quarantine instructions when it was first imposed more than a week ago, and blamed the “frivolous, flippant” few who “put everyone in danger” by defying the instructions.  Earlier Sunday, government spokesman Stelios Petsas had chastised those “who have interpreted the quarantine as a holiday season” by crowding public spaces or leaving the capital Athens en masse for the countryside, taking advantage of the mild weather. ___ WASHINGTON - The government’s top infectious disease expert says he remains hopeful the U.S. is not on the same trajectory as Italy in the coronavirus struggle. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says the stringent measures being put in place in the U.S. including travel restrictions, the closing of schools and many businesses and other social distancing will go “a long way” to prevent the U.S. from becoming like Italy. Italy has seen over 50,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 5,000 deaths. Fauci tells CBS’ “Face the Nation” that it’s hard to know exactly why Italy is “suffering so terribly” but that they did not appear to shut out as well the input of infections originating from China and other parts of the world. He says the U.S. is “going to be hit, no doubt about it,” but it appears to be in a better position because “we have from the beginning put a kind of clamper” on the virus. ___ SAARLAND, Germany - Germany’s small western state of Saarland became the third to offer medical help to neighboring France, which is struggling with a surge in coronavirus patients. Gov. Tobias Hans said his state would use available hospital beds with ventilators to treat severely ill patients from France’s Grand-Est region. Public broadcaster SR quoted Hans on Sunday saying that “we will only win the battle again the virus together.” Saarland came under French control after World War II but was returned to West Germany in 1957 following a referendum. Germany’s southwestern states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Wuerttemberg, which also border France, have already offered spare hospitals beds to treat French patients. ___ WASHINGTON - Illinois’ governor says his state is not receiving enough medical supplies.  Gov. Jay Pritzker tells CNN’s “State of The Union” that they got a recent supply but it was a fraction of what was requested. He says they’re buying supplies from the open market and competing with other states also in need of supplies.  He said it’s a bad system.  Pritzker is hopeful that now that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is in charge of response he is hopefully it will improve. He says that FEMA is more prepared to manage the crisis than other federal agencies.  Pritzker ordered all 12.7 million people in Illinois to stay at home starting Saturday evening, and said he wished there would be stay-at-home orders nationwide.  He says unless leaders tell citizens to stay home, they just won’t. ___ WASHINGTON - Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf says illegal border crossings have dropped by 50% after restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic.  The Trump administration is turning back anyone crossing illegally, among other restrictions.  Wolf says because migrants often come without identification paperwork it’s unclear how to trace their medical history and to determine if they are arriving from an area hard-hit by the virus.  But the Trump administration has also made restriction immigration a top priority, regardless of the pandemic and had already been sending thousands of asylum seekers back to Mexico to wait out their cases. The nation’s immigration courts are still operating with limited closures and some hearings delayed.  Wolf said on Fox News “Sunday Morning Futures” that the borders between the U.S. and Mexico and U.S. and Canada are not shut down, but are only allowing for necessary trade and travel.  He says there’s more than $2 billion combined trade at both borders and it’s important to keep that going. But he says anyone coming for tourism should stay home.  ___ MADRID - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez says he plans to extend the national state of emergency that includes strict measures to combat the coronavirus.  It means the countrywide lockdown will last at least one month.  Spain is finishing its first week of what was initially a 15-day state of emergency that imposes stay-at-home restrictions and store closings. But with infections and deaths continuing to rise, Sánchez has decided not to wait to extend the lockdown.  To do so, his government will ask the Parliament for its necessary approval on Tuesday.  Spain, the hardest hit country after China and Italy, has 28,572 infections and 1,720 deaths. ___ STOCKHOLM - The city of Stockholm says it has teamed up with the Swedish military to build a make-shift hospital inside a large fair and convention center south of the Swedish capital to accommodate a rapidly growing number of coronavirus patients. Stockholm region officials said the building of the facility will start immediately in co-operation with the Swedish Armed Forces. It will include an intensive care unit.  Stockholm had 661 confirmed cases and seven deaths by Sunday. Nationwide, Sweden has seen a large hike in coronavirus cases in the past week with 1,747 cases and 20 deaths confirmed in the country Sunday. ___ WASHINGTON - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he expects Congress and the White House to reach full agreement later Sunday on an economic stimulus package that could approach $2 trillion to address the coronavirus crisis.  The package would include $3,000 checks to families and other aid to last the next 10 weeks. Mnuchin tells “Fox News Sunday” that there is a “fundamental understanding” reached with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders to provide significant aid.  He says the deal includes federal loans to small businesses so they can retain their workers; cash payments averaging $3,000 for a family of four as well as “enhanced” unemployment insurance. The package also will allow the Federal Reserve to leverage up to $4 trillion of liquidity to support the nation’s economy, while hospitals will get “approximately” $110 billion to address a crush of people infected with the virus. Mnuchin says President Donald Trump has “every expectation” the aid package will help workers and the economy improve “four or eight weeks from now,” but if the virus is still raging after 10 weeks, “we’ll go back to Congress again.” Mnuchin says he expects a Senate vote on the deal on Monday morning. ___ WASHINGTON - Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says her state needs the federal government to provide not only more test kits and masks but also clear guidance on how best to fight the spread of the coronavirus. Speaking Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Whitmer said her state and others are doing the best they can, “but it would be nice to have a national strategy.” As it is, she said the states are “all building the airplane as we fly it.” She criticized the federal government for not focusing on the threat much earlier. She also said she didn’t want to belabor the point because she needs to be able to work with the federal government. She said she doesn’t want to fight with the White House, but says a point will come in which failures will need to be examined.  ___ LONDON - Authorities in Britain’s remotest regions say an influx of people trying to get away from crowded urban areas is putting local lives at risk. Scottish authorities told people heading to the sparsely populated Highlands to stay at holiday homes or in camper vans to go home. The Road to The Isles group, which represents tourism businesses in part of the scenic region, said its area had an aging population and just one ambulance, with the nearest hospital 100 miles (160 kms) away. Chairwoman Sine MacKellaig-Davis urged people “to stay home, care for loved ones and, as soon as it’s safe to do so, the Road to the Isles and its communities and businesses will welcome you.” Judy Murray, mother of tennis star Andy Murrray, had a blunter message. She tweeted “Message for those relocating to the countryside” above a picture of a car and trailer with “Go home idiots” and “Covid-19” painted on the side. ___ PRAGUE - The Czech Foreign Ministry is sending a military plane to the Baltics and secured deals with commercial airlines to take home stranded Czech nationals in Egypt, Philippines and Vietnam. Various restrictive measures on movement adopted by the governments around the globe due to the outbreak of the coronavirus have made it difficult for many to return. Altogether some 600 Czechs should return by those flights, plus 100 people from other EU countries who were offered seats. The government have already been sending buses for the Czechs stranded at the airports in Munich, Frankfurt and Berlin in Germany as well Vienna in Austria. ___ WASHINGTON - Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey says his state is desperate for more face masks and other personal protective equipment and is not getting nearly what it needs from the federal government. Murphy said, “We’ve had a big ask into the strategic stockpile in the White House. They’ve given us a fraction of our ask.” New Jersey is now fourth in the country in terms of the number of positive cases, which the governor says hit more than 1,300 on Saturday with 16 fatalities. He also cited an urgent need for direct financial assistance from the federal government to help workers and small business. He said, “We think New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut alone, those four states, need $100 billion, direct cash assistance, to allow us to continue the fight.” Murphy spoke Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” ___ DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Long-haul carrier Emirates says it will suspend all passenger flights beginning Wednesday over the coronavirus outbreak. The decision is a major one for the Dubai-based, government-owned airline built on linking the East to the West. A statement from the carrier quoted Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, its chairman and CEO, as saying: “The world has literally gone into quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak. This is an unprecedented crisis situation in terms of breadth and scale: geographically, as well as from a health, social, and economic standpoint.” ___ COLOMBO, Sri Lanka - Sri Lanka has indefinitely extend the closure of the arrival terminal at it’s main international airport to prevent imported cases of the coronavirus.  The Indian ocean island nation stepped up efforts to contain the spreading of virus as the number of positive cases has now risen to 82. Early this week, the government suspended arrival flights until March 25. On Sunday, the government announced that the restrictions of arrival flights “will continue until the country returns to normalcy.” However, the airport’s departure terminal will continue to be operational and flights are allowed into the country to take departing passengers.  ___ NEW YORK - New York City’s mayor is telling New Yorkers at the epicenter of the U.S. pandemic that it’s only going to get worse. Mayor Bill de Blasio said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that his city is in desperate need of ventilators and other medical supplies and staff. He also lambasted the White House response as non-responsive.  He says he’s asked “repeatedly” for the U.S. military to mobilize, and has heard nothing. The Mayor said the actions taken by American citizens are “much farther ahead than anything we’ve seen out of the White House.”  ___ LONDON - British doctors and nurses are making urgent pleas for more protective equipment as the number of coronavirus patients in U.K. hospitals soars. Almost 4,000 medical workers signed a letter to the Sunday Times saying front-line staff felt like “cannon fodder.” They warned that medics would die if they did not receive better equipment. The letter said that intensive-care doctors and anaesthetists “have been carrying out the highest-risk procedure, putting a patient on a ventilator, with masks that expired in 2015.” Britain’s coronavirus outbreak is not expected to peak for weeks, and already staff at some hospitals have complained about shortages of ventilators and protective equipment like face masks, safety glasses, gloves and protective suits. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said that hospitals would receive new stocks of protective equipment by Sunday afternoon.  The government has also ordered thousands of ventilators and has struck a deal with private hospitals to use thousands of beds and 20,000 medical staff to treat coronavirus patients. ___ ISLAMABAD - Pakistan’s top health official has revised the country’s number of confirmed coronavirus cases to 646 cases. That’s down from the more than 700 confirmed cases reported a day earlier.  Zafar Mirza, the special assistant to prime minister Imran Khan, said the figures he was presenting came from all provincial health authorities. He said the total suspected cases are 5650.  Out of the confirmed cases, 292 tested positive in southern Sindh province, 152 in Punjab, 104 in Baluchistan, 31 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 55 in Gilgit Baltistan, 11 in Islamabad and one in Pakistan controled Kashmir.  ___ PRAGUE - The Czech government is sending to Italy about 100,000 face masks and respirators that were among hundreds of thousands seized in the country earlier this week. Czech authorities used emergency powers to raid a warehouse and seize 680,000 masks and 28,000 respirators on Tuesday. The state was negotiating to acquire those badly needed masks and respirators with a private company but before reaching a deal the price significantly increased, prompting the seizure. Interior Minister Jan Hamacek later acknowledged it turned out that 101,600 of the protective gear were sent by China’s Red Cross to fellow Chinese nationals living in Italy and apologized for the Czech move. Czech police are investigating how those masks from China ended up in a warehouse located in northwestern town of Lovosice. Czech Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek said on Sunday he would explain the situation to his Italian counterpart and the masks will be transported to Italy early next week. ___ CRAIOVA, Romania - Romania has reported its first death due to the coronavirus.  Authorities said Sunday the victim was a 67-year-old man with terminal cancer who returned March 6 from France, where he had been receiving treatment.  The man died while in the intensive care unit of a hospital for infectious diseases in the southwestern city of Craiova. Romania has 367 confirmed cases of people infected with the coronavirus. The country will close its borders to foreigners Sunday night and curfews will be enforced. ___ WARSAW, Poland - A hospital in Poland has been sealed off and a quarantine ordered for all patients and employees after a 38-year-old patient tested positive for the coronavirus.  Nearly 70 people are now quarantined in Provincial Hospital of Lung Diseases and Tuberculosis in Wolica, near the central Polish city of Kalisz.  No one can leave the hospital until further notice and no one can enter. The patient with COVID-19 has been transported to another hospital in severe condition. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Sen. Rand Paul has tested positive for the coronavirus, his office said Sunday. The senator is feeling fine and in quarantine, spokesman Sergio Gor said. Mr. Paul isn’t showing symptoms but was tested “out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events.” “He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person,” Mr. Gor said. “He expects to be back in the Senate after his quarantine period ends and will continue to work for the people of Kentucky at this difficult time. Ten days ago, our D.C. office began operating remotely, hence virtually no staff has had contact with Senator Rand Paul.” Mr. Paul was the only senator to vote against an $8 billion coronavirus bill earlier this month after colleagues rejected his bid to pay for the measure by cutting foreign aid. Two House members, Reps. Ben McAdams of Utah and Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, have tested positive. President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence received tests but they came back negative.

"DETROIT — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Sunday that Michigan needs the federal government to provide not only more test kits and masks but also clear guidance on how best to fight the spread of the coronavirus. “We’re all building the airplane as we fly it right now. We’re doing the best that we can. We’re going to continue to be aggressive and we’re continually monitoring what the next move we can make is,” she said on ABC’s “This Week.” “Frankly a patchwork strategy of each state doing what they can is - we’re going to do it if we have to but it would be nice to have a national strategy.” She said she doesn’t want to fight with the White House, but said a point will come in which failures will need to be examined. Michigan has reported 787 cases in total of COVID-19. Eight people have died. Whitmer has also signed an executive order that closes “non-essential personal care services” for three weeks. The services include nail and hair salons, tattoo and piercing shops, and spas, as well as other services that “require individuals to be within 6 feet of each other.” The order goes into effect Sunday and runs through April 13. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. • The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Senate Democrats and environmentalists want to tack climate-change mandates onto proposed federal aid to major airlines and cruise lines reeling from the novel coronavirus outbreak. In a letter to the House and Senate leadership, eight Senate Democrats said that any financial assistance to the travel industry “should be paired with requirements that companies act in a more responsible fashion” by reducing their carbon footprint. “If we given the airline and cruise industries assistance without requiring them to be better environmental stewards, we would miss a major opportunity to combat climate change and ocean dumping,” said the Wednesday letter. At the same time, more than 200 environmental and wildlife groups urged Congress to place a cap on greenhouse gases from U.S. air fleets, which would require the industry to reduce emissions by 20% per decade from 2020 levels. “Climate change damages will wreak havoc on a scale even greater than the coronavirus,” said the Friday letter headed by the Center for Biological Diversity. “It is time to stop repeating the mistakes of the past and ensure that any bailout of the aviation industry puts it on a path to address its threat to our climate, workers and communities.” We’re trying! It is possible to accomplish two goals at once, even in Congress. https://t.co/hLsuy5tPYH Which is really strange because everyone is with them on this https://t.co/90qnsbulY6 pic.twitter.com/hIcd0G41FX The U.S. airline industry is pushing for $50 billion in financial assistance—about half in zero-interest loan guarantees, half in cash grants—as air travel nosedives in reaction to COVID-19, while the Senate GOP package as introduced includes loans but not grants. The risk for Democrats lies with the optics of holding up critically needed aid over climate concerns. United Airlines and its unions warned Friday that layoffs would be necessary to account for next month’s anticipated 60% drop in planned flights without federal help. Climate Depot’s Marc Morano blasted the effort to insert climate change into the pandemic response, saying that the “last thing U.S. businesses or the economy need are more punishing climate-based mandates to satisfy the Democrat Party base.” “Democrats know that they should never let a crisis go to waste,” said Mr. Morano, author of “The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change.” “They are pouncing on any opportunity to inject climate into the Covid-19 issue. Trying to make sure that any federal stimulus bills include going in the ‘right direction toward decarbonization’ is not the way to proceed.” Climate-change activists have increasingly targeted greenhouse gas emissions from airplane travel, engaging in “flight shaming” to discourage frequent flyers, a phenomenon has wound up embarrassing Green New Deal advocates like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren over their private-jet travel. In their letter, the Democrats said that airline travel accounts for 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions, a figure expected to triple by 2050, while cruise ships “burn heavy fuel oil, one of the dirtiest fuels.” “Business leaders are themselves increasingly recognizing that their companies must make positive contributions to society or risk losing their social license,” said the letter. “This is particularly true when companies ask American taxpayers for financial assistance.” The industry group Airlines for America said on its website that U.S. planes improved their efficiency between 1978 and 2018 by 130%, resulting in nearly five billion metric tons of “carbon dioxide savings,” while carriers continue to invest in alternative fuels. The Democrats who signed the letter were Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island; Martin Heinrich of New Mexico; Jeffrey Merkley of Oregon; Cory Booker of New Jersey; Edward Markey of Massachusetts; Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut; Tina Smith of Minnesota, and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.

"The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is calling on President Trump to take “extraordinary measures” to help American citizens abroad who are struggling to find flights back to the U.S. amid the global coronavirus outbreak. In a letter to Mr. Trump Sunday, Sen. Bob Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, called for the administration to take “all necessary steps” to provide travel assistance to tens of thousands of Americans around the world trying to return home. “No American should ever have to worry that they might be abandoned abroad by our government … we must provide Americans overseas the support that they need,” Mr. Menendez wrote, pointing to the rapidly increasing number of cancelled commercial flights into the U.S. and new measures to close borders. Mr. Menendez suggested the Pentagon “explore” making military aircraft available to evacuate stranded American citizens and called on Mr. Trump to authorize the use of the Civil Reserve Airfleet (CRAF) to charter commercial flights for this purpose. “At a time when U.S. commercial carriers are seeking unprecedented financial assistance from U.S. taxpayers — and while much of the airline fleet is otherwise idle — we would expect that U.S. airlines, including those participating in the CRAF program, will be willing and able to step into the breach and work with the Department of State to provide the necessary support to bring American citizens home,” Mr. Menendez wrote. The letter comes just days after the State Department issued its highest travel advisory — level 4 — warning Americans not to travel internationally amid the health pandemic. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday said his department is working with the Pentagon and commercial and private airlines to fly U.S. citizens to an undisclosed destination in the U.S., while other Americans could find themselves flying back on a Defense Department flight “where there is space available.” A handful of lawmakers have raised “serious concerns” in recent days about Americans abroad who are struggling to return after U.S. citizens in Honduras, Morocco, Peru and Tunisia reported difficulties booking flights or obtaining support from American embassies and consulates.

"BERLIN — German Chancellor Angela Merkel has gone into quarantine after being informed that a doctor who administered a vaccine to her has tested positive for the new coronavirus. Merkel’s spokesman said the German chancellor was informed about the doctor’s test shortly after holding a news conference Sunday announcing new measures to curb the spread of the virus. Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said Merkel had received a precautionary vaccine Friday against pneumococcal infection. Seibert said in a statement that Merkel, 65, would undergo “regular tests” in the coming days and continue with her work from home for the time being.

"Anthony Fauci, the main scientist in the U.S. coronavirus response, says combining a malaria drug with certain antibiotics shows “anecdotal” promise for COVID-19 patients and that his push for more proof doesn’t mean he is clashing with President Trump. “I think there’s this issue of trying to separate the two of us. There isn’t fundamentally a difference there,” Dr. Fauci, the director of the told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “He’s coming at it from a hope-layperson standpoint. I’m coming at it from a scientific standpoint.” Mr. Trump last week said he directed the Food and Drug Administration to speed the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine —  a well-established antimalarial drug — and azithromycin antibiotics to treat coronavirus patients, citing studies that suggest it can help. The president said it might be a “game-changer.” Dr. Fauci sounded a bit hesitant from the White House podium. He said the medical world must conduct clinical trials to ensure the combo is safe and effective — a process that can take months — but that he’s not trying to pick a fight with the president. “I’m not disagreeing with the fact, anecdotally, they might work,” Dr. Fauci told CBS. “But my job is to prove definitely from a scientific standpoint that they do work.” Mr. Trump got a boost from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who on Sunday said he wants to see if the drug combination is effective. His state has seen the most coronavirus cases in the U.S. He said New York will begin a trial of (hydroxy)chloroquine and azithromycin on Tuesday.

"DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) - Syrian President Bashar Assad granted amnesty and reduced sentences for all crimes committed before Sunday, while also offering amnesty to military deserters who turn themselves in within the next few months. Similar amnesties have been issued on several occasions, most recently in September of last year. The decree did not say whether freeing prisoners was part of an attempt to halt the spread of the new coronavirus inside Syria’s jails. Syria is the only country in the Middle East that has reported zero coronavirus cases so far, although strict measures have been taken across the war-torn country to prevent the spread of the virus, including the closure of restaurants and cafes. Iran, one of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the new virus, released 85,000 prisoners last week on temporary leave. The move was apparently an effort to keep the virus from spreading through Iran’s prisons. Iran has been a strong ally of Assad during Syria’s nine-year civil war. The conflict in Syria has killed more than 400,000 people and displaced half the country’s population. Opposition activists say tens of thousands of anti-government activists are held in jails around the country. Sunday’s decree granted amnesty to several crimes that weren’t included in previous amnesties.However, the decree did not name which specific crimes were covered, instead referring to them by their number in Syrian criminal law. A government adviser, Abdul-Qader Azouz, later said the amnesty covered crimes committed since the war began in 2011, such as anti-government activity online and some acts of terrorism. Death penalties would be replaced by life sentences with hard labor, while those serving life sentences would serve 20 years with hard labor, according to the decree. Juvenile prisoners would see their sentences cut in half. Prisoners suffering from incurable diseases and those over 70 years of age as of Sunday were to be freed. Army deserters inside the country would receive amnesty if they surrender within three months, while those outside the country have six months to surrender, the decree said. The amnesty did not include prisoners convicted of weapons smuggling or drug dealing.

Rand Paul of Kentucky is the first U.S. senator to test positive for COVID-19, the infection caused by the coronavirus.  That’s according to a tweet from the senator, who is a top ally of President Donald Trump.  The senator is “feeling fine,” the tweet said. He is “asymptomatic,” and in quarantine.  He was not aware “of any direct contact with any infected person,” the tweet said.

The head of Italy’s Civil Protection Agency, Angelo Borrelli, noted that the increases had narrowed from recent days, adding ‘’we hope that this trend can be confirmed in the coming days. We should not lower our guard.’’  ___ BOGOTA, Colombia - Authorities in Colombia say 23 prisoners died and another 83 were injured in a riot and attempted escape over poor conditions inmates argue will spread the coronavirus. The violence happened overnight at the La Modelo jail in Bogota, where all of the deaths occurred, along with several other penitentiaries. Officials said seven workers were injured, two of them in critical condition. Relatives gathered outside the jail Sunday wearing masks and clamoring for information. Videos shared by inmates online showed fires inside several jails, prisoners outside their cells and inmates complaining of conditions. Colombia has confirmed 231 coronavirus cases. Authorities say none are in jails. ___ ISTANBUL - Turkish Airlines will halt all international flights except for five destinations starting Friday.  The airline’s chief executive officer Bilal Eksi tweeted flights would continue to Hong Kong, Moscow, Addis Ababa, New York and Washington, D.C. All other international passenger flights would be suspended from March 27 to April 17.  Turkey already suspended flights to 68 countries as part of Ankara’s efforts to contain the coronavirus. Eksi said domestic flights would continue but decrease in number. Cargo flights are also to continue. ___ OKLAHOMA CITY - A second person in Oklahoma has died of COVID-19 as the number of state residents with the illness caused by the coronavirus increased by more than a dozen.  The man who died was in his 50s and lived in Pawnee County, west of Tulsa. The Oklahoma State Department of Health did not provide further details on the circumstances of his illness and death. The number of people in the state who have tested positive for the virus increased to 67 Sunday, from 53 the day before. The health department said 11 of those people are hospitalized.  Oklahoma County has the most cases, with 26, following by Cleveland County, with 13, and Tulsa County, with six. ___ WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is lashing out at governors and other lawmakers who have been critical about the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Trump tweeted on Sunday that they should not be “blaming the federal government for their own shortcomings.”  He added: “We are there to back you up should you fail, and always will be!”   Democratic lawmakers such as Illinois’ governor and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio were on various TV news shows Sunday saying they had to fight with states over medical resources and questioned why Trump hasn’t yet made military resources available despite triggering the Defense Production Act late last week.   Trump has said repeatedly his administration is not to blame for the growing pandemic including a lack of resources for medical teams. ___ PARIS - France’s health minister has said the country reached a grim milestone – the first hospital doctor to have died of the coronavirus. Oliver Veran said Sunday he had learned of the death of the unnamed 68-year-old emergency doctor from Compiegne in Oise the day before and “shared the pain of the family.” It is, he said, “to my knowledge… the first case that struck a hospital doctor.” In the Le Parisien newspaper, the doctor’s son said his father’s illness hit suddenly, saying the family is “sad and angry.” He added: “He came back very tired after being on duty. He quickly fell ill, no longer ate, had no taste in spite of being of a bon vivant. Despite everything — knowing he was sick, he wanted to go back to work.” ___ ATHENS, Greece - Greece has reported an additional two fatalities from the COVID-19 virus.  That brings the total to 15. Also, 94 new cases were confirmed on Sunday, bringing the total to 624. Of those, 124 are hospitalized and 34 people are in intensive care. ___ WASHINGTON - Immigrant advocates have filed a federal lawsuit demanding that family detention centers release immigrants because of an eminent risk of a coronavirus outbreak.  Lawyers filed the lawsuit in the District of Columbia on Saturday. They say the country’s three detention centers where families are held: Berks in Pennsylvania, Karnes and Dilley in Texas, have failed to take adequate measures to protect families from COVID-19.  They say there is no justification for risking their health and safety.  Immigration enforcement has a wide latitude on when to release people detained. Earlier this year, Homeland Security officials said they would detain families as long as possible in an effort to discourage migrants from crossing the border.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said officers are taking precautions to avoid an outbreak in detention facilities. ___ ISLAMABAD - A young doctor who was infected with the coronavirus in northern Pakistan while screening pilgrims returned from Iran into Gilgit Baltistan has died.   Rashid Arshad, spokesman for chief minister of Gilgit Baltistan, said Dr Osama Riaz dead was removed from a ventilator after two days with the consent of his family.   Riaz was admitted to Gilgit’s main hospital in critical condition after he passed out Friday. He was treating suspected COVID-19 cases with proper safety gear but they were short in supply in the far mountainous terrain.  Riaz joined the hospital as medical officer after passing first stage of fellowship in medicine. With Riaz’s death number of dead due to COVID-19 in Pakistan is now four. ___ WASHINGTON - The government’s top infectious disease expert insists he has no disagreement with President Donald Trump over whether a drug to treat COVID-19 is actually at hand. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tells CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Trump had heard anecdotal reports that a malaria drug could be used for the coronavirus and so was expressing the hope “that if they might work, let’s try and push their usage.” Last week, Trump asserted that tests had provided evidence the drug is useful for COVID-19, a statement Fauci contradicted during televised White House briefings. Trump also falsely suggested that the FDA had just cleared the drug specifically for the viral pandemic, when it had not. On Sunday, Fauci explained that Trump’s views reflected a layperson who was “trying to bring hope to the people” whereas his own job is to “prove definitively from a scientific job that they do work.” ___ SKOPJE, North Macedonia - North Macedonia has announced the first death from the COVID-19 virus. Health minister Venko Filipce said Sunday the victim was a 57- year old woman from the town of Kumanovo. Her health deteriorated rapidly at the hospital, but cause of death was only determined after. Filipce did not specify when the woman died. Filipce said 29 people have tested positive on virus over the past 24 hours, all but seven from the capital Skopje. This brings the number of confirmed cases to 114. North Macedonia has imposed a 9 pm curfew that begins Sunday night. Two regions in the west of the country, near the border with Albania, have been sealed off for 30 days. More then 7,600 people are quarantined. ___ ATHENS, Greece - Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced a lockdown, starting at 6 a.m. Monday. All citizens and residents must stay at home or risk a fine. There are specific exemptions to the lockdown such as going to work, visiting a doctor, shopping, exercise and walking the dog. Everyone must carry an ID or passport with them. Also, people returning to their permanent place of residence are exempt from the measure as they travel. Other government officials will specify the measures and their enforcement. Mitsotakis thanked “the vast majority of citizens” who followed the quarantine instructions when it was first imposed more than a week ago, and blamed the “frivolous, flippant” few who “put everyone in danger” by defying the instructions.  Earlier Sunday, government spokesman Stelios Petsas had chastised those “who have interpreted the quarantine as a holiday season” by crowding public spaces or leaving the capital Athens en masse for the countryside, taking advantage of the mild weather. ___ WASHINGTON - The government’s top infectious disease expert says he remains hopeful the U.S. is not on the same trajectory as Italy in the coronavirus struggle. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says the stringent measures being put in place in the U.S. including travel restrictions, the closing of schools and many businesses and other social distancing will go “a long way” to prevent the U.S. from becoming like Italy. Italy has seen over 50,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 5,000 deaths. Fauci tells CBS’ “Face the Nation” that it’s hard to know exactly why Italy is “suffering so terribly” but that they did not appear to shut out as well the input of infections originating from China and other parts of the world. He says the U.S. is “going to be hit, no doubt about it,” but it appears to be in a better position because “we have from the beginning put a kind of clamper” on the virus. ___ SAARLAND, Germany - Germany’s small western state of Saarland became the third to offer medical help to neighboring France, which is struggling with a surge in coronavirus patients. Gov. Tobias Hans said his state would use available hospital beds with ventilators to treat severely ill patients from France’s Grand-Est region.

But the Trump administration has also made restriction immigration a top priority, regardless of the pandemic and had already been sending thousands of asylum seekers back to Mexico to wait out their cases. The nation’s immigration courts are still operating with limited closures and some hearings delayed.  Wolf said on Fox News “Sunday Morning Futures” that the borders between the U.S. and Mexico and U.S. and Canada are not shut down, but are only allowing for necessary trade and travel.

But with infections and deaths continuing to rise, Sánchez has decided not to wait to extend the lockdown.  To do so, his government will ask the Parliament for its necessary approval on Tuesday.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - A Trump administration official said Sunday that illegal border crossings have dropped by half as the strictest U.S.-Mexico border policies yet went into place amid the coronavirus pandemic, but there was confusion about how it was all working.  Anyone caught crossing the border illegally is to be immediately returned back to Mexico or Canada, according to the new restrictions based on an order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Friday. According to Mark Morgan, the acting head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the decision applies to all migrants.  “We’re not going to take you into our custody,” he said Sunday on Fox News. “We don’t know anything about you. You have no documents, we’re not going to take you into our facilities and expose you to CBP personnel and the American people as well as immigrants,” he said.  But Mexican officials have said they would only take people from Mexico and Central America and only those who are encountered straight away - not people already in custody.  “If people who are not Mexican or Central American are returned to us, Mexico would not accept them,” Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said Friday in Spanish. “The United States will take care of that.”  The majority of people crossing the border are from Central America, but not all. For example, there were some 6,000 Brazilians and nearly 1,200 Chinese who arrived between January and February this year, according to Customs and Border Protection data.  But it’s not entirely clear what happens to those people. Morgan said the migrants should be “expeditiously” returned to the country they came from.  CDC on Friday issued an order in effect for 30 days that bars anyone coming illegally in part because migrants are held in close quarters and there isn’t enough proper staffing or space to keep them at a safe distance and to screen for the illness. Plus, migrants who are suspected of having COVID-19 are sent to local hospitals, possibly further infecting others, the CDC warned.  The borders remain open, according to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, but only to facilitate trade; the U.S. has about $3 billion per day with Canada and Mexico. Tourists and shoppers were asked to stay home.  Wolf said Sunday on Fox News that it was important to “keep supply chains open,” but to do it in a careful and considerate way that would “limit the introduction and spread of the virus.”  Meanwhile, in the U.S., immigrant advocates filed a lawsuit in Washington D.C. requesting the immediate release of migrant families from detention facilities over concerns of inadequate care and an environment ripe for an outbreak. They say the country’s three detention centers where families are held - Berks in Pennsylvania, and Karnes and Dilley in Texas - have failed to take adequate measures to protect families from COVID-19.                  Immigration enforcement has  wide latitude on when to release migrants. Earlier this year, Homeland Security officials said they would detain families as long as possible in an effort to discourage migrants from crossing the border. Most families are held 20 days.  “The families who are detained in these detention centers facilities have no criminal history and do not pose any threat whatsoever to public safety and are not a flight risk - they all came to the United States to seek asylum and are actively pursuing the right to remain in the United States,” the advocacy groups wrote. ICE has said it is working to contain any spread of the virus in its detention facilities. The agency did not comment on the lawsuit. Immigration courts are still operating, but with scattered closures and delays in some hearings.  For most people, the new  coronavirus  causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. More than 300,000 have been infected worldwide.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. Curbing immigration has been a signature policy of Trump’s, and he’s tried to block asylum seekers before but failed after courts ruled against him. On Sunday, a text from his re-election campaign read: “Pres. Trump is making your safety his #1 priority. That’s why we’re closing BORDERS to illegals.” ___ Associated Press Writer Maria Verza contributed to this report from Mexico City.  ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"A snapshot of the emerging rescue package in Congress to provide healthcare and economic aid amid the coronavirus outbreak and national shutdown.  The details are subject to change as congressional leaders and the White House continue negotiating. The highlights so far: One-time checks to Americans The measure would provide a quick, one-time stipend of about $1,200 per individual, $2,400 for couples, and $3,000 for family of four. The money would cut off at higher income levels.  ___ Paycheck support An estimated $350 billion would be provided for small businesses to keep making payroll. Companies with 500 or fewer employees could tap up to $10 million in forgivable small business loans to keep paychecks flowing. ___ Unemployment expansion Workers who are eligible would receive up to 39 weeks of unemployment insurance through the end of 2020 if they are sidelined by the outbreak. The coverage would be retroactive to Jan. 27.  ___ Emergency funding, public health  The bill includes an additional $242 billion in additional emergency funds to fight the virus and shore up for safety net programs. That includes money for food stamps, child nutrition, hospitals, the Centers for Disease Control and public health and transportation agencies.

"Anthony Fauci, the main scientist in the U.S. coronavirus response, says combining a malaria drug with certain antibiotics shows “anecdotal” promise for COVID-19 patients and that his push for more proof doesn’t mean he is clashing with President Trump. “I think there’s this issue of trying to separate the two of us. There isn’t fundamentally a difference there,” Dr. Fauci, the director of the told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “He’s coming at it from a hope-layperson standpoint. I’m coming at it from a scientific standpoint.” Mr. Trump last week said he directed the Food and Drug Administration to speed the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine —  a well-established antimalarial drug — and azithromycin antibiotics to treat coronavirus patients, citing studies that suggest it can help. The president said it might be a “game-changer.” Dr. Fauci sounded a bit hesitant from the White House podium. He said the medical world must conduct clinical trials to ensure the combo is safe and effective — a process that can take months — but that he’s not trying to pick a fight with the president. “I’m not disagreeing with the fact, anecdotally, they might work,” Dr. Fauci told CBS. “But my job is to prove definitely from a scientific standpoint that they do work.” Mr. Trump got a boost from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who on Sunday said he wants to see if the drug combination is effective. His state has seen the most coronavirus cases in the U.S. He said New York will begin a trial of (hydroxy)chloroquine and azithromycin on Tuesday.

"The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 328,275 people and killed more than 14,300. The COVID-19 illness causes mild or moderate symptoms in most people, but severe symptoms are more likely in the elderly or those with existing health problems. More than 95,650 people have recovered so far, mostly in China.  TOP OF THE HOUR: - Republican Sen. Rand Paul is first U.S. senator to test positive for COVID-19 - German Chancellor Angela Merkel is in quarantine after doctor who administered a vaccaine to her tested positive for the coronavirus.  - Colombian authorities say 23 dead in prison riot.  ___ PARIS - France’s Parliament has adopted a bill allowing the government to declare a “state of health emergency” meant to better fight the coronavirus epidemic in the country. The measure voted Sunday allows the government to issue decrees that curtail temporarily freedoms, including restrictions on movements, trade, entrepreneurship and gatherings. It also enables the government to requisition necessary goods and services to fight against a health disaster. The state of heath emergency is yet to be formally declared by President Emmanuel Macron’s government during a Cabinet meeting. The measure was needed to provide legal basis to ensure the continuity of current emergency measures in the country and the democratic functioning of the state. The bill also includes the postponing of nationwide municipal elections initially due to take place on Sunday and a package of economic measures to support workers and businesses hardly hit by the crisis. French health authorities have reported 16,018 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 674 people who have died. ___ WASHINGTON - Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is the first U.S. senator to test positive for COVID-19, the infection caused by the coronavirus.  That’s according to a tweet from the senator, who is a top ally of President Donald Trump.  The senator is “feeling fine,” the tweet said. He is “asymptomatic,” and in quarantine.  He was not aware “of any direct contact with any infected person,” the tweet said.  This comes shortly after the nation’s capital announced its second death to coronavirus. ___ BERLIN - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has gone into quarantine after being informed that a doctor who administered a vaccine to her has tested positive for the coronavirus. Merkel’s spokesman said the German chancellor was informed about the doctor’s test shortly after holding a news conference Sunday announcing new measures to curb the spread of the virus. Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said Merkel had received a precautionary vaccine Friday against pneumococcal infection. Seibert said in a statement that Merkel would undergo “regular tests” in the coming days and continue with her work from home for the time being. ___ ROME - The number of deaths of people with the coronavirus in Italy jumped 651 to 5,476 in the last 24 hours, while new infections rose by 10% to over 59,000. The head of Italy’s Civil Protection Agency, Angelo Borrelli, noted that the increases had narrowed from recent days, adding ‘’we hope that this trend can be confirmed in the coming days. We should not lower our guard.’’  ___ BOGOTA, Colombia - Authorities in Colombia say 23 prisoners died and another 83 were injured in a riot and attempted escape over poor conditions inmates argue will spread the coronavirus. The violence happened overnight at the La Modelo jail in Bogota, where all of the deaths occurred, along with several other penitentiaries. Officials said seven workers were injured, two of them in critical condition. Relatives gathered outside the jail Sunday wearing masks and clamoring for information. Videos shared by inmates online showed fires inside several jails, prisoners outside their cells and inmates complaining of conditions. Colombia has confirmed 231 coronavirus cases. Authorities say none are in jails. ___ ISTANBUL - Turkish Airlines will halt all international flights except for five destinations starting Friday.  The airline’s chief executive officer Bilal Eksi tweeted flights would continue to Hong Kong, Moscow, Addis Ababa, New York and Washington, D.C. All other international passenger flights would be suspended from March 27 to April 17.  Turkey already suspended flights to 68 countries as part of Ankara’s efforts to contain the coronavirus. Eksi said domestic flights would continue but decrease in number. Cargo flights are also to continue. ___ OKLAHOMA CITY - A second person in Oklahoma has died of COVID-19 as the number of state residents with the illness caused by the coronavirus increased by more than a dozen.  The man who died was in his 50s and lived in Pawnee County, west of Tulsa. The Oklahoma State Department of Health did not provide further details on the circumstances of his illness and death. The number of people in the state who have tested positive for the virus increased to 67 Sunday, from 53 the day before. The health department said 11 of those people are hospitalized.  Oklahoma County has the most cases, with 26, following by Cleveland County, with 13, and Tulsa County, with six. ___ WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is lashing out at governors and other lawmakers who have been critical about the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Trump tweeted on Sunday that they should not be “blaming the federal government for their own shortcomings.”  He added: “We are there to back you up should you fail, and always will be!”   Democratic lawmakers such as Illinois’ governor and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio were on various TV news shows Sunday saying they had to fight with states over medical resources and questioned why Trump hasn’t yet made military resources available despite triggering the Defense Production Act late last week.   Trump has said repeatedly his administration is not to blame for the growing pandemic including a lack of resources for medical teams. ___ PARIS - France’s health minister has said the country reached a grim milestone – the first hospital doctor to have died of the coronavirus. Oliver Veran said Sunday he had learned of the death of the unnamed 68-year-old emergency doctor from Compiegne in Oise the day before and “shared the pain of the family.” It is, he said, “to my knowledge… the first case that struck a hospital doctor.” In the Le Parisien newspaper, the doctor’s son said his father’s illness hit suddenly, saying the family is “sad and angry.” He added: “He came back very tired after being on duty. He quickly fell ill, no longer ate, had no taste in spite of being of a bon vivant. Despite everything — knowing he was sick, he wanted to go back to work.” ___ ATHENS, Greece - Greece has reported an additional two fatalities from the COVID-19 virus.  That brings the total to 15. Also, 94 new cases were confirmed on Sunday, bringing the total to 624. Of those, 124 are hospitalized and 34 people are in intensive care. ___ WASHINGTON - Immigrant advocates have filed a federal lawsuit demanding that family detention centers release immigrants because of an eminent risk of a coronavirus outbreak.  Lawyers filed the lawsuit in the District of Columbia on Saturday. They say the country’s three detention centers where families are held: Berks in Pennsylvania, Karnes and Dilley in Texas, have failed to take adequate measures to protect families from COVID-19.  They say there is no justification for risking their health and safety.  Immigration enforcement has a wide latitude on when to release people detained. Earlier this year, Homeland Security officials said they would detain families as long as possible in an effort to discourage migrants from crossing the border.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said officers are taking precautions to avoid an outbreak in detention facilities. ___ ISLAMABAD - A young doctor who was infected with the coronavirus in northern Pakistan while screening pilgrims returned from Iran into Gilgit Baltistan has died.   Rashid Arshad, spokesman for chief minister of Gilgit Baltistan, said Dr Osama Riaz dead was removed from a ventilator after two days with the consent of his family.   Riaz was admitted to Gilgit’s main hospital in critical condition after he passed out Friday. He was treating suspected COVID-19 cases with proper safety gear but they were short in supply in the far mountainous terrain.  Riaz joined the hospital as medical officer after passing first stage of fellowship in medicine. With Riaz’s death number of dead due to COVID-19 in Pakistan is now four. ___ WASHINGTON - The government’s top infectious disease expert insists he has no disagreement with President Donald Trump over whether a drug to treat COVID-19 is actually at hand. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tells CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Trump had heard anecdotal reports that a malaria drug could be used for the coronavirus and so was expressing the hope “that if they might work, let’s try and push their usage.” Last week, Trump asserted that tests had provided evidence the drug is useful for COVID-19, a statement Fauci contradicted during televised White House briefings. Trump also falsely suggested that the FDA had just cleared the drug specifically for the viral pandemic, when it had not. On Sunday, Fauci explained that Trump’s views reflected a layperson who was “trying to bring hope to the people” whereas his own job is to “prove definitively from a scientific job that they do work.” ___ SKOPJE, North Macedonia - North Macedonia has announced the first death from the COVID-19 virus. Health minister Venko Filipce said Sunday the victim was a 57- year old woman from the town of Kumanovo. Her health deteriorated rapidly at the hospital, but cause of death was only determined after. Filipce did not specify when the woman died. Filipce said 29 people have tested positive on virus over the past 24 hours, all but seven from the capital Skopje. This brings the number of confirmed cases to 114. North Macedonia has imposed a 9 pm curfew that begins Sunday night. Two regions in the west of the country, near the border with Albania, have been sealed off for 30 days. More then 7,600 people are quarantined. ___ ATHENS, Greece - Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced a lockdown, starting at 6 a.m. Monday. All citizens and residents must stay at home or risk a fine. There are specific exemptions to the lockdown such as going to work, visiting a doctor, shopping, exercise and walking the dog. Everyone must carry an ID or passport with them. Also, people returning to their permanent place of residence are exempt from the measure as they travel. Other government officials will specify the measures and their enforcement. Mitsotakis thanked “the vast majority of citizens” who followed the quarantine instructions when it was first imposed more than a week ago, and blamed the “frivolous, flippant” few who “put everyone in danger” by defying the instructions.  Earlier Sunday, government spokesman Stelios Petsas had chastised those “who have interpreted the quarantine as a holiday season” by crowding public spaces or leaving the capital Athens en masse for the countryside, taking advantage of the mild weather. ___ WASHINGTON - The government’s top infectious disease expert says he remains hopeful the U.S. is not on the same trajectory as Italy in the coronavirus struggle. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says the stringent measures being put in place in the U.S. including travel restrictions, the closing of schools and many businesses and other social distancing will go “a long way” to prevent the U.S. from becoming like Italy. Italy has seen over 50,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 5,000 deaths. Fauci tells CBS’ “Face the Nation” that it’s hard to know exactly why Italy is “suffering so terribly” but that they did not appear to shut out as well the input of infections originating from China and other parts of the world. He says the U.S. is “going to be hit, no doubt about it,” but it appears to be in a better position because “we have from the beginning put a kind of clamper” on the virus. ___ SAARLAND, Germany - Germany’s small western state of Saarland became the third to offer medical help to neighboring France, which is struggling with a surge in coronavirus patients. Gov. Tobias Hans said his state would use available hospital beds with ventilators to treat severely ill patients from France’s Grand-Est region. Public broadcaster SR quoted Hans on Sunday saying that “we will only win the battle again the virus together.” Saarland came under French control after World War II but was returned to West Germany in 1957 following a referendum. Germany’s southwestern states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Wuerttemberg, which also border France, have already offered spare hospitals beds to treat French patients. ___ WASHINGTON - Illinois’ governor says his state is not receiving enough medical supplies.  Gov. J.B. Pritzker tells CNN’s “State of The Union” that they got a recent supply but it was a fraction of what was requested.

"Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is pushing ahead with Monday’s timeline to vote on the third coronavirus spending package, even as negotiations have yet to be finalized amongst senators. The Kentucky Republican said a deal is almost ready and it’s time for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to draw their talks to a close. “This national crisis is not going to wait around if Congress slips back into conventional politics or haggles endlessly over the finer points,” Mr. McConnell said. “In other words — it is just about time to take ‘yes’ for an answer,” he added. “And then let’s get this done tomorrow.” Mr. McConnell had initially aimed to get a bipartisan deal finalized by Friday evening, but talks dragged on throughout the weekend. He said the package has embraced some of the Democrats’ top priorities — including expanding unemployment insurance and restricting how major companies can use the government aid they will receive to ensure it helps their workers. The bill will also include $75 billion for healthcare resources and gives nearly $200 billion to state and local priorities. The final details of the deal, however, have yet to be revealed. On Thursday, Republicans released their four-part plan that would extend loans to small businesses, checks to the American public, major support to hard-hit industries and more funds to the overly strained healthcare system. Under their proposal, the foundation for the weekend’s bipartisan talks, the government would provide about $1,200 to Americans making up to $75,000. The handouts would then be scaled down between $75,000 and $99,000 and provide $500 per child. It includes a $300 billion loan plan for eligible small businesses to go towards payrolls and other operating expenses to help these companies stay afloat and keep their employees. To aid certain sectors of the economy devastated by the virus, the package includes $208 billion in loans. That figure breaks down to $50 billion for airlines, $8 billion for cargo air carriers and $150 billion for other eligible entities.

"CHICAGO (AP) - Airickca Gordon-Taylor, a relative of Emmett Till who spent her life educating others about the black teenage lynching victim’s legacy through her foundation, died at age 50, according to family members.  Gordon-Taylor, of suburban Chicago, died early Saturday, hours after a hospital stay. She had kidney problems for decades, including two transplants, according to her mother, Ollie Gordon, who was Till’s cousin. “She was a great advocate. She was a fighter for equal justice,” Gordon said. “She was very serious about her commitment to keep the legacy of Emmett Till going.” Gordon-Taylor, of Olympia Fields, also called herself Till’s cousin, but considered herself a surrogate daughter to his mother, whom she lived with for a time. In 2009, Gordon-Taylor named her foundation after Till’s mother, calling it the Mamie Till Mobley Memorial Foundation.  Its mission is to honor her and her only son.  Emmett Till was killed in 1955 while visiting relatives in Mississippi, his body found weighted down in the Tallahatchie River. His mother insisted on an open-casket funeral in Chicago, where they lived, so the public could see the mutilated corpse. An all-white jury acquitted two white men in the killing. Till’s death helped energize the civil rights movement.  Gordon-Taylor’s work included youth empowerment, such as teaching young people oratory skills, and civil rights issues. Most recently, she advocated in Washington, D.C., for an anti-lynching bill named after Till.  “Airickca dedicated her life’s work to lifting up the legacy of her cousin, Emmett Till, and she stood in solidarity with other families who had lost loved ones to racial violence in our country,” said Kristen Clarke, head of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which works with the foundation. “She fought for truth and justice, and worked tirelessly to promote racial healing.”  Family members said they hope to plan a public memorial event in the future.  __ Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sophiatareen.

"Congress was unable to reach an agreement Sunday on a $1 trillion-plus stimulus package that gives cash to families and keeps small businesses afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic, deepening fears of economic chaos as Rand Paul of Kentucky became the first U.S. senator to confirm he has contracted the disease. Democrats balked at the Senate Republicans’ push to set aside $425 billion for loans to select companies and industries, dubbing it a “slush fund” for the Treasury to direct as it sees fit. They said the benefits are tilted toward corporations instead of working people. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, dared Democrats to reject the Senate measure in a procedural vote Sunday as tales of joblessness and woe poured in from every part of the nation. “This national crisis is not going to wait around if Congress slips back into conventional politics or haggles endlessly over the finer points,” Mr. McConnell said. “In other words, it is just about time to take ‘yes’ for an answer,” he said. The measure failed to get the 60 votes needed to advance or even a majority — 47-47. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, said her troops will go back to the drawing board with their own bill and hope it is compatible with the Senate legislation.

"President Trump said Sunday that he gave the green light for Ford, General Motors and Tesla to manufacture ventilators and other items to treat COVID-19, but some state and local officials say the administration isn’t moving aggressively enough to get medical supplies delivered. The president urged auto executives to “go for it” in the race to build ventilators and other medical supplies for intensive care units, but he said he has resisted using the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law that empowers the president to compel production, because it would smack of “nationalization” and is not necessary at this time. “We have tremendous numbers of companies making equipment,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. “We’re a country not based on nationalizing their businesses. We have the threat of doing it, if we need it. But using it is actually a big deal.” He said his announcement last week that he intended to use the law “sent tremors through our business community.” “Nobody would know where to start,” he said of a system that would compel changes in factory outputs. Saying the current system is working well, Mr. Trump used as an example Honeywell International’s increase in output of N95 masks. Presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro, who is coordinating the response from private industry, said the effort is “purely voluntary.” “We’re seeing the greatest mobilization of the industrial base since World War II,” said Mr. Navarro. “The Defense Production Act has given me quiet leverage. We’re getting what we need without putting the heavy hand of government down.” But some state and local officials say the president has not been quick enough to order specific private companies to repurpose their factories since Wednesday, when he invoked the Defense Production Act. “The president of the United States is from New York City, and he will not lift a finger to help his hometown. And I do not get it. I do not get it,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Right now I have asked repeatedly for the military to be mobilized, for the Defense Production Act be used to the fullest to get us things like ventilators, so people can live who would have died otherwise.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, said the Trump administration’s failure to invoke the Defense Production Act is “going to cost lives.” She said hospitals in her district treating COVID-19 patients are experiencing shortfalls in masks, gowns and other equipment. Mr. Trump has said many companies are stepping forward to make more masks, swabs and other supplies, so he hasn’t used the 1950 law to direct production from the private sector. He rattled off statistics Sunday of supplies provided from the federal stockpile to states, such as more than 440,000 surgical masks for New York state. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a well-known liberal Democrat, said it’s great that companies are voluntarily helping but greater production is necessary. “It is absolutely needed,” she told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We are nowhere near the beds and capacity that we need in this country.” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, complimented the work of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Sunday but said states are facing the “Wild West” in the global hunt for masks, gowns and other equipment. “We’re all competing against each other,” Mr. Pritzker told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “This should have been a coordinated effort by the federal government.” The president tweeted in response that Mr. Pritzker is part of a “very small group of certain other Governors” who “shouldn’t be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings. “We are there to back you up should you fail, and always will be!” Mr. Trump said. Under the Defense Production Act, the president can require U.S. companies that manufacture ventilators to prioritize federal government contracts over foreign customers. Mr. Trump also could order U.S. factories to manufacture more of the N95 face masks and other medical supplies, and direct the equipment to specific hospitals. The president has been saying he hasn’t needed to order companies to take those steps because many of them have been stepping up on their own. 3M has ramped up to “maximum production levels” of N95 masks and doubled its global output to a rate of nearly 100 million per month, said CEO and Chairman Mike Roman. “In the United States, we are producing 35 million [masks] per month. Of these, more than 90% are now designated for health care workers, with the remaining deployed to other industries also critical in this pandemic, including energy, food and pharmaceutical companies,” Mr. Roman said. GM and ventilator maker Ventec Life Systems said they were combining resources to boost production and get ventilators to hospitals faster. “We will continue to explore ways to help in this time of crisis,” said GM Chief Executive Mary Barra. Pernod Ricard USA, which makes Absolut Vodka and aperitifs, is switching to production of hand sanitizer at plants in Arkansas, West Virginia, Kentucky and Texas. “Our company is proud to support the efforts of the administration and communities across the country in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Ann Mukherjee, CEO of Pernod Ricard North America. Mr. Trump said the clothing manufacturer Hanes also is retooling to make more masks. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups have raised concerns that the Defense Production Act could harm the economy by reducing supply chains and limiting access to overseas markets. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Neil Bradley said the action could be counterproductive. “Such moves could deprive vibrant U.S. companies of access to international markets and inputs in a way that could undermine economic recovery,” he said. FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor said earlier Sunday that the president had not ordered any companies to begin producing medical supplies and prefers to use the emergency law as “leverage. “The president can use it any time,” he said. “All these companies are coming up asking us what they can do to help. And we haven’t had to use it because companies around the country, donations, they are saying, what can we do to help you? And it’s happening without using that lever. If it comes to a point we have to pull the lever, we will. But, right now, it’s really a great sign about the greatness of this country.”  ",Trump won’t ‘nationalize’ companies under emergency law to produce medical supplies,"Sunday, March 22, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/22/trump-will-not-nationalize-companies-under-defense/,washington_times
"President Trump said he’d be in favor of letting members of Congress vote remotely during the coronavirus crisis. “I would be in favor of it. I was thinking of it today,” he told White House reporters. Mr. Trump said there may be constitutional barriers to overcome in doing it, though said it’s becoming a necessity as two House members battle infections and Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, reports a positive test. “You could have a lot of people there, from Congress,” he said. “I would be totally in favor of it from a temporary basis.”  ",Trump ‘totally in favor’ letting Congress vote remotely during coronavirus pandemic,"Sunday, March 22, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/22/trump-supports-letting-congress-vote-remotely-duri/,washington_times
"It is almost unthinkable in a national emergency. Journalists and commentators are now calling for a complete media blackout of President Trump’s live briefings on the coronavirus pandemic, concerned that these daily TV events promote misinformation of have turned into a Trump “rally.” These critics overlook the fact, however, that Mr. Trump shares the podium with vital members of his task force including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The briefings also include official information, timely discussion and questions from the press. Nevertheless, the call to silence Mr. Trump has been percolating for the last 72 hours. “The media must stop live-broadcasting Trump’s dangerous, destructive coronavirus briefings. He’s just using them a substitute for his rallies. Put him on tape-delay so journalists can counter his rush of information,” writes Washington Post media analyst Margaret Sullivan. MSNBC prime-time host Rachel Maddow is also calling for a blackout, deeming Mr. Trump’s statements as “needlessly diverting and wildly irresponsible” and that the public needs to “inoculate” themselves to it. “The daily briefing is a litany of things from the president that would be awesome of they were true, if they were happening. But they’re not. The sooner we come to terms with that, the better for all of us,” Ms. Maddow said in a on-air commentary. “It’s misinformation. If Trump is going to keep lying like he has been every day on stuff this important, we should, all of us, stop broadcasting it. Honestly, it’s going to cost lives,” she concluded. There is already a #blackouttrump hashtag circulating on social media. “If President Trump is not capable of leading stably and effectively, he should for the good of the country stop making things worse, and consider leaving the podium to others,” said CNN host Jake Tapper on his own broadcast. Viewers may not agree with this idea. Multiple polls suggest that the public approves of Mr. Trump’s response to the pandemic, including an ABC News survey which found that 55% approved of the president’s actions during the pandemic. One observer smells a rat, citing the timing of the “blackout” call. “It is no accident this insidious and un-American idea arrived the day after a number of polls showed a clear majority of the public approving of Trump’s handling of the Wuhan virus,” writes Breitbart News editor at large John Nolte, who traced calls for a Trump blackout to such news organizations as The Atlantic, NBC News, The Boston Globe, the Nation, and “former Obama officials.” Is the “Deep State” in on it? Mr. Nolte believes the push to remove Mr. Trump from the media realm is meant to turn the coronavirus pandemic into “Trump’s Katrina,” referring to former President George W. Bush’s experiences during Hurricane Katrina, which killed 1,883 people and caused $108 billion in damages in 2005. The weather event was often referred to as “a political storm.” NOW THERE’S A THOUGHT “Three cheers for President Trump’s success in forcing a federal bureaucracy that normally moves at the speed of a glacier to begin working at ‘Trump Speed,’” writes American Thinker contributor William Noel. “That’s why they call it the Trump train,” responds Lucianne Goldberg, founder of Lucianne.com, a political news site. BIDEN’S ‘SHADOW BRIEFING’ Though he is currently confined to his own home Delaware due to the coronavirus pandemic, Democratic presidential hopeful Joseph R. Biden plans to offer “shadow briefings” on the national emergency. In a press call, Mr. Biden announced he was in the process of upgrading space in his house to include enough high tech equipment to livestream his coronavirus commentary via the internet. The former vice president also has renewed his pushback against President Trump — advising him to “stop saying false things” about the health crisis. Politico has already deemed Mr. Biden’s plan as a “shadow briefing” and predicts the new feature could start as early as Monday. “In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president,” Mr. Biden declared in a recent tweet. The former vice president is not holding back now — and has already debuted an online “COVID-19 Breakdown” video with Ron Klain, the White House Ebola Response coordinator during the Obama administration. A SUCCINCT MEDIA REALITY CHECK “The coronavirus epidemic is shaking humanity and turning the world upside down. Quick, somebody alert the media. The Washington press corps is covering one of the largest, continuing stories in recent history the same way it has covered the Trump administration since Day One. The formula is simple: Whatever the president does is not just wrong, it’s borderline evil. Details at 11,” writes New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin. “In the real world, events are unfolding at a pace and scale impossible to comprehend. But at too many news outlets, the aim is not to inform. It’s to render the harshest possible judgment on the man journalists love to hate,” he says. 2020: THE SHOW MUST GO ON Should the presidential election be canceled or delayed in the year of coronavirus? Uh, no.

"Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is pushing ahead with Monday’s timeline to vote on the third coronavirus spending package, even as negotiations have yet to be finalized amongst senators. The Kentucky Republican said a deal is almost ready and it’s time for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to draw their talks to a close. “This national crisis is not going to wait around if Congress slips back into conventional politics or haggles endlessly over the finer points,” Mr. McConnell said. “In other words — it is just about time to take ‘yes’ for an answer,” he added. “And then let’s get this done tomorrow.” Mr. McConnell had initially aimed to get a bipartisan deal finalized by Friday evening, but talks dragged on throughout the weekend. He said the package has embraced some of the Democrats’ top priorities — including expanding unemployment insurance and restricting how major companies can use the government aid they will receive to ensure it helps their workers. The bill will also include $75 billion for healthcare resources and gives nearly $200 billion to state and local priorities. The final details of the deal, however, have yet to be revealed. On Thursday, Republicans released their four-part plan that would extend loans to small businesses, checks to the American public, major support to hard-hit industries and more funds to the overly strained healthcare system. Under their proposal, the foundation for the weekend’s bipartisan talks, the government would provide about $1,200 to Americans making up to $75,000. The handouts would then be scaled down between $75,000 and $99,000 and provide $500 per child. It includes a $300 billion loan plan for eligible small businesses to go towards payrolls and other operating expenses to help these companies stay afloat and keep their employees. To aid certain sectors of the economy devastated by the virus, the package includes $208 billion in loans. That figure breaks down to $50 billion for airlines, $8 billion for cargo air carriers and $150 billion for other eligible entities.

"Sen. Rand Paul has tested positive for the coronavirus, his office said Sunday. The senator is feeling fine and in quarantine, spokesman Sergio Gor said. Mr. Paul isn’t showing symptoms but was tested “out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events.” “He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person,” Mr. Gor said. “He expects to be back in the Senate after his quarantine period ends and will continue to work for the people of Kentucky at this difficult time. Ten days ago, our D.C. office began operating remotely, hence virtually no staff has had contact with Senator Rand Paul.” Mr. Paul attended the Speed Art Museum’s “Speed Ball” in Louisville on March 7. Two attendees at the ball later tested positive for COVID-19, although the senator is not aware of any direct contact with either. A who’s who of Kentucky officials attended the event, including Gov. Andy Beshear. Also, one of Mr. Paul’s neighbors attacked him in late 2017, causing a lung injury that required surgery. That put Mr. Paul in a higher risk category for pulmonary issues. Mr. Paul’s colleagues were alarmed by the positive test, however, and scrutinized his presence on Capitol Hill, including reports the senator went to the gym early Sunday. “I’ve never commented about a fellow Senator’s choices/actions. Never once,” Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, Arizona Democrat, tweeted with a link to a reporter’s tweet about Mr. Paul’s activities. “This, America, is absolutely irresponsible. You cannot be near other people while waiting for coronavirus test results. It endangers others & likely increases the spread of the virus.” Mr. Paul’s office stressed that he had no known contact with anyone known to be infected and went into isolation once he learned his results. “We want to be clear, Senator Paul left the Senate IMMEDIATELY upon learning of his diagnosis. He had zero contact with anyone & went into quarantine,” his office tweeted. “Insinuations such as those below that he went to the gym after learning of his results are just completely false & irresponsible!” Mr. Paul was the only senator to vote against an $8 billion coronavirus bill earlier this month after colleagues rejected his bid to pay for the measure by cutting foreign aid. Two House members, Reps. Ben McAdams of Utah and Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, have tested positive. President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence received tests but they came back negative.

"Senate Democrats and environmentalists want to tack climate change mandates onto proposed federal aid to major airlines and cruise lines reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter to the House and Senate leadership, eight Senate Democrats said last week that any financial assistance to the travel industry “should be paired with requirements that companies act in a more responsible fashion” by reducing their carbon footprint. “If we given the airline and cruise industries assistance without requiring them to be better environmental stewards, we would miss a major opportunity to combat climate change and ocean dumping,” said the letter. At the same time, more than 200 environmental and wildlife groups urged Congress to place a cap on greenhouse gases from U.S. air fleets, which would require the industry to reduce emissions by 20% per decade from 2020 levels. “Climate change damages will wreak havoc on a scale even greater than the coronavirus,” said the Friday letter headed by the Center for Biological Diversity. “It is time to stop repeating the mistakes of the past and ensure that any bailout of the aviation industry puts it on a path to address its threat to our climate, workers and communities.” The U.S. airline industry is pushing for $50 billion in financial assistance — about half in zero-interest loan guarantees, half in cash grants — as air travel nosedives in reaction to COVID-19, while the Senate GOP package as introduced includes loans but not grants. The risk for Democrats lies with the optics of holding up critically needed aid over climate concerns. United Airlines and its unions warned Friday that layoffs would be necessary to account for next month’s anticipated 60% drop in planned flights without federal help. Climate Depot’s Marc Morano blasted the effort to insert climate change into the crisis response, saying that the “last thing U.S. businesses or the economy need are more punishing climate-based mandates to satisfy the Democrat Party base.” “Democrats know that they should never let a crisis go to waste,” said Mr. Morano, author of “The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change.” “They are pouncing on any opportunity to inject climate into the COVID-19 issue. Trying to make sure that any federal stimulus bills include going in the ‘right direction toward decarbonization’ is not the way to proceed.” Climate change activists have increasingly targeted greenhouse gas emissions from airplane travel, engaging in “flight shaming” to discourage frequent flyers, a phenomenon has wound up embarrassing such Green New Deal advocates as Sens. Bernard Sanders and Elizabeth Warren over their private jet travel. In their letter, the Democrats said that airline travel accounts for 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions, a figure expected to triple by 2050, while cruise ships “burn heavy fuel oil, one of the dirtiest fuels.” “Business leaders are themselves increasingly recognizing that their companies must make positive contributions to society or risk losing their social license,” said the letter. “This is particularly true when companies ask American taxpayers for financial assistance.” The industry group Airlines for America said on its website that U.S. planes improved their efficiency between 1978 and 2018 by 130%, resulting in nearly 5 billion metric tons of “carbon dioxide savings,” while carriers continue to invest in alternative fuels. The Democrats who signed the letter were Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Jeffrey Merkley of Oregon, Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, Edward Markey of Massachusetts, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Tina Smith of Minnesota and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.

"Rep. French Hill bucks charges that his party’s $1 trillion coronavirus economic rescue package that stalled in the Senate on Sunday night is a bailout. Or a stimulus bill. Or a retreat from the Republican Party’s embrace of fiscal conservatism. “This is not an economic stimulus bill, this is an economic preservation bill,” he told The Washington Times. “We’re not attempting to stimulate the economy. We’re attempting to save the economy from a black swan, external shock.” Senate Democrats, looking for a broader expansion of unemployment benefits and skeptical of corporate assistance in the package, blocked the bill on a procedural vote Sunday. But Republicans are also fending off criticism of the bill from the right. Mr. Hill, an Arkansas Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, said the bill’s loan guarantees and lifelines for businesses in need of capital are in line with conservative economic philosophy, particularly when financial hardships arise from a public health crisis rather than irresponsible business practices. Mr. Hill called Senate Republicans’ proposed package “a reasonable response” on the part of Congress. “You’re in a global public health pandemic. It hasn’t been faced in the developed world certainly in my lifetime,” he said. “This is not an opportunity to create more government permanent spending.” The Republicans’ four-part plan would extend loans to small businesses, send checks to the American public, provide major support to hard-hit industries and deliver more taxpayer funds to the overly strained healthcare system. Under the proposal, the government would provide about $1,200 to Americans making up to $75,000 a year. The handouts would then be scaled down for those earning between $75,000 and $99,000 and would provide $500 per child. A $230 billion loan plan would help eligible small businesses make payroll and cover other operating expenses to keep the companies and their employees afloat. Another $208 billion in loans would go to industries hardest hit by the crisis: $50 billion for airlines, $8 billion for cargo air carriers and $150 billion for other eligible entities. In all, the phase-three bill is expected to cost more than $1 trillion. That’s on top of the billions spent in the first two packages. The first preparedness and response bill was signed into law by President Trump on March 6 and cost $8.3 billion. The second package that targeted relief at workers was signed by the president Wednesday and cost more than $100 billion. Mr. Hill said he was open to “creative” solutions such as the cash handouts, but he would prefer Congress focus on supporting small businesses, especially through local banks and other financial institutions. That way, he argued, there’s less need to funnel money into unemployment benefits and ensure workers keep their jobs. “So I think the most important thing we can do is get money in the hands of the job creators and in the hands of employers so they can keep more people working and they don’t have to be laid off, but we’re behind the curve on that,” he said. Mr. Hill said Republican lawmakers in the House are looking at lowering interest rates for small business loans, expanding eligibility for refinancing, and expediting express loans for small businesses. Mr. Hill is also concerned that small businesses will face overwhelming issues with troubled debt restructuring as they try to move around their limited funds, so he’s calling for regulatory direction to mitigate that in the stimulus package. While working in the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush, Mr. Hill saw first hand how that type of regulatory approach had a “cascading negative effect” during the 1991 recession. But to pass any new package, lawmakers are faced with balancing the health risks posed by the very virus they need to legislate against. As of last week, two lawmakers — Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida and Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams of Utah — announced they had tested positive for the coronavirus. Both were at the House’s vote last Saturday. Staffers in Senate and House offices have revealed they tested positive for the disease and dozens of lawmakers have closed their offices and told staff to work from home. In both chambers, rank-and-file members are pushing leadership to find ways for them to vote remotely, though both Democrat and Republican leaders are reluctant to make such dramatic rule changes. Congress’ rules forbid remote voting under any circumstances and it hasn’t happened in the more than 230-year history of the institution. Mr. Hill, for one, isn’t concerned about in-person voting conflicting with social distancing guidelines. He said new voting procedures allow for members to trickle into the chamber rather than gathering all at once. “I think people know how to take good care of themselves from a hygiene point of view and the travel back and forth,” he said. “If they have good basic health and don’t have any health conditions personally that would compromise that I think we can conduct our constitutional duties and do it in a safe way.”  ","Coronavirus recovery bill doesn’t violate conservative principles, says Arkansas GOP congressman","Saturday, March 21, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-recovery-bill-doesnt-violate-conservat/,washington_times
"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden plans to begin live-streaming his own briefings on the coronavirus Monday, attempting to keep his Democratic presidential run relevant while the deadly virus sidelines his campaign. He told donors in tele-fundraiser Sunday that it is time for Americans to come together in the face of a crisis, and he slammed President Trump and Republican lawmakers for botching economic rescue legislation. “This is a time for this nation to come together because, folks, we’re all in this together. This virus doesn’t care whether you’re a Democrat or Republican,” Mr. Biden, who is hunkered down at his home in Delaware, told the 72 donors on the conference call. He said the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 does not discriminate based on gender, race, ethnicity or anything else. “From the Great Depression to two world wars to 9/11, to the pandemic of 1918. This country has always overcome every crisis we faced in our history. We’re gonna overcome this one, too,” said Mr. Biden Mr. Biden’s home has been outfitted with high-speed internet for his “shadow briefings” that will be broadcast from his home as a counterpoint to Mr. Trump’s daily press conferences on the federal response to the outbreak. “They’ve converted a recreation room, basically, into a television studio. And so beginning tomorrow, I guess tomorrow, I’m making the first presentation at 11:30 a.m. thereabouts, Eastern Standard Time,” said Mr. Biden, who was closing in on the nomination when the outbreak all but closed down the presidential race. The call Sunday was the Biden campaign’s second tele-fundraiser since the coronavirus struck the U.S. An in-person fundraiser was originally scheduled to take place in Atlanta. Muhtar Kent, the former chairman and CEO of the Coca-Cola Company, hosted the conference call. Mr. Biden said a president’s job in times of crisis was telling the American people the truth. “We need to tell the American people the truth, the unvarnished truth: where things stand, where they’re heading, what has to be done to head it off,” he said. “The American people are going to do anything — they’ll do anything we ask them. They’ll meet any challenge, just as long as we tell them the truth. And that’s the responsibility of a president. That’s what the American people are owed.” He also blamed the wrangling over the more than $1 trillion COVID-19 relief bill on Mr. Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican. “There’s an impasse now because apparently, Mitch McConnell and the president are … changing the game plan,” said Mr. Biden. Shortly after Mr. Biden’s call, Senate Democrats derailed the bill in a procedural vote.

"President Trump said he is giving Washington state, California and New York “maximum flexibility” to use the National Guard as they see fit to combat the coronavirus. He said the governors of those states will be “in command” and he hopes they’re up to the task in stemming the crisis. The president also said he’s doled out hundreds of thousands of masks to hard-hit states from the national stockpile and that tens of thousands of face shields and gowns have been delivered to New York, as governors complain about a lack of action from the federal government. Mr. Trump said he’s sending “federal medical stations” to hard-hit states with thousands of beds to handle patients, and he’s empowered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build medical facilities in New York. Mr. Trump is striking an upbeat tone as the U.S. caseload reaches nearly 33,000, including 400 deaths. The president also said Congress is working to protect unemployed workers until the epidemic is defeated. “You will see our economy skyrocket once this is over,” Mr. Trump said. “We will win the war.” “We want to have as few deaths as possible,” he added. Mr. Trump gave a shout-out to GOP allies who contracted the disease — Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida— though did not mention Democratic Rep.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - A Trump administration official said Sunday that illegal border crossings have dropped by half as the strictest U.S.-Mexico border policies yet went into place amid the coronavirus pandemic, but there was confusion about how it was all working.  Anyone caught crossing the border illegally is to be immediately returned back to Mexico or Canada, according to the new restrictions based on an order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Friday. According to Mark Morgan, the acting head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the decision applies to all migrants.  “We’re not going to take you into our custody,” he said Saturday evening on Fox News. “We don’t know anything about you. You have no documents, we’re not going to take you into our facilities and expose you to CBP personnel and the American people as well as immigrants,” he said.  But Mexican officials have said they would only take people from Mexico and Central America and only those who are encountered straight away - not people already in custody. Officials later said the elderly and minors won’t be taken back and that they expected to take in about 100 per day.  “If people who are not Mexican or Central American are returned to us, Mexico would not accept them,” Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said Friday in Spanish. “The United States will take care of that.”  The majority of people crossing the border are from Central America, but not all. For example, there were some 6,000 Brazilians and nearly 1,200 Chinese who arrived between January and February this year, according to Customs and Border Protection data.  But it’s not entirely clear what happens to those people. Morgan said the migrants should be “expeditiously” returned to the country they came from.  CDC on Friday issued an order in effect for 30 days that bars anyone coming illegally in part because migrants are held in close quarters and there isn’t enough proper staffing or space to keep them at a safe distance and to screen for the illness. Plus, migrants who are suspected of having COVID-19 are sent to local hospitals, possibly further infecting others, the CDC warned.  The borders remain open, according to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, but only to facilitate trade; the U.S. has about $3 billion per day with Canada and Mexico. Tourists and shoppers were asked to stay home.  Wolf said Sunday on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that the number of migrants crossing illegally had plummeted, but it was important to “keep supply chains open,” but to do it in a careful and considerate way that would “limit the introduction and spread of the virus.”  Meanwhile, there was growing concern on the Mexican side of the border that the number of migrants stranded there would only increase, with shelters already at capacity.  “We have 300 people in the shelter and we can no longer take it. We have been a week without the United States asking for people and if they don’t ask, we are going to be overcrowded,” said Héctor Joaquín Silva, director of the Senda de Reynosa shelter, which borders McAllen, Texas. Silva said he hasn’t accepted more migrants and has kept the shelter in quarantine to avoid infections but that migrants continue to arrive in Reynosa.  Meanwhile, in the U.S., immigrant advocates filed a lawsuit in Washington D.C. requesting the immediate release of migrant families from detention facilities over concerns of inadequate care and an environment ripe for an outbreak. They say the country’s three detention centers where families are held - Berks in Pennsylvania, and Karnes and Dilley in Texas - have failed to take adequate measures to protect families from COVID-19.                  Immigration enforcement has  wide latitude on when to release migrants. Earlier this year, Homeland Security officials said they would detain families as long as possible in an effort to discourage migrants from crossing the border. Most families are held 20 days.  “The families who are detained in these detention centers facilities have no criminal history and do not pose any threat whatsoever to public safety and are not a flight risk - they all came to the United States to seek asylum and are actively pursuing the right to remain in the United States,” the advocacy groups wrote. ICE has said it is working to contain any spread of the virus in its detention facilities. The agency did not comment on the lawsuit. Immigration courts are still operating, but with scattered closures and delays in some hearings.  For most people, the new  coronavirus  causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. More than 300,000 have been infected worldwide.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. Curbing immigration has been a signature policy of Trump’s, and he’s tried to block asylum seekers before but failed after courts ruled against him. On Sunday, a text from his re-election campaign read: “Pres. Trump is making your safety his #1 priority. That’s why we’re closing BORDERS to illegals.” ___ Verza contributed to this report from Mexico City.  ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"A snapshot of the emerging rescue package in Congress to provide healthcare and economic aid amid the coronavirus outbreak and national shutdown.  The details are subject to change as congressional leaders and the White House continue negotiating the nearly $2 trillion package. The highlights so far: ONE-TIME CHECKS TO AMERICANS The measure would provide a quick, one-time stipend of about $1,200 per individual, $2,400 for couples, and $3,000 for family of four. The money would cut off at higher income levels.  PAYCHECK SUPPORT An estimated $350 billion would be provided for small businesses to keep making payroll. Companies with 500 or fewer employees could tap up to $10 million each in forgivable small business loans to keep paychecks flowing. UNEMPLOYMENT EXPANSION Workers who are eligible would receive up to 39 weeks of unemployment insurance through the end of 2020 if they are sidelined by the outbreak. The coverage would be retroactive to Jan. 27.  EMERGENCY FUNDING, PUBLIC HEALTH The bill includes an additional $242 billion in additional emergency funds to fight the virus and shore up for safety net programs. That includes money for food stamps, child nutrition, hospitals, the Centers for Disease Control and public health and transportation agencies. The measure includes $15.6 billion to augment the food stamp program, which helps feed around 40 million Low income people per year. It’s annual budget is around $70 billion. INDUSTRY AID The initial GOP plan called for $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries, which would have to be repaid. Leaders are still negotiating the final number and how the money would be provided by the administration. STATE AID Negotiators are still hammering out whether there will be money give to the states, whose governors have requested billions to shore up their budgets.

"Joe Biden has secured endorsements from both of the nation’s major teacher unions after the American Federation of Teachers on Sunday voted to back his presidential campaign. The AFT’s executive council voted to support Biden after months of town halls and candidate interviews that drew thousands of its 1.7 million members. Recent polling done for the union found that its members prefer Biden by a wide margin, with 60% favoring the former vice president and 30% favoring Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT, said Biden’s views on public education and college affordability line up with the union’s, and she said Biden stands the best chance at defeating President Donald Trump in November. “Joe Biden is the experienced and empathic leader our country needs right now,” Weingarten said in a statement. “Our country is navigating the greatest challenge we have battled in generations, and it is essential that we rally around a candidate who can show courage, conviction and compassion in the face of uncertainty.” The AFT chose Biden a week after the nation’s largest teachers union, the National Education Association, threw its weight behind him. Before the field of candidates thinned, the AFT encouraged its members to choose from among Biden, Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, saying all three had a track record of working with the union. But recent polling showed that Biden has surged in popularity among members, especially since a series of primary wins on March 17. Most Democrats in the 2020 race lined up with the teachers unions, with promises to boost funding for public schools, increase pay for teachers and open college to a wider swath of Americans. Biden’s plans call for universal access to pre-kindergarten, tripling Title I funding for schools that teach large shares of low-income students, and increased support for school infrastructure, among other ideas. He also opposes the use of taxpayer money to support for-profit charter schools. Until recently, Biden supported a narrower version of free college than Sanders and other candidates, saying community colleges should be free but not public four-year universities. Earlier this month, however, he shifted his stance and proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities for students whose families make up to $125,000.

"Rep. Ben McAdams, the second member of Congress to publicly confirm a positive coronavirus test, said that he was hospitalized after experiencing “severe shortness of breath” on Friday evening. Mr. McAdams, Utah Democrat, said he called the COVID-19 hotline and was instructed to go to the hospital and check in with the isolation unit. “I was admitted and have been receiving oxygen as I struggled to maintain my blood oxygen at appropriate levels,” Mr. McAdams said in a statement on Sunday evening. “I am now off oxygen and feeling relatively better and expect to be released as soon as the doctors determine it is appropriate.” He said he’s grateful to the hospital medical staff. “My experience has shown me how critical it is to follow the advice of the CDC and the Utah Department of Health in order to stop the spread of this virus,” he said. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, Florida Republican, was the first member of Congress to announce a positive test. He said last week he was hopeful that the worst had passed. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has also tested positive for COVID-19, though Mr. Paul was “feeling fine” and is “asymptomatic,” according to the senator’s office. Congress is scrambling to pass a trillion dollar-plus fiscal stimulus package in light of the coronavirus outbreak.

Several other senators are self-quarantining out of caution as well, potentially affecting leaders’ ability to muster enough votes to move forward.

"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - The Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by a gun shop that challenged Gov. Tom Wolf’s authority to shutter businesses determined to be “non-life-sustaining,” paving the way for enforcement to begin Monday. Without comment, a majority of the state’s high court late Sunday denied the petition by a gun shop, a gun purchaser and a law firm to have Wolf’s shutdown order thrown out. The lawsuit had claimed Wolf’s edict violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms and other constitutional rights. The Democratic governor has ordered all nonessential businesses to close their physical locations indefinitely, saying the measure is needed to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. Enforcement by state police and other state and local agencies was to begin Monday morning, with violators subject to warnings, fines, license suspensions and even criminal charges. In a dissenting statement joined by two other justices, Justice David Wecht said Wolf’s order amounts to “an absolute and indefinite prohibition upon the acquisition of firearms by the citizens of this commonwealth - a result in clear tension with the Second Amendment” and the state constitution. He called on Wolf to make some allowance for the in-person sale of firearms. Pennsylvania health officials on Sunday reported more than 100 new cases in Pennsylvania, for a total of more than 470. Montgomery County said it had confirmed the first coronavirus-related death there, the third reported in Pennsylvania.

"Senate Democrats on Monday announced legislation to compel President Trump to implement the Defense Production Act, which gives the White House broad latitude to force the private sector to procure certain goods, in light of the expanding coronavirus outbreak. The bill from Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii would force Mr. Trump to identify private sector capacity for 500 million respirators and pairs of gloves, 20 million face shields, 20 million surgical gowns, and 200,000 ventilators, among other medical equipment. “The current system, in which states and hospitals are competing against each other for scarce equipment, is both unnecessary and barbaric,” Mr. Murphy said. “Enough is enough. It’s time to centralize the critical medical supply chain and distribution during this public health crisis.” Democrats have pressed Mr. Trump to fully leverage the Korean War-era law amid national shortages of hospital equipment and medical supplies. But the president has said companies are stepping up on their own to fill demand and that the U.S. has historically been wary of nationalizing major industries.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Monday that Senate Democrats must drop their objections to a nearly $2 trillion economic relief package before midnight to help businesses and workers hurt by the coronavirus outbreak. “We need to pass this today,” Mr. Mnuchin told CNBC host Maria Bartiromo. “We are working round the clock today to make sure the Senate passes this today.”He rejected Democrats’ complaints that $500 billion in the bill to help corporations amounts to a “slush fund” to bail out big companies. “This isn’t corporate welfare,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “This helps all American workers. There’s enormous bipartisan support for this. We’re using all the tools we have, and we’ve told Congress, we need additional tools ASAP.” He said the measure will complement a series of emergency actions by the Federal Reserve to pump more cash and credit into financial markets and businesses. “This legislation is now approximately $2 trillion,” he said. “Part of that is $500 billion, which is not a slush fund — that we can use in working with the Federal Reserve that will provide another $4 trillion of potential liquidity into the market. That’s on top of the Fed’s balance sheet.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has scheduled another vote for Monday on the measure, after all Democrats voted against proceeding with the bill on Sunday evening. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said the measure doesn’t provide relief for hospitals or localities. Mr. Mnuchin said the bill provides Small Business Administration loans for any business with 500 or fewer employees to cover two months of payroll and “some overhead.” He said if companies hire back their workers, “the government will forgive that loan.” Asked if the president is considering a nationwide shutdown, Mr. Mnuchin replied, “The president will decide.

"Congress was unable to reach an agreement Sunday on a $1 trillion-plus stimulus package that gives cash to families and keeps small businesses afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic, deepening fears of economic chaos as Rand Paul of Kentucky became the first U.S. senator to confirm he has contracted the disease. Democrats balked at the Senate Republicans’ push to set aside $425 billion for loans to select companies and industries, dubbing it a “slush fund” for the Treasury to direct as it sees fit. They said the benefits are tilted toward corporations instead of working people. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, dared Democrats to reject the Senate measure in a procedural vote Sunday as tales of joblessness and woe poured in from every part of the nation. “This national crisis is not going to wait around if Congress slips back into conventional politics or haggles endlessly over the finer points,” Mr. McConnell said. “In other words, it is just about time to take ‘yes’ for an answer,” he said. The measure failed to get the 60 votes needed to advance or even a majority — 47-47. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, said her troops will go back to the drawing board with their own bill and hope it is compatible with the Senate legislation.

"A federal appeals court denied rehearing a challenge by President Trump over blocking of critics on Twitter after a three-judge panel ruled the move violated the First Amendment. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order Monday rejecting an appeal for the full court to review its prior ruling that Mr. Trump’s Twitter account is a public forum, and therefore he cannot block his critics on the social media site. “When the president creates such a public forum, he violates the First Amendment when he excludes persons from the dialogue because they express views with which he disagrees,” wrote Judge Barrington Parker, a Nixon appointee. Nine judges on the 2nd Circuit considered rehearing the case, with two of the active judges on the circuit not taking part. The majority declined to hear the appeal, but Trump-appointed Judges Michael Park and Richard Sullivan would have taken up the case, reasoning the president created his personal Twitter account six years before taking office. “This decision strays from our precedents, extends the scope of the First Amendment to encompass the personal social-media activity of government officials, and therefore merits review by the whole court,” the dissent argued.

"Joseph R. Biden called on President Trump Monday to drop a lawsuit against Obamacare, saying the coronavirus outbreak has underscored the importance of making affordable health care more available. Writing on the 10th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act being signed into law, Mr. Biden said it is “unconscionable” that the Trump administration would “pursue a lawsuit designed to strip millions of Americans of their health insurance and protections under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the ban on insurers denying coverage or raising premiums due to pre-existing conditions.” “No American should have the added worry right now that you are in court trying to take away their health care,” the former vice president and Democratic presidential front-runner said. “You are letting partisan rancor and politics threaten the lives of your constituents, and that is a dereliction of your sworn duty.” “I am therefore calling on each of you to drop your support of litigation to repeal the ACA,” Mr. Biden said.

"Congressional Democrats are demanding an “ideological wish list” including new collective bargaining powers for unions as they hold up a nearly $2 trillion economic package of coronavirus relief, Republicans said Monday. The Democrats’ belated list of demands includes new, tighter fuel emission standards for airlines and an expansion of wind and solar tax credits, a senior Republican aide said. “As Leader Schumer continues to hold up the desperately-needed relief package, the last-minute list of demands from Pelosi’s and Schumer’s ideological wish list are coming into focus,” the aide said of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The source said the demands “popped up after Speaker Pelosi flew back from San Francisco yesterday after taking a week off.” Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, called the new demands “disgusting.” The senior Republican aide said, “Not only are these completely unrelated to the coronavirus epidemic, they could prevent companies from participating in the loan programs altogether — directly causing unnecessary layoffs.” All Democratic senators voted against the measure on Sunday night.

Schumer and Nancy Pelosi sitting on the sidelines receiving a government paycheck while hundreds of thousands of Americans are out of work because they’ve been told they can’t go to work and they’re not receiving a penny,” he said. “What they’re doing is using this crisis to advance their ideological and political agenda. This is not a time for that.” Mr. Cornyn added, “We’re trying to get them some help as well as the small businesses that we hope will still be in existence when this virus passes, as well as try to provide some loans that will be paid back to large employers that employ hundreds of thousands of people so our economy can jump back after this temporary crisis.”  ","Dems demanding new union bargaining powers, solar tax credits in new coronavirus aid package"," -

UNEMPLOYMENT EXPANSION Establishes a new, much more generous unemployment benefit by adding $600 per week to normal state benefits for up to four months and provides an additional 13 weeks of benefits to 39 weeks of regular unemployment insurance through the end of 2020 if they are sidelined by the outbreak. The coverage would be retroactive to Jan. 27. Extends coverage to “gig” workers and independent contractors. EMERGENCY FUNDING, PUBLIC HEALTH The bill includes an additional $242 billion in additional emergency appropriations to fight the virus and shore up for safety net programs. That includes money for food stamps, child nutrition, hospitals, the Centers for Disease Control and public health and transportation agencies. The figure has gone significantly higher during talks over the weekend. The measure includes $15.6 billion to augment the food stamp program, which helps feed around 40 million Low income people per year. It’s annual budget is around $70 billion. A bipartisan package is likely to provide far more. INDUSTRY AID The initial GOP plan called for $208 billion in loans to larger businesses like airlines, which would have to be repaid, and a subsequent; a version released over the weekend called for $500 billion. Leaders are still negotiating the final number and how the money would be provided by the administration and safeguards to prevent abuses. Delays payroll tax payments by employers. They would would be able to defer payment of their 2020 payroll taxes until 2021 and 2022. STATE AID Republicans and the administration have resisted demands by Democrats and governors for aid to the states, whose governors have requested $150 billion to shore up budgets strained by large new costs and plummeting tax revenues. Negotiations are likely to produce a compromise.

"Congressional Democrats are demanding an “ideological wish list” including new collective bargaining powers for unions as they hold up a nearly $2 trillion economic package of coronavirus relief, Republicans said Monday. The Democrats’ belated list of demands includes new, tighter fuel emission standards for airlines and an expansion of wind and solar tax credits, a senior Republican aide said. “As Leader Schumer continues to hold up the desperately-needed relief package, the last-minute list of demands from Pelosi’s and Schumer’s ideological wish list are coming into focus,” the aide said of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The source said the demands “popped up after Speaker Pelosi flew back from San Francisco yesterday after taking a week off.” Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, called the new demands “disgusting.” The senior Republican aide said, “Not only are these completely unrelated to the coronavirus epidemic, they could prevent companies from participating in the loan programs altogether — directly causing unnecessary layoffs.” All Democratic senators voted against the measure on Sunday night. Negotiations with the administration are ongoing Monday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, accused Democrats of playing “partisan games” on Sunday and said, “One House Democrat, for example, said this is a ‘tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision,’ ” referring to House Majority Whip James Clyburn, South Carolina Democrat. Mr. Clyburn reportedly made the remark last Thursday in a conference call with Democratic colleagues. Mr. Cornyn, speaking on KFYO’s “The Chad Hasty Show,” said Democrats are being “completely irresponsible.” “I’m … pretty frustrated and downright angry at Sen. Schumer and Nancy Pelosi sitting on the sidelines receiving a government paycheck while hundreds of thousands of Americans are out of work because they’ve been told they can’t go to work and they’re not receiving a penny,” he said. “What they’re doing is using this crisis to advance their ideological and political agenda. This is not a time for that.” Mr. Cornyn added, “We’re trying to get them some help as well as the small businesses that we hope will still be in existence when this virus passes, as well as try to provide some loans that will be paid back to large employers that employ hundreds of thousands of people so our economy can jump back after this temporary crisis.”  ","Dems demanding new union bargaining powers, solar tax credits in new coronavirus aid package","Monday, March 23, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/23/dems-demanding-new-union-bargaining-powers-solar-t/,washington_times
"Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who suspended her presidential campaign last month, announced Monday that her husband was diagnosed and is hospitalized with COVID-19. She said he began to feel sick while she was in her home state of Minnesota and he was in Washington, D.C., so she has been advised by a doctor that she does not need a test. “I am outside the 14-day period for getting sick, my doctor has advised me to not get a test. As everyone is aware, there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere, and I don’t qualify to get one under any standard,” Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement. Her husband, John, quarantined himself when he thought he had only a cold, but once he coughed up blood, he got a chest X-ray and tested for the coronavirus. He is in a Virginia hospital due to low oxygen levels. He has pneumonia currently and is on oxygen but not a ventilator. Ms. Klobuchar said it’s a difficult time since she and her daughter cannot go visit him, but they are communicating by phone. “We love him very much and pray for his recovery. He is exhausted and sick but a very strong and resilient person,” the senator wrote.  ","Sen.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday the state is directing hospitals to increase their capacity by 50% as it grapples with its response to the expanding coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Cuomo said he hasn’t had “second thoughts” on decisions he’s made on restrictions amid the COVID-19 crisis, while acknowledging that the current way of life isn’t sustainable and that at some point you have to “open the valve.” He said there are 53,000 hospital beds but that there could be a need for 110,000 beds as more people get sick. “We are today issuing an emergency order that says to all hospitals you must increase your capacity by 50% — you must,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Find more beds, use more rooms.” He also said hospitals should try to increase their capacity by 100%. “I think it’s unreasonable to [say] to every hospital, basically, double your capacity,” he said. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say try to reach a hundred percent increase.” Mr. Cuomo on Sunday had accepted a recommendation from the Army Corps of Engineers for four temporary hospital sites in the state at the Javits Convention Center, SUNY Stony Brook, SUNY Old Westbury, and the Westchester Convention Center. “President Trump did deliver yesterday,” he said. He also said Mr. Trump agreed to waive the state’s 25% cost-sharing portion that would typically come under a federal disaster declaration for New York. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio had said Monday on CNN that public hospitals in New York City were on the verge of becoming overwhelmed if they don’t get an influx of supplies this week. Mr. Cuomo said there are now 20,875 positive coronavirus cases in the state and that 157 people have died. He said that for the moment, the state does have the capacity to get supplies like protective masks to those in need. “Today, we can get masks to anyone who needs them, and gowns. I can’t promise you next week or the week thereafter,” he said. Mr. Cuomo did hint at eventually dialing back some restrictions he and the state have imposed to try to mitigate the spread of the virus. He had already ordered that 100% of the workforce in New York stay home, except for essential workers, and that nonessential gatherings be temporarily banned. Those restrictions went into effect at 8 p.m. Sunday. “It is unsustainable to run this state or run this country with the economy closed down,” he said. “You’re doing smart public health policy and smart economic policy. I think there is a line, a dot where those two lines cross.” He said he has “no second thoughts” on actions he’s taken, like ordering all nonessential workers to stay home. “I would make the same decisions today,” he said. “At [one] point, you have to open the valve … because that is oxygen for the economy and this is not sustainable.” He also re-upped his call for Mr. Trump to implement the Defense Production Act, saying states are currently competing with one another for supplies like protective masks and ventilators. “It does not nationalize any industry. All it does is say to a factory, you must produce this quantity,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Yes, it is an assertion of government power on private sector companies — yes. But so what? This is a national emergency, and you’re paying the private sector company.” He said private companies would be paid “handsomely.” “You cannot continue to do these supplies on an ad hoc basis,” he said.

"If you’re looking for something truly inspirational to distract from the current state of things, Netflix’s “Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution”  might be just the ticket. This documentary focuses on an idyllic summer camp for kids and teens with disabilities in the Catskills in the early ‘70s that turned out to be a breeding ground for the modern disability rights movement.  Located just a short distance from Woodstock, Camp Jened in 1971 was a welcome and heady escape from the world for a group of kids with disabilities from polio to cerebral palsy. At home, when the law offered no protections or guarantees of equality, their disabilities governed their lives. The now-grown campers describe how they were excluded from many normal childhood activities and institutions, from sports to school. But at camp, they got to experience what it was like to just be young. They swam. They dated. They played sports. They goofed around. They debated. And they got to be around a vibrant group of people who saw a person first, not a disability.  Directors Nicole Newham and James LeBrecht, a Hollywood sound designer and mixer who was once a Jened camper himself, use nearly 40-year-old footage, photos and present-day interviews to bring the unique setting to life. Not only was the camp something to look forward to every year, it helped the kids see, as one puts it, that their lives could be better. That idea was enough to propel some of the campers into a lifetime of activism that resulted in real and positive changes for people living with disabilities.  Judy Heumann, who was a Jened camper and then counselor, would become a major figure in the fight for disability rights as she and others made their way to Berkeley and learned the art of the protest. At one in New York, a handful of people - many in wheelchairs - essentially shut down the city by blocking one intersection. At another, the “504 sit-in,” more than 100 people in the disabled community occupied the local offices of the Department of Health, Welfare and Education for over 25 days, demanding that the Carter Administration guarantee their civil rights. It’s a necessary and sobering look at a not too recent past when this country treated people with disabilities as barely human. The examples of their systemic exclusion from everyday society, from the seemingly small (like being turned away from ice cream shops) to the major (like being overlooked for jobs), are appalling. One soundbite has Richard Nixon bemoaning the cost of installing ramps and elevators around public transportation centers, wondering just how many people it would benefit anyway. Another sickening clip from a news broadcast featuring a very young Geraldo Rivera shows the horrifying conditions at Willowbrook, a state-run institution in New York for people with disabilities.  But what makes “Crip Camp,” which was produced by Barack and Michelle Obama, so wonderful are the people who attended that camp so many years ago and the joy you see in their faces recounting those youthful days. It’s a worthy story even without the coda of the fight for their civil rights. You never know where empowerment might stem from: Sometimes, it’s a hippie camp in the Catskills.  “Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution,” a Netflix release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for “some language including sexual references.” Running time: 106 minutes.

"A federal appeals court denied rehearing a challenge by President Trump over blocking of critics on Twitter after a three-judge panel ruled the move violated the First Amendment. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order Monday rejecting an appeal for the full court to review its prior ruling that Mr. Trump’s Twitter account is a public forum, and therefore he cannot block his critics on the social media site. “When the president creates such a public forum, he violates the First Amendment when he excludes persons from the dialogue because they express views with which he disagrees,” wrote Judge Barrington Parker, a Nixon appointee. Nine judges on the 2nd Circuit considered rehearing the case, with two of the active judges on the circuit not taking part. The majority declined to hear the appeal, but Trump-appointed Judges Michael Park and Richard Sullivan would have taken up the case, reasoning the president created his personal Twitter account six years before taking office. “This decision strays from our precedents, extends the scope of the First Amendment to encompass the personal social-media activity of government officials, and therefore merits review by the whole court,” the dissent argued. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year against a public official in a similar First Amendment challenge. A Virginia resident had been temporarily blocked on Facebook. The court sided with the individual over the public official in that dispute too.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Monday that Senate Democrats must drop their objections to a nearly $2 trillion economic relief package before midnight to help businesses and workers hurt by the coronavirus outbreak. “We need to pass this today,” Mr. Mnuchin told CNBC host Maria Bartiromo. “We are working round the clock today to make sure the Senate passes this today.”He rejected Democrats’ complaints that $500 billion in the bill to help corporations amounts to a “slush fund” to bail out big companies. “This isn’t corporate welfare,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “This helps all American workers. There’s enormous bipartisan support for this. We’re using all the tools we have, and we’ve told Congress, we need additional tools ASAP.” He said the measure will complement a series of emergency actions by the Federal Reserve to pump more cash and credit into financial markets and businesses. “This legislation is now approximately $2 trillion,” he said. “Part of that is $500 billion, which is not a slush fund — that we can use in working with the Federal Reserve that will provide another $4 trillion of potential liquidity into the market. That’s on top of the Fed’s balance sheet.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has scheduled another vote for Monday on the measure, after all Democrats voted against proceeding with the bill on Sunday evening. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said the measure doesn’t provide relief for hospitals or localities. Mr. Mnuchin said the bill provides Small Business Administration loans for any business with 500 or fewer employees to cover two months of payroll and “some overhead.” He said if companies hire back their workers, “the government will forgive that loan.” Asked if the president is considering a nationwide shutdown, Mr. Mnuchin replied, “The president will decide. The president has not made that decision. The president is hopeful that the policies and procedures put in place will kill this virus quickly.” Mr. Mnuchin, who was meeting again with Senate leaders on Monday morning, said it’s possible the administration would come back to Congress for another rescue package before summer. “This legislation prepares us for what I would say the 10- to 12-week period,” he said. “But I hope that we don’t need to last that long. And for whatever reason [if] this turns out that it’s going to last longer, we’ll go back to Congress.”  ",Mnuchin calls on Senate Democrats to approve economic package today ,"Monday, March 23, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/23/mnuchin-calls-senate-democrats-approve-economic-pa/,washington_times
"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - The Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by a gun shop that challenged Gov. Tom Wolf’s authority to shutter businesses determined to be “non-life-sustaining,” paving the way for enforcement to begin Monday. Without comment, a narrow majority of the state’s high court late Sunday denied the petition by a gun shop, a gun purchaser and a law firm to have Wolf’s shutdown order thrown out. The lawsuit had claimed Wolf’s edict violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms and other constitutional rights. The court also said a legal challenge to Wolf’s order to close law offices had become moot because of subsequent action that lets lawyers work from their physical locations to perform duties deemed essential by county or federal judges. The Democratic governor has ordered all nonessential businesses to close their physical locations indefinitely, saying the measure is needed to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.  In a dissenting statement joined by two other justices, Justice David Wecht said Wolf’s order amounts to “an absolute and indefinite prohibition upon the acquisition of firearms by the citizens of this commonwealth - a result in clear tension with the Second Amendment” and the state constitution. He called on Wolf to make some allowance for the in-person sale of firearms. ___ ENFORCEMENT BEGINS Wolf’s order to close down the physical locations of businesses deemed not essential to sustain life is being enforced as of Monday morning.  The Wolf administration has been sorting through nearly 10,000 waiver requests, saying their only consideration is health and safety. State police spokesman Ryan Tarkowski said Monday that troopers are aiming at voluntary compliance, “not coming in with a hammer at 8:01” a.m., when the enforcement period began.  “Our goal is not to write a giant pile of citations,” he said. Tarkowski said people who want to report a business that remains open should use non-emergency numbers to call state police or local police. “Please don’t call 911,” Tarkowski said. ___ WHAT’S OPEN, CLOSED Businesses that remain open to the public include grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and motels, beer distributors, laundromats and gas stations. Restaurants are only open for take-out orders. The open list also includes farms, mines, food production and some manufacturing.  Car dealers, clothing stores and other retailers, salons and entertainment venues are among those on the shuttered list. On Monday, Pennsylvania officials extended the closure of facilities in state parks and forests until April 30. People with reservations for campgrounds, cabins and other overnight accommodations will get refunds. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources said trails, lakes, forests, roads and parking areas remain open to the public, but urged people to practice social distancing and avoid crowded parking lots and trailheads. The closure includes restrooms. ___ CASES Pennsylvania health officials on Monday reported 165 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Pennsylvania, for a total of more than 640 in 34 counties. Three deaths have been reported. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell slammed Democrats for delaying the “phase three” coronavirus aid package Monday, accusing them of pursuing partisan priorities over the public good. The nearly $2 trillion stimulus package is struggling to pass procedural hurdles in the Senate after Democrats introduced demands to address climate change. “Tax credits for solar energy and wind energy. Provisions to force employers to give special new treatment to Big Labor. And listen to this — new emissions standards for the airlines. Are you kidding me?” Mr. McConnell said in a heated speech on the Senate floor. The Kentucky Republican warned that Democrats will end up meeting their green initiatives if the majority of American workers end up getting laid off during the economic crisis. He directed much of his frustration at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose chamber was out on recess last week and is introducing her own bill later Monday afternoon. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, in turn, accused Mr. McConnell of taking time away from the ongoing negotiations by giving “partisan speeches” on the Senate floor. He downplayed the delay, saying he was confident a deal could be reached Monday. “Mr. McConnell continues to set arbitrary vote deadlines when the matter of real importance is the status of the bipartisan negotiations,” the New York Democrat said. “The bill still includes something that most Americans don’t want to see: large corporate bailouts with almost no strings attached,” he added. Mr. Schumer didn’t specifically mention the green initiatives that Democrats are pursuing, but rather focused on their top asks for a massive surge of funds for unemployment insurance and healthcare systems. Mr. McConnell argued that they’ve addressed those priorities in their bill. Senate Democrats on Sunday evening blocked a motion to advance the GOP’s framework for the coronavirus aid bill that senators had been negotiating throughout the weekend. The Senate is set to attempt to advance their version on the phase three package Monday, starting with a series of procedural votes Monday afternoon.

"Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez on Monday said the party is planning for “every eventuality” for its national convention in July amid the coronavirus outbreak. “We’re obviously in regular touch with both federal, state and local officials. We are planning and hoping for the best, but planning for every eventuality and safety will always be paramount in planning the convention,” Mr. Perez said on a conference call with reporters on a separate topic. “We still have roughly four months until the convention and so we will continue to be in regular contact with all of the relevant stakeholders, including but not limited to public health professionals federally and at a state and local level in Wisconsin,” he said. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place July 13-16 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But it’s unclear how such a massive event can go on as scheduled if current guidance and restrictions on crowds are still in place down the line. Earlier this month, when the crisis was not nearly at the point it is now, Mr. Perez had said he wasn’t contemplating rules changes to hold a virtual or online convention, for example. The Republican National Convention is scheduled to take place from Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte, N.C. Michael Whatley, who chairs the North Carolina Republican Party, said over the weekend that the RNC is “firmly committed” to moving forward with its convention at this time. “However, the RNC is closely monitoring conditions regarding the COVID-19 outbreak and is working closely with federal, state, and local governments in order to determine whether they will need to make any changes to the schedule,” Mr. Whatley said in an open letter to state Republicans. Mr. Whatley also said that remaining county and district conventions will be conducted virtually via teleconference and online platforms. He said that “at this time,” they plan on holding the state party convention, set for May 14-17 in Greenville, as scheduled.

"More than 50 leading U.S. economists and professors have signed an open letter warning that the proposed Medicare for All plans to place Americans on a government-run system would trigger shortages, degrade quality, and discourage medical innovation. “Americans should have access to the health care they need and have insurance protection for medical expenses they cannot afford,” said the letter released last week. “We, the undersigned economists, believe the proposed Medicare for All plans would lead to shortages throughout the health sector that would restrict access to care, undermine quality, lead to innovation-stifling price controls, and adversely impact the economy.” The 55 signers include Michael Boskin, who chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President George H. W. Bush; former Office of Management and Budget director James Miller III, and Chapman University professor Vernon L. Smith, a 2002 Nobel Laureate in economic sciences. Medicare for All, a form of universal health care, has gained popularity with Democratic voters and candidates, although the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, suggested earlier this month that he would veto any such legislation. In their letter, the economists said that the nation “does not have a properly functioning market in the health sector due in part to the reimburse-the-supplier insurance model, but the solution is not more and bigger government.” “The solution is creating a more efficient market for medical care and medical insurance that would restrain costs through competition, improved and transparent information, and consumer incentives rather than through destructive methods such as price controls and limits on private care choices,” they said. The Coalition Against Socialized Medicine, a free-market group whose members include the American Conservative Union, Heritage Action and FreedomWorks, said the COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the importance of encouraging innovation in health care. “Unfortunately, the stakes now have been put into stark relief as the world faces the grim challenge of the coronavirus,” said coalition executive director Marc Palazzo. “As humanity battles this common threat together, our hopes are pinned to the very innovation that these policies would ultimately destroy.” “Coronavirus Vindicates Capitalism: Drug companies will save lives, even as Bernie Sanders is denouncing them,” from @KimStrassel via @WSJopinion. https://t.co/ORSX3KlHWA Sen. Bernie Sanders, Mr. Biden’s only remaining challenger in the primary race, argued at last week’s CNN debate that the COVID-19 pandemic “exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current healthcare system.” “We are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re spending so much money, and yet we are not even prepared for this pandemic.” Mr. Biden countered by noting that Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus, has universal government-provided health care. “With all due respect to Medicare for All, you have a single-payer system in Italy. It doesn’t work there,” Mr. Biden said.

"The World Health Organization said Monday it needs the Group of 20 nations to increase the production of hospital gear and drop export bans to ensure that countries with the greatest need are equipped to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. “Measures put in place to slow the spread of the virus may have unintended consequences by exacerbating shortages of essential protective gear, and the materials needed to make them,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus. “Addressing the global shortage of these life-saving tools means addressing every part of the supply chain, from raw materials to finished product.” Mr. Ghebreyesus said he will be speaking to G-20 leaders soon. “We need unity in the G-20 countries who have more than 80% of the global GDP,” he said. The search for personal protective equipment, or PPE, has dominated the debate in the U.S., where a set of governors has called on President Trump to use the Defense Production Act to compel production from the private sector and coordinate shipments. Governors say the lack of federal direction is forcing them to bid against other states and pay exorbitant prices for gear. Mr. Trump says he doesn’t want to “nationalize” industries and that many companies are stepping up to fill the need. Researchers, meanwhile, are scrambling to figure out if certain drugs might be effective against the coronavirus and its disease, COVID-19. Mr. Ghebreyesus said nations should join a WHO initiative, the SOLIDARITY Trial, that’s designed to share information from clinical trials across the globe. Countries are trying an antiviral known as remdesivir, a malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine and a pair of HIV drugs on COVID-19 patients to see if any of them are safe and effective. Also Monday, WHO said the future of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo is “under close observation.” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, for the first time, suggested the games might have to be postponed instead of starting as planned in late July. Mr. Trump, who is close to Mr. Abe, says the Japanese leader will make the right call. “We will be guided by the wishes of Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a great friend of the United States and a man who has done a magnificent job on the Olympic Venue, as to attending the Olympic Games in Japan,” President Trump tweeted. “He will make the proper decision!” The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It’s infected over 350,000 people on six continents and killed over 15,000 people, including nearly 500 in the U.S. “The pandemic is accelerating,” Mr. Tedros said. “It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 cases and just four days for the third 100,000 cases. You can see how the virus is accelerating.” “But we’re not prisoners to statistics,” he said. “We can change the trajectory of this pandemic.” He compared it to a soccer game in which attacking the goal is important — not just defending. Mr. Tedros riffed on the metaphor as part of WHO’s partnership soccer governing body, FIFA, which launched a campaign to “kick COVID-19 out.” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said global stars will press the public to take the pathogen seriously and follow public health advice, as they join fans in staying at home. “In my case, I’m not able to be together with my colleges, with my teammates to do what I love, what is my passion,” Liverpool FC goalkeeper Alisson Becker, a Brazilian, told the WHO press briefing via video feed. “I was made for playing football.” “It’s important in this moment,” he said, “that we have the right information and follow the right information.” European leagues have suspended club play and the continent’s governing body, UEFA, delayed its Euro 2020 tournament among national teams until summer 2021. “Many football matches have stopped but our collaboration has become more important during this difficult time,” Mr. Tedros said.

"Joseph R. Biden said President Trump’s slow response to the coronavirus outbreak has cost the nation and said the GOP’s push for a “blank check” bailout for big corporations is misguided. Mr. Biden said Mr. Trump ignored warning signs and downplayed the threat of the virus, and said he hopes the response from the administration improves. “My point is that the mindset that was slow to recognize the problem in the first place — to treat it with the seriousness it deserved — is still too much a part of how the president is addressing the problem,” the Democratic presidential front-runner and former vice president said. “Trump keeps saying he is a wartime president. Well, start to act like one,” he said. Mr. Biden’s comments came during the first live briefing that he has promised to deliver as a way to explain to voters how he would handle the COVID-19 response and to combat false and misleading statements from Mr. Trump. The virus has upended the 2020 presidential race, pulling Mr. Biden and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont off the campaign trail and forcing them to come up with ways to stay relevant during the national emergency. Mr. Biden said the federal government must boost hospital capacity, increase the production of protective gear for frontline responders, and increase the availability of ventilators. He said the federal government’s focus should be on providing the resources needed to keep workers on the payroll and protect small businesses. Mr. Biden called for sustained unemployment benefits. He said Social Security checks should be “boosted” and said student loans need to be “forgiven for now.” “Unfortunately as of last night, President Trump and Mitch McConnell were offering a plan to let big corporations off the hook,” Mr. Biden said. “They proposed a $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions.” The former vice president said big companies need assistance, but the current plan equates to “blank checks.” “For workers and families and small businesses, we should be focused on them. The no-strings corporate bailout makes no sense,” he said.  “[When] corporations take money from taxpayers, they have to make an enforceable commitment that they will keep workers on the payroll.”  ",Joe Biden casts Trump's response to coronavirus outbreak as too slow,"Monday, March 23, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/23/joe-biden-casts-donald-trumps-response-coronavirus/,washington_times
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday the state is directing hospitals to increase their capacity by 50% as it grapples with its response to the expanding coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Cuomo said he hasn’t had “second thoughts” on decisions he’s made on restrictions amid the COVID-19 crisis, while acknowledging that the current way of life isn’t sustainable and that at some point you have to “open the valve.” He said there are 53,000 hospital beds but that there could be a need for 110,000 beds as more people get sick. “We are today issuing an emergency order that says to all hospitals you must increase your capacity by 50% — you must,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Find more beds, use more rooms.” He also said hospitals should try to increase their capacity by 100%. “I think it’s unreasonable to [say] to every hospital, basically, double your capacity,” he said. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say try to reach a hundred percent increase.” Mr. Cuomo on Sunday had accepted a recommendation from the Army Corps of Engineers for four temporary hospital sites in the state at the Javits Convention Center, SUNY Stony Brook, SUNY Old Westbury, and the Westchester Convention Center. “President Trump did deliver yesterday,” he said. He also said Mr. Trump agreed to waive the state’s 25% cost-sharing portion that would typically come under a federal disaster declaration for New York. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio had said Monday on CNN that public hospitals in New York City were on the verge of becoming overwhelmed if they don’t get an influx of supplies this week. Mr. Cuomo said there are now 20,875 positive coronavirus cases in the state and that 157 people have died. He said that for the moment, the state does have the capacity to get supplies like protective masks to those in need. “Today, we can get masks to anyone who needs them, and gowns. I can’t promise you next week or the week thereafter,” he said. Mr. Cuomo did hint at eventually dialing back some restrictions he and the state have imposed to try to mitigate the spread of the virus. He had already ordered that 100% of the workforce in New York stay home, except for essential workers, and that nonessential gatherings be temporarily banned. Those restrictions went into effect at 8 p.m. Sunday. “It is unsustainable to run this state or run this country with the economy closed down,” he said. “You’re doing smart public health policy and smart economic policy. I think there is a line, a dot where those two lines cross.” He said he has “no second thoughts” on actions he’s taken, like ordering all nonessential workers to stay home. “I would make the same decisions today,” he said. “At [one] point, you have to open the valve … because that is oxygen for the economy and this is not sustainable.” He also re-upped his call for Mr. Trump to implement the Defense Production Act, saying states are currently competing with one another for supplies like protective masks and ventilators. “It does not nationalize any industry. All it does is say to a factory, you must produce this quantity,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Yes, it is an assertion of government power on private sector companies — yes. But so what? This is a national emergency, and you’re paying the private sector company.” He said private companies would be paid “handsomely.” “You cannot continue to do these supplies on an ad hoc basis,” he said.

"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf plans to order residents of the state’s hardest-hit areas to stay home to help combat the spread of the new coronavirus that has already sickened hundreds and caused three deaths statewide, his spokeswoman said Monday. Wolf will issue the stay-at-home order for Philadelphia and its surrounding counties; Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh; and Monroe County in the Pocono Mountains, said spokeswoman Lyndsay Kensinger. Together, those counties account for 75% of the state’s confirmed cases of COVID-19. Details about the directive, which will cover 5.5 million people, or more than 40% of the state’s population, are expected Monday afternoon. It’s the latest in a series of progressively tougher measures imposed by Wolf in the face of a global pandemic that state officials say threatens to swamp hospitals and spike the death toll. Wolf had already closed schools and ordered all “non-life-sustaining” businesses to shutter their physical locations, an edict that state police and other government agencies began enforcing Monday morning. ___ COURT DISMISSES LAWSUIT ON NONESSENTIAL BUSINESSES  Late Sunday, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by a gun shop that challenged Wolf’s authority to shutter businesses deemed nonessential. Without comment, a narrow majority of the state’s high court denied the petition by a gun shop, a gun purchaser and a law firm to have Wolf’s shutdown order thrown out. The lawsuit had claimed Wolf’s edict violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms and other constitutional rights. The court also said a legal challenge to Wolf’s order to close law offices had become moot because of subsequent action that lets lawyers work from their physical locations to perform duties deemed essential by county or federal judges. The Democratic governor has ordered all nonessential businesses to close their physical locations indefinitely, saying the measure is needed to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.  In a dissenting statement joined by two other justices, Justice David Wecht said Wolf’s order amounts to “an absolute and indefinite prohibition upon the acquisition of firearms by the citizens of this commonwealth - a result in clear tension with the Second Amendment” and the state constitution. He called on Wolf to make some allowance for the in-person sale of firearms. ___ ENFORCEMENT BEGINS Wolf’s order to close down the physical locations of businesses deemed not essential to sustain life is being enforced as of Monday morning.  The Wolf administration has been sorting through nearly 10,000 waiver requests, saying their only consideration is health and safety. State police spokesman Ryan Tarkowski said Monday that troopers are aiming at voluntary compliance, “not coming in with a hammer at 8:01” a.m., when the enforcement period began.  “Our goal is not to write a giant pile of citations,” he said. Tarkowski said people who want to report a business that remains open should use non-emergency numbers to call state police or local police. “Please don’t call 911,” Tarkowski said. ___ WHAT’S OPEN, CLOSED Businesses that remain open to the public include grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and motels, beer distributors, laundromats and gas stations. Restaurants are only open for take-out orders. The open list also includes farms, mines, food production and some manufacturing.  Car dealers, clothing stores and other retailers, salons and entertainment venues are among those on the shuttered list. On Monday, Pennsylvania officials extended the closure of facilities in state parks and forests until April 30. People with reservations for campgrounds, cabins and other overnight accommodations will get refunds. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources said trails, lakes, forests, roads and parking areas remain open to the public, but urged people to practice social distancing and avoid crowded parking lots and trailheads. The closure includes restrooms. ___ CASES Pennsylvania health officials on Monday reported 165 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Pennsylvania, for a total of more than 640 in 34 counties. Three deaths have been reported. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Speaker Nancy Pelosi outlined the priorities that House Democrats will include in their phase three coronavirus economic package. “The Senate Republicans’ bill, as presented, put corporations first, not workers and families. Today, House Democrats will unveil a bill that takes responsibility for the health, wages and well-being of America’s workers,” Mrs. Pelosi said in a statement. The bill includes funds to shore up resources and equipment for health care institutions and stronger protection for workers on the front line of fighting the disease. It will require any funds given to corporations hit hard by the economic ripple effects go toward workers, restricting them from using it for CEOs or shareholders. To get more cash flow to the American public, the Democrats’ plan will include both direct payments and expands the tax credits for earned income and children, while expanding worker leave benefits. Democrats also aim to address the impact the coronavirus has had on the election — several states struggled with their primaries as health advisories cracked down on large gatherings last week. The bill would give billions in grants to states and require that they extend the deadline for early and absentee voting. The bill will be formally rolled out Monday afternoon. Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, has come under strong backlash from Senate Republicans for pursuing her own plan, making it more difficult for them to get their package over procedural hurdles after a weekend of negotiations. “We were this close,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. “But then, yesterday morning, the Speaker of the House flew back from San Francisco, and suddenly the Senate’s serious bipartisan process turned into this left-wing episode of ‘Supermarket Sweep.’ Unrelated issues left and right.”  ",Nancy Pelosi previews Democratic priorities for House coronavirus package,"Monday, March 23, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/23/nancy-pelosi-previews-democratic-priorities-house-/,washington_times
"Congressional Democrats are demanding an “ideological wish list” including new collective bargaining powers for unions as they hold up a nearly $2 trillion economic package of coronavirus relief, Republicans said Monday. The Democrats’ belated list of demands includes new, tighter fuel emission standards for airlines and an expansion of wind and solar tax credits, a senior Republican aide said. “As Leader Schumer continues to hold up the desperately-needed relief package, the last-minute list of demands from Pelosi’s and Schumer’s ideological wish list are coming into focus,” the aide said of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mr. Schumer said Monday that Democrats are seeking “protections for workers and labor [at] companies that are getting hundreds of billions of dollars.” “That is a wish list for workers, nobody else,” Mr. Schumer said. “These are not extraneous issues. We are looking for protection.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of the Democrats’ wish list, “Are you kidding me? This is not a juicy political opportunity. This is a national emergency.” Mr. McConnell described the Democrats’ push for renewable energy tax credits as “completely, non-germane wishlist items.” The Republican source said the demands “popped up after Speaker Pelosi flew back from San Francisco yesterday after taking a week off.” Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, called the new demands “disgusting.” The senior Republican aide said, “Not only are these completely unrelated to the coronavirus epidemic, they could prevent companies from participating in the loan programs altogether — directly causing unnecessary layoffs.” All Democratic senators voted against the measure on Sunday night. Negotiations with the administration are ongoing Monday. Mr. McConnell, Kentucky Republican, accused Democrats of playing “partisan games” on Sunday and said, “One House Democrat, for example, said this is a ‘tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision,’ ” referring to House Majority Whip James Clyburn, South Carolina Democrat. Mr. Clyburn reportedly made the remark last Thursday in a conference call with Democratic colleagues. Mr. Cornyn, speaking on KFYO’s “The Chad Hasty Show,” said Democrats are being “completely irresponsible.” “I’m … pretty frustrated and downright angry at Sen. Schumer and Nancy Pelosi sitting on the sidelines receiving a government paycheck while hundreds of thousands of Americans are out of work because they’ve been told they can’t go to work and they’re not receiving a penny,” he said. “What they’re doing is using this crisis to advance their ideological and political agenda. This is not a time for that.” Mr. Cornyn added, “We’re trying to get them some help as well as the small businesses that we hope will still be in existence when this virus passes, as well as try to provide some loans that will be paid back to large employers that employ hundreds of thousands of people so our economy can jump back after this temporary crisis.”  ","Dems demanding new union bargaining powers, solar tax credits in new coronavirus aid package"," -

"HOUSTON (AP) - A 42-year-old Mexican man died in a South Texas hospital while being held pending his deportation, immigration authorities said Monday. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified the man as Ramiro Hernandez Ibarra and said he died Saturday after being hospitalized Thursday. ICE said Hernandez’s preliminary cause of death was complications related to septic shock but did not provide further details. Hernandez is the 10th person to die in ICE custody since October, the start of the governmental fiscal year. Eight people died in the previous fiscal year. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, immigration advocates have criticized the medical care ICE provides to people it detains and called on ICE to release some of its more than 37,000 detainees. About 47% of those people are being held on non-criminal violations of immigration law, according to the agency’s most recent statistics. As of last week, ICE had not confirmed any cases of COVID-19 in its facilities. The agency has placed sick detainees under observation and others in quarantine at several of its jails, including about 60 people confined to a dorm in the Pine Prairie facility in rural Louisiana, according to a lawyer who has spoken to detainees there. ICE says Hernandez had repeatedly crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and voluntarily returned to Mexico eight times. He was most recently taken into ICE’s custody in December after he was arrested and jailed for domestic violence at the Hidalgo County Jail.

"More than 50 leading U.S. economists and professors have signed an open letter warning that the proposed “Medicare for All” plans to place Americans on a government-run system would trigger shortages, degrade quality and discourage medical innovation. “Americans should have access to the health care they need and have insurance protection for medical expenses they cannot afford,” said the letter released last week. “We, the undersigned economists, believe the proposed Medicare for All plans would lead to shortages throughout the health sector that would restrict access to care, undermine quality, lead to innovation-stifling price controls, and adversely impact the economy.” The 55 signers include Michael Boskin, who chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President George H.W. Bush; former Office of Management and Budget director James Miller III, and Chapman University professor Vernon L. Smith, a 2002 Nobel Laureate in economic sciences. Medicare for All, a form of universal health care, has gained popularity with Democratic voters and candidates, although the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, suggested earlier this month that he would veto any such legislation. In their letter, the economists said that the nation “does not have a properly functioning market in the health sector due in part to the reimburse-the-supplier insurance model, but the solution is not more and bigger government.” “The solution is creating a more efficient market for medical care and medical insurance that would restrain costs through competition, improved and transparent information, and consumer incentives rather than through destructive methods such as price controls and limits on private care choices,” they said. The Coalition Against Socialized Medicine, a free-market group whose members include the American Conservative Union, Heritage Action and FreedomWorks, said the COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the importance of encouraging innovation in health care. “Unfortunately, the stakes now have been put into stark relief as the world faces the grim challenge of the coronavirus,” said coalition executive director Marc Palazzo. “As humanity battles this common threat together, our hopes are pinned to the very innovation that these policies would ultimately destroy.” “Coronavirus Vindicates Capitalism: Drug companies will save lives, even as Bernie Sanders is denouncing them,” from @KimStrassel via @WSJopinion. https://t.co/ORSX3KlHWA Vermont Sen. Bernard Sanders, Mr. Biden’s only remaining challenger in the primary race, argued at last week’s CNN debate that the COVID-19 pandemic “exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current healthcare system.” “We are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re spending so much money, and yet we are not even prepared for this pandemic.” Mr. Biden countered by noting that Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus, has universal government-provided health care. “With all due respect to Medicare for All, you have a single-payer system in Italy. It doesn’t work there,” Mr. Biden said.  ","Leading economists warn 'Medicare for All' would trigger shortages, stifle innovation"," -

"BOSTON (AP) - Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker ordered all nonessential businesses to close by Tuesday afternoon and remain closed until at least April 7 in an effort to slow down the spread of the new coronavirus. The Republican governor also said Monday the state Department of Health has issued a stay-at-home advisory, but stressed that it wasn’t a shelter-in-place order. “Everyone is advised to stay home and limit all unnecessary activities,” he said at a news conference. “We’re asking everyone to use their common sense, think about the impact this virus is having on the sick and elderly, and to limit their interactions with other people.” He said it was OK to take a walk at the park while keeping appropriate social distancing, but advised against pickup basketball and touch football games, or other activities that bring people into close contact with others.  Essential businesses include supermarkets and the businesses that support them, pharmacies, gas stations, and manufacturers of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. Although medical marijuana facilities will be allowed to stay open, recreational pot shops are considered nonessential and must close, he said. Restaurants will be allowed to stay open for takeout and delivery only. There have been nearly 650 positive cases of the coronavirus in Massachusetts and five deaths as of Sunday, public health officials said. ___ INMATES TEST POSITIVE Three inmates at a Massachusetts prison have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, officials said. The inmates at the Massachusetts Treatment Center in Bridgewater have been quarantined from the general population, authorities said. One officer at the prison has also reported testing positive and has been told to stay home and follow their doctor’s orders, they said. The Massachusetts Treatment Center is a medium-security facility that houses people convicted of sex crimes and those who have been civilly committed as sexually dangerous persons. ___ IMMIGRANT DETAINEES SEEK RELEASE More than 50 immigrant detainees at the Bristol County House of Corrections are complaining about overcrowding and possible exposure to the new coronavirus. The detainees, in a letter made public Friday, called for jail officials to immediately release those who have serious medical conditions, are considered a low public-safety risk, or who have agreed to leave the country immediately.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Monday that Senate Democrats must drop their objections to a nearly $2 trillion economic relief package before midnight to help businesses and workers hurt by the coronavirus outbreak. “We need to pass this today,” Mr. Mnuchin told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “We are working round the clock today to make sure the Senate passes this today.”He rejected Democrats’ complaints that $500 billion in the bill to help corporations amounts to a “slush fund” to bail out big companies. “This isn’t corporate welfare,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “This helps all American workers. There’s enormous bipartisan support for this. We’re using all the tools we have, and we’ve told Congress, we need additional tools ASAP.” He said the measure will complement a series of emergency actions by the Federal Reserve to pump more cash and credit into financial markets and businesses. “This legislation is now approximately $2 trillion,” he said. “Part of that is $500 billion, which is not a slush fund — that we can use in working with the Federal Reserve that will provide another $4 trillion of potential liquidity into the market. That’s on top of the Fed’s balance sheet.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has scheduled another vote for Monday on the measure, after all Democrats voted against proceeding with the bill on Sunday evening. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said the measure doesn’t provide relief for hospitals or localities. Mr. Mnuchin said the bill provides Small Business Administration loans for any business with 500 or fewer employees to cover two months of payroll and “some overhead.” He said if companies hire back their workers, “the government will forgive that loan.” Asked if the president is considering a nationwide shutdown, Mr. Mnuchin replied, “The president will decide. The president has not made that decision. The president is hopeful that the policies and procedures put in place will kill this virus quickly.” Mr. Mnuchin, who was meeting again with Senate leaders on Monday morning, said it’s possible the administration would come back to Congress for another rescue package before summer. “This legislation prepares us for what I would say the 10- to 12-week period,” he said. “But I hope that we don’t need to last that long. And for whatever reason [if] this turns out that it’s going to last longer, we’ll go back to Congress.”  ",Mnuchin calls on Senate Democrats to approve economic package today ," -

"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday ordered residents of Pennsylvania’s hardest-hit areas to stay home for at least two weeks to help combat the spread of the new coronavirus that has already sickened hundreds and caused six deaths statewide. He also shuttered all schools statewide for an additional two weeks. Noting that Philadelphia has already ordered residents to remain home, Wolf issued his own stay-at-home order for the counties around the city; for Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh; and for Monroe County in the Pocono Mountains. Together, those counties account for 75% of the state’s confirmed cases of COVID-19. Wolf said the administration wanted to take a “measured approach” to the crisis and expressed hope that if the coronavirus could be largely contained to the most heavily impacted counties, he could avoid extending his stay-at-home order to the entire state. The order was to take effect at 8 p.m. Monday. In all, 5.5 million people, or more than 40% of the state’s population, have been ordered to stay home. Wolf said residents will be able to leave their homes for “allowable activities,” including trips to the grocery store and the pharmacy. He did not say how it would be enforced. Wolf has imposed a series of progressively tougher measures in the face of a global pandemic that state officials say threatens to swamp hospitals and spike the death toll. The governor has already closed schools and ordered all “non-life-sustaining” businesses to shutter their physical locations, an edict that state police and other government agencies began enforcing Monday morning after Wolf beat back a pair of legal challenges. “The novel coronavirus has halted life as we knew it,” Wolf said Monday. “I won’t pretend that things will not get worse before they get better.” ___ COURT DISMISSES LAWSUIT ON NONESSENTIAL BUSINESSES  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by a gun shop that challenged Wolf’s authority to shutter businesses deemed nonessential. Without comment, a narrow majority of the state’s high court late Sunday denied the petition by a gun shop, a gun purchaser and a law firm to have Wolf’s shutdown order thrown out. The lawsuit had claimed Wolf’s edict violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms and other constitutional rights. The court said a separate legal challenge to Wolf’s order to close law offices had become moot because of subsequent action that lets lawyers work from their physical locations to perform duties deemed essential by county or federal judges. The Democratic governor has ordered all nonessential businesses to close their physical locations indefinitely, saying the measure is needed to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.

He called on Wolf to make some allowance for the in-person sale of firearms. ___ ENFORCEMENT BEGINS Wolf’s order to close down the physical locations of businesses deemed not essential to sustain life is being enforced as of Monday morning.  The Wolf administration has been sorting through nearly 10,000 waiver requests, saying their only consideration is health and safety. State police spokesman Ryan Tarkowski said Monday that troopers are aiming at voluntary compliance, “not coming in with a hammer at 8:01” a.m., when the enforcement period began.  “Our goal is not to write a giant pile of citations,” he said.

Restaurants are only open for take-out orders. The open list also includes farms, mines, food production and some manufacturing.  Car dealers, clothing stores and other retailers, salons and entertainment venues are among those on the shuttered list.

"Senate Democrats blocked their GOP counterparts’ “phase three” coronavirus aid bill for a second time Monday afternoon. The motion failed on a 49-46 vote. It needed to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass. The motion would have begun debate on the package itself. The bill has stalled in the chamber as lawmakers haggle over details within the economic stimulus package. Republicans accused Democrats of prioritizing an ideological wish list over a bipartisan agreement. “Are you kidding me? This is not a juicy political opportunity. This is a national emergency,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Meanwhile, one of the Democrats’ chief complaints is that  Republicans still have too much wiggle room in their package for large-scale corporations that will receive federal loans. Leadership on both sides of the aisle are still hoping to reach a bill by the end of Monday. At the same time that the procedural vote failed in the Senate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled her chamber’s own version of a “phase three” package.

"Congressional Democrats are demanding an “ideological wish list” including new collective bargaining powers for unions as they hold up a nearly $2 trillion economic package of coronavirus relief, Republicans said Monday. The Democrats’ belated list of demands includes new, tighter fuel emission standards for airlines and an expansion of wind and solar tax credits, a senior Republican aide said. “As Leader Schumer continues to hold up the desperately-needed relief package, the last-minute list of demands from Pelosi’s and Schumer’s ideological wish list are coming into focus,” the aide said of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mr. Schumer said Monday that Democrats are seeking “protections for workers and labor [at] companies that are getting hundreds of billions of dollars.” “That is a wish list for workers, nobody else,” Mr. Schumer said. “These are not extraneous issues. We are looking for protection.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of the Democrats’ wish list, “Are you kidding me? This is not a juicy political opportunity. This is a national emergency.” Mr. McConnell described the Democrats’ push for renewable energy tax credits as “completely, non-germane wishlist items.” The Republican source said the demands “popped up after Speaker Pelosi flew back from San Francisco yesterday after taking a week off.” Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, called the new demands “disgusting.” The senior Republican aide said, “Not only are these completely unrelated to the coronavirus epidemic, they could prevent companies from participating in the loan programs altogether — directly causing unnecessary layoffs.” All Democratic senators voted against the measure on Sunday night. Negotiations with the administration are ongoing Monday. Mr. McConnell, Kentucky Republican, accused Democrats of playing “partisan games” on Sunday and said, “One House Democrat, for example, said this is a ‘tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision,’ ” referring to House Majority Whip James Clyburn, South Carolina Democrat. Mr. Clyburn reportedly made the remark last Thursday in a conference call with Democratic colleagues. Mr. Cornyn, speaking on KFYO’s “The Chad Hasty Show,” said Democrats are being “completely irresponsible.” “I’m … pretty frustrated and downright angry at Sen. Schumer and Nancy Pelosi sitting on the sidelines receiving a government paycheck while hundreds of thousands of Americans are out of work because they’ve been told they can’t go to work and they’re not receiving a penny,” he said. “What they’re doing is using this crisis to advance their ideological and political agenda. This is not a time for that.” Mr. Cornyn added, “We’re trying to get them some help as well as the small businesses that we hope will still be in existence when this virus passes, as well as try to provide some loans that will be paid back to large employers that employ hundreds of thousands of people so our economy can jump back after this temporary crisis.”  ","Dems demanding new union bargaining powers, solar tax credits in new coronavirus aid package","Monday, March 23, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/23/dems-demanding-new-union-bargaining-powers-solar-t/,washington_times
"More than 50 leading U.S. economists and professors have signed an open letter warning that the proposed “Medicare for All” plans to place Americans on a government-run system would trigger shortages, degrade quality and discourage medical innovation. “Americans should have access to the health care they need and have insurance protection for medical expenses they cannot afford,” said the letter released last week. “We, the undersigned economists, believe the proposed Medicare for All plans would lead to shortages throughout the health sector that would restrict access to care, undermine quality, lead to innovation-stifling price controls, and adversely impact the economy.” The 55 signers include Michael Boskin, who chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President George H.W. Bush; former Office of Management and Budget director James Miller III, and Chapman University professor Vernon L. Smith, a 2002 Nobel Laureate in economic sciences. Medicare for All, a form of universal health care, has gained popularity with Democratic voters and candidates, although the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, suggested earlier this month that he would veto any such legislation. In their letter, the economists said that the nation “does not have a properly functioning market in the health sector due in part to the reimburse-the-supplier insurance model, but the solution is not more and bigger government.” “The solution is creating a more efficient market for medical care and medical insurance that would restrain costs through competition, improved and transparent information, and consumer incentives rather than through destructive methods such as price controls and limits on private care choices,” they said. The Coalition Against Socialized Medicine, a free-market group whose members include the American Conservative Union, Heritage Action and FreedomWorks, said the COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the importance of encouraging innovation in health care. “Unfortunately, the stakes now have been put into stark relief as the world faces the grim challenge of the coronavirus,” said coalition executive director Marc Palazzo. “As humanity battles this common threat together, our hopes are pinned to the very innovation that these policies would ultimately destroy.” “Coronavirus Vindicates Capitalism: Drug companies will save lives, even as Bernie Sanders is denouncing them,” from @KimStrassel via @WSJopinion. https://t.co/ORSX3KlHWA Vermont Sen. Bernard Sanders, Mr. Biden’s only remaining challenger in the primary race, argued at last week’s CNN debate that the COVID-19 pandemic “exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current healthcare system.” “We are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people,” Mr. Sanders said. “We’re spending so much money, and yet we are not even prepared for this pandemic.” Mr. Biden countered by noting that Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus, has universal government-provided health care. “With all due respect to Medicare for All, you have a single-payer system in Italy. It doesn’t work there,” Mr. Biden said.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday the state is directing hospitals to increase their capacity by 50% as it grapples with its response to the expanding coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Cuomo said he hasn’t had “second thoughts” on decisions he’s made on restrictions amid the COVID-19 crisis, while acknowledging that the current way of life isn’t sustainable and that at some point you have to “open the valve.” He said there are 53,000 hospital beds but that there could be a need for 110,000 beds as more people get sick. “We are today issuing an emergency order that says to all hospitals you must increase your capacity by 50% — you must,” Mr. Cuomo said Monday morning as he provided an update on COVID-19 in his state. “Find more beds, use more rooms.” He also said hospitals should try to increase their capacity by 100%. “I think it’s unreasonable to [say] to every hospital, basically, double your capacity,” he said. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say try to reach a hundred percent increase.” Mr. Cuomo on Sunday had accepted a recommendation from the Army Corps of Engineers for four temporary hospital sites in the state at the Javits Convention Center, SUNY Stony Brook, SUNY Old Westbury, and the Westchester Convention Center. “President Trump did deliver yesterday,” he said. He also said Mr. Trump agreed to waive the state’s 25% cost-sharing portion that would typically come under a federal disaster declaration for New York. Appearing Monday afternoon at the Javits Center in New York City, Mr. Cuomo said that construction would start this week for about 1,000 emergency beds at that site to open up space at other hospitals. He said that construction would hopefully be done in the next 7-10 days. “All systems are go here,” he said. He said they were also looking into potentially building 1,000 separate beds for “lighter medical care.” “This is going to get much worse before it gets better,” the governor said. “We are still in the relative calm before the storm. You’re going to see the number of infections, the number of cases increase dramatically.” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio had said Monday on CNN that public hospitals in New York City were on the verge of becoming overwhelmed if they don’t get an influx of supplies this week. At Mr. Cuomo’s Monday morning briefing, the governor said there are now 20,875 positive coronavirus cases in the state and that 157 people have died. He said that for the moment, the state does have the capacity to get supplies like protective masks to those in need. “Today, we can get masks to anyone who needs them, and gowns. I can’t promise you next week or the week thereafter,” he said. Mr. Cuomo did hint at eventually dialing back some restrictions he and the state have imposed to try to mitigate the spread of the virus. He had already ordered that 100% of the workforce in New York stay home, except for essential workers, and that nonessential gatherings be temporarily banned. Those restrictions went into effect at 8 p.m. Sunday. “It is unsustainable to run this state or run this country with the economy closed down,” he said. “You’re doing smart public health policy and smart economic policy. I think there is a line, a dot where those two lines cross.” He said he has “no second thoughts” on actions he’s taken, like ordering all nonessential workers to stay home. “I would make the same decisions today,” he said. “At [one] point, you have to open the valve … because that is oxygen for the economy and this is not sustainable.” He also re-upped his call for Mr. Trump to implement the Defense Production Act, saying states are currently competing with one another for supplies like protective masks and ventilators. “It does not nationalize any industry. All it does is say to a factory, you must produce this quantity,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Yes, it is an assertion of government power on private sector companies — yes. But so what? This is a national emergency, and you’re paying the private sector company.” He said private companies would be paid “handsomely.” “You cannot continue to do these supplies on an ad hoc basis,” he said.

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Monday that Senate Democrats must drop their objections to a nearly $2 trillion economic relief package before midnight to help businesses and workers hurt by the coronavirus outbreak. “We need to pass this today,” Mr. Mnuchin told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “We are working round the clock today to make sure the Senate passes this today.”He rejected Democrats’ complaints that $500 billion in the bill to help corporations amounts to a “slush fund” to bail out big companies. “This isn’t corporate welfare,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “This helps all American workers. There’s enormous bipartisan support for this. We’re using all the tools we have, and we’ve told Congress, we need additional tools ASAP.” He said the measure will complement a series of emergency actions by the Federal Reserve to pump more cash and credit into financial markets and businesses. “This legislation is now approximately $2 trillion,” he said. “Part of that is $500 billion, which is not a slush fund — that we can use in working with the Federal Reserve that will provide another $4 trillion of potential liquidity into the market. That’s on top of the Fed’s balance sheet.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has scheduled another vote for Monday on the measure, after all Democrats voted against proceeding with the bill on Sunday evening. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said the measure doesn’t provide relief for hospitals or localities. Mr. Mnuchin said the bill provides Small Business Administration loans for any business with 500 or fewer employees to cover two months of payroll and “some overhead.” He said if companies hire back their workers, “the government will forgive that loan.” Asked if the president is considering a nationwide shutdown, Mr. Mnuchin replied, “The president will decide. The president has not made that decision. The president is hopeful that the policies and procedures put in place will kill this virus quickly.” Mr. Mnuchin, who was meeting again with Senate leaders on Monday morning, said it’s possible the administration would come back to Congress for another rescue package before summer. “This legislation prepares us for what I would say the 10- to 12-week period,” he said. “But I hope that we don’t need to last that long. And for whatever reason [if] this turns out that it’s going to last longer, we’ll go back to Congress.”  ",Mnuchin calls on Senate Democrats to approve economic package today ,"Monday, March 23, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/23/mnuchin-calls-senate-democrats-approve-economic-pa/,washington_times
"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday ordered residents of Pennsylvania’s hardest-hit areas to stay home for at least two weeks to help combat the spread of the new coronavirus that has already sickened hundreds and caused six deaths statewide. He also shuttered all schools statewide for an additional two weeks. Noting that Philadelphia has already ordered residents to remain home, Wolf issued his own stay-at-home order for the counties around the city; for Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh; and for Monroe County in the Pocono Mountains. Together, those counties account for 75% of the state’s confirmed cases of COVID-19. Wolf said the administration wanted to take a “measured approach” to the crisis and expressed hope that if the coronavirus could be largely contained to the most heavily impacted counties, he could avoid extending his stay-at-home order to the entire state. The order was to take effect at 8 p.m. Monday. In all, 5.5 million people, or more than 40% of the state’s population, have been ordered to stay home. Wolf said residents will be able to leave their homes for “allowable activities,” including trips to the grocery store and the pharmacy. He did not say how it would be enforced. Wolf has imposed a series of progressively tougher measures in the face of a global pandemic that state officials say threatens to swamp hospitals and spike the death toll. The governor has already closed schools and ordered all “non-life-sustaining” businesses to shutter their physical locations, an edict that state police and other government agencies began enforcing Monday morning after Wolf beat back a pair of legal challenges. “The novel coronavirus has halted life as we knew it,” Wolf said Monday. “I won’t pretend that things will not get worse before they get better.” ___ COURT DISMISSES LAWSUIT ON NONESSENTIAL BUSINESSES  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by a gun shop that challenged Wolf’s authority to shutter businesses deemed nonessential. Without comment, a narrow majority of the state’s high court late Sunday denied the petition by a gun shop, a gun purchaser and a law firm to have Wolf’s shutdown order thrown out. The lawsuit had claimed Wolf’s edict violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms and other constitutional rights. The court said a separate legal challenge to Wolf’s order to close law offices had become moot because of subsequent action that lets lawyers work from their physical locations to perform duties deemed essential by county or federal judges. The Democratic governor has ordered all nonessential businesses to close their physical locations indefinitely, saying the measure is needed to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.  In a dissenting statement joined by two other justices, Justice David Wecht said Wolf’s order amounts to “an absolute and indefinite prohibition upon the acquisition of firearms by the citizens of this commonwealth - a result in clear tension with the Second Amendment” and the state constitution. He called on Wolf to make some allowance for the in-person sale of firearms. ___ ENFORCEMENT BEGINS Wolf’s order to close down the physical locations of businesses deemed not essential to sustain life is being enforced as of Monday morning.  The Wolf administration has been sorting through nearly 10,000 waiver requests, saying their only consideration is health and safety. State police spokesman Ryan Tarkowski said Monday that troopers are aiming at voluntary compliance, “not coming in with a hammer at 8:01” a.m., when the enforcement period began.  “Our goal is not to write a giant pile of citations,” he said. Tarkowski said people who want to report a business that remains open should use non-emergency numbers to call state police or local police. “Please don’t call 911,” Tarkowski said. ___ WHAT’S OPEN, CLOSED Businesses that remain open to the public include grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and motels, beer distributors, laundromats and gas stations. Restaurants are only open for take-out orders. The open list also includes farms, mines, food production and some manufacturing.  Car dealers, clothing stores and other retailers, salons and entertainment venues are among those on the shuttered list. On Monday, Pennsylvania officials extended the closure of facilities in state parks and forests until April 30. People with reservations for campgrounds, cabins and other overnight accommodations will get refunds. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources said trails, lakes, forests, roads and parking areas remain open to the public, but urged people to practice social distancing and avoid crowded parking lots and trailheads. The closure includes restrooms. ___ CASES Pennsylvania health officials on Monday reported 165 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Pennsylvania, for a total of more than 640 in 34 counties. They reported a total of six deaths, up from two a day earlier. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. ___ STATE HOUSE The state House of Representatives began a non-voting session Monday, and the speaker assigned proposals to get emergency assistance for small businesses and to allow for electronic notarization of documents to committees. The State Government Committee planned to meet to consider legislation regarding the April 28 primary, which could be delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Senate Democrats again blocked a $1.8 trillion economic rescue package for the coronavirus pandemic on Monday, as the White House negotiated furiously behind closed doors on the package and House Democrats rolled out a rival $2.5 trillion proposal containing partisan “wish-list” items such as same-day voter registration. The Senate test vote on the aid package failed 49-46, with all the “no” votes coming from Democrats a day after they blocked a first attempt to begin debate on the bill itself. Sixty votes were needed to proceed. By 6 p.m., Senate leaders said they didn’t expect any votes Monday night, although talks were continuing. President Trump called on the Senate to pass the Republicans’ bill “and avoid playing any more partisan games.” “They have to get together and just stop with the partisan politics,” Mr. Trump said. “I think that’s happening. It’s not really a choice. They have to make a deal. This should not be a time for political agendas, but rather one for focusing solely and squarely on the needs of the American people.” The president during the coronavirus task force briefing said he planned to get the economy going again soon. “We’re going to be opening up our country,” he said. Asked if it would take weeks or months, Mr. Trump replied, “I’m not looking at months.” Republicans accused congressional Democrats of prioritizing ideological goodies such as carbon taxes and corporate diversity quotas over a bipartisan agreement to help shuttered industries and idled workers. “Are you kidding me? This is not a juicy political opportunity. This is a national emergency,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican. After the vote, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin continued negotiations with Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and Mr. McConnell. Mr. Schumer and Mr. Mnuchin said they were close to an agreement. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, announced new steps to ease corporate and consumer debt, signaling it would do essentially whatever it takes to save the U.S economy until the pandemic eases. The central bank also announced it soon will roll out a “Main Street Business Lending Program” to bolster congressional efforts to expand lending by about $350 billion through the Small Business Administration. The actions did little to calm plunging financial markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 582 points, or 3%, to close at 18,591. The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, while the Nasdaq was down 0.2%. The Senate Republicans’ bill would provide direct payments of $1,200 to adults earning less than $75,000 annually and include $500 for each child. It also would allocate $350 billion in loans to small businesses to address layoffs, add $250 billion to unemployment insurance and create a $500 billion program for businesses, states and localities. Democrats have criticized the $500 billion program as a “slush fund” for administration-favored corporations. “The bill still includes something that most Americans don’t want to see: large corporate bailouts with almost no strings attached,” Mr. Schumer said. Tempers flared on the Senate floor as the impasse dragged on. When Mr. Schumer blocked Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine from speaking on the floor, she responded, “You are objecting to my speaking? This is appalling.” Sen. John Thune, South Dakota Republican, warned his Democratic colleagues: “The country is burning and your side wants to play political games.” Mr. McConnell said of the Democratic efforts to change the bill, “The American people have had enough of this nonsense. They’d like to know what’s going on here. The bazaar is apparently open on the other side.” Sen. Dick Durbin, Illinois Democrat, urged Republicans to “take a deep breath.” “The emotions we’ve seen on both sides of the aisle are reflected in homes across America,” Mr. Durbin said. “But we are going to solve this problem.” As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced her competing rescue bill Monday, Republicans reacted with a fury at what they said was a partisan laundry list of proposals not worthy of an emergency economic rescue plan. Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, also blamed Mrs. Pelosi for distracting the attention of official Washington to President Trump’s impeachment in December and January, when the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in China. He reminded the Senate that Mrs. Pelosi delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate for four weeks. “As we were dealing with this impeachment garbage, China was on fire,” Mr. Graham said. “You’ll hear more about that later in the year.” He said in remarks directed at Mrs. Pelosi, “We’re not going to let you turn the country upside down to shape it in your image.” Tucked into House Democrats’ coronavirus relief bill are provisions for “risk-limiting audits” of elections and same-day voter registration, items long sought by Democrats but unrelated to the pandemic, Republicans charged. “Risk-limiting audits of results of elections,” called for in a section of the bill, generally requires a manual review of statistical samples of paper ballots to see if official election results were tallied correctly. Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican, accused Mrs. Pelosi of trying to add “liberal wish list” items to the emergency bill. “Same-day voter registration? Where does that fit in a bill to rescue the American people who, right now, find themselves in the throes of a disease that may kill them?” Mr. Barrasso asked on the Senate floor. Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, picked apart the Pelosi bill, for example mocking its proposal for diversity on corporate boards of directors. “The Democrats want to impose quotas for race and sex on corporate boards,” Mr. Cotton said. “I know they’ve wanted to do that for a long time. Is that going to stop anyone from getting sick from the coronavirus?” Of early voting and same-day voter registration, Mr. Cotton asked, “Now they want to pile election rules on a bill that’s designed to stop a pandemic?” He also took aim at the Democrats’ proposal for airlines to go “carbon-neutral” by 2025 with emissions offsets. “I wonder if that will apply to the private planes that Nancy Pelosi and her family flies in, and all their buddies in Hollywood,” Mr. Cotton said. More than $150 billion in the House Democrats’ version would be funneled into the healthcare system — hospitals, care centers, and other facilities — to shore up resources for equipment and programs for coronavirus treatment. It also would strengthen worker requirements to better protect those working directly to combat the disease. Their plan to give direct cash payments to the public would extend $1,500 per individual and up to $7,500 to a family of five. The bill would create a temporary employment program that would pay $600 per week to any worker affected by the coronavirus’ economic impact, which combined with other benefits, should provide full compensation. It also expands which workers would be eligible for unemployment benefits. It also expands on several aspects of the second coronavirus package — including paid sick leave benefits, food stamps and eliminating copays for all coronavirus treatments. The measure would set aside more than $500 billion in grants and interest-free loans for small businesses, many of which have been shuttered by government-mandated shelter-in-place and self-quarantine policies. There is $215 billion in grants allocated for state and local governments to help continue to fund public services. It also gives $60 billion to schools and universities. Mrs. Pelosi told reporters that the House could be willing to vote on the package this week, depending on what unfolds in the Senate. “That is a hope yes, but we’ll see what the Senate does,” she said.

"House Republicans on Monday night offered a detailed critique of what they called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s “socialist wish list” in House Democrats’ $2.5 trillion proposal for responding to the coronavirus outbreak. “Speaker Pelosi unveiled legislation aimed at exploiting the COVID-19 public health crisis by attempting to force the inclusion of a socialist wish list of policies that have nothing to do with the public health and economic emergency,” said House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, Louisiana Republican. After poring over the 1,400-page proposal, Mr. Scalise offered his characterization of Republicans’ objections to the following items: Under the heading of “Union Giveaways”: • Nullifies the White House executive orders on federal collective bargaining and codifies taxpayer-funded union official time. • Requires a labor union representative on every airline’s board of directors. • Multiemployer pension bailout lacking needed reforms. • Permanently raises the minimum wage to $15 for any business that receives federal aid for COVID-19. • Cancels all debt owed by the U.S. Postal Service to the Treasury. Under the heading “Green New Deal priorities”: • Requires all airlines that receive assistance to offset carbon emissions for domestic flights by 2025. • Includes a $1 billion “cash for clunkers” airplane program where the Transportation Department buys fuel-inefficient planes from airlines in exchange for agreeing to buy new ones. • Includes expansive new tax-credit for solar and wind energy. Under “Student Loan Forgiveness”: • $10,000 blanket loan forgiveness. Under “Federalizing Elections”: • Mandates how states must run elections, including the nationalization of ballot harvesting, requiring early voting, same day registration, and no-excuse vote by mail. • Puts states at risk of costly litigation if they are unable to implement these stringent mandates ahead of the 2020 election. Under “Immigration Provisions”: • Requires the Homeland Security Department to automatically extend visas and work authorizations expiring within the next year, including those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status, for an amount of time equal to their prior visa, authorization or status. • Limits Customs and Border Patrol’s ability to shutdown processing centers if there is a health crisis on the border and requires CBP to assure the timely adjudication of asylums applications. • Would allow certain funding to go to sanctuary cities. Under “Overreaching Mandates on Businesses”: • Permanent changes to who can serve on corporate boards of directors for companies that receive assistance for payroll and operating costs. • Mandatory disclosure on supply chain management. • Requires board diversity disclosure for all publicly traded companies. • Ban on all federal rulemaking including non-COVID 19 proposals (extends 30 days after emergency) “in an attempt to delay the current administration from promulgating actions House Democrats disagree with.”Under “New Permanent Mandates”: • Virtually rewrites the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program policy with no reference to COVID-19 and permanently disallows rulemaking pertaining to work requirements and eligibility. • Permanent expansion of Obamacare entitlement, “putting the American taxpayer on the hook for endless and unchecked health insurance spending and would remove all incentives for insurers to reduce the cost of health insurance.” Mr. Scalise said the Democrats’ bill also excludes bipartisan health-care provision in the Senate bill, including a proposal to expand telehealth access for home dialysis patients, hospice and home health patients; and a measure to prevent a payment reduction for durable medical equipment to help patients’ better transition from the hospital to home. “Instead of working in a bipartisan, bicameral way to provide this immediate relief, the speaker has proposed legislation that includes highly partisan provisions while excluding key patient care provisions that would have a real impact on Americans affected by COVID-19,” Mr. Scalise told his Republican colleagues.

"For climate-change activists, there’s an upside to the novel coronavirus outbreak. As House Majority Whip James Clyburn, South Carolina Democrat, reportedly said last week, “This is a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.” Not only did China see its greenhouse-gas emissions drop as its economy shuttered, but Democrats held up Monday nearly $2 trillion in pandemic relief to squeeze in items from their climate wish list, including re-upping renewable-energy tax credits and tacking emissions mandates on the aviation and cruise industries. Prodding the Democrats were global-warming gurus like Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, who urged Congress to take advantage of the unprecedented opportunity to address both the coronavirus and climate “crises.” “Congress: don’t waste this chance,” tweeted Mr. McKibben. “If you’re going to bail out corporations, in return demand that they take serious climate action. We could actually work on both crises at once!” Republicans erupted, accusing Democrats of putting their ideological wish list ahead of the national interest by delaying critical funds to hospitals and small businesses to “dust off the Green New Deal,” as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put it. James Taylor, senior fellow at the free-market Heartland Institute, called it “unconscionable that Democrats are holding coronavirus relief for millions of Americans hostage to completely unrelated extremist climate demands.” “American lives and Americans’ ability to feed themselves and make rent and mortgage payments are far more important than imposing climate restrictions on airplanes and giving more handouts to the wind and solar industries,” said Mr. Taylor. “Politicians who believe unemployed Americans are less important than climate activism and wind power have no moral justification holding office.” JunkScience’s Steve Milloy, a member of the Trump EPA transition team, said that Democrats are “more worried about not letting the coronavirus go to political waste than they are about protecting public health and rescuing the economy.” The pandemic has threatened to throw the U.S. economy into an economic recession, if not depression, but for the climate movement, the upheaval offers a rare, possibly once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to recalibrate societal priorities on everything from travel to commuting to shopping. In a statement updated Monday, “5 Principles for Just COVID-19 Relief and Stimulus,” hundreds of environmental groups, including 350.org, Extinction Rebellion and Greenpeace, called for achieving the recovery while simultaneously meeting the goals of the Green New Deal. They include public investments to “rebuild our infrastructure, replace lead pipes, expand wind and solar power, build clean and affordable public transmit, weatherize our buildings … restore our wetlands and forests, expand public services that support climate resilience, and support regenerative agriculture led by family farmers.” In a Monday editorial, the Los Angeles Times declared, “Climate change is just as real as COVID-19. Now’s the last best chance for our government to treat it that way.” “The main imperative for the government is to keep climate policy in mind as it devises a plan to rescue the economy,” said the staff editorial, adding that “maybe accepting the reality of COVID-19 will lead the administration to recognize the reality of climate change and work with Congress to begin addressing it in meaningful ways.” Shutting down economy to save world Such declarations have alarmed free-market advocates worried that the global and national response will pave the way for more government control over the private sector as future Democratic administrations draw parallels between the coronavirus and global warming. “The goals of the climate activists have advanced, given the coronavirus’ total shutdown of society,” said Climate Depot’s Marc Morano. “Climate activists know that if the U.S. government can shut down all aspects of society over a virus, it can and may someday under a different president take similar measures to fight an alleged climate crisis.” He pointed to the shutdown of airline travel, restaurants and entertainment, saying that “many climate activists will welcome a global recession because they have been calling for ‘degrowth’ policies and ‘planned recessions’ to fight climate change.” It’s true that the pandemic has come at a cost to the climate movement by curbing rallies, protests and other public events. At the same time, the drop in manufacturing, travel and commuting has also led to a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, most notably in China, the world’s largest emitter. Satellite imaging from NASA and the European Space Agency shows a dramatic decline in nitrogen dioxide since Jan. 1, although emissions are expected to rebound as the Chinese economy picks up again. “Well, that is, ironically, of course, the other side of this, right? It may be good for climate … because there is less trade, there’s less travel, there’s less commerce,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres in a March 3 interview with London’s Channel 4. If companies decide they can hold meetings via telecommuting instead of traveling, “that would be a systemic contribution to climate change,” she said. “What is not helpful is just a help that would be here for a few months but then we jump back to bad traditions,” said Ms. Figueres. Mr. McKibben agreed. “Our goal can’t be simply a return to the status-quo ante, because that old normal was driving a climate crisis that will eventually prove every bit as destructive as a pandemic,” he said Friday in a New Yorker op-ed. “With just a little courage from Democratic legislators, we could actually be building a world that is safer on every front,” he concluded.

"House Rules Committee report threw cold water on the push to allow members to vote remotely during the coronavirus crisis. “This change cannot be implemented overnight, and likely cannot be accomplished in time to address the current crisis. Without complete consensus, which we do not currently have, it would also require us to come back to Washington to vote to change House rules to allow for remote voting,” the report said. Instead, the report suggests that the House continue to use existing procedures, namely unanimous consent and voice votes. The House’s phase two coronavirus bill was nearly derailed last week after one member, Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, threatened to object to the unanimous consent movement members needed to pass technical corrections to the package. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi commissioned the rules committee to look into suggestions from members to change procedures, something she and leadership across Capitol Hill have been reluctant to do. The push to allow members to join the majority of the country working from home comes as the virus hits Capitol Hill. So far only a handful of lawmakers — most recently, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul — announced they had tested positive for the virus. Two members of the House have tested positive: Reps. Ben McAdams, Utah Democrat, and Mario Diaz Balart, Florida Republican. Some staffers in both the Senate and House offices have revealed they’ve tested positive for the disease and dozens of lawmakers have closed their offices and sent staffers to work from home.

"House Democrats unveiled a $2.5 trillion economic stimulus package Monday, their response to the bill the GOP-controlled Senate is attempting to pass. The final version of the bill was released late Monday night. House Republicans slammed the finalized bill as a “socialist wish list” that expands too far beyond the scope of the coronavirus. More than $150 billion will be funneled into the health care system — hospitals, care centers, etc — to shore up resources for equipment and programs for coronavirus treatment. It also strengthens worker requirements to better protect those working directly to combat the disease. It allocates nearly $8 billion to defense resources going to combat the virus: $3.48 billion to the National Guard, $3.8 billion for military health care services and $500 million for the Defense Production Act. Their plan to give direct cash payments to the public would extend $1,500 per individual and up to $7,500 to a family of five. There is also $602 million set aside for tax credits, including child and earned income credits. It also suspends rent payments for those receiving federal rental assistance and puts a moratorium on evictions nationwide. The bill would create a temporary employment program that pays $600 per week to any worker affected by the coronavirus economic impact, which combined with other benefits, should provide a full compensation. It also expands which workers would be eligible for unemployment. Democrats also allocated $25 billion for lost revenue to the postal service. Federal workers that are still required to come to work during the crisis will receive $2,000 per child per month throughout the crisis. It also expands on several aspects of the second coronavirus package — including paid sick leave benefits and SNAP food security programs — and eliminates copays for all coronavirus treatments. These paid sick leave benefits will be extended to businesses with 50 employees or less and “strips the Labor Secretary of authority” to carve these companies out. It sets aside more than $500 billion in grants and interest-free loans for small businesses, many of which have been shuttered by government-mandated shelter-in-place and self-quarantine policies. Of that, $300 billion in guaranteed loans are set aside for short-term payroll expenses. There is $215 billion in grants allocated for state and local governments to help continue to fund public services. It also gives $60 billion to schools and universities, and allows for $10,000 in student loan forgiveness. The legislation will also has $4 billion in grants for states to continue with the scheduled 2020 election, while requiring that they expand early and absentee voting opportunities with a 15-day window — including providing self-sealing envelopes and prepaid postage for mail-in ballots. The voting regulations extend, however, to require states allow same-day voter registration and no longer request the last four digits of social security numbers. It also sets aside $20 million for “risk limiting” audits of election results. Democrats were skeptical of supporting “bailouts” of hard-hit industries in the Senate’s phase three bill, but do include funds for the airline industry with some important caveats. The bill provides $37 billion in grants to airline and cargo employees, $3 billion to ground support contractors, and $21 billion in unsecured loans to air carriers. Airports will receive $10 billion for infrastructure, sanitation and workforce purposes, but they must retain 10% of their workforce. Air carriers must also maintain a $15 minimum wage for all contracted workers. The funds are prohibited from being used for stock buybacks or going to shareholders; CEO salaries are capped at 50 times more than their average employee. This portion of the package provides $1 billion to eliminate high-polluting aircraft and $100 million in research for green fuel. It also requires all air carriers that receive assistance to offset their carbon emissions by 2025 — these carriers will need to reduce their emissions by 50% by 2050. The package includes $100 million to create an oversight panel to ensure all the funds appropriated to tackle the coronavirus are properly used. Mrs. Pelosi told reporters that the House could be willing to vote on the package this week, depending on what unfolds in the Senate. “That is a hope yes, but we’ll see what the Senate does,” she said.

"The House Judiciary Committee’s upcoming oversight hearing with Attorney General William P. Barr was postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak, chairman Jerrold Nadler said Monday. Mr. Nadler, New York Democrat, tweeted that the hearing needed to be pushed back because of “overwhelming” health concerns. The hearing was scheduled for March 31 and it was the first time Mr. Barr was set to appear before the committee since he refused to testify last year. “DOJ has made a commitment to rescheduling the hearing for when the crisis abates and the committee is able to reconvene,” Mr. Nadler tweeted. Panel members were prepared to grill Mr. Barr on allegations he intervened with the sentencing recommendation for Roger Stone, a longtime ally of President Trump. They were also planning to ask him about special counsel Robert Mueller’s conclusions regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Barr was scheduled to testify before the committee last year, but refused to appear because of a dispute over the hearing’s format. The Justice Department objected to Democrats’ plan to have staff lawyers ask questions.

"The coronavirus pandemic is upending convention plans for state and local political parties, and organizers involved with the Democratic and Republican national conventions warn that the fate of the summer events could end up in the hands of public health officials. The chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party said in a letter that the GOP is “firmly committed” to proceeding with its national convention in Charlotte in August, as he announced that upcoming county and district conventions will be conducted virtually or via teleconference. The national Libertarian and Green parties were weighing contingency options for their conventions, which are scheduled to be held in May and July, respectively. “We’re just going to be flexible,” said Nicholas Sarwark, chairman of the Libertarian National Committee. “I used to work with a Marine colonel back when I was in D.C., and his motto was ‘Semper Gumby’ — always flexible.” Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez on Monday pointed out that the party’s convention in Milwaukee is still four months away and that the committee will continue to be in regular contact with federal, state and local health professionals on how to proceed. “We’re obviously in regular touch with federal, state and local officials. We are planning and hoping for the best, but planning for every eventuality and safety will always be paramount in planning the convention,” Mr. Perez said on a conference call with reporters on a separate topic. Earlier this month, when the crisis was not nearly at the point it is now, Mr. Perez had said he wasn’t contemplating rules changes to accommodate a virtual or online convention. Joe Solmonese, CEO of the Democratic National Convention Committee, said they’re monitoring the fluid situation and the convention committee will stay focused on planning a “safe and successful” event in Milwaukee in four months. “As we prepare these plans, we will remain in constant communication with the local, state and federal officials responsible for protecting public health and security — and will continue to follow their guidance as we move forward,” he said. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers previewed what he called a “safer at home” order coming Tuesday, calling on people to stay at home and limit their travel to essential needs. John Verdejo, a DNC member from North Carolina, said he thinks the party leadership needs to do a better job looping in rank-and-file members who aren’t intricately involved in the planning. He said that moving forward as scheduled isn’t worth it if it means risking lives. “I know everyone wants to see a convention going on and everyone wants to partake in those festivities and so forth,” he said. “It’s not worth it, bro. It’s not worth it. I mean hell, they canceled baseball.” Michael Whatley, chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, said over the weekend that the RNC is “firmly committed” to moving forward with its convention, scheduled for Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte. “However, the RNC is closely monitoring conditions regarding the COVID-19 outbreak and is working closely with federal, state and local governments in order to determine whether they will need to make any changes to the schedule,” Mr. Whatley said in an open letter to Republicans in the state. Mr. Whatley also said that the remaining county and district conventions, which are frequently used to formally select delegates to the national convention, will be conducted virtually via teleconference and online platforms. He said the party’s state convention will take place as scheduled in May. The COVID-19 outbreak is also upending local and state party proceedings elsewhere. The New Hampshire GOP announced Monday that it would postpone its annual convention, which had been slated for May 2. The North Dakota Republican Party canceled its convention that had been scheduled for this week, and the Republican Party of Virginia last week postponed its convention that had been slated for early May. The North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party, meanwhile, held a virtual convention last week instead of an in-person gathering. “This has been quite an adventure of a week trying to navigate this new world we’re living in right now and trying to find ways that we as Democrats, and really as North Dakotans, and Americans can all stay connected during this pandemic crisis and still engage in the business that is required of us,” said party chairwoman Kylie Oversen. Mr. Sarwark, the Libertarian Party chairman, said they might have to get creative but they’re not going to put people in excessive risk. The Libertarian convention is scheduled for late May in Austin, Texas, presenting more of a time crunch than Democrats or Republicans have for their national conventions. He said he has advised some state parties in the process of holding their conventions to cancel or postpone the events, but suggested to others that they work with the venue to practice social distancing or use a video link to conduct business. “We’ll figure it out. We will have a nominee and they will be on all 50 state ballots,” he said. “We want to cooperate with our opponents to not endanger people.” Michael O’Neil, communications manager for the Green Party, said they’re exploring their options, including for a possible “virtual” convention. The Green Party Convention is scheduled to be held in Detroit in July, right before the Democratic National Convention. “We’re running through different scenarios and looking at different broadcasting possibilities or live-streaming possibilities and just getting a sense of what are the tools that are out there to accommodate our needs,” he said. Mr. O’Neil said some Green Party state conventions have moved to online meetings because of COVID-19. • This article is based in part on wire service reports.

"There will be no new votes on the Senate’s coronavirus phase three bill Monday, delaying efforts to push through the nearly $2 trillion stimulus package. “We will not be having any votes tonight,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. Because of the failed procedural vote earlier Monday afternoon, Mr. McConnell needed to essentially restart the clock on a new procedural vote — teeing that up for Wednesday. The bill is stalled in the chamber as lawmakers continue to haggle over details within the economic stimulus package aimed to get cash to the American public, funds to overwhelmed healthcare facilities, loans to hard-hit corporations and small businesses. Republicans accused Democrats of prioritizing an ideological wish list over a bipartisan agreement. Meanwhile, one of the Democrats’ chief complaints is that  Republicans still have too much wiggle room in their package for large scale corporations that will receive federal loans. Members on both sides of the aisle were aiming to get a deal finalized and voted on by the end of Monday. It would still need to go to the House, which has not returned from recess due to the coronavirus.

"Sen. Ted Cruz unleashed a stemwinder before his colleagues on Monday over a “Christmas list” added to the coronavirus relief bill filled with environmental and diversity politics issues.  “A famed quote from Rahm Emanuel, he was President Obama’s chief of staff,” the Texas Republican said. “‘Never let a good crisis go to waste.’  Sadly, we’re seeing the embodiment of that cynical approach right now because, of all the people out of jobs, the Democrats are using — what are they pushing for? Changing the emission standards on airplanes. Mr. President, what the hell do the emissions standards on airplanes have to do with thousands of people dying and millions of people out of work in the coronavirus epidemic? Don’t treat this bill like a partisan Christmas list!” Mr. Cruz lambasted Democrats for holding up over $1 trillion in aid for Americans while adding, for clarity, that similar behavior from him might include attempts to legislatively weaken or abolish the IRS. The Republican then noted that Democrats are pushing for diversity requirements on corporate boards and solar credits. “There are some Democratic lobbyists getting fat and rich and they’re they’re willing to extort a crisis to advance their political agenda,” Mr. Cruz continued. “The Pelosi wish-list wants to restructure the debt of the Post Office. Mr. President, look, last I checked our postal workers go through wind and rain and snow — but they haven’t been laid off. I call upon both sides: don’t play games with this.” Democrats have countered that Republicans have crafted a bill that is lopsided in favor of businesses at the expense of employees. “We don’t want industry bailouts unless we include strict conditions that put #WorkersFirst,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted Saturday. The New York Democrat added: “No stock buybacks. No layoffs. No salary cuts for workers or salary increases for corporate executives.” Sen. @tedcruz UNLOADS on Dems from the Senate floor:“What the hell do the emissions standards on airplanes have to do with thousands of people dying and millions of people out of work in the Coronavirus epidemic?” pic.twitter.com/zXiQjJRpRA  ",Ted Cruz lights up Dems for coronavirus ‘Christmas list’ in relief bill ,"Monday, March 23, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/23/ted-cruz-blasts-democrats-christmas-list-in-corona/,washington_times
"A pair of nationally trending social media hashtags tells the story: #PelosiHatesAmerica and #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica were very popular following the Democratic Party’s successful push to block a GOP-led economic coronavirus stimulus package and replace it with its own 1,400-page version. A multitude of tweets and countermessages followed. “After engaging in countless hours of good faith negotiations, the Democrats took the bill hostage to push through their radical policy initiatives,” tweeted Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Tennessee Republican. “Now the American people get to see how this Democrat Congress, headed by Nancy Pelosi, doesn’t give a damn about the lives and livelihoods of hurting Americans!” tweeted pro-Trump sister team Diamond and Silk. Reactions were swift. “The Democrats just made a huge mistake. They are exploiting a national emergency for the grubbiest of partisan motive,” wrote Roger Kimball, editor of the New Criterion and publisher of Encounter Books, in a column for the Spectator. “At a time when Americans are suffering every day, it’s unacceptable that the left is delaying relief legislation in an attempt to pass a liberal policy wish list,” says Jessica Anderson, vice president of Heritage Action for America. Meanwhile, it’s politics as usual for the Democrats. Priorities USA Action, a Democratic Party super PAC, on Tuesday will launch a $6 million ad campaign against President Trump’s response to the pandemic threat. The title of the TV outreach is “Exponential Threat,” to be shared in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to CNN. The timing of the attacks may not be prudent, however. As was the case last week, majorities of Americans currently approve of Mr. Trump’s actions during the crisis. Meanwhile, many voters remain perplexed about the Democratic opposition to the economic stimulus package. The two present a public impression that is less than empathetic — and may soon need its own cure. EVER VIGILANT C-SPAN A programming note from C-SPAN, which continues to supply straightforward information in a troubled time. The public affairs network has debuted a special live prime-time edition of “Washington Journal” — its long-standing morning call-in program. The new offering airs 8-9 p.m. EDT on weekday nights with a focus on federal and state response to COVID-19. “The hour-long program will include expert guests plus viewer calls and reactions to the pandemic,” C-SPAN advises. MEDIA DOWNPLAYS THE GOOD NEWS Some now wonder whether the news media is intentionally ramping up public anxiety about the coronavirus. “Is the media ignoring good news on coronavirus?” asks an editorial by Issues and Insights founder John Merline. “There has been some tantalizingly good news about the coronavirus in the past few days, not that you’d know it from the end-of-the-world treatment it gets in the press. Of the 10 countries with the most COVID-19 cases, five showed declines in new reported cases over the past few days. In France, the number has been flat for days,” the news organization said, citing other promising developments, including two research studies that showed lower-than-expected death rates from coronavirus in the U.S. “To be sure, the recent trend data might just be a blip, and these two studies involve relatively small sample sizes and come with lots of caveats. We’re not saying the COVID-19 is nothing to worry about. But these recent developments do raise a question. Will the news media report good news as aggressively as they’ve been reporting the bad? So far, it doesn’t look that way,” Mr. Merline said. The pandemic also has another influence. “One of the unheralded casualties of the coronavirus crisis is, oddly enough, the daily news. Let’s face it — no matter what time of day or night you turn on your television, you are likely to be greeted with a barrage of virus video. It’s ‘Hurricane TV’ on steroids, and maybe the crisis justifies the 24/7 obsession, but the question arises: What are we missing?” writes Frank Miele, a columnist for RealClearPolitics. “Some well-known names are probably relieved that their foibles were overshadowed by the ongoing crisis,” he says, citing former President Bill Clinton, who recently publicly revisited his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for Florida governor who was caught in an untoward situation in a motel room. MASKING THE PROBLEM Two major news organizations — Bloomberg News and The Los Angeles Times — are pointing the finger at the Obama administration for the impending shortage of N95 respirator masks, a vital item for health care workers, doctors and patients alike during the coronavirus crisis. “The national shortage can be traced back to 2009 after the H1N1 swine flu pandemic, when the Obama administration was advised to replenish a national stockpile but did not. The Trump administration is scrambling to replenish a stockpile of protective medical gear for health care workers and patients, as the coronavirus sweeps across the nation. N95 respirator masks are one of the most needed medical supplies amid the outbreak,” notes The Washington Examiner, which is also tracking the phenomenon. There are 12 million N95 masks in the U.S. medical stockpile at the moment; the nation needs 3.5 billion masks, according to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II.

"President Trump signed an executive order Monday to crack down on retailers hiking prices on essential items in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, including masks and ventilators. “We have some people hoarding. We want to prevent price gouging and critical resources are going to be protected in every form,” Mr. Trump said at a press conference Monday. Attorney General William P. Barr said he ordered all 93 U.S. Attorney’s Office to appoint a lead prosecutor to tackle coronavirus-related price gouging. The attorney general emphasized that the order will not target consumers who stockpile essential supplies, but rather individuals who are hoarding items with the intent of selling them at marked up prices. “If you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house, this is not something you have to worry about, but if you are sitting on a warehouse with surgical masks, you’ll be hearing a knock on your door,” he said. Under the Defense Production Act, the president has the authority to deem certain supplies as scare. Once an item is deemed scare, it is illegal to hoard them in excess of business need or sell them at a price greater than the general retail cost. Mr. Barr said the Justice Department will meet with officials from the Department of Health and Human Services to decide which health items should be labeled scare. One item expected to be  deemed essential is N95 masks, which are critical to protect health workers from being infected with the virus. Prices for the masks were fetching more than $1,000 on online retail stores. Ebay ultimately banned their sales of such masks to crack down on price gouging.

"Tucked into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s coronavirus relief bill are provisions for “risk-limiting audits” of elections and same-day voter registration, items long sought by Democrats but unrelated to the pandemic, Republicans charged Monday. The bill unveiled Monday includes a section calling for “grants for conducting risk-limiting audits of results of elections.” Such action generally requires a manual review of statistical samples of paper ballots to see if official election results were tallied correctly. The measure also would require early voting in states, and same-day voter registration. The Senate failed again on Monday to approve a test vote on a $1.8 trillion economic rescue plan endorsed by the White House and Senate Republicans, with nearly all Democrats voting no. Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican, accused Mrs. Pelosi of trying to add “liberal wish list” items to the emergency bill. “Same-day voter registration? Where does that fit in a bill to rescue the American people who, right now, find themselves in the throes of a disease that may kill them?” Mr. Barrasso asked on the Senate floor. He also ridiculed Democrats’ efforts to include parts of the Green New Deal clean energy agenda in the measure. “They are delaying direct assistance so they can play to the liberal left,” Mr. Barrasso said. “They want to put up an entire cap-and-trade system for the airline industry. Nancy Pelosi has been pushing this extreme environmental agenda from the moment she cut the deal to remain as speaker.” Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, picked apart the Pelosi bill, for example mocking its proposal for diversity on corporate boards of directors. “The Democrats want to impose quotas for race and sex on corporate boards,” Mr. Cotton said. “I know they’ve wanted to do that for a long time. Is that going to stop anyone from getting sick from the coronavirus?” Of early voting and same-day voter registration, Mr. Cotton asked, “Now they want to pile election rules on a bill that’s designed to stop a pandemic?” He also took aim at the Democrats’ proposal for airlines to go “carbon-neutral” by 2025 with emissions offsets. “I wonder if that will apply to the private planes that Nancy Pelosi and her family flies in, and all their buddies in Hollywood,” Mr. Cotton said. He said of requiring union officials to get paid by taxpayers for union organizing work, “Is that going to stop the pandemic?”  ","Pelosi’s coronavirus bill proposes election audits, same-day voter registration","Monday, March 23, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/23/pelosis-coronavirus-bill-proposes-election-audits-/,washington_times

Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating for days but Democrats have blocked a more than $1 trillion coronavirus package aimed at economic relief during the closure of businesses across the country in a time of quarantine. “What you have now is a power struggle where Pelosi and Schumer believe they can blackmail the president into accepting really dumb ideas,” Mr. Gingrich said. “I personally do not want to see a Trump-McConnell-McCarthy team that are blackmailed by Pelosi and Schumer and give in,” he added.

"Democratic senators on Monday demanded a rapid expansion of absentee vote-by-mail and early voting, fearing the coronavirus pandemic will postpone the November elections. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Ron Wyden of Oregon partnered with Stand Up America to push for emergency legislation to fund states’ efforts to adapt to voters who are currently quarantined and learning to social distance. Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Wyden are the principal authors of the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act of 2020, which includes several provisions to expand America’s early and absentee voting capabilities. Ms. Klobuchar, whose husband, John Bessler, was diagnosed and hospitalized with the coronavirus on Monday, told reporters that lawmakers need to act now to ensure the November elections are not postponed as several states’ presidential primaries have been. “I think everyone on this call within a week or two is going to have someone in their own family or a close friend that’s going to be stricken with this,” Ms. Klobuchar said on a call with reporters. “This is going to happen to everyone and it’s why we have to take incredibly fast and immediate measures now on hospitals and why we have been holding out for the best bill possible as well as the work that needs to be done for our economy, but that we can never forget that this is a democracy and people must be able to vote.” Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Wyden’s proposal aims to ensure that every state provides 20 days of in-person early voting and absentee vote-by-mail, with states required to process votes cast during that period beginning 14 days before Election Day to avoid real-time vote counting on Election Day. The proposal would force states to provide self-sealing envelopes and prepaid postage to voters requesting an absentee ballot application, an absentee ballot, or a voter registration application. The bill would require states to provide downloadable and printable absentee ballots to voters who request but do not receive absentee ballots for the 2020 election. Beginning in 2022, the bill also would require the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to develop a downloadable and printable absentee ballot that everyone could use. Stand Up America, a liberal advocacy group opposed to President Trump, said it has begun a national campaign in support of the legislation and made 50,000 phone calls urging Americans to push their senators to support the legislation. The Democrats anticipate opposition from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, but think they may find potential partners in individual Republican secretaries of state across the country. Ms. Klobuchar identified Sen. Roy Blunt, Missouri Republican, as someone who has worked with her on ballot-access issues and may be open to further collaboration. Mr. Blunt’s office did not respond to request for comment. Mr. Wyden said he and his Democratic colleagues would pull out all the stops to earn GOP support and get the legislation over the finish line. “Look, America could be faced with a choice this fall of either Americans being able to vote, which means vote-by-mail, or not voting at all,” Mr. Wyden said. “And our case to [Republicans] is that’s not even a close call.” American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten told reporters Monday her organization supports the bill and both Republicans and Democrats need to join in support because no one can predict which states will need it most. “What happens if Democratic states could figure this out but Republican states couldn’t figure this out and then what happens in terms of the Electoral College?” Ms. Weingarten told reporters. “So right now it’s absolutely imperative before anybody can game out who is advantaged and who isn’t, that we actually protect the vote and do it in a way that ensures that every state has vote-by-mail, has early voting, has safe polling places.” Companion legislation has not emerged in the House, but Mr. Wyden said he expected a proposal to be rolled out soon.

"NEW YORK — Six television networks began showing President Donald Trump’s briefing on the coronavirus outbreak late Monday, but only Fox News Channel stuck it out to the end nearly two hours later. It was a notable turning point in coverage of the president’s now-daily briefings. Networks had been starting to hear criticism of how much time they have been showing the president answering questions live, reminiscent of a similar debate in the past about showing Trump’s campaign rallies. Still, there’s a difference between political rallies and a White House discussion of a national emergency. ABC, CBS and NBC all covered Trump at the beginning of Monday’s briefing, which began about 6:10 p.m. Eastern. After 20 minutes, they switched to the network evening newscasts, never to return to Trump. The president spoke until shortly after 8 p.m. The cable news networks have given Trump blanket coverage for his briefings, but CNN cut away Monday at around 7:20 p.m. MSNBC followed within five minutes. Of its own decision to stop showing Trump live, CNN said that “if the White House wants to ask for time on the network, they should make an official request. Otherwise we will make our own editorial decisions.” MSNBC, through a spokesperson, said that “we cut away because the information no longer appeared to be valuable to the important ongoing discussion around public health.” The network’s top star, Rachel Maddow, had said Friday night that television networks should no longer show Trump live. She cited examples of what she called false or misleading statements the president had made in past briefings, from general suggestions that the government had the virus under control to more specific discussions about drug treatments. “All of us should stop broadcasting it, honestly,” she said. “It’s going to cost lives.” The Washington Post’s media critic, Margaret Sullivan, wrote Monday that the briefings were beginning to sound like substitutes for Trump’s campaign rallies, and were working against the goal of giving the public critical and truthful information. “They have become a daily stage for Trump to play his greatest hits to captive audience members,” she said. On Monday, after he had dismissed most of the administration officials who had stood near him on the podium, Trump talked about his briefings. By then, only Fox was televising him. “I don’t want to stand here for two hours and do this but I think it’s important,” he said. “I call it getting it out of your system. We don’t want to just answer two questions and leave.” He said some of the questions were repetitive, but others were good and led to problems being solved. “At least you can say I’m very transparent,” he said. He spoke to an emptier room of reporters. More space has been placed between reporters since it was revealed that one correspondent had a suspected case of the disease. The briefings have attracted public interest, perhaps in part due to more people being at home and able to watch. For the three cable news networks, five Trump briefings last week each had more than double the audience the networks had for the same time period a year earlier, the Nielsen company said. For example, Fox News Channel, CNN and MSNBC attracted 8.28 million viewers for Trump’s briefing Friday, nearly half of them watching Fox. The audience for those networks a year earlier was 2.82 million, Nielsen said. “When people are tuning in in droves to watch a news event, that tells you that they’re interested in it – and you have to pay attention to that,” said Jonathan Klein, a former CNN president. One option for news executives worried that Trump might try to mislead the public could be to air briefings on tape delay so inaccuracies could be pointed out, he said. Given the importance of the story, though, “I don’t think they have a choice” but to air the briefings, said Klein, who spoke in an interview shortly after Monday’s session began.

"As coronavirus shutdowns and remain-at-home orders spread across the U.S., a growing number of people wonder what the tipping point is when the response becomes worse than the actual disease. The question has been whispered in conversations at homes, debated by academics in the back alleys of the internet, and shared quietly via e-mail messages among work colleagues. President Trump ripped the curtain back Monday, saying it can’t go on like this. “We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem,” Mr. Trump said at the White House, saying he’s giving the shutdown only a little more time, and then he’ll announce plans to get most people back to work, while focusing medical efforts on vulnerable populations in key geographic areas. “We will be quarantining many people in these areas. There are other areas that just aren’t affected, or are affected very little. Why would we close down 100% of the country?” he said. A senior administration official told The Washington Times there’s a “universal” sense within the White House that the health-vs-economy equation needs to be rebalanced and it will take more than the bill working its way through Congress right now. “Liquidity is great. Small business loans are great. Beefed up unemployment insurance is great. But none of it will mean anything unless people go back to work and we start having people buying and selling and working and doing,” the official said. “For the last week we’ve been a socialist country. You know what? It has been terrible. It turns out being Denmark sucks,” the official added. Mr. Trump’s blunt declaration stunned some policy-makers. “We’ve got to think about the human cost here,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN, defending shutdown orders as “extreme” but necessary to stymie the virus. “If you don’t slow this thing down, it will sacrifice a lot more on the other end of the equation.” The trouble is nobody knows for sure the size of the sacrifices on either end. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told Bloomberg News over the weekend that the unemployment rate could hit 30% over the next three months, and the country’s gross domestic product could drop 50%. Those are educated guesses, but then, so are current estimates of the threat of the disease, which are based on infection and mortality experiences in China, Italy and several cruise ships where outbreaks occurred. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, said the mortality rate in Wuhan, where COVID-19 was first detected in China, was 3%. In the rest of China it was about seven-tenths of a percent. And in South Korea it was seven or eight tenths of a percent. But she cautioned against reading too much into those stats, saying asymptomatic people weren’t tested so the true mortality rate is still unknown. Experts say major decisions are being made without knowing enough. “The response ought to be more, ‘Let’s try to resume production as quickly as we can,’” said Chris Edwards, an economist with the Cato Institute. “We’re going to ruin people’ lives in my view if all these mandatory closings go on too long.” The debate over where the tipping point is has raged in academia for weeks. A professor at the University of Chicago pegged it at $65 trillion — what a a three-year shutdown of the U.S. economy would cost. Anything less than $65 trillion is an acceptable loss in exchange for the lives that could be saved, Luigi Zingales said in a piece for Chicago’s Stigler Center. He looked at rates of infection and mortality and said left unchecked, COVID-19 could account for 9 million deaths in the U.S. But if social distancing and shutdowns can slow the spread of the disease, hospitals can lower the mortality rate, saving 7.2 million of those people, he calculated. That 7.2 million number, then, must be stacked up against the economic damage. Mr. Zingales said economists use a figure of $9 million per life for those age 65 and older — it’s derived from the statistical tipping point Americans see between risk reduction and safety enhancements — to place a value on a decision. That works out to $65 trillion in value of lives that could be saved by self-quarantines, social distancing and nonessential shutdowns. “Thus, even the simplest cost-benefit analysis suggests that the U.S. government should be willing to spend up to $65 trillion to avoid extra deaths,” Mr. Zingales wrote. “Since $65 trillion is 3 times the U.S. GDP, the United States should be willing to stop production for up to 3 years in order to eliminate the extra deaths.” John P.A. Ioannidis, an epidemiologist at Standard University and co-director of the school’s Meta-Research Innovation Center, weighed in with a contrary view, saying there’s just not enough data right now to say whether economy-killing decisions are merited. He said the mortality rates are too uncertain, but if it turns out to be on the low end, the worldwide lockdown “may be totally irrational. “It’s like an elephant being attacked by a house cat. Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies,” he wrote. Mr. Ioannidis said the most valuable step would be to try to figure out the prevalence of the infection by testing a truly random population. He said assuming 1% of the U.S. population gets infected, and using a mid-range mortality estimate of about three-tenths of a percent, it works out to about 10,000 deaths. At that rate, it’s background noise for the annual rate of deaths from flu-like illnesses. “In the absence of data, prepare-for-the-worst reasoning leads to extreme measures of social distancing and lockdowns. Unfortunately, we do not know if these measures work,” he wrote. Mr. Trump, at the White House on Monday, said he’s worried about the human costs of the economic chaos. He ticked off anxiety, depression and suicide. The senior administration official who spoke to The Times said the White House is pondering how to reframe the situation. “There’s a general sense now that you are essentially quarantining 250 million healthy, non-vulnerable people to protect what might be as few as 50 million vulnerable people. It would be much more favorable to protect who you want to protect, and let other people get back to work,” the official said. The Cato Institute’s Mr. Edwards concurred, saying there needs to be a way to clear and return some people to work. “I see people framing this as the economy on one hand and healthcare on the other. I think that’s a false dichotomy,” he said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was among those to say there’s got to be a balance, though he said he doesn’t regret his order forcing non-essential workers to shelter in place. “I did the right thing, I’m proud of it. At the same time, at one point you have to open the valve,” he said Monday. “You have to open the valve because that is oxygen for the economy. And this is not sustainable.” Mr. Cuomo said there might be a way to “stratify” who goes back to work first — for instance, younger people who are less vulnerable to the disease or people who’ve gotten sicker, recovered and have some immunity. “Can you have a more refined public health strategy that is also more productive or less destructive to the economy?” Mr. Cuomo said. • Tom Howell Jr. and S.A.

"District Department of Health announced 21 new cases of COVID-19 Monday night, one of which is a one-year-old girl, as elected officials in Maryland, Virginia and the District united to advocate for more resources. As of Monday evening, the region has recorded 11 deaths and over 600 positive cases of COVID-19, with 116 in the District, 219 in Virginia and 288 in Maryland. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser released a joint statement on their group effort to monitor the coronavirus, especially since the region is home to 360,000 federal government workers who help run the country. “The COVID-19 virus knows neither borders nor boundaries — it does not recognize state or city lines. We are working closely together to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” said the three executives. “Together, we are promoting social distancing and encouraging all of our residents to stay at home and avoid crowds and gatherings. In each of our jurisdictions, we will be enforcing crowd control measures and social distancing standards.” Businesses, schools, public buildings and parks are closed across the region in an effort to promote social distancing and slow the spread of COVID-19. Ms. Bowser has extended the public health emergency until at least April 25, meaning the ban on mass gatherings of 50 people or more will last until then and schools, restaurants and bars, public playgrounds and libraries will remain closed until then. Mr. Hogan has placed an indefinite ban on mass gatherings of 10 people or more, he ordered all non-essential businesses to close and he postponed the April 28 primary. Schools are to be closed at least until March 27. Mr. Northam ordered the closure of schools until the end of the academic year and ordered the closure of bars and restaurants, with exceptions for delivery and carry-out services, entertainment and personal care businesses, for at least a month. Mr. Northam also banned gatherings of 10 people or more.

"It took a pandemic to bring President Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell together. The president revealed Monday that he called the embattled Fed chairman to compliment him on the central bank’s emergency actions to rescue the economy that is struggling against the coronavirus outbreak. “I am happy with him,” the president told reporters.  “I called him today and I said, ‘Jerome, good job.’ I really think he’s caught up and he’s done the right thing.” Leading up to the pandemic, the president has repeatedly criticized Mr. Powell and the Fed for failing to cut interest rates rapidly to help the economy and stay competitive with other countries. He also has blasted Mr. Powell for the Fed raising interest rates in 2018. In the past few weeks, the Fed has taken several emergency actions to provide cash flow to businesses, loosen lending and ease the credit crunch for corporations and consumers. “Ultimately we will be rewarded because of the decisions he made … he’s really stepped up over the last week,” the president said of Mr. Powell. The president said that in the past, Mr. Powell “was a little bit slower than I would have liked.” But the president said of Mr. Powell’s recent leadership of the Fed, “I was proud of him. That took courage. He’s not finished. He’s got other arrows in the quiver. I’m very happy with the job he did.”  ",Trump gives rare praise to Fed chairman for emergency actions,"Monday, March 23, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/23/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-chairman-wins-trump-/,washington_times
"The World Health Organization said the coronavirus pandemic is “accelerating” as Britain imposed a three-week lockdown Monday and New York, bracing for a tidal wave of cases, ordered hospitals to increase their capacity by 50%. A senior member of the International Olympic Committee, meanwhile, said the Summer Games in Tokyo would not start as planned on July 24, after some countries said they wouldn’t send their athletes in the face of a pandemic that’s hit nearly every nation and is getting worse. WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus called on nations to maintain the fight, even if the numbers are alarming. “It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 cases and just four days for the third 100,000 cases,” he said. “You can see how the virus is accelerating.” “But we’re not prisoners to statistics,” he said. “We’re not helpless bystanders. We can change the trajectory of this pandemic.” The U.S. case tally zoomed to over 40,000, a tenfold rise from a week ago. Officials said they expect that number to spike in the coming days, especially if Americans refuse to heed warnings to stay at home and avoid crowds. “I want America to understand: this week, it’s going to get bad,” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on NBC’s “Today” program. “We really, really need everyone to stay at home.” The Trump administration and states are racing to dispatch protective gear to health workers and find enough life-saving ventilators to meet demand. Vice President Mike Pence announced a breakthrough Monday, saying devices used by anesthesiologists could be converted into ventilators. “We directed all of our governors again today to survey all of their outpatient clinics to identify what we believe are tens of thousands of these devices, which could add to our nation’s resources for ventilators for people that might be severely impacted by the coronavirus. We got a strong response from our governors,” Mr. Pence said at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. President Trump signed an executive order to crack down on retailers hiking prices on essential items in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, including masks and ventilators. “We have some people hoarding. We want to prevent price gouging and critical resources are going to be protected in every form,” Mr. Trump said at a press conference Monday. The order targets price gouging on N95 masks, which are critical to protecting health workers from being infected with the virus. Prices for the masks were fetching more than $1,000 in online retail stores. eBay ultimately banned their sales of such masks to crack down on price gouging. Mr. Ghebreyesus, meanwhile, said he will ask the Group of 20 nations to increase their production of hospital gear and drop export bans so that countries with the greatest need are equipped to deal with the pandemic. “Measures put in place to slow the spread of the virus may have unintended consequences by exacerbating shortages of essential protective gear, and the materials needed to make them,” he said. “Addressing the global shortage of these life-saving tools means addressing every part of the supply chain, from raw materials to finished product.” The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. Worldwide cases have more than doubled in the past week alone, to nearly 375,000. More than 16,000 people have died, including nearly 600 in the U.S. Britain joined the list of countries imposing strict lockdown measures. Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered most stores to close and banned gatherings of more than two people for three weeks. The pandemic has upended normal life in wide swaths of the developed world. European capitals are no longer teeming with tourists, while American parents are trying to telework and home-school their children at the same time. The only sports on TV are replays after pro leagues and colleges suspended play. Japan and the IOC were a notable holdout, but an all-but-inevitable postponement hit Monday. “On the basis of the information the IOC has, postponement has been decided,” IOC member Dick Pound told USA Today. “The parameters going forward have not been determined, but the Games are not going to start on July 24, that much I know.” The U.S. has the third-most cases in the world behind China and then Italy, where the death toll has reached a world-leading 6,000-plus. Deborah Birx, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, said only one person under 15 has died from the virus in Europe, according to available data. “We still see there is less severity in children,” Dr. Birx said. Dr. Birx said the evidence is reassuring but the elderly are at high risk, so everyone must follow Mr. Trump’s guidance to avoid crowds and stay at home as much as possible through the end of March. The president on Monday suggested he may loosen that guidance, citing the impact on the economy. He said the U.S. can’t be closed for months, and cited the higher number of people who die from flu or car crashes without stringent restrictions going into effect. Dr. Birx said the greater New York City area remains a big worry spot, however, because 28% of submitted tests come back positive compared to less than 8% elsewhere. “This is the group that needs to social distance and self-isolate,” Dr. Birx said of the region. “Clearly the virus had been circulating there for a number of weeks.” New York state has seen the most cases by far in the U.S., with more than 20,000 compared to 3,000 or fewer in every other state. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who holds daily briefings on the coronavirus, said they have 53,000 hospital beds available for the coronavirus but they may need 110,000 as more people get sick. “We are today issuing an emergency order that says to all hospitals you must increase your capacity by 50% — you must,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Find more beds, use more rooms.” He also said hospitals should try to increase their capacity by 100%. Mr. Cuomo on Sunday had accepted a recommendation from the Army Corps of Engineers for four temporary hospitals in the state at the Javits Convention Center, SUNY Stony Brook, SUNY Old Westbury, and the Westchester Convention Center. Touring the Javits Center in Manhattan, Mr. Cuomo said he hoped to see 1,000 emergency beds at the site within seven to 10 days. The idea is to free up space as regular hospitals get overrun by COVID-19 patients. “All systems are go here,” he said. He said they were also looking into building 1,000 separate beds for “lighter medical care.” “This is going to get much worse before it gets better,” the governor said. “We are still in the relative calm before the storm. You’re going to see the number of infections, the number of cases increase dramatically.” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said that public hospitals in his city were on the verge of becoming overwhelmed if they don’t get an influx of supplies this week. Mr. Cuomo also renewed his call for Mr. Trump to implement the Defense Production Act, saying states are currently competing with one another for supplies like protective masks and ventilators. “It does not nationalize any industry. All it does is say to a factory, you must produce this quantity,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Yes, it is an assertion of government power on private sector companies - yes. But so what? This is a national emergency, and you’re paying the private sector company.” Mr. Trump teed up the production act but hasn’t forced the private sector to produce anything, saying he doesn’t want to “nationalize” industries. The president spotlighted the start of a clinical trial in New York on Tuesday to determine if a drug against malaria — hydroxychloroquine — is effective against the coronavirus. The president frequently highlights anecdotal evidence the drug is effective against the new disease. “It would be a gift from God if that worked. It would be a big game-changer,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s something we have to try.” Mr. Cuomo said the fight against the coronavirus could last several months. No one will turn on the news, he said, and find out the ordeal is over after two weeks. “That is not going to happen,” he said, “so deal with this reality.” • Jeff Mordock and Adam Zielonka contributed to this report.

"President Trump said Monday he’s going to delay the deadline for compliance with Real ID, a federal mandate that was set to be enforced Oct. 1, preventing anyone without a secure identification from boarding a flight. About two-thirds of Americans currently lack compliant IDs because states have been slow to adopt them. Officials were expecting a surge of people at state motor vehicle offices to update their identifications over the next months, but the virus has made that impossible right now, the president said. So a delay was needed. “We will be announcing the new deadline very soon,” he said. Real ID grew out of one of the recommendations of the 9-11 Commission that studied the way the hijackers perpetrated the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The commission said some of the hijackers were in the country illegally, yet were able to obtain valid driver’s licenses that they used to board the airplanes they turned into missiles. The law containing Real ID was passed in 2005 and there was a May 11, 2011, deadline for states to comply. The Obama administration initiated several delays, finally setting the Oct. 1, 2020, deadline. Even with the extra years, a number of states had been begging for another delay. Before coronavirus Homeland Security had been coy about whether another one would be granted.

"President Trump said Monday that Asian-Americans should not be abused or somehow held responsible for the spread of a pathogen he’s frequently dubbed the “Chinese virus” because of its origins in the city of Wuhan. “They’re amazing people, and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form,” Mr. Trump said. The president says he calls it the “Chinese virus” because the outbreak began in Hubei Province, China. Critics say it’s a bigoted label and that it puts Asian-Americans at risk, citing many reports of bias from around the U.S. The World Health Organization has dubbed the coronavirus disease “COVID-19” — a shorthand of “coronavirus disease” and the year it was discovered —  to avoid place names or ethnic labels that fuel stigma. Mr. Trump underscored his defense of Asian-Americans on Twitter. “It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world,” Mr. Trump wrote. “They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form.

"Several European nations are evaluating powerful but potentially intrusive tools for fighting the coronavirus pandemic, a move that could put public health at odds with individual privacy. The tools in question are apps that would use real-time phone-location data to track the movements of virus carriers and the people they come in contact with. The aim would be to develop a better sense of where infections are flaring up, how they are spreading and when health authorities need to order quarantines and related measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. Britain, Germany and Italy are among the nations considering the enlistment of individual location data in the fight against the virus. That worries privacy advocates, who fear such ubiquitous surveillance could be abused in the absence of careful oversight, with potentially dire consequences for civil liberties. “These are testing times, but they do not call for untested new technologies,” a group of mostly British activists said in an open letter Monday  to the country’s National Health Service. The letter noted that such measures could put human rights at risk and may not work. Unless the data in question can be effectively anonymized, the new tools would mark a substantial departure from existing European disease-surveillance efforts, which have focused on tracking people’s movements with aggregated phone location data designed not to identify individuals. Italian police also began mobilizing drones on Monday to enforce restrictions on citizens’ movements. But there is a powerful argument in favor of more powerful digital tools, even if they shred privacy: They have been used by several of the Asian governments most successful at containing the pandemic, including in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.  Last week, Israel took the most extreme step yet by charging its Shin Bet domestic security agency with using smartphone location data to track the movements of virus carriers for the prior two weeks, using historical data to identify possible transmission. Epidemiologists call this process “contact tracing,” although traditionally it involves questioning newly diagnosed individuals about their contacts with others. So far, there’s no indication the U.S. government plans to track identifiable individuals for disease surveillance. A spokesperson for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy said it was not currently working on such an app. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.  The White House has reached out to Big Tech companies for help in the worst pandemic in a century, but Google and Facebook both told the AP they are not sharing people’s location data with governments.  A Google spokesperson said the company was exploring ways to use aggregated location information against COVID-19, but added that the location data Google normally gathers from phone users isn’t accurate enough for contact tracing. An AT&T; spokesperson said the company was not sharing real-time location tracking with U.S. government virus-trackers. Sprint declined to comment and Verizon did not immediately respond to a query. Contact-tracing apps being considered by European governments would, like Israel’s effort, go well beyond what those governments are currently getting from wireless carriers to identify “hot spots” of disease and human concentration. While legal safeguards exist in most democracies to protect digital privacy, the danger of the coronavirus could quickly compel policymakers to override them. On Friday, the European Union’s Data Protection Authority cautiously endorsed putting privacy on pause during the public health emergency. Italy’s Lazio region, which includes Rome and is home to 5.9 million people, rolled out a voluntary app  over the weekend to assist people placed under quarantine or who think they’ve been in contact with others infected by the coronavirus. Privacy advocates worry that such apps can be used to track people. Poland has introduced a more intrusive app  - its instructions say it’s voluntary - to enforce 14-day quarantine for an estimated 80,000 people.  Jens Wille, CEO of the Hamburg digital mapping company UbiLabs, developed an opt-in app prototype for contact tracing that he said German officials evaluated but chose not to adopt. Officials at the Robert Koch Institute, which is managing the country’s COVID-19 response, told the AP they did not yet have anything to say on the issue. “They are working on something,” said Wille. The chief executive of the innovation arm of Britain’s National Health Service, Matthew Gould, said in a statement that his office was “looking at whether app-based solutions might be helpful in tracking and managing coronavirus, and we have assembled expertise from inside and outside the organisation to do this as rapidly as possible.” In South Korea, a compulsory app enforces self-isolation for those ordered to maintain it. Anyone violating quarantine could face a $8,400 fine or up to a year in prison. Taiwan and Singapore also use smartphone apps to enforce quarantines via “electronic fences” that alert authorities when someone moves out of quarantine. Hong Kong health authorities use electronic wristbands to monitor all overseas travelers ordered into self-isolation. Italy’s minister of technological innovation, Paola Pisano, said in an interview Monday that a government task force is putting out a request for tracking-app candidates on Tuesday and expects to evaluate them by the end of the week. Pisano said she expects Italy’s app to be voluntary and for the government to protect individual privacy. One-sixth of Italy’s 60 million people don’t use the internet, she said, and older people - those most susceptible to being killed by the virus - are generally disinclined to download a new app, and might rebel if forced to do so.  Europeans are closely examining the South Korean model of contact tracing, which involves the use of personal information such as immigration, public transportation and credit-card records in addition to location-tracking GPS data. But the Korean government disclosed so much ostensibly anonymous personal data that digital sleuths were able to identify virus carriers based on such information as where patients visited just before testing positive. Some people boycotted businesses, stigmatized carriers and even used the data to track alleged marital infidelity. On Friday, South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was drafting new guidelines to scale back such abuses.  Michael Parker, an ethicist on an Oxford University team, said people are more likely to contact-tracing app if they’re not coerced - and the greater the participation the better the odds of identifying ‘hot spots’ and containing the virus.  “Identification and notification could be done anonymously,” he said. “You wouldn’t need to have to tell people where their possible infection came from.” But Ashkan Soltani, a former U.S. Federal Trade Commission chief technologist, cautioned that contact tracing via app needs to be complemented with other means of disease surveillance, as in South Korea. That begins with universal testing for the virus, which the U.S. doesn’t have yet. There are other problems. Location data from wireless carriers alone can produce a lot of false positives. Even phone-based GPS data is often inaccurate, Soltani noted, and could inaccurately identify strangers as meeting when they’re actually just in the same high-rise apartment building. Israel’s Army Radio reported Monday that some people had been erroneously forced into quarantine as a result of location errors. It did not say how many. Adi Carmi, a former Shin Bet official, told the station that such anomalies happen with any large scale system. “It’s reasonable to assume that there will be mistakes here and there,” he said.  Amid the uproar, the Israeli health ministry launched a smartphone app that lets users opt into tracking system so it can notify them if they have overlapped with any virus carriers over the past 14 days. The app is constantly updated with epidemiological data. The closest analogues in the U.S. are apps from startups K Health and Buoy Health that let people self-diagnose with an online questionnaire. If their symptoms are consistent with COVID-19, the individual can be connected with medical professionals to determine next steps. New York-based K Health shares data with the government for a “heat map” of virus spread but says it is keeping personal data private. — AP correspondents Kelvin Chan in London, Ilan Ben Zion in Jerusalem, Tong-hyung Kim in Seoul and Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report.

"AUSTIN, Texas — The governor and attorney general of Texas are moving to ban most abortions in the state during the coronavirus outbreak, declaring they don’t qualify as essential surgeries. Attorney General Ken Paxton said Monday that the order issued over the weekend by Gov. Greg Abbott barred “any type of abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.” Failure to comply with the order can result in penalties of up to $1,000 or 180 days of jail time, Paxton said. “No one is exempt from the governor’s executive order on medically unnecessary surgeries and procedures, including abortion providers,” Paxton said. “Those who violate the governor’s order will be met with the full force of the law.” The issue also has flared in Ohio, where abortion clinics received letters Friday from Republican Attorney General Dave Yost ordering them to cease all “non-essential” surgical abortions. Yost wrote that the procedures violate a March 17 order issued by the state health director. However, representatives of Ohio clinics said that they were in compliance with the health director’s order and planned to continue providing abortions. Amid the moves by Ohio and Texas, a coalition of anti-abortion groups urged its allies across the nation to ask governors to ban most abortions on the grounds they were not essential. “If abortion is a ‘choice’ then abortion is an elective procedure,” said Mark Harrington, president of the anti-abortion group Created Equal. Abortion-rights leaders nationwide decried the tactic, saying it was an affront to women grappling with difficult decisions amid the disruptions of the pandemic. “Abortion is time-sensitive, essential health care,” said Katherine Hancock Ragsdale, president of the National Abortion Federation. “Women deserve better than a craven exploitation of a health care crisis in furtherance of an anti-abortion agenda.” In Ohio, abortion clinics planned to remain in operation. Jennifer Branch, an attorney for the Women’s Med Center of Dayton, said the clinic had already taken steps to minimize the use of personal protective equipment — one of the issues raised in the state’s order. The CEOs of two Planned Parenthood affiliates in Ohio are said their clinics also were in compliance, having cut back on the use of equipment that is in short supply. Cleveland-based Preterm, the busiest abortion clinic in Ohio, is not open on Mondays but said it was continuing to take appointments for later in the week. Bethany McCorkle, a spokesman for Yost, said the orders sent to three abortion clinic operators weren’t politically motivated, but rather, were due to complaints from the public. She said they were similar to orders sent to a urology practice. In Texas, Planned Parenthood did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the order from Abbott, but it was hailed by anti-abortion activists. “The abortion industry has been consuming and hoarding medical supplies that are in desperate need around the state including masks, gloves, and other protective gear for medical professionals,” said Texas Right to Life. Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, called on abortion clinics nationwide to temporarily halt abortion services. “Abortion clinics conducting business as usual in the presence of a life-threatening disease shows just how callous pro-abortion groups and abortionists are to protecting life at any stage,” said Tobias. Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, director of state media campaigns for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said Planned Parenthood clinics were intend on remaning in operation. “While public health providers work together in our communities to care for patients whose health care can’t wait, some anti-abortion activists are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to push their ideological agenda,” she said. “This is not a time to play politics.” There were no immediate reports of other states planning to target abortion clinics with restrictions related to COVID-19, even in Republican-governed states that have been active in passing anti-abortion legislation in recent years. In Idaho, the governor’s office said the state “has not mandated providers stop procedures of any type. Health systems are determining what procedures are considered elective internally.” The executive director of Georgia Right to Life, Zemmie Fleck, said she has not heard of any plans by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to curtail abortions because of the coronavirus. But she suggested such a step would be warranted. “Already we see people, even people that I know personally, whose elective surgeries have been postponed due to this pandemic,” she said in a phone interview. “I would say the same should apply to the abortion industry as well.” Diane Derzis, owner of the only abortion clinic in Mississippi, told The Associated Press that the clinic had not been told by the state to stop providing the procedure. “It is our contention that we are an essential service,” Derzis said by phone from Alabama, where she lives. A spokeswoman for Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves did not immediately respond to a question from the AP on Monday about whether he will order a halt to abortions. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan says Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s order, issued Friday, to prohibit elective procedures does not extend to abortions. Whitmer supports abortion rights. Similarly, in North Carolina, health department spokeswoman Sarah Peel said abortion clinics would not be covered by a directive asking hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers to suspend all elective and non-urgent procedures and surgeries. These medical procedures are defined as those that would not cause harm to the patient if put off for at least four weeks, a letter to hospitals says. So surgical abortions are “not something that would need to be postponed,” said Peel. He department is in the administration of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who supports abortion rights. ___ Crary reported from New York and Carr Smyth from Columbus, Ohio.

"JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel appeared on the verge of a constitutional crisis Tuesday as top members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud urged their party colleague and parliament speaker to defy a Supreme Court order to hold an election for the prime minister’s successor. After suspending parliamentary activities last week, citing procedural issues and restrictions on large gatherings due to the spread of the coronavirus, Yuli Edelstein on Monday dismissed the court’s call to explain his delay in convening the Israeli Knesset, or parliament.  It sparked an unprecedented judicial rebuttal, with Supreme Court Chief Justice Esther Hayut ordering him to hold a vote by Wednesday and ruling that “the continued refusal to allow the vote in the Knesset plenum on the election of a permanent speaker is undermining the foundations of the democratic process.” Even after that, at least two Likud Cabinet ministers, including Netanyahu’s surrogate interim justice minister, called on Edelstein to defy the order, deeming it a judicial “coup” against Israel’s elected officials. Cabinet Minister Yariv Levin led the charge, accusing the court of trampling the principle of separation of powers. He said it was creating “anarchy” and acting as if it “owned the country.” Netanyahu has yet to comment but others in the party, while equally lambasting the high court, called on Edelstein to respect its ruling to avoid a full fledged constitutional crisis at such a sensitive time. The developments marked the apex of an ever-deepening standoff between Netanyahu’s opponents and supporters in the wake of the country’s third inconclusive election in less than a year and against the backdrop of a series of emergency executive measures enacted to quell the spread of the new virus. The opposition Blue and White party, which is backed by a slim majority in the newly elected Knesset, said the country’s legislature must continue to function at such a critical time to provide oversight of the government. The party accuses Netanyahu and his caretaker government of carrying out undemocratic measures amid the crisis, and using it as cover to cling to power.  With the country in near-shutdown mode, Netanyahu has already managed to postpone his own pending criminal trial on serious corruption charges and authorize unprecedented electronic surveillance of Israeli citizens. Even amid the health scare, Israelis have taken to the streets to protest what they consider an assault on Israeli democracy.  Blue and White is expected to choose a new speaker and use its parliamentary majority to push through legislation that could prevent Netanyahu from serving as prime minister in the future.  The Knesset on Monday voted 61-0 in favor of convening the key Arrangements Committee, which is authorized to create the parliament’s other decision-making committees. Later, it approved a half-dozen other temporary committees, including one devoted to the corona crisis. Netanyahu and his allies boycotted the votes to protest what they called a power play that relied on Arab members of parliament. Likud said it would take no part in the “unprecedented destructiveness.” Netanyahu’s Likud emerged as the largest party in the March 2 election but along with his smaller religious and nationalist allies only won the support of 58 lawmakers - leaving his right-wing bloc three seats short of the required majority in Parliament. Gantz’s majority bloc is deeply divided along ideological lines and unlikely to band together to form an alternative government. But they are determined to oppose Netanyahu and seem willing to cooperate in parliament. Replacing Edelstein on Wednesday appears to be the first step. The parliament speaker informed the court that he will “not agree to an ultimatum” and that “a permanent Knesset speaker has never been elected at a time of such great uncertainty concerning the composition of a future coalition.” He said he would not put the Knesset speaker vote on the agenda until the political situation becomes clearer.  Netanyahu has called on his rivals to join him in an emergency unity government to combat the global pandemic, but says that option will be gone if Edelstein is replaced.  In Israel, daily life has largely shut down with tens of thousands out of work and all but essential movement out of the home restricted. Cases have been multiplying over the past week, with more than 1,650 people testing positive for the new virus and fears that the spread will soon overwhelm the health system. One patient has died and 31 are in serious condition. Opposition leader Benny Gantz has pledged to support the government in its effort to combat the virus. But he and his allies have been skeptical about Netanyahu’s power-sharing overtures, concerned that he will not follow through on his promises to cede power in 18 months. If no compromise or alternative government is found, Israel could once again find itself faced with the prospect of yet another unfathomable election. Given the current state of lock down and fear of contagion it’s not clear if that would even be possible. ____ Follow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap  ",Likud members urge speaker to defy Israeli high court order,"Tuesday, March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/24/likud-members-urge-speaker-to-defy-israeli-high-co/,washington_times
"The House Judiciary Committee’s upcoming oversight hearing with Attorney General William P. Barr was postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak, Chairman Jerrold Nadler said Monday. Mr. Nadler, New York Democrat, tweeted that the hearing needed to be pushed back because of “overwhelming” health concerns. The hearing was scheduled for March 31, and it was the first time Mr. Barr was set to appear before the committee since he refused to testify last year. “DOJ has made a commitment to rescheduling the hearing for when the crisis abates and the committee is able to reconvene,” Mr. Nadler tweeted.

They were also planning to ask him about special counsel Robert Mueller’s conclusions regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election.

"As coronavirus shutdowns and remain-at-home orders spread across the U.S., a growing number of people wonder what the tipping point is when the response becomes worse than the actual disease. The question has been whispered in conversations at homes, debated by academics in the back alleys of the internet, and shared quietly via e-mail messages among work colleagues. President Trump ripped the curtain back Monday, saying it can’t go on like this. “We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem,” Mr. Trump said at the White House, saying he’s giving the shutdown only a little more time, and then he’ll announce plans to get most people back to work, while focusing medical efforts on vulnerable populations in key geographic areas. “We will be quarantining many people in these areas. There are other areas that just aren’t affected, or are affected very little. Why would we close down 100% of the country?” he said. A senior administration official told The Washington Times there’s a “universal” sense within the White House that the health-vs-economy equation needs to be rebalanced and it will take more than the bill working its way through Congress right now. “Liquidity is great. Small business loans are great. Beefed up unemployment insurance is great. But none of it will mean anything unless people go back to work and we start having people buying and selling and working and doing,” the official said. “For the last week we’ve been a socialist country. You know what? It has been terrible. It turns out being Denmark sucks,” the official added. Mr. Trump’s blunt declaration stunned some policy-makers. “We’ve got to think about the human cost here,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN, defending shutdown orders as “extreme” but necessary to stymie the virus. “If you don’t slow this thing down, it will sacrifice a lot more on the other end of the equation.” The trouble is nobody knows for sure the size of the sacrifices on either end. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told Bloomberg News over the weekend that the unemployment rate could hit 30% over the next three months, and the country’s gross domestic product could drop 50%. Those are educated guesses, but then, so are current estimates of the threat of the disease, which are based on infection and mortality experiences in China, Italy and several cruise ships where outbreaks occurred. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, said the mortality rate in Wuhan, where COVID-19 was first detected in China, was 3%. In the rest of China it was about seven-tenths of a percent. And in South Korea it was seven- or eight-tenths of a percent. But she cautioned against reading too much into those stats, saying asymptomatic people weren’t tested so the true mortality rate is still unknown. Experts say major decisions are being made without knowing enough. “The response ought to be more, ‘Let’s try to resume production as quickly as we can,’ ” said Chris Edwards, an economist with the Cato Institute. “We’re going to ruin people’ lives in my view if all these mandatory closings go on too long.” The debate over where the tipping point is has raged in academia for weeks. A professor at the University of Chicago pegged it at $65 trillion — what a a three-year shutdown of the U.S. economy would cost. Anything less than $65 trillion is an acceptable loss in exchange for the lives that could be saved, Luigi Zingales said in a piece for Chicago’s Stigler Center. He looked at rates of infection and mortality and said left unchecked, COVID-19 could account for 9 million deaths in the U.S. But if social distancing and shutdowns can slow the spread of the disease, hospitals can lower the mortality rate, saving 7.2 million of those people, he calculated. That 7.2 million number, then, must be stacked up against the economic damage. Mr. Zingales said economists use a figure of $9 million per life for those age 65 and older — it’s derived from the statistical tipping point Americans see between risk reduction and safety enhancements — to place a value on a decision. That works out to $65 trillion in value of lives that could be saved by self-quarantines, social distancing and nonessential shutdowns. “Thus, even the simplest cost-benefit analysis suggests that the U.S. government should be willing to spend up to $65 trillion to avoid extra deaths,” Mr. Zingales wrote. “Since $65 trillion is 3 times the U.S. GDP, the United States should be willing to stop production for up to 3 years in order to eliminate the extra deaths.” John P.A. Ioannidis, an epidemiologist at Standard University and co-director of the school’s Meta-Research Innovation Center, weighed in with a contrary view, saying there’s just not enough data right now to say whether economy-killing decisions are merited. He said the mortality rates are too uncertain, but if it turns out to be on the low end, the worldwide lockdown “may be totally irrational. “It’s like an elephant being attacked by a house cat. Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies,” he wrote. Mr. Ioannidis said the most valuable step would be to try to figure out the prevalence of the infection by testing a truly random population. He said assuming 1% of the U.S. population gets infected, and using a mid-range mortality estimate of about three-tenths of a percent, it works out to about 10,000 deaths. At that rate, it’s background noise for the annual rate of deaths from flu-like illnesses. “In the absence of data, prepare-for-the-worst reasoning leads to extreme measures of social distancing and lockdowns. Unfortunately, we do not know if these measures work,” he wrote. Mr. Trump, at the White House on Monday, said he’s worried about the human costs of the economic chaos. He ticked off anxiety, depression and suicide. The senior administration official who spoke to The Times said the White House is pondering how to reframe the situation. “There’s a general sense now that you are essentially quarantining 250 million healthy, non-vulnerable people to protect what might be as few as 50 million vulnerable people. It would be much more favorable to protect who you want to protect, and let other people get back to work,” the official said. The Cato Institute’s Mr. Edwards concurred, saying there needs to be a way to clear and return some people to work. “I see people framing this as the economy on one hand and healthcare on the other. I think that’s a false dichotomy,” he said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was among those to say there’s got to be a balance, though he said he doesn’t regret his order forcing non-essential workers to shelter in place. “I did the right thing, I’m proud of it. At the same time, at one point you have to open the valve,” he said Monday. “You have to open the valve because that is oxygen for the economy. And this is not sustainable.” Mr. Cuomo said there might be a way to “stratify” who goes back to work first — for instance, younger people who are less vulnerable to the disease or people who’ve gotten sicker, recovered and have some immunity. “Can you have a more refined public health strategy that is also more productive or less destructive to the economy?” Mr. Cuomo said. • Tom Howell Jr. and S.A.

"The World Health Organization said the coronavirus pandemic is “accelerating” as Britain imposed a three-week lockdown Monday and New York, bracing for a tidal wave of cases, ordered hospitals to increase their capacity by 50%. A senior member of the International Olympic Committee, meanwhile, said the Summer Games in Tokyo would not start as planned on July 24, after some countries said they wouldn’t send their athletes in the face of a pandemic that’s hit nearly every nation and is getting worse. WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus called on nations to maintain the fight, even if the numbers are alarming. “It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 cases and just four days for the third 100,000 cases,” he said. “You can see how the virus is accelerating.” “But we’re not prisoners to statistics,” he said. “We’re not helpless bystanders. We can change the trajectory of this pandemic.” The U.S. case tally zoomed to over 40,000, a tenfold rise from a week ago. Officials said they expect that number to spike in the coming days, especially if Americans refuse to heed warnings to stay at home and avoid crowds. “I want America to understand: This week, it’s going to get bad,” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on NBC’s “Today” program. “We really, really need everyone to stay at home.” The Trump administration and states are racing to dispatch protective gear to health workers and find enough life-saving ventilators to meet demand. Vice President Mike Pence announced a breakthrough Monday, saying devices used by anesthesiologists could be converted into ventilators. “We directed all of our governors again today to survey all of their outpatient clinics to identify what we believe are tens of thousands of these devices, which could add to our nation’s resources for ventilators for people that might be severely impacted by the coronavirus. We got a strong response from our governors,” Mr. Pence said at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. President Trump signed an executive order to crack down on retailers hiking prices on essential items in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, including masks and ventilators. “We have some people hoarding. We want to prevent price gouging and critical resources are going to be protected in every form,” Mr. Trump said at a press conference Monday. The order targets price gouging on N95 masks, which are critical to protecting health workers from being infected with the virus. Prices for the masks were fetching more than $1,000 in online retail stores. eBay ultimately banned their sales of such masks to crack down on price gouging. Mr. Ghebreyesus, meanwhile, said he will ask the Group of 20 nations to increase their production of hospital gear and drop export bans so that countries with the greatest need are equipped to deal with the pandemic. “Measures put in place to slow the spread of the virus may have unintended consequences by exacerbating shortages of essential protective gear, and the materials needed to make them,” he said. “Addressing the global shortage of these life-saving tools means addressing every part of the supply chain, from raw materials to finished product.” The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. Worldwide cases have more than doubled in the past week alone, to nearly 375,000. More than 16,000 people have died, including nearly 600 in the U.S. Britain joined the list of countries imposing strict lockdown measures. Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered most stores to close and banned gatherings of more than two people for three weeks. The pandemic has upended normal life in wide swaths of the developed world. European capitals are no longer teeming with tourists, while American parents are trying to telework and home-school their children at the same time. The only sports on TV are replays after pro leagues and colleges suspended play. Japan and the IOC were a notable holdout, but an all-but-inevitable postponement hit Monday. “On the basis of the information the IOC has, postponement has been decided,” IOC member Dick Pound told USA Today. “The parameters going forward have not been determined, but the Games are not going to start on July 24, that much I know.” The U.S. has the third-most cases in the world behind China and then Italy, where the death toll has reached a world-leading 6,000-plus. Deborah Birx, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, said only one person under 15 has died from the virus in Europe, according to available data. “We still see there is less severity in children,” Dr. Birx said. Dr. Birx said the evidence is reassuring but the elderly are at high risk, so everyone must follow Mr. Trump’s guidance to avoid crowds and stay at home as much as possible through the end of March. The president on Monday suggested he may loosen that guidance, citing the impact on the economy. He said the U.S. can’t be closed for months, and cited the higher number of people who die from flu or car crashes without stringent restrictions going into effect. Dr. Birx said the greater New York City area remains a big worry spot, however, because 28% of submitted tests come back positive compared to less than 8% elsewhere. “This is the group that needs to social distance and self-isolate,” Dr. Birx said of the region. “Clearly the virus had been circulating there for a number of weeks.” New York state has seen the most cases by far in the U.S., with more than 20,000 compared to 3,000 or fewer in every other state. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who holds daily briefings on the coronavirus, said they have 53,000 hospital beds available for the coronavirus but they may need 110,000 as more people get sick. “We are today issuing an emergency order that says to all hospitals you must increase your capacity by 50% — you must,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Find more beds, use more rooms.” He also said hospitals should try to increase their capacity by 100%. Mr. Cuomo on Sunday had accepted a recommendation from the Army Corps of Engineers for four temporary hospitals in the state at the Javits Convention Center, SUNY Stony Brook, SUNY Old Westbury, and the Westchester Convention Center. Touring the Javits Center in Manhattan, Mr. Cuomo said he hoped to see 1,000 emergency beds at the site within seven to 10 days. The idea is to free up space as regular hospitals get overrun by COVID-19 patients. “All systems are go here,” he said. He said they were also looking into building 1,000 separate beds for “lighter medical care.” “This is going to get much worse before it gets better,” the governor said. “We are still in the relative calm before the storm. You’re going to see the number of infections, the number of cases increase dramatically.” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said that public hospitals in his city were on the verge of becoming overwhelmed if they don’t get an influx of supplies this week. Mr. Cuomo also renewed his call for Mr. Trump to implement the Defense Production Act, saying states are currently competing with one another for supplies like protective masks and ventilators. “It does not nationalize any industry. All it does is say to a factory, you must produce this quantity,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Yes, it is an assertion of government power on private sector companies - yes. But so what? This is a national emergency, and you’re paying the private sector company.” Mr. Trump teed up the production act but hasn’t forced the private sector to produce anything, saying he doesn’t want to “nationalize” industries. The president spotlighted the start of a clinical trial in New York on Tuesday to determine if a drug against malaria — hydroxychloroquine — is effective against the coronavirus. The president frequently highlights anecdotal evidence the drug is effective against the new disease. “It would be a gift from God if that worked. It would be a big game-changer,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s something we have to try.” Mr. Cuomo said the fight against the coronavirus could last several months. No one will turn on the news, he said, and find out the ordeal is over after two weeks. “That is not going to happen,” he said, “so deal with this reality.” • Jeff Mordock and Adam Zielonka contributed to this report.

Opposition leader Benny Gantz’s majority bloc is deeply divided along ideological lines and unlikely to band together to form an alternative government. But they are determined to oppose Netanyahu and seem willing to cooperate in parliament. Replacing Edelstein on Wednesday appears to be the first step. The parliament speaker informed the court that he will “not agree to an ultimatum” and that “a permanent Knesset speaker has never been elected at a time of such great uncertainty concerning the composition of a future coalition.” He said he would not put the Knesset speaker vote on the agenda until the political situation becomes clearer.  On Tuesday, amid the uproar, Netanyahu seemed to tone down his rhetoric, repeating a call for his rivals to join him in an emergency unity government to combat the global pandemic. But he’s previously said that option will be gone if Edelstein is replaced.  “This is a time that tests leadership and national responsibility. The citizens of Israel need a unity government that will save their lives and livelihoods,” he tweeted. “We both know the gaps between us are small and can be overcome.” In Israel, daily life has largely shut down with tens of thousands out of work and all but essential movement out of the home restricted. Cases have been multiplying over the past week, with more than 1,650 people testing positive for the new virus and fears that the spread will soon overwhelm the health system. One patient has died and 31 are in serious condition. Gantz, who heads Blue and White, has pledged to support the government in its effort to combat the virus. But he and his allies have been skeptical about Netanyahu’s power-sharing overtures, concerned that he will not follow through on his promises to cede power in 18 months. If no compromise or alternative government is found, Israel could once again find itself faced with the prospect of yet another unfathomable election. Given the current state of lock down and fear of contagion it’s not clear if that would even be possible. ____ Follow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap  ",Likud members urge speaker to defy Israeli high court order,"Tuesday, March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/24/likud-members-urge-speaker-to-defy-israeli-high-co/,washington_times
"President Trump called on Congress Tuesday to reject Democrats’ “nonsense” and approve a $1.8 trillion package proposed by Senate Republicans to provide relief for workers and businesses from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. “This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal. It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!” Mr. Trump tweeted. “Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today.” A rival $2.5 trillion bill unveiled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi includes proposals for expanded solar energy tax credits and tighter fuel efficiency requirements for any airlines that accept government aid.

"Sen.

"The Kansas City Star, March 20 Johnson County commissioners were told only Thursday that a California or New York-style shelter-in-place order was possible to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. On Friday, they stressed that no lockdown plan was in place. By Saturday, it indeed was - not just in Johnson County, but across the metro, in Kansas City, Jackson County and Wyandotte County. With allowances for trips to grocery stores, pharmacies, hardware stores, medical visits, dry cleaners, laundromats and banks, residents of the area are being told to stay home as of 12:01 a.m. Tuesday - though, in truth, residents should comply with all deliberate speed. Anyone listening to Johnson County public health officer Dr. Joseph LeMaster - also of KU Medical Center - isn’t surprised by the lockdown so much as the speed with which it descended after his measured remarks to commissioners Thursday. His gentle bedside manner belying the ominousness of his words, he cautioned them that such a directive could be coming “as early as next week.” As it turns out, it came sooner than that, as increasing numbers of states around the nation and leaders in the St. Louis area announced their own shelter-in-place orders, which are having trouble keeping up with the spread of the virulent virus. Like the drastic, rolling cancellations of iconic American events such as the NCAA basketball tournament and many other gatherings, shelter-in-place orders have come in waves across the country during the past few days. While just two days before, LeMaster had held out hope of mitigating the spread of COVID-19 through voluntary self-isolating, mandatory dine-in restaurant closures and prohibitions on gatherings of more than 10 people, it became increasingly clear a mandatory stay-at-home order was necessary. The need was apparent even Saturday morning, as traffic still clogged major Johnson County arteries, and shoppers were out transacting undoubtedly nonessential business. Alarmingly, some people had earlier been asking what the limits of activity were under the county’s looser emergency order, LeMaster told commissioners. Translation: They wanted to be able to get out and do as much as they could get away with. That’s dangerous thinking, he suggested in not so many words. It’s thinking that may follow the letter of the order but not the spirit of stopping the spread. LeMaster had said he wanted people to do as little as they could, rather than as much as they could get away with, “so that we don’t have to go to that more-draconian type of state” - adding ominously, “I will not promise you that we will not be there, or come back to you, or make that sort of an order, even as early as next week.” It’s here, earlier than expected, even for the Johnson County public health officer. Johnson County officials downplayed the possibility of a shelter-in-place order Friday, saying they didn’t want elevated levels of public concern. Now it’s evident that elevated concern would’ve been a good thing. “People who are not alarmed - who think that this is all being blown out of proportion - are themselves minimizing the greatest public health crisis of our generation,” Dr. LeMaster said in a statement to The Star. “Everyone needs to take the public health orders with utmost seriousness and do their best not just to comply, but to do so in the spirit that they would if we were being invaded by an alien army. We must, every last one of us, take it as our duty in the national interest to limit the spread of transmission.” Whether the fault of the virus or our apathy in fighting its spread - likely both - the more restrictive lockdowns you’ve been seeing in the national news have come to the Kansas City area. LeMaster predicted it might be this way if we didn’t take voluntary self-isolation more seriously. “If we have to go down to ‘shelter in place’ where each person is pretty much in their home all the time, it’s going to make things a whole lot more difficult for the city and for the county, for business - for everything to be able to function,” LeMaster told commissioners. “Even though (the prior state of emergency) is difficult, it’s not as difficult as it could be, or as difficult as it is in other parts of the country.” We will now see what he means. ______ The St. Joseph News-Press, March 22 In these tumultuous times, we can count on a few certainties. Downtown employees report that the city of St. Joseph still enforces parking meter violations. Business might be ground to a halt, but it takes more than a pandemic to stop the meter maid, apparently. Tax obligations are postponed but hardly absolved. The Internal Revenue Service pushed back the filing deadline to July 15, but there’s no more Mr. Nice Guy starting on July 16. Then there’s the unseemly influence of lobbyists in Jefferson City, a festering issue that may have worsened when term limits flooded the state capital with retired lawmakers. One of those lawmakers is Steve Tilley, a former House speaker who now serves as a state lobbyist and confidant of Missouri Gov. Mike Parson. Tilley certainly landed on his feet, with a growing list of clients, including many in the state’s burgeoning medical marijuana industry. The Kansas City Star reports that Tilley, a Republican, has become a central figure in FBI inquiries into questionable utility contracts in Independence and the rocky roll-out of medical marijuana licensing. Tilley’s company lobbies on behalf of Independence Power & Light. He also has multiple clients in the medical marijuana industry, including the Missouri Medical Cannabis Trade Association. That industry group included members who were able to win state licenses to grow and sell marijuana.As is normally the case, the FBI offers no public comment on the nature of its inquiries. An investigation, in and of itself, does not mean a crime has been committed. It does fuel a lack of public confidence in the state’s handling of medical marijuana, which voters legalized in the 2018 general election. Already, the state’s effort is beset with lawsuits and questions about inconsistencies in the process for awarding licenses. Some of this is expected. That state can’t allow medical cannabis on every corner, so some applicants were bound to walk away disappointed. But if the winners happened to be associated with a powerful former state politician, and a third-party entity scores applicants in an oblique grading process, then public confidence is bound to go up in smoke. It’s not a stretch to suggest that Parson, who has received some criticism for an initial COVID-19 response that defers to local authorities on issues of school closings and limits on public gatherings, has bigger fish to fry at this point in time. A politician isn’t just judged by the actions he or she takes. It’s also worth noting the company that an elected official keeps. In this case, Parson would be wise to sever ties with Tilley as this investigation plays out and the state turns its focus to more critical issues. ____ The Jefferson City News-Tribune, March 21 As COVID-19 sweeps across the nation and the world, the American Red Cross faces a severe blood shortage. As of Thursday, the agency said nearly 2,700 Red Cross blood drives have been canceled across the country due to coronavirus concerns, resulting in some 86,000 fewer blood donations. Blood donation centers are taking extra precautions amid the pandemic and say donating blood is still safe. The Red Cross says there is no evidence to suggest the coronavirus can transfer through a blood donation. Also, they now are implementing these new precautions: Checking the temperature of staff and donors before entering a drive to make sure they are healthy; Providing hand sanitizer for use before the drive, as well as throughout the donation process; Spacing beds, where possible, to follow social distancing practices between blood donors; and Increasing enhanced disinfecting of surfaces and equipment. People can set an appointment to give blood with the American Red Cross by visiting RedCrossBlood.org, using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, calling 1-800-RED-CROSS or activating the Blood Scheduling Skill for Amazon Alexa. To reduce the time it takes to donate, complete a RapidPass online health history questionnaire. A donation of blood is the gift of life. We’re a compassionate society. In this time of emergency, we need to think even more about our neighbors, our community, our nation. At some point in your life, there’s a good chance you or one of your loved ones will need blood. Let’s all work to make sure it’s available. Now is the time to pay it forward.

"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) - Bangladesh’s government will release imprisoned former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia for six months on the condition that she stays at home and does not leave the country, the law minister said Tuesday.  Anisul Huq said Zia, 74, is being released on humanitarian grounds considering her age. Zia, the country’s opposition leader, was sentenced to 17 years in prison in two corruption cases. Her Bangladesh Nationalist Party says the cases were politically motivated. The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Zia’s archrival, denies the allegation.  Zia’s party says she is seriously ill with ailments including respiratory problems and arthritis. She is currently being treated in a prison cell at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University in Dhaka.  “The government has decided to release her after staying her sentences, … showing its generosity because of her age and on humanitarian grounds,” Huq said. “She will receive her remaining treatment at home.”  He said the Ministry of Home Affairs will issue a notification for her release. It was not immediately clear exactly when she would be freed.  In February, the High Court rejected an appeal by Zia seeking her release for medical treatment in the United Kingdom for chronic arthritis. Zia was convicted in February 2018 on charges of misusing her power by embezzling some $250,000 in donations meant for an orphanage trust. She was later convicted in another corruption case.  Zia and Hasina are both part of political dynasties. Zia is the widow of Ziaur Rahman, a general-turned-president who was assassinated in 1981. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s first president and independence leader, who was assassinated in 1975.  Bangladesh gained independence through a nine-month war against Pakistan in 1971.

"White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Tuesday the administration is taking a look at reopening some targeted areas of the country for business and that congressional leaders are close to striking a deal on a $2 trillion-plus fiscal stimulus package. “After the 15-day period is over, which I guess ends [at] the end of this week or the weekend, we will take another look at the possibility of targeting areas that are safe enough,” Mr. Kudlow, who heads White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on Fox Business Network. “We have to do this with the assent and help of the health specialists — there’s no question about that,” he said. He said they’re hearing from a lot of small businesses who want to see if they can “liberalize” and “target more” and “stop as many shutdowns as we have.” “That doesn’t mean [we’re] going to leave social distancing; that doesn’t mean we’re going to walk away from the mitigating advice that we’ve received from our health specialists and so forth,” Mr. Kudlow said. “It just means we’re going to take a slightly different look at this and I think the president would like to do something in the next couple of weeks.” On March 16, President Trump had announced a 15-day period during which people were encouraged to stay at home if possible and avoid elective surgery. But Mr. Trump said on Monday that the country can’t stay shut down forever and suggested he’d like to take another look at things at the end of that time frame. A number of governors around the country have also issued various degrees of “stay at home” orders, as well as directives to shutter non-essential businesses. Mr. Kudlow also said Capitol Hill leaders were very close to striking a deal on a $2 trillion-plus fiscal stimulus package to try to assist workers and businesses who have been adversely affected by the coronavirus outbreak. He said the package is “absolutely essential” to the reopening of the economy. “We know small businesses have been shut in, we know that a lot of workers are either furloughed or laid off,” he said. Talks had stalled despite a quick timeline laid out by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, with Republicans complaining that Democrats were tacking on unrelated items at the last minute that dealt with issues like unions and election funding. Mr. Kudlow said that coupled with $4 trillion of lending authority for the Federal Reserve, the stimulus could add up to about $6 trillion, or 30% of GDP. “This is the largest Main Street assistance package in the history of the country,” he said. He said they’ve compromised with Democrats on issues like unemployment insurance. “Here we are with a $6 trillion package and we may be taking a new look at the shut-ins around the country,” he said. “But let’s get this thing passed. Let’s just get this bill passed. It’s so important.”  ",Trump economic adviser: We'll take another look at reopening safe areas for business," -

"The blows keep coming for former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s failed presidential campaign. A Bloomberg campaign worker filed a class-action lawsuit against the campaign for allegedly getting rid of more than 1,000 workers who Mr. Bloomberg promised to employ through the 2020 election regardless of his campaign’s outcome. The lawsuit, brought by lawyers from the Shavitz Law Group and Outten & Golden, claims Mike Bloomberg 2020 Inc. violated the Fair Labor Standards Act. “Employees have been damaged by losing their jobs with Bloomberg approximately eight months early, losing their income, and losing their healthcare,” the lawsuit argues. “Bloomberg’s conduct amounts to such gross, wanton or willful fraud, dishonest and intentional non-disclosure of material facts as to involve a high degree of moral culpability, making it appropriate to deter Bloomberg from engaging in similar conduct in the future.” The former worker bringing the suit was a field organizer who wants compensation, including “unpaid overtime pay,” for themselves and all of the others let go amid the coronavirus outbreak. “Many of these field organizers and other campaign employees resigned or took leaves of absences from their then-current employment, and a lot of them relocated to different cities and states in order to work for Mr. Bloomberg,” Gregg Shavitz, Shavitz Law Group founding partner, said in a statement. “The campaign induced our client into employment and told her that it would last until the November election. Then they fired her and other hard-working Americans, pulling the rug out from under them in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic. Bloomberg should make this right.” The Bloomberg campaign disputed that its former workers have been hung out to dry. “This campaign paid its staff wages and benefits that were much more generous than any other campaign this year,” a Bloomberg campaign spokesperson said. “Staff worked 39 days on average, but they were also given several weeks of severance and health care through March, something no other campaign did this year.” The Bloomberg campaign said it would create a fund to ensure that staff receive health care funding through April and noted that many former staffers would go to work for the Democratic National Committee because of the large monetary transfer from Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign to the DNC. Mr. Bloomberg’s failed campaign and decision to suddenly get rid of campaign workers is having ramifications across the country. In Arlington, Virginia, Mr. Bloomberg’s former campaign office is poised to become a liquor store. Virginia ABC is reportedly planning to open a liquor store at Mr. Bloomberg’s former Arlington location, but the store has been slowed by the coronavirus outbreak.

"The Trump administration is using the emergency Defense Production Act for the first time Tuesday to allocate coronavirus test kits, said FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor. “We’re going to use it today,” Mr. Gaynor said on CNN. “We’re going to use it for about 60,000 test kits, and really we’re going to use the allocation portion of the DPA. We want to be thoughtful and meaningful on how we do it for the best result.” Mr. Gaynor didn’t say where or how the government would be allocating the test kits, using its emergency authority that President Trump invoked Wednesday. But he said it was the first such use of the new authority. “There’s some test kits we need to get our hands on,” Mr. Gaynor said. He also said the administration will add some DPA language into federal contracts to obtain about 500 million protective masks. His announcement came soon after Mr. Trump tweeted that “the Defense Production Act is in full force, but haven’t had to use it because no one has said NO!” He said “millions” of surgical masks were being delivered to states by manufacturers voluntarily. Under the allocation portion of the 1950 law, federal agencies can require a company to reserve supplies in anticipation of a priority-rated order;  require a company to stop producing a certain item; and specify the maximum amount of supplies authorized for specific use. Some Democratic officials have been imploring Mr. Trump to use the law to order private companies to manufacture and deliver more ventilators, masks and other protective gear, to ease demand and reduce costs to states.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that lawmakers are close to finalizing a deal on a $2 trillion phase three coronavirus economic stimulus plan. Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, made the rounds on the morning talk shows and said she was optimistic about the deal Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin have been negotiating around the clock. “My hope is that while we’re in the red zone here, we get across the finish line, and that we do so in a way that we can bring the bill to the floor under unanimous consent,” she said on MSNBC. “Assuming we’re in agreement … we can do that very quickly,” Mrs. Pelosi added. After two procedural votes failed the Senate, Mr. McConnell was forced to essentially restart the clock on the next vote — setting that up for likely Wednesday, even if a deal is reached on Tuesday. Mr. Schumer on the Senate floor said negotiators were at the “two-yard-line” but expects a deal in a matter of hours. The stimulus package would provide direct cash payments to the American public, loans to small businesses, aid to hard-hit industries and more resources to the stressed health care system. Two of Democrats’ biggest priorities were more unemployment benefits, oversight on the aid to corporations, and funds to stabilize state and local governments. Mrs. Pelosi noted that if they can’t vote on the Senate bill with unanimous consent, they would consider other options — amending it on the House floor or passing their own bill. On Monday evening, House Democrats unveiled their own $2.5 trillion plan that would do much of what the Senate bill does but expands to also fund 2020 elections and student loan forgiveness. It also implements new green regulations for airlines that receive aid. Speaking about the Senate bill negotiations, Mrs. Pelosi touted that Democrats secured a number of victories, most notably an inspector general and congressional oversight of the money that hard-hit corporations will receive from the government. She noted that they did not, however, secure the funds they wanted for elections, but said it was not something that would derail the bill. “This is a bubble up.

"Joseph R. Biden said Tuesday that his biggest concern in combating the coronavirus is making sure that Americans are not being given “misinformation” about the virus. During an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” the 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful urged viewers to “listen to the scientist” and to “listen to the doctors,” suggesting the public is better off heeding the advice from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, than from President Trump. “Listen to what they have to say, and I respectfully suggest that you should have Dr. Fauci on a lot more than the president or anyone who is not an expert like Fauci, laying out exactly what is going on,” Mr. Biden said to the show’s hosts. Mr. Trump suggested this week that he would be looking to relax the social distancing guidelines after 15 days in order to revive the economy. Mr. Biden is searching for ways to reinvent his campaign in the middle of a national emergency that has basically halted the 2020 primary race. The 77-year-old has taken to holding daily briefings on the virus in an attempt to counter Mr. Trump’s daily briefings at the White House.

"Sen. Rick Scott, Florida Republican, condemned Democrats for holding up the $2 trillion coronavirus aid package over unrelated wish-list items on climate change, corporate diversity and voter registration, saying that they “don’t care.” “They don’t care. This is why they should never — the Democrats should never, ever be in charge of anything, because they don’t care about the American public,” Mr. Scott said Tuesday on “The Hugh Hewitt Show.” In the radio interview, Mr. Scott referred to then-Obama White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel’s famous 2008 quote, “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.” “They care about their liberal agenda, and they’re going to do everything they can do, they’re going to do exactly what Rahm Emanuel said: They’re not going to let a crisis go to waste,” Mr. Scott said. “And they’re going to try to, you know, put on Americans a whole bunch of their liberal policies.” Senate Democrats have twice blocked votes on the coronavirus financial-assistance bill, calling it a “slush fund” aimed at bailing out corporations. Meanwhile, Republicans have accused Democrats of seeking to stuff the measure with renewable-energy tax credits; emissions mandates on the aviation and cruise industries; diversity requirements for corporate boards, and early voting and same-day voter registration. Mr. Scott said the bill was urgently needed to help workers who have lost jobs and small businesses at risk of failing as the coronavirus quarantines shut down economic activity. “It’s a tough life for these people right now,” Mr. Scott said. “And then you watch the Democrats. They don’t care. ‘We’ve got some liberal stuff we’ve got to get done here, so we’re going to hold everybody up. We don’t want to help people.’ “ “They don’t care.

"President Trump called on Congress Tuesday to reject Democrats’ “nonsense” and approve a $1.8 trillion package proposed by Senate Republicans to provide relief for workers and businesses from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. “This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal. It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!” Mr. Trump tweeted. “Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today.” A rival $2.5 trillion bill unveiled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi includes proposals for expanded solar energy tax credits and tighter fuel efficiency requirements for any airlines that accept government aid. Senate Democrats blocked the White House-backed bill from advancing for the second time on Monday, asserting that $500 billion for large companies in the package amounts to a corporate “slush fund.” The administration says there will be strong oversight of the corporate aid, and that every day of delay is throwing more people onto the unemployment rolls. “The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!” Mr. Trump tweeted. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin negotiated with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer until nearly midnight on Monday, with both men saying they were very close to an agreement. The president also continued to bang the drum for some workers in the U.S. to return to their jobs very soon. “Our people want to return to work,” he tweeted. “They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly. We can do two things together. The cure cannot be worse (by far) than the problem! Congress must act now. We will come back strong!” But Thomas Bossert, who served as Mr. Trump’s homeland security adviser, said Tuesday the purported COVID-19 death rate of 1% in the U.S. will rise “if we prematurely return to open society w/out controls.” “More infected people means more total deaths. 1% of 66M = 660K,” Mr. Bossert tweeted.

"For climate-change activists, there’s an upside to the novel coronavirus outbreak. Not only did China see its greenhouse-gas emissions drop as its economy shuttered, but Democrats held up Monday nearly $2 trillion in pandemic relief to squeeze in items from their climate wish list, including re-upping renewable-energy tax credits and tacking emissions mandates on the aviation and cruise industries. As House Majority Whip James Clyburn, South Carolina Democrat,  reportedly said last week, “This is a tremendous opportunity to  restructure things to fit our vision.” Prodding the Democrats were global-warming gurus like Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, who urged Congress to take advantage of the unprecedented opportunity to address both the coronavirus and climate “crises.” “Congress: don’t waste this chance,” tweeted Mr. McKibben. “If you’re going to bail out corporations, in return demand that they take serious climate action. We could actually work on both crises at once!” Republicans erupted, accusing Democrats of putting their ideological wish list ahead of the national interest by delaying critical funds to hospitals and small businesses to “dust off the Green New Deal,” as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put it. James Taylor, senior fellow at the free-market Heartland Institute, called it “unconscionable that Democrats are holding coronavirus relief for millions of Americans hostage to completely unrelated extremist climate demands.” “American lives and Americans’ ability to feed themselves and make rent and mortgage payments are far more important than imposing climate restrictions on airplanes and giving more handouts to the wind and solar industries,” said Mr. Taylor. “Politicians who believe unemployed Americans are less important than climate activism and wind power have no moral justification holding office.” JunkScience’s Steve Milloy, a member of the Trump EPA transition team, said that Democrats are “more worried about not letting the coronavirus go to political waste than they are about protecting public health and rescuing the economy.” The pandemic has threatened to throw the U.S. economy into an economic recession, if not depression, but for the climate movement, the upheaval offers a rare, possibly once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to recalibrate societal priorities on everything from travel to commuting to shopping. In a statement updated Monday, “5 Principles for Just COVID-19 Relief and Stimulus,” hundreds of environmental groups, including 350.org, Extinction Rebellion and Greenpeace, called for achieving the recovery while simultaneously meeting the goals of the Green New Deal. They include public investments to “rebuild our infrastructure, replace lead pipes, expand wind and solar power, build clean and affordable public transmit, weatherize our buildings … restore our wetlands and forests, expand public services that support climate resilience, and support regenerative agriculture led by family farmers.” In a Monday editorial, the Los Angeles Times declared, “Climate change is just as real as COVID-19. Now’s the last best chance for our government to treat it that way.” “The main imperative for the government is to keep climate policy in mind as it devises a plan to rescue the economy,” said the staff editorial, adding that “maybe accepting the reality of COVID-19 will lead the administration to recognize the reality of climate change and work with Congress to begin addressing it in meaningful ways.” Shutting down economy to save world Such declarations have alarmed free-market advocates worried that the global and national response will pave the way for more government control over the private sector as future Democratic administrations draw parallels between the coronavirus and global warming. “The goals of the climate activists have advanced, given the coronavirus’ total shutdown of society,” said Climate Depot’s Marc Morano. “Climate activists know that if the U.S. government can shut down all aspects of society over a virus, it can and may someday under a different president take similar measures to fight an alleged climate crisis.” He pointed to the shutdown of airline travel, restaurants and entertainment, saying that “many climate activists will welcome a global recession because they have been calling for ‘degrowth’ policies and ‘planned recessions’ to fight climate change.” It’s true that the pandemic has come at a cost to the climate movement by curbing rallies, protests and other public events. At the same time, the drop in manufacturing, travel and commuting has also led to a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, most notably in China, the world’s largest emitter. Satellite imaging from NASA and the European Space Agency shows a dramatic decline in nitrogen dioxide since Jan. 1, although emissions are expected to rebound as the Chinese economy picks up again. “Well, that is, ironically, of course, the other side of this, right? It may be good for climate … because there is less trade, there’s less travel, there’s less commerce,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres in a March 3 interview with London’s Channel 4. If companies decide they can hold meetings via telecommuting instead of traveling, “that would be a systemic contribution to climate change,” she said. “What is not helpful is just a help that would be here for a few months but then we jump back to bad traditions,” said Ms. Figueres. Mr. McKibben agreed. “Our goal can’t be simply a return to the status-quo ante, because that old normal was driving a climate crisis that will eventually prove every bit as destructive as a pandemic,” he said Friday in a New Yorker op-ed. “With just a little courage from Democratic legislators, we could actually be building a world that is safer on every front,” he concluded.

"Vice President Mike Pence said the White House believes in its 15-day guidelines for slowing transmission of the coronavirus and has no plans to force everyone to shelter in place. “At no point has the White House coronavirus task force discussed what some people call a nationwide lockdown,” Mr. Pence said at a Fox News virtual town hall on the pandemic. Rather, he said, Mr. Trump is focused on finding a way to protect older people and the medically vulnerable while getting other Americans back to work in the coming weeks. “The president said we want to find a way to open America back up, to get American business moving again,” the vice president said. Mr. Trump on March 16 announced a 15-day period during which people were encouraged to work and learn at home if possible, avoid groups of 10 or more and use takeout instead of entering bars and restaurants. But the country can’t stay shut down forever, the president said. He’d like to take another look at things at the end of the 15-day freeze this weekend. Mr. Pence said the president is fielding recommendations from his coronavirus task force. However, Mr. Pence said the White House “fully supports” states that have decided to take actions that might be stronger than the White House guidelines, including “stay at home” orders and directives to shutter nonessential businesses. The federal response to the coronavirus is “state-managed,” he added, “and then it’s federally supported.” Mr. Pence said he is working with private industry, states and FEMA to identify respirators and ventilators for hospitals, especially in hard-hit areas such as New York City. The administration invoked the Defense Production Act on Tuesday to get its hands on more diagnostic tests, though Mr. Pence continued to say U.S. companies, including automakers, have offered to produce gear voluntarily. “Every time we’ve asked American industry to step forward, they’ve said yes,” Mr. Pence said. Mr. Pence also highlighted a clinical trial in New York that looks at whether a malaria drug, chloroquine, will be effective against the coronavirus. “There’s no barrier to access to chloroquine in this country. We’re working to add to that supply even as we speak,” Mr. Pence said, responding to a question from TV personality Dr. Mehmet Oz. “At the same time, we are engaging in a clinical trial.” Asked whether Mr. Pence would take the medicine personally, the vice president said he would follow the advice of his doctor.

"The Secret Service paid less than $10,000 to President Trump’s Scottish golf resort for services during a 2018 presidential stay, and all of the costs were properly authorized, according to an inspector general’s audit released Tuesday. Agents were even able to rent rooms at the “cost price” to the hotel, meaning they paid far less than the list rate and didn’t turn a profit, according to the audit. Mr. Trump’s decision to stay at the Trump Turnberry Resort during his trip to Scotland drew criticism from Democrats who said he was pumping taxpayer money into his own businesses. They demanded the Homeland Security inspector general investigate, and the new audit is the result. Investigators estimated the overall trip cost the Secret Service at least $950,000, not including meals and incidentals, which were redacted from the public report. But almost all of that was paid to companies other than the president’s resort. Just $9,662 actually went to Turnberry: $5,935 for hotel rooms, $2,804 for logistics and $923 for golf cart rentals at the property. The agents actually got a lower rate than the listed seasonal rate for rooms, though the actual dollar amount per room was redacted. The number of agents involved was also redacted from the public report. For the golf carts, the Secret Service rented nine from Turnberry and 10 from another company. The rate paid to Turnberry was 80 cents lower per day than the other company, the audit said. “We did not identify any fraud indicators or costs that were not authorized in relation to the President’s visit to the Trump Turnberry Resort,” the inspector general concluded. Mr. Trump’s frequent trips and stays at his own properties have become a major issue for the billionaire president, who declined to give up his ownership stake when he became president. Several lawsuits have challenged his behavior as a violation of the Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution. His July 2018 trip to Scotland drew particular fire because he took several days out of his European itinerary to stay at his own club, where he played a couple rounds of golf but, according to Democratic critics, made no public appearances. Then-Rep. Elijah Cummings, at the time the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Tom Carper demanded the inspector general investigate.

"White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Tuesday the administration is taking a look at reopening some targeted areas of the country for business and that congressional leaders are close to striking a deal on a $2 trillion-plus fiscal stimulus package. “After the 15-day period is over, which I guess ends [at] the end of this week or the weekend, we will take another look at the possibility of targeting areas that are safe enough,” Mr. Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said on Fox Business Network. “We have to do this with the assent and help of the health specialists — there’s no question about that,” he said. He said they’re hearing from a lot of small businesses who want to see if they can “liberalize” and “target more” and “stop as many shutdowns as we have.” “That doesn’t mean [we’re] going to leave social distancing; that doesn’t mean we’re going to walk away from the mitigating advice that we’ve received from our health specialists and so forth,” Mr. Kudlow said. “It just means we’re going to take a slightly different look at this and I think the president would like to do something in the next couple of weeks.” On March 16, President Trump had announced a 15-day period during which people were encouraged to stay at home if possible and avoid elective surgery. But Mr. Trump said on Monday that the country can’t stay shut down forever and suggested he’d like to take another look at things at the end of that time frame. A number of governors around the country have also issued various degrees of “stay at home” orders, as well as directives to shutter non-essential businesses. Mr. Kudlow also said Capitol Hill leaders were very close to striking a deal on a $2 trillion-plus fiscal stimulus package to try to assist workers and businesses who have been adversely affected by the coronavirus outbreak. He said the package is “absolutely essential” to the reopening of the economy. “We know small businesses have been shut in, we know that a lot of workers are either furloughed or laid off,” he said. Talks had stalled despite a quick timeline laid out by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, with Republicans complaining that Democrats were tacking on unrelated items at the last minute that dealt with issues like unions and election funding. Mr. Kudlow said that coupled with $4 trillion of lending authority for the Federal Reserve, the stimulus could add up to about $6 trillion, or 30% of GDP. “This is the largest Main Street assistance package in the history of the country,” he said. He said they’ve compromised with Democrats on issues like unemployment insurance. “Here we are with a $6 trillion package and we may be taking a new look at the shut-ins around the country,” he said. “But let’s get this thing passed. Let’s just get this bill passed. It’s so important.” Mr. Kudlow said a $500 billion stabilization fund for businesses, states and localities is not a “slush fund,” as Democrats have described it. “This is aboveboard,” he said. “Everyone will get a chance to see it. Nothing’s going to be hidden, and we’re just trying to get the basic essentials of the economy.”  ",Trump economic adviser: We'll take another look at reopening safe areas for business,"Tuesday, March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/24/larry-kudlow-well-take-another-look-reopening-safe/,washington_times
"The blows keep coming for former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s failed presidential campaign. A Bloomberg campaign worker filed a class-action lawsuit against the campaign for allegedly getting rid of more than 1,000 workers who Mr. Bloomberg promised to employ through the 2020 election regardless of his campaign’s outcome. The lawsuit, brought by lawyers from the Shavitz Law Group and Outten & Golden, claims Mike Bloomberg 2020 Inc. violated the Fair Labor Standards Act. “Employees have been damaged by losing their jobs with Bloomberg approximately eight months early, losing their income, and losing their healthcare,” the lawsuit argues. “Bloomberg’s conduct amounts to such gross, wanton or willful fraud, dishonest and intentional non-disclosure of material facts as to involve a high degree of moral culpability, making it appropriate to deter Bloomberg from engaging in similar conduct in the future.” The former worker bringing the suit was a field organizer who wants compensation, including “unpaid overtime pay,” for themselves and all of the others let go amid the coronavirus outbreak. “Many of these field organizers and other campaign employees resigned or took leaves of absences from their then-current employment, and a lot of them relocated to different cities and states in order to work for Mr. Bloomberg,” Gregg Shavitz, Shavitz Law Group founding partner, said in a statement. “The campaign induced our client into employment and told her that it would last until the November election. Then they fired her and other hard-working Americans, pulling the rug out from under them in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic. Bloomberg should make this right.” The Bloomberg campaign disputed that its former workers have been hung out to dry. “This campaign paid its staff wages and benefits that were much more generous than any other campaign this year,” a Bloomberg campaign spokesperson said. “Staff worked 39 days on average, but they were also given several weeks of severance and health care through March, something no other campaign did this year.” The Bloomberg campaign said it would create a fund to ensure that staff receive health care funding through April and noted that many former staffers would go to work for the Democratic National Committee because of the large monetary transfer from Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign to the DNC. Mr. Bloomberg’s failed campaign and decision to suddenly get rid of campaign workers is having ramifications across the country. In Arlington, Virginia, Mr. Bloomberg’s former campaign office is poised to become a liquor store. Virginia ABC is reportedly planning to open a liquor store at Mr. Bloomberg’s former Arlington location, but the store has been slowed by the coronavirus outbreak.

"President Trump said Tuesday he wants to reopen American businesses by April 12, signaling he’s eager to reinvigorate the economy after a two-week push to keep Americans at home to slow down and defeat the coronavirus. “I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,” he told a Fox News town hall on the coronavirus from the White House. Mr. Trump said the country is simply not built to shut down. “We can destroy our country this way by closing it down,” he said. “You’re gonna lose more people by putting the country into a massive recession or depression. You’re going to have suicides by the thousands.” Mr. Trump on March 16 announced a 15-day period during which people were encouraged to work and learn at home if possible, avoid groups of 10 or more and use takeout instead of entering bars and restaurants. He says he will reevaluate the guidance this weekend, meaning changes could come before Easter. One idea is to get healthier people back to work first or tell parts of the country with fewer cases that it’s OK to return to business as normal. Scientists say the business closures, a form of “social distancing,” are vital to breaking up the virus’s chains of transmission. It will buy time for hospitals, so they aren’t overrun with patients. The question is whether the president is trying to jump the gun by loosening guidelines after just two weeks, instead of prolonging the shutdown now to ensure the virus doesn’t spread like wildfire and cause even more economic damage down the road. Mr. Trump said the economy had been thriving under his administration before the virus hit. He emphasized other techniques to avoid the virus instead of closures, such as hand-washing and avoiding skin-to-skin contact. “You won’t be shaking hands for at least a while,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump compared the coronavirus, which has killed nearly 600 in the U.S., to car accidents and influenza, which kill far more Americans per year but are not a new challenge. “We lose thousands and thousands of people per year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off,” he said. Mr. Trump has defended his response to the coronavirus broadly, saying it’s an invisible enemy that blindsided the world. Yet a lack of diagnostic tests held back the response in late February and early March, and health workers say they face a dearth of protective gear. Mr. Trump blamed an outdated test-approval system that forced private labs to get centralized approval from the federal government. He also said “tens of thousands” of more Americans would be dead if he hadn’t restricted travel from China at the end of January. “We made a decision, I made a decision, to close off from China,” Mr. Trump said. “Honestly I took a lot of heat. Sleepy Joe Biden said it’s xenophobic. I don’t know if he knows what that means, but that’s OK.” Mr. Trump conducted the town hall alongside Vice President Mike Pence, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams and U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, Deborah Birx, who said scientists are trying to figure out whether people who recover from the virus are now immune from getting it again. Notably absent was Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of infectious diseases research at the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Fauci has served six presidents and is considered a trusted expert. He’s also been willing to correct Mr. Trump when he strays from accepted science, causing some to wonder if the president will tire of him. Mr. Trump said their relationship is solid and that Dr. Fauci had work to do during the town hall.  ",Trump: America ‘not built to shut down’," -

"AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - Maine’s campaign finance laws have been expanded to include more groups under the state’s definition of a political action committee. A new law in the state defines caucus political action committees as subject to the same rules as other PACs. Supporters of the proposal said Tuesday the rule change means the Maine Ethics Commission will be able to fully enforce ethics rules about caucus political action committees that are led by legislators. Democratic Sen. Justin Chenette of Saco proposed the law, which was signed by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills last week. Chenette said the law change will “help make sure Maine voters, not big donors, have a strong voice in the state house.” The law makes certain the Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices will be able to enforce rules on the PACs, supporters said. It designates caucus political action committees as PACs designated by party leaders to promote the election of nominees of the party leaders’ political party.

Yet a lack of diagnostic tests held back the response in late February and early March, and health workers say they face a dearth of protective gear. Mr. Trump blamed an outdated test-approval system that forced private labs to get centralized approval from the federal government. He also said “tens of thousands” of more Americans would be dead if he hadn’t restricted travel from China at the end of January. “We made a decision, I made a decision, to close off from China,” Mr. Trump said. “Honestly I took a lot of heat. Sleepy Joe Biden said it’s xenophobic. I don’t know if he knows what that means, but that’s OK.” Mr. Trump conducted the town hall alongside Vice President Mike Pence, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams and U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, Deborah Birx, who said scientists are trying to figure out whether people who recover from the virus are now immune from getting it again. Notably absent was Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of infectious diseases research at the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Fauci has served six presidents and is considered a trusted expert. He’s also been willing to correct Mr. Trump when he strays from accepted science, causing some to wonder if the president will tire of him. Mr. Trump said their relationship is solid and that Dr. Fauci had work to do during the town hall.  ",Trump: America ‘not built to shut down’," -

"President Trump is likely enjoying a rally of public support, including his personal-best approval rating, as he leads the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Gallup said Tuesday. Gallup’s latest survey found that 60% of Americans approve of Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, and 38% disapprove, which the pollster said was the president’s highest rating ever. Among Republicans, 94% approve of the president’s handling of the outbreak; 60% of independents approve; and 27% of Democrats approve. “Two aspects of Trump’s latest approval rating suggest a presidential approval rally effect,” wrote Jeffrey Jones of Gallup. “His rating shows a fairly sudden increase, and that increase is seen among both independents and Democrats — both highly unusual for Trump in particular.” Two other recent polls, by CBS News and ABC News, found that Mr. Trump’s approval rating on handling the pandemic was 53% and 55%, respectively. Historically, presidential job approval has increased when the nation is under threat, Gallup noted. Every president from Franklin D. Roosevelt through George W. Bush saw their approval rating surge at least 10 points after a “significant national event.” Mr. Bush’s 35-point increase after the 9/11 terrorist attacks is the most notable rally effect on record, the pollster said. Overall, the president’s job approval rating was back up to 49%, up from 44% earlier this month and matching the highest rating of his presidency in the Gallup poll. Mr. Trump also had 49% job approval in late January and early February, around the time of his Senate impeachment trial.

"JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel appeared on the verge of a constitutional crisis Tuesday as top members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud urged their party colleague and parliament speaker to defy a Supreme Court order to let lawmakers hold a vote for his successor. After suspending parliamentary activities last week, citing procedural issues and restrictions on large gatherings due to the spread of the coronavirus, Yuli Edelstein on Monday dismissed the court’s call to explain his delay in convening the Israeli Knesset, or parliament.  It sparked an unprecedented judicial rebuttal, with Supreme Court Chief Justice Esther Hayut ordering him to hold a vote by Wednesday and ruling that “the continued refusal to allow the vote in the Knesset plenum on the election of a permanent speaker is undermining the foundations of the democratic process.” Even after that, at least two Likud Cabinet ministers, including Netanyahu’s surrogate interim justice minister, called on Edelstein to defy the order, deeming it a judicial “coup” against Israel’s elected officials. Cabinet Minister Yariv Levin led the charge, accusing the court of trampling the principle of separation of powers. He said it was creating “anarchy” and acting as if it “owned the country.” Edelstein did not release any comment Tuesday on how he would proceed. Netanyahu has yet to comment but others in the party, while equally lambasting the high court, called on Edelstein to respect its ruling to avoid a full fledged constitutional crisis at such a sensitive time. The developments marked the apex of an ever-deepening standoff between Netanyahu’s opponents and supporters in the wake of the country’s third inconclusive election in less than a year and against the backdrop of a series of emergency executive measures enacted to quell the spread of the new virus. The opposition Blue and White party, which is backed by a slim majority in the newly elected Knesset, said the country’s legislature must continue to function at such a critical time to provide oversight of the government. The party accuses Netanyahu and his caretaker government of carrying out undemocratic measures amid the crisis, and using it as cover to cling to power.  “We cannot allow Israeli democracy to be trampled upon. Not on my watch,” Blue and White leader Benny Gantz posted on Facebook. With the country in near-shutdown mode, Netanyahu has already managed to postpone his own pending criminal trial on serious corruption charges and authorize unprecedented electronic surveillance of Israeli citizens. Even amid the health scare, Israelis have taken to the streets to protest what they consider an assault on Israeli democracy.  Blue and White is expected to choose a new speaker and use its parliamentary majority to push through legislation that could prevent Netanyahu from serving as prime minister in the future.  The Knesset on Monday voted 61-0 in favor of convening the key Arrangements Committee, which is authorized to create the parliament’s other decision-making committees. Later, it approved a half-dozen other temporary committees, including one devoted to the corona crisis. Netanyahu and his allies boycotted the votes to protest what they called a power play that relied on Arab members of parliament. Likud said it would take no part in the “unprecedented destructiveness.” Netanyahu’s Likud emerged as the largest party in the March 2 election but along with his smaller religious and nationalist allies only won the support of 58 lawmakers - leaving his right-wing bloc three seats short of the required majority in Parliament. Gantz’s majority bloc is deeply divided along ideological lines and unlikely to band together to form an alternative government. But they are determined to oppose Netanyahu and seem willing to cooperate in parliament. Replacing Edelstein on Wednesday appears to be the first step. The parliament speaker informed the court that he will “not agree to an ultimatum” and that “a permanent Knesset speaker has never been elected at a time of such great uncertainty concerning the composition of a future coalition.” He said he would not put the Knesset speaker vote on the agenda until the political situation becomes clearer.  On Tuesday, amid the uproar, Netanyahu seemed to tone down his rhetoric, repeating a call for his rivals to join him in an emergency unity government to combat the global pandemic. But he’s previously said that option will be gone if Edelstein is replaced.  “This is a time that tests leadership and national responsibility. The citizens of Israel need a unity government that will save their lives and livelihoods,” he tweeted. “We both know the gaps between us are small and can be overcome.” In Israel, daily life has largely shut down with tens of thousands out of work and all but essential movement out of the home restricted. Cases have been multiplying over the past week, with more than 1,650 people testing positive for the new virus and fears that the spread will soon overwhelm the health system. One patient has died and 31 are in serious condition. Gantz has pledged to support the government in its effort to combat the virus. But he and his allies have been skeptical about Netanyahu’s power-sharing overtures, concerned that he will not follow through on his promises to cede power in 18 months. If no compromise or alternative government is found, Israel could once again find itself faced with the prospect of yet another unfathomable election. Given the current state of lock down and fear of contagion it’s not clear if that would even be possible. ____ Follow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap  ",Likud members urge speaker to defy Israeli high court order,"Tuesday, March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/24/likud-members-urge-speaker-to-defy-israeli-high-co/,washington_times
"The White House and Senate leaders of both parties have struck an agreement on a sweeping $2 trillion measure to aid workers, businesses and a health care system strained by the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak. Top White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway shortly after midnight. The agreement came after days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure and still needs to be finalized in detailed legislative language. “Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,” Ueland said. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well.  ","‘We have a deal’: Senate leaders, White House reach agreement on coronavirus relief package"," -

"House speaker Nancy Pelosi beat a retreat Tuesday from the massive coronavirus wish list of Green New Deal projects, immigration measures and other non-virus changes she and fellow Democrats had proposed just hours earlier. She signaled in several television interviews that her troops would likely accept the deal that will emerge from the Senate, while casting her own 1,404-page bill, with a price tag of $2.5 trillion, as more of a marker for future fights over the direction of American priorities on energy, the work force, elections and immigration. “The easiest way to do it is for us to put aside some of our concerns for another day, and get this done,” the California Democrat told CNBC. GOP lawmakers were incensed at Mrs. Pelosi’s legislation, released late Monday night, saying it threatened to undo the progress toward a deal with its focus on issues that went beyond the immediate coronavirus rescue effort. It would have required airlines receiving bailout money to promise to go carbon-neutral by 2025, revoked several Trump executive orders on unionization within the federal workforce, imposed mandatory nationwide early voting and same-day voter registration, and forgiven $10,000 of student-loan debt across the board. Also, any company taking coronavirus bailout money would also have to permanently raise their minimum wage to $15 by the start of next year. “Everything we’re suggesting just relates to COVID-19,” Mrs. Pelosi told CNN. “It’s not about making long — for the future. It’s about COVID.” Republicans immediately started to use the Pelosi bill against vulnerable Democrats, accusing them of holding struggling workers hostage to a left-wing wish list. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, Arizona Democrat, took to Twitter to point out that none of the offending provisions were part of the Senate negotiations. And an administration official familiar with the talks said the Pelosi bill was a “dead letter” in the Senate discussions. Mrs. Pelosi fanned out on television to say her goal now is to try to pass whatever emerges from the Senate as quickly as possible — possibly by unanimous consent, or a voice vote, which would mean she wouldn’t have to call lawmakers back to Washington, risking coronavirus spread. House Republican leaders are on board that plan, too — though they believe a voice vote is more likely than getting unanimous consent from all members. Republican Whip Steve Scalise, in a call with the whip team, said that would also head off any effort by House Democrats to try to amend the Senate bill — a possibility Mrs. Pelosi did raise several times. Dissonant voices were making themselves heard. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, took to Twitter to call the emergency Senate bill “concerning.” “It seems to give a *HALF TRILLION DOLLARS* away to big corporations, w/ few worker protections,” she wrote. Mrs. Pelosi, while embracing the Senate negotiations, said the House lawmakers who put her shelved bill were an “intellectual resource” that did shape the Senate’s work. She praised new additions to the Senate deal, such as an inspector general to monitor the bailout money. Releasing her bill may end up hurting Mrs. Pelosi’s efforts to sell the Senate legislation, after liberal advocacy groups rushed to praise House Democrats for their far-reaching vision. Immigrant-rights groups were particularly pleased, saying Democrats went out of their way to ensure federal assistance could reach people regardless of immigration status. “We are all in the same boat when it comes to the virus. The virus doesn’t check immigration papers, citizenship status, or ability to pay when it hurts our communities. Nor should our government response,” said Douglas Rivlin, communications director at America’s Voice. But some of the immigration provisions went well beyond assistance and into major policy decisions. The bill would automatically renew millions of foreign guest-workers’ work permits. It would also, for the first time, write a specific protection for illegal-immigrant “Dreamers” into law, ordering the Homeland Security secretary to renew hundreds of thousands of DACA permits. Rosemary Jenks, vice president at NumbersUSA, which advocates for stricter immigration limits, said it struck a dissonant note amid coronavirus’s economic chaos to grant foreign workers permission to compete with Americans. “In the face of massive layoffs of American workers and predictions of unemployment reaching 20 percent or more, it is unconscionable that Democrats would prioritize foreign workers over the American workers who will desperately need those jobs,” Ms. Jenks said. The bill would have automatically renewed the immigration status of anyone whose current permits expired 30 days before the bill is enacted, and at least a year after it becomes law. It would apply to anyone here on Temporary Protected Status, DACA or another deferred deportation program, and regular guest-worker programs such as high-skilled H-1B visa-holders, farm workers on H-2A visas and seasonal non-farm workers on H-2B visas. It would even apply to those here on short-term tourist or business visas. Jessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies, said as much as 50% of the H-2B workers are in sectors deeply affected by coronavirus, such as hospitality or resorts. The law requires companies to try to hire American workers first, but Ms. Vaughan said the requirements aren’t very strict and American workers are displaced. And even if Americans do now compete for those jobs, she said the guest-workers, with renewed permits, aren’t likely to give up and go home. “They are likely to try to find another job here, and with worksite enforcement almost non-existent, they are likely to find it,” she said. “This visa extension provision is more likely to exacerbate the economic fallout of this crisis, not repair it.”  ",‘It’s about COVID’: Pelosi retreats on stimulus ‘wish list’,"Tuesday, March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/24/nancy-pelosi-retreats-coronavirus-stimulus-wish-li/,washington_times
"One senator thinks her colleagues should share the financial pain of the Americans being laid off as a result of the coronavirus epidemic. Sen. Martha McSally, Arizona Republican, introduced a bill Tuesday that would withhold pay from all senators until they pass a COVID-19 relief and support package. “If Americans aren’t getting paid, then neither should the Senators failing to support the workers and families who need help making ends meet,” Ms. McSally said in a statement. Senate Democrats have twice blocked votes on a relief bill that would spend hundreds of billions on coronavirus work and economic support, and House Democrats have pushed a bill larded with such non-coronavirus-related provisions as diversity requirements, pro-union rules, airline-emission requirements and a $15 minimum-wage requirement. Republicans have accused them of playing politics, pushing a “socialist wish list” with a potential national catastrophe at stake. “It is despicable that millions of Americans are without a paycheck in this time of crisis, while the Senate wastes precious time playing political games. The Senate must pass this relief package now in order to get cash straight to the people,” Ms. McSally said. Ms. McSally’s bill is unlikely to pass as long as the relief bill itself can’t pass. But another Republican lawmaker took a concrete step of his own Tuesday. Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina said he would decline his salary until a coronavirus relief package has passed on Capitol Hill and urged other lawmakers to follow suit. “Struggling Americans don’t need the political tactics and radical agenda-setting of the DC political class while they face a crisis,” Mr. Walker said. “Until they can get over their bickering, I urge my colleagues to join me in forgoing pay until they can choose people over politics and get a relief bill to President Trump’s desk.”  ",Martha McSally bill: No pay for Senate until coronavirus stimulus passes,"Tuesday, March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/24/martha-mcsally-bill-no-pay-senate-until-coronaviru/,washington_times
"Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams, currently hospitalized after a coronavirus diagnosis, warned his colleagues Tuesday against pursuing partisan policies as they work on a “phase three” economic stimulus package. “Using a public health emergency to insert unrelated partisan provisions is wrong,” Mr. McAdams said in a statement. “Both parties and both chambers must put politics aside and put working families — lives and livelihoods — first.” Mr. McAdams, who represents a swing district in Utah, tested positive for the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, last week after passing the phase two bill out of the House. He will remain in the hospital as doctors continue to monitor his need for supplemental oxygen. The phase three bill has stalled in the Senate this week amid thorny negotiations. The stimulus package would provide direct cash payments to the American public, loans to small businesses, aid to hard-hit industries and more resources to the stressed health care system. Some of the sticking points for Democrats were more unemployment benefits, oversight on the aid to corporations, and funds to stabilize state and local governments. House Democrats unveiled on Monday evening their own $2.5 trillion plan, which would do much of what the Senate bill does but also fund 2020 election efforts and student loan forgiveness. It also implements new green regulations for airlines that receive aid. The bill has been slammed by Republicans across Capitol Hill as a “ideological wish list.”  ",Congressman hospitalized for coronavirus warns against ‘partisan provisions’ in stimulus package,"Tuesday, March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/24/ben-mcadams-hospitalized-coronavirus-warns-against/,washington_times
"More than 6,000 complaints of coronavirus-related price gouging have flooded into state attorneys-general offices across the country, according to The Washington Times’ analysis of publicly available data. All told, 6,247 complaints were filed last week against retailers who reportedly raised prices for such essential items as hand sanitizers, face masks, toilet paper, and disinfectant wipes, according to the Times’ analysis. Pennsylvania topped the nation with 1,600 complaints. Michigan was second with 800, followed by New Jersey with 600 complaints. The total number of complaints nationwide is likely much higher because several large states, including California and Massachusetts, did not release their numbers. Government officials have been sternly warning retailers not to raise prices during the pandemic and aggressively fining those who do. Increasing prices during an emergency may seem like cruel profiteering, but free-market economists say the crackdown could do more harm than good. As they see it, essential items fly off the shelves faster when government-mandated price controls keep prices artificially low. By letting the market dictate the cost, some consumers buck the price tag leaving more supply available. Thus higher prices prevent panic buying, according to economists. “The choice is between low prices with no availability and nothing to buy, or high prices where the supply is going to be available,” said Mark J. Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor at the University of Michigan’s Flint campus. Most states have price-gouging laws on their books, although the threshold to declare increases as “gouging” varies. Some states bar retailers from inflating prices by 10% during an emergency. Free-market economists argue that market forces should be allowed to decide the cost of products. In their view, so-called price gouging encourages suppliers to rush into the market with much-needed supplies thus lowering prices anyway. As law enforcement ramps up its efforts to combat price-gouging, retailers are beginning to push back. They say the cost of fines and battling lawsuits could cause more harm to their business than the coronavirus pandemic. A liquor store in Fresno, California, was fined $10,000 for jacking up the price of bottled water. The store was selling a 24-pack of bottled water for $16, according to the City Attorney’s Office. Typically, a pack of water retails between $4 and $5. Officials in Jersey City, New Jersey issued 9 fines totaling $90,000 to one discount store they say inflated the price of rubbing alcohol and disinfectant wipes. New York City has issued more than $275,000 in fines for alleged price gouging. “Those stores operate on very thin profit margins and fines of $50,000 or $60,000 could bankrupt smaller retailers,” Mr. Perry said, adding that larger retail stores like Target or Walmart don’t usually raise prices because they fear damage to the company’s reputation. Mr. Perry said the finger should be pointed at greedy consumers rather than store owners. “Consumers who had no thought about their fellow Americans bought up al the toilet paper they didn’t really need,” he said. “Price gouging laws won’t do anything to address the panic buying because if prices stay low, then the toilet paper is going to get bought up by the people who get there first.” The solution, he says, is for stores to restrict the number of items a customer can buy. By limiting customers to two bottles of hand sanitizer or one pack of toilet paper retailers can combat panic buying. “Quotas are the way to correct the problem rather than sending law enforcement or attorneys general out to fine companies,” he said.

"NEW ORLEANS | Outside the Veterans Administration hospital here — by far the hardest hit by the coronavirus in the U.S. network of military care facilities — it’s something of a ghost town. Tents are being erected outside the facility on Galvez Street that will serve as a drive-through testing site, and a handful of employees eat lunch or stroll outside. Like most VA hospitals, New Orleans is closed to visitors. “But as far as the virus goes, I think they’re doing a good job when it comes to the safety of the vets and staff,” said McNeal Lewis, a former Marine who now works in the VA records department. Indeed, as hospitals across the country scramble to make sure they have enough medical supplies to meet the coronavirus pandemic’s demands, the nation’s VA facilities aren’t worried. Officials at the network of 170 medical centers that provide care to an estimated 9 million veterans say they’ve got plenty of critical items such as masks and ventilators. VA is treating almost 300 cases of COVID-19 infections nationwide. “VA facilities are equipped with essential items and supplies to handle an influx of coronavirus cases,” said Christina Mandreucci, the department’s press secretary. “Regarding testing, VA facilities’ testing capacity meets current demand.” The VA has administered 2,726 coronavirus tests and is tracking 204 cases of COVID-19 infection or potential infection, according to data released Monday. The U.S. had recorded more than 53,000 cases and about 700 deaths as of Tuesday evening, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The biggest hot zone by far is New Orleans, where the VA has 63 potential cases, 12 of whom are inpatient and another 31 pending as of Tuesday. The next closest, Atlanta, has 17 cases, 15 of whom are quarantining at home. Staffers in New Orleans believe the number hospitalized is a bit higher — between 20 and 25 they said — and those are being housed almost exclusively on a second-floor wing where the hospital’s first coronavirus patient surfaced. Other areas with multiple cases are New York Harbor (13 cases: 8 home quarantined and 5 inpatient); Puget Sound (4 of 13 are inpatient); Washington (2 of 10 inpatient) and San Juan, Puerto Rico, where one of 11 is being treated inpatient. The Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center and Clinics, the nation’s third largest VA hospital with 600 staffed beds, instituted drive-through testing Monday. Like its counterparts nationwide, the facility announced that everyone entering its buildings must be screened for the COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus. The screening, which every employee undergoes daily, involves a series of questions about fever, coughing and the like, the major symptoms associated with the coronavirus, New Orleans workers said. Last week, the popular African American radio personality DJ Black-n-Mild (the name comes from a cigarette brand), died from coronavirus at 44, and his brother, a veteran who checked on DJ Black-n-Mild when they thought he had pneumonia, is now a patient at the VA hospital, according to staffers. Anticipating a surge in cases, the eight outpatient clinics in northeastern Ohio run by the Cleveland VA were converted Monday into “tele-triage,” said spokeswoman Kristen Parker, meaning they no longer handle appointments on site. “When it comes to testing, we are taking samples on-site and getting them processed locally. “We will soon have on-site testing capabilities.” Fears have risen in the U.S. that the crush of patients infected with the virus would overwhelm hospital staffs, leaving them without masks for physicians and health care workers, and ventilators to help patients’ infected lungs. The VA had assured Congress early this month that it was preparing for the worst. “We train for this. We train not only for national disasters but we train for epidemics,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie testified March 4 before a House committee. “We have been putting in place those courses of action that we use for Ebola and H1N1 in the past. So, we will be approaching this as we have these other issues.” Still, most VA facilities have been closed to all but patients and health providers. In New Orleans, all noncritical appointments have been moved to at least April 24, and staff have been instructed not to book new appointments before June, several workers said. Major veterans groups have had to cancel activities, under state orders or because they’re following the White House’s “social distancing” guidelines. Communication lines to some of the VAs most likely customers at local American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars were also damaged, given so many of them have canceled activities, such as weekly Bingo games, either under state order or by common sense guidelines about social distancing. “As far as I know, nobody has come down with it,” said Mary Leaycraft, the office manager of the American Legion in Covington, Louisiana, which has more than 400 active members. “But they don’t go anywheres unless they really have to.”  ",VA hospitals prepare to treat coronavirus patients,"Tuesday, March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/24/va-hospitals-prepare-to-treat-coronavirus-patients/,washington_times
"Negative narratives about President Trump seem to be getting more inventive. His many foes in the news media are on the prowl for new ways to undermine both Mr. Trump’s presidency and his ceaseless efforts to counter the coronavirus. Some news organizations have gone so far as to minimize or downplay their own opinion polls which reveal that Americans approve of the job Mr. Trump and his administration are doing to counter the pandemic. In the last 48 hours, a new tactic has emerged, and that is to fabricate a rift between the president and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an esteemed medical researcher and a member of the White House coronavirus task force. “Has Trump had enough of Anthony Fauci?” asked CNN, while both MSNBC and The New York Times declared that “Trump’s patience with Dr. Fauci is wearing thin.” “Where’s Fauci? Doctor’s absence is noted at coronavirus briefing,” said USA Today. “Trump vs. Fauci: Trump’s gut sense collides with science,” noted The Associated Press. Dr. Fauci, however, will have none of it, and has clearly denied there is any distance between doctor and president. He distinctly cited repeated media inquiries about “differences” between himself and Mr. Trump. “It is really unfortunate. I would wish that would stop because we have a much bigger problem here than trying to point out differences. There are really, fundamentally, at the core when you look at it, there are no differences,” Dr. Fauci tells WMAL, a talk radio outlet in the nation’s capital. “The president has listened to what I’ve said, and what the other people on the task force have said. When I’ve made recommendations, he’s taken them. He’s never countered and overridden me,” the doctor declared, questioning the media’s practice of emphasizing discord between president and physician. “The idea of pitting one against the other is just not helpful, and I’d wish that would stop so we can look ahead at the challenge we have together to get over this thing,” Dr. Fauci told WMAL. He was not done, though. “We’ve never had a threat like this and the coordinated response has been, there are a number of adjectives to describe it. Impressive, I think is one of them. I mean, we’re talking about all-hands on-deck is that I, as one of many people on a team, I’m not the only person, since the beginning that we even recognized what this was. I have been devoting almost full time on this — almost full time.” Dr. Fauci said in an interview with Fox News host Mark Levin. Mr. Trump himself joined in the discussion. “Is everything cool with you and Dr. Fauci?” Fox News host Bill Hemmer asked the president during a live appearance on Tuesday. “Oh, absolutely. We get along very well,” Mr. Trump responded, adding that Dr. Fauci also is busy with a multitude of duties. ‘THE AXIS OF TRUMP’ Fox News prime-time host Tucker Carlson — who typically draws some 3 million viewers to his show each night — offers a review of news media portrayal of President Trump since he took office. “My feeling is that the cost of lying in news coverage for 3 1/2 years, and making every story about Donald Trump and how he is a bad person — which everyone in the news media has done — has made 40% of the country deaf to what the press is saying,” Mr. Carlson tells The Los Angeles Times in a wide-ranging new interview. “No one believes the media because every story rotates around the axis of Trump. And it’s just ludicrous,” Mr. Carlson advises. CONFIDENCE IN THE PRESIDENT Yet another national poll finds that majorities of Americans are giving President Trump and his administration a positive reviews for their efforts to contain and manage the coronavirus pandemic. A CBS News survey released Tuesday reveals that the public feels Mr. Trump has done a “good job” and that they are optimistic about the current situation. The findings are similar to an ABC News survey released last week revealing that 55% of Americans approved of Mr. Trump’s response to the coronavirus crisis. In the meantime, CBS appears to be downplaying the positive findings about Mr. Trump, according to one analyst. “CBS This Morning on Tuesday mostly ignored the findings of its own poll on the coronavirus and the government’s handling of it,” wrote Scott Whitlock, an analyst for the Media Research Center who reviewed the network’s coverage of the findings. “The network allowed a scant 10 seconds to the news that a majority, 53% approve of the President’s response. Relegated to online is the news that more Americans trust Donald Trump to given information than the media itself.” Indeed, the poll revealed that 57% of Americans do not trust the media to supply accurate information. The poll also found that respondents do not yet consider the pandemic a complete catastrophe. But the poll revealed mixed feelings though: Find more numbers in the Poll du Jour at column’s end.

"President Trump said Tuesday that he wants the U.S. open and “raring to go” in less than three weeks, proposing an optimistic end date to the upheaval caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as he pushes to reinvigorate an election-year economy that has been turned on its head. “I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,” he told a Fox News town hall on the pandemic. As doctors and scientists call for greater limits on public interaction, Mr. Trump said the country was not built to shut down and that economic aftershocks could kill more people than the pathogen itself. “We can destroy our country this way by closing it down,” he said. “You’re going to lose more people by putting the country into a massive recession or depression. You’re going to have suicides by the thousands.” Briefing reporters later, he said “that beautiful Easter day” of April 12 is his target but he will be guided by experts and science. “I just think it would be a beautiful timeline,” Mr. Trump said. The president had asked Americans to stay indoors and avoid large gatherings through the end of March, yet he has signaled potential changes to his guidance by the weekend. He said some parts of the country have been hit harder than others and that influenza and car crashes kill thousands each year without a single business closing. Lawmakers working to finish an economic stimulus package warned Mr. Trump not to be too hasty because failure to defeat the virus would lead to more pain down the road. “The cost to the economy of many more people getting affected and sick is an even bigger cost than we’re seeing now,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, also a California Democrat, pleaded with Mr. Trump to listen to scientists after the U.S. recorded more than 10,000 new cases in a single day at the start of the week. “It makes no sense to make changes to our safety guidelines unless those changes are based strictly on science. Politics should play no role when more and more people are dying every day,” she said. “I hope the president consults with doctors and other experts before making any changes to federal recommendations.” The president said March 16 that people should work and learn at home if possible, avoid groups of 10 or more and use takeout service instead of entering bars and restaurants for 15 days. Governors across the country have issued various degrees of “stay at home” orders as well as directives to shutter nonessential businesses. Scientists say the widespread business closures, a form of “social distancing,” are vital to breaking the virus’ chains of transmission. It will buy time for hospitals so they aren’t overrun with patients. Yet Mr. Trump and others say the economy can’t wither indefinitely and a plan is needed for restarting it. Mr. Trump’s allies said April 12 isn’t a deadline, per se, but a target date for Americans striving to get back to normal. “I don’t think it should be interpreted necessarily as you know, one day we’re on a stop sign, the next day we’re on a green light. I think there’s a lot of different ways to do transition phases to get to that point,” said Marc Short, chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence. “You could have different guidelines on different parts of the country where there are certain hot spots. Some of it could be guidance that’s given to different demographics.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of infectious disease research at the National Institutes of Health, said it is a “flexible situation.” The president said workers should follow safety guidelines as they return to the office during any type of phase-in. “You won’t be shaking hands for at least a while,” Mr. Trump said. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It has infected about 400,000 people worldwide, upending normal life in much of the developed world and forcing officials to postpone the Summer Olympics in Tokyo until next year. Nearly 19,000 people, including nearly 700 in the U.S., have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, Cases in Italy surged to about 70,000, putting it closer to China’s toll. A world-leading 7,000 people have died in Italy. Broadcasters for RAI television on Tuesday interviewed people huddled inside their homes by shouting up to their balcony windows. India, a country of more than 1 billion people, announced a three-week lockdown on Tuesday to limit the virus’ spread. The number of cases in the U.S. has ballooned from several thousand a week ago to more than 53,000 as increased testing roots out infections. It’s a major turnabout from one month ago, when Mr. Trump pointed to just over a dozen domestic cases and several dozen patients repatriated from other countries. “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” he tweeted Feb. 24. Wall Street numbers have tanked since then, erasing the gains of Mr. Trump’s presidency and forcing the Federal Reserve and Congress to reach for stimulus measures. The economic fallout is weighing on Mr. Trump, who was hoping to point to robust markets and low unemployment rates as the centerpiece of his reelection campaign. “Our country has to get back to work,” Mr. Trump said. “We can’t lose the advantage that we have.” The Greater New York City area has emerged as the epicenter of the U.S. crisis. The 15,000 cases reported in the city far exceed that of any state. White House officials asked anyone who has traveled out of the metropolitan area to self-isolate for 14 days so they don’t spread the virus elsewhere. “It’s a very serious situation. They’ve suffered terribly through no fault of their own,” Dr. Fauci said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday said the rate of new infections is doubling about every three days and that the “apex” is likely in 14 to 21 days. “The apex is higher than we thought, and the apex is sooner than we thought,” said Mr. Cuomo, speaking from the Javits Center in New York City. A week ago, he said he didn’t expect the peak for another 45 days. New York has recorded more than 25,600 coronavirus infections and at least 210 deaths related to COVID-19. Both totals are the most of any state in the country. “In many ways, we have exhausted every option available to us,” he said. “We’ve closed all the businesses, we’ve reduced the street density, and we’ve increased testing to the highest level in the country.” He repeated his call for the federal government to leverage the Defense Production Act to increase production of critical supplies such as ventilators, saying it’s inexplicable that there hasn’t been quicker action on that front. “I need the ventilators in 14 days — only the federal government has that power,” he said. Mr. Cuomo said the state has procured 7,000 ventilators, which are critical for treating people who have tested positive for the virus, but that they need 30,000. Mr. Pence said 4,000 ventilators will ship to New York within two days, while Mr. Trump chafed at Mr. Cuomo’s complaints. “He had 16,000 ventilators. He could have had a great price, and he didn’t buy them,” the president said, citing a report from five years ago. South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported Tuesday that Mr. Trump asked President Moon Jae-in whether South Korea could provide medical equipment to the U.S. Mr. Moon replied that his government would provide “maximum support” if available but pointed out that approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration might be required, the report said. Mr. Trump said he would take immediate action for that “within today,” said Blue House spokesman Kang Min-seok. Yonhap noted that South Korea has been praised for its effective and swift response to the spread of the virus, including advanced testing capabilities, and has been exporting test kits to several countries. South Korea, where the outbreak hit earlier than the U.S., has reported more than 9,000 cases of COVID-19, with 120 deaths. The U.S. now has more than 46,000 cases and 593 deaths. The White House readout of the 23-minute phone call made no specific mention of Mr. Trump asking for medical supplies from South Korea. White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said Mr. Trump “reiterated his commitment to employ the full weight of the United States government and work with global leaders to save lives and restore economic growth.” Dr. Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, said the U.S. has conducted more tests for COVID-19 in eight days than South Korea conducted in eight weeks. She said South Korea likely conducted about 290,000 total tests, and the U.S. will be over 300,000 on Thursday. “Our cases will continue to surge,” she said, “because we’re still working on our backlog.” ⦁ Dave Boyer and Gabriella Muñoz contributed to this report.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The State Department has advised against all international travel because of the coronavirus, but that didn’t stop Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from flying to Afghanistan this week. Gyms across the nation’s capital are shuttered, but Sen. Rand Paul, an eye doctor, still managed a workout at the Senate on Sunday morning as he awaited the results of a coronavirus test. It came back positive. The guidance against shaking hands? That hasn’t always applied to President Donald Trump, whose penchant for pressing the flesh continued even after public health officials in his administration were warning that such bodily contact could facilitate the spread of the contagious virus. Practice social distancing? Daily White House briefings involve Trump and other senior officials crowded around a podium. Even as the country has largely hunkered down, heeding the guidance of health experts and the directives of state leaders, some powerful people in Washington have defied preventative measures aimed at curbing the spread. Their business-as-usual actions are at odds with the restrictions everyday Americans find themselves under - and with the government’s own messaging.  Some human behavior experts say the “do as I say, not as I do”’ ethos seemingly on display is common among powerful officials, who may be inclined to think rules for the general public don’t apply to them in the same way or who can easily disassociate their own actions from what they say is best for others. “When we have high power, we think of ourselves as exceptional as if the rules don’t apply to us,” said Maurice Schweitzer, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who has researched behavior and decision-making. “We’re much more prone to do what we want because we don’t feel constrained in the way that less powerful people do.” In Pompeo’s case, the State Department says the unannounced trip - coming amid a near-global travel shutdown - was necessary and urgent because of political turmoil in Afghanistan that U.S. officials fear could threaten a recent U.S.-Taliban peace deal that calls for American troop withdrawals. Pompeo left Kabul on Monday without being able to secure a power-sharing deal. People traveling with Pompeo had their temperatures taken and were given small plastic bags containing a face mask, hand sanitizer, bleach wipes and mini-disposable thermometers. A State Department medical official told reporters that Pompeo and his staff would not be quarantining themselves because Afghanistan is not considered a high-risk country for the virus and because Pompeo’s movements on the trip were controlled. But some of the behavior by other officials has drawn rebukes.  Asked in a Science Magazine interview about Trump shaking hands, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he tells White House staff that “we should not be doing that. Not only that - we should be physically separating a bit more on those press conferences.” Several senators, meanwhile, scolded Paul for refusing to self-quarantine after he’d been tested, with the doctor overseeing the government’s coronavirus response suggesting the Kentucky Republican’s actions fell short of model “personal responsibility.” More than two dozen senators are in their 70s and 80s, putting them at high risk if exposed. Still, despite risk to senators and the fact that gyms across the country have been closed as a precaution, Paul and other senators were able to continue going to the Senate gym, using a keypad for access. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said in an interview with Newsy that Paul’s actions were “irresponsible” and that senators in general have been acting as if they were somehow immune to getting sick. He cited what he said was a “photo opp” for senators held over the weekend. “I think that senators must think that they’re invincible,” Brown said.  Paul, a proud civil libertarian, said he had thought it “highly unlikely” he was sick before getting the test results and had no symptoms of the illness. He said he did not have contact with anyone who tested positive for the virus or was sick. He was at the Senate gym Sunday morning, though Paul’s staff says he left the Capitol as soon as he received the results.  Asked about Paul, Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said people can spread the virus while being asymptomatic, so social distancing is imperative. She noted that she herself stayed home over the weekend when she felt ill. She took a coronavirus test that came back negative. “These are the kinds of things that we have to do for one another. This is the personal responsibility that I’m talking about that we all have to practice,” Birx said. Trump raised eyebrows among public health specialists when he methodically shook the hands of retail and health industry specialists at a Rose Garden news conference two weeks ago. He acknowledged Monday that shaking hands has been a hard habit for him to break, having become accustomed as president to doing so with “literally thousands of people a week.”  Even now, he stands close to other officials at daily White House briefings, including Vice President Mike Pence. By contrast, Defense Secretary Mark Esper began separating from his deputy this month as a precaution. Itzhak Yanovitzky, a Rutgers University communications professor, said senior officials or people in positions of power frequently separate their public behavior from their private, especially if they think they have greater control over their circumstances compared to strangers. Doctors, for instance, may not always follow their own recommendations to their patients if they think they have better control over their illnesses. In times of crisis, most people look to health experts as the ultimate authority, Yanovitzky said in an email. But for the segment of the population already disinclined to take the risk seriously, inconsistencies between what people say and do risk undermining the recommendations and mandates of the public health community, he said. “The problem,” said Schweitzer, the Wharton professor, “is that the mixed messages sow confusion, and it seems disorganized, undisciplined, chaotic.” ____ Associated Press writers Matthew Lee and Matthew Daly contributed to this report.

"LAS VEGAS — Nevada’s governor has signed an emergency order barring the use of anti-malaria drugs for someone who has the coronavirus. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak’s order Tuesday restricting chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine comes after President Donald Trump touted the medication as a treatment for the virus. Trump last week falsely stated that the Food and Drug Administration had just approved the use of chloroquine to treat patients infected with coronavirus. After the FDA’s chief said the drug still needs to be tested for that use, Trump overstated the drug’s potential benefits in containing the virus. Sisolak said in a statement that there’s no consensus among experts or Nevada doctors that the drugs can treat people with COVID-19. His order also limits a prescription to a 30-day supply to ensure it’s available for “legitimate medical purposes” and so that people cannot find a way to stockpile the drug. The governor’s rule comes a day after a Phoenix-area man died and his wife was in critical condition from taking an additive used to clean fish tanks known as chloroquine phosphate, similar to the drug used to treat malaria.

"Markets surged Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its biggest point gain in history, as investors cheered the nearing agreement on a $2 trillion economic rescue package in Congress and President Trump’s statement that an economy stalled by coronavirus could be revved up again by Easter. The Dow soared 2,112 points, or 11.3%, to close at 20,704. It was the index’s biggest one-day percentage increase since March 1933, and its largest point gain ever. The S&P 500 soared 9.3%, and the Nasdaq jumped 8.1%. The president attributed the market comeback to his expressed goal that most areas of the country could reopen for business by April 12, less than three weeks away, and to the looming deal in Congress to provide a massive infusion of cash and loans to workers and businesses idled by the coronavirus outbreak. “They [investors] see we’re working very hard on that [restarting the economy], that’s a very big factor I think in today’s historic gains,” the president said. He called the rescue legislation “the biggest and boldest financial relief package in American history.” In Congress, Senate Democrats neared an agreement with the White House Tuesday night on the unprecedented economic recovery plan that includes Democrats’ demand for the government to pay furloughed workers up to four months of lost salary, delivers $500 billion to distressed companies and provides $130 billion for besieged hospitals. Democrats negotiated all day and into the night with Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin on the package, which also will include direct cash payments to the average family of four of about $3,000. Both sides said they were very close to an agreement. “We are working to pass the biggest and boldest financial relief package in American history,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. “They’re getting very close right now to a very fair deal and a great deal for the people of our country.” Combined with roughly $4 trillion in expanded lending and backing by the Federal Reserve, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Washington will be injecting $6 trillion into the economy. “This package will be the single largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States,” he said. Leaders in Congress and the administration have been working for several days to pass as quickly as possible the economic stimulus package. In a move that resolved one sticking point, Mr. Mnuchin agreed to an inspector general and a five-member congressional oversight panel for the $500 billion fund for distressed companies. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said at mid-day that he was “very pleased” with a substantial increase of about $55 billion in funding for hospitals, as well as Republicans’ embrace of about $250 billion for what the New York Democrat called “unemployment insurance on steroids” — essentially full wages for affected workers for up to four months. “This is a great plan,” Mr. Schumer said. Unemployment insurance would be expanded from 26 weeks to 39 weeks in most states, boosting benefits by $600 per week through July to essentially provide full wages and salaries. Jobless benefits also would apply to freelancers and contractors. The package also would provide nearly $400 billion in grants and loans for small business with fewer than 500 employees, with loans forgiven if companies keep their employees on the payroll. Mr. Trump said the $500 billion fund for larger companies would help prop up the hard-hit airline and cruise-ship industries with loans. “The loans will be very secure and they will be very profitable,” the president said. But Mr. Trump emphasized, “The bill is very much focused on the small businessperson. It’s the engine of our country. The owners are going to need some help, and we’re going to take care of them.” Lawmakers have included a $150 billion fund for state and local governments. Republicans said the package also sets aside $75 billion for veterans services, $20 billion for public transportation, $10 billion for airports and $4.5 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Senate Republicans again criticized Democrats for blocking two earlier procedural votes on the package as more and more workers were laid off around the country. “The urgency and the gravity of this moment cannot be lost on anyone,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “Everyone needs help. We’re all in this together.” In remarks directed at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Mr. McConnell said the Senate wasted time on “Democrat counteroffers that demanded things like new emission standards, or tax credits for solar panels.” “We saw the speaker of the House release an encyclopedia of unrelated demands as though it were a coronavirus proposal somehow. In spite of all that, we are very close,” he said. Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams of Utah, currently hospitalized for coronavirus, warned his colleagues against pursuing partisan policies as they work on a phase three economic stimulus package. “Using a public health emergency to insert unrelated partisan provisions is wrong,” Mr. McAdams said in a statement. “Both parties and both chambers must put politics aside and put working families — lives and livelihoods — first.” In the House, lawmakers looked past Democrats’ rival $2.5 trillion plan including a liberal “wish list” such as same-day voter registration, focusing instead on the merits of the Senate package and how to approve it when most House members are back in their districts. House Republicans said there was general support for approving the final package by “unanimous consent,” rather than a formal roll call that requires lawmakers to be physically present in the chamber. But the GOP conceded that the procedure is risky because a lone lawmaker could object and block the deal. At an early evening briefing on the coronavirus task force’s efforts, Mr. Trump urged Congress to get the rescue package over the goal line. “The legislation developed in the Senate is the first step to restoring confidence and stability to America’s economy as we look ahead to the time when we can carefully and responsibly reopen our country for business,” the president said.

"The emissions from Sean Carroll’s new Tesla are clean but the expression on his license plate is filthy — at least according to the Rhode Island Department of Motor Vehicles. The statement Mr. Carroll made with his tag — “FKGAS” — is at the center of a First Amendment fight in federal court. It is the latest skirmish in decades of free speech struggles between Americans and DMVs across the country, which have included battles over “QUEER” vanity plates and Sons of Confederate Veterans specialty plates. The climate change activist’s legal battle against censorship started after Mr. Carroll received a vanity plate for his electric car in August. He said he wanted to spread a political message about being environmentally conscious. Last month, Rhode Island DMV Administrator Walter Craddock notified Mr. Carroll that the department received a complaint and that the state deemed the plate offensive. He instructed Mr. Carroll to turn in the plate or else have his car registration revoked. “‘FKGAS’ is my personal statement challenging everyone to look at the world differently. Gas isn’t the only option when it comes to powering your vehicle,” Mr. Carroll said. “My choice for a vanity plate has already brought more attention to alternative fuel sources and electric vehicles.” The state law allows the DMV to deny a plate that offends “good taste and decency,” but Mr. Carroll’s lawsuit argues that the state applies its standard arbitrarily. His complaint says Rhode Island allows “FATTY” but not “CHUBBY,” “DRUNK” but not “TIPSY,” “SLOB” but not “NEAT,” and “REDNECK” but not “REDNEK,” “REDNK” or “EDNEC.” A spokesperson from the Rhode Island attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit. Mr. Carroll also insists his vanity plate isn’t dirty. He said that when he explained to his young daughter that the Tesla is an electronic vehicle charged by the solar panels, she responded by saying it was like “fake gas,” according to court papers. That was part of the inspiration for “FKGAS,” Mr. Carroll’s complaint suggested. He is not alone in the license plate wars. A group of drivers has launched a similar offensive in California. Five residents sued this month claiming they were being censored after the California DMV decided “OG” and “Queer” were too extreme. The Pacific Legal Foundation brought a case on behalf of the residents in the Northern District of California. It is the second legal battle the advocacy group has begun since last April to strike down the DMV standard. Chris Ogilvie hoped to combine his military nickname, “OG,” with his love for wolves in a custom plate, “OGWOOLF,” but the California DMV rejected his application after finding that “OG” stood for “original gangster.” The DMV also rejected Amrit Kohli’s request for a “QUEER” vanity plate, which Mr. Kohli says celebrates his work as a gay musician with the record label Queer Folk. Pacific Legal Group, which is representing the California drivers, filed a lawsuit last year on behalf of Jon Kotler, a University of Southern California professor who sought the plate “COYW,” which stood for “Come on You Whites” in reference to a soccer team that wears white jerseys. His request was initially rejected. The California DMV settled the “COYW” dispute earlier this year. Mr. Kotler was able to get his plate, but the law remains on the books. The legal group points to a Supreme Court case it brought and won in 2018 challenging arbitrary censorship of dress codes at political polling places after a Minnesotan was denied access to voting for five hours while wearing a T-shirt that read “Don’t tread on me.” The Supreme Court, in a 7-2 ruling, struck down Minnesota’s law prohibiting political insignia at polling sites on Election Day. The court said the law infringed on free speech rights. On license plates, though, the justices have sided with the state. The Supreme Court settled a Texas dispute in 2015 when the Sons of Confederate Veterans moved to have specialty license plates displaying the group’s logo with the Confederate flag. The state rejected the application, and the high court, in a 5-4 move, affirmed the state’s ability to do so. The justices ruled that the denial isn’t viewpoint discrimination because a state’s specialty license plate is a form of government speech. However, that ruling applied to a specialty plate, not a personalized vanity plate such as Mr. Carroll’s “FKGAS” tags. The specialty plates are mass-produced by states with a slogan or insignia of a specific group. Massachusetts offers specialty plates with Boston Red Sox, Firefighters Memorial, and disabled veterans logos. Specialty and vanity plates are moneymakers for states, but they also cause headaches. Other battles over Sons of Confederate Veterans plates have lingered in various states despite the high court ruling. In Virginia, the governor has been phasing out the license plates since 2015. The high court ruling in the Texas dispute affected “Choose Life” license plates too. It permitted each state to decide whether to issue plates with abortion-related messaging. About 32 states offer the specialty “Choose Life” tags. Frustration over Rhode Island’s standard for vanity plates has been brewing for years. ACLU lawyers began searching in 2018 for a client to challenge the state law, the Providence Journal reported. The advocacy group found Mr. Carroll, who argues that Rhode Island’s move is arbitrary and gives the DMV commissioner unchecked authority, which in turn allows for subjective issuance and canceling of plates. “The DMV twice issued the license plate ‘FKGAS’ to Mr. Carroll and he drove his Tesla for over 5 months with that plate on it making his political statement. No one complained. Now, after one unknown person complained for some unknown reason, the Defendant has decided the plate is ‘inappropriate and/or offensive.’ This looks like political censorship,” said Thomas W. Lyons, a lawyer representing Mr. Carroll.

"Most Americans say the coronavirus crisis could last for months, but they also view President Trump’s handling of the pandemic favorably, according to a new CBS News poll released Tuesday. Fifty-three percent of those surveyed said Mr. Trump is doing a good job and 54 percent were hopeful about his administration’s handling of the health emergency. But 66 percent did think the Trump administration was not prepared when COVID-19 first hit. More than 70 percent of respondents said they believe it will take months to contain the virus, while only a quarter of Americans thought it could be contained in a few weeks. In terms of Congress, 52 percent said Capitol Hill is doing a good job of tackling the crisis and 85 percent support the idea of sending checks to Americans in need due to the economic impact the quarantines have caused.

"LOS ANGELES (AP) - The Los Angeles County sheriff reversed his own decision Tuesday to order deputies to make sure gun shops were closed during the coronavirus crisis after the county’s top lawyer said the shops could be open.  Los Angeles, the nation’s largest county with 10 million residents, enacted a stay-at-home order last week that required all nonessential businesses to close to slow the spread of the virus.  Sheriff Alex Villanueva had said gun stores were not essential businesses and they had been selling to the public through a “loophole” allowing them to stay open, many attracting long lines of customers.  But the county order - and an executive order from Gov. Gavin Newsom - does not specifically mention gun shops, prompting the Los Angeles County counsel’s office to issue a statement hours later on Tuesday saying it has “opined that gun stores qualify as essential businesses.” A few hours after the counsel’s statement, a spokesman for the sheriff’s department said Villanueva has suspended efforts to close the shops. Deputy Ed Luna said the department is evaluating its next steps. Guns Direct in Burbank has received conflicting information in recent days, according to manager Palmer Bailey. Burbank police previously told the store they were not considered to be essential business and then Tuesday said they could be open. The sheriff’s conflicting instructions complicated things further. Bailey said employees have been constantly posting new signs at the front of the business, only to tear them down with new ones. “The roller coaster just keeps going,” he said, noting that the store has not ruled out legal action.  Villanueva said the order was meant to keep open gun and ammunition businesses that support police departments and other security organizations.  The stay-at-home order is not a license “for everyone to be panic gun-buying or rushing to stores, which is now what we’re seeing,” Villanueva said.  He said gun shops have complied and deputies have not had to issue any citations. The county’s stay-at-home order was crafted by the health department and Villanueva had said he’s working with the agency on new language.                 FOXLA reported the sheriff’s decisions first. County Counsel Mary Wickham could not immediately be reached Tuesday evening for more details on the opinion that the stores could remain open.  The initial move by Villanueva to close the shops on Tuesday enraged Second Amendment advocates who said they planned to challenge it in court. The sheriff also said deputies would close strip clubs and nightclubs if they were open in the violation of the order.  Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California, had said his organization was looking at legal action. “There are far more important things that the sheriff can be doing than sending uniformed officers to gun stores telling them they’re going to be shut down by force,” Paredes said. “We’ve got lots of stories from people who said, ‘I’d never thought I’d own a firearm, and now I want them more than anything in the world.’” In Northern California, a gun shop called Solar Tactical had initially refused to close despite an order to do so in Alameda County, sheriff’s Sgt. Ray Kelley said Thursday.  “We’ll start out nice,” Kelley said. “Then we’ll post a notice to close and then we will take enforcement.” The gun shop posted on Facebook a day later that it had closed. Calls to the store were not answered Tuesday.  Chuck Michel, an attorney for the National Rifle Association-affiliated California Rifle and Pistol Association, said the organization is trying to work with local authorities in California to keep gun stores open. “They don’t just sell guns - they sell camping gear, survival gear, things that people may need,” he said. “Gun stores have been deemed to be essential in many, many jurisdictions, but unfortunately some of these jurisdictions are allowing politics to creep in.” The FBI reported a slight decline in the number of firearms background checks from California in February, before the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic, from 96,567 in January to 95,430 last month. The state Department of Justice, which does background checks and regulates sales of firearms and ammunition, said it doesn’t have updated statistics for March that can be publicly shared.  Nationally, orders deeming gun shops to be essential or nonessential vary.  In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf quietly allowed gun shops to reopen on a limited basis during the coronavirus pandemic after several justices of the state Supreme Court urged him to do so. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had narrowly dismissed a gun shop’s lawsuit that challenged Wolf’s authority to shutter businesses deemed “non-life-sustaining.” In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive order does not explicitly list gun dealers. But the state’s online service that processes background checks is not taking more requests and its website says licensed firearms dealers are not essential. A federal lawsuit has been filed challenging the order. ___ Thompson reported from Sacramento. Associated Press writers Juliet A.

"White House officials on Tuesday told people fleeing the coronavirus in New York City to isolate themselves so they don’t spread the disease to other parts of the country. Deborah Birx, the White House coordinator of the coronavirus response, said she’s tracking flareups on Long Island. “That suggests people have left the city,” she said. She said people who just left the city should self-isolate for 14 days, whether it’s in Florida, North Carolina or elsewhere. New York City is the clear epicenter of the crisis, with 15,00 out of roughly 50,000 domestic cases. It’s reporting roughly one in five of U.S. deaths from the disease, known as COVID-19. “It’s a very serious situation, they’ve suffered terribly through no situation of their own,” said Anthony Fauci, the director of infectious-diseases research at the National Institutes of Health.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - With nearly 40 million people stuck at home because of the coronavirus, California’s governor on Tuesday warned state agencies to prepare for less money from the government that will likely postpone many of the state’s ambitious spending plans. Citing a “severe drop in economic activity,” Gov. Gavin Newsom’s budget director wrote in a letter to all state agencies that they “should have no expectation of full funding for either new or existing proposals.” That means some of Newsom’s plans aided by a projected multi-billion dollar surplus could be on hold. His January budget proposal included plans for California to manufacture and sell its own generic drugs, create at least four new state agencies  and give government-funded health insurance to low-income seniors living in the country illegally. “We will review everything,” Department of Finance spokesman H.D. Palmer said. California is the latest state to signal budget troubles because of the coronavirus. Arkansas is facing a $353 million shortfall while states such as New York, New Jersey and Oregon have all warned about shrinking revenue. California is particularly vulnerable  because it depends so much on capital gains taxes from the wealthy. Nearly half of the state’s personal income tax collections come from the top 1% of earners, whose income depends on the health of the stock market. Through the month of February, California had collected $88.8 billion in taxes, more than $1.2 billion more than state officials had planned. But earlier this month, the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office reported a preliminary analysis indicates “a very high likelihood” that California’s capital gains tax collections “will be several billion dollars lower” than what state officials had planned. Assemblyman Phil Ting, a Democrat from San Francisco who is chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee, said Tuesday he expects most state agencies to get the same amount of money next year as they got this year, with some exceptions. But he expects lawmakers to increase spending on three of the state’s biggest problems: coronavirus, homelessness and wildfires. “There really won’t be a whole lot of room for much else,” Ting said. Lawmakers have already dipped into California’s reserves to give Newsom up to $1 billion to fight the coronavirus outbreak, money the governor has used to lease hospitals that were at risk of closing and give local governments money to prevent the spread of the virus among their homeless populations. But Ting said lawmakers could go further, possibly passing their own version of an economic stimulus that would give money to Californians impacted by the virus. What California does will likely depend on what type of aid Congress passes, if any. Newsom’s letter signals a likely end to bountiful surpluses the state has enjoyed in recent years, buoyed by a strong economy marked by 10 consecutive years of job growth. Monday, Newsom said the state had been averaging about 2,500 claims a week for unemployment benefits. Now, the state averages more than 106,000 claims a week. Specific details of Newsom’s updated budget proposal won’t be available until May. But advocacy groups are digging in, preparing for much tougher funding fights. Anthony Wright, executive director for the consumer health care advocacy group Health Access, said he will be pushing for Newsom to keep his plan to extend government-funded health benefits for low-income people 65 and older who are living in the country illegally.  It would cover about 27,000 people and cost up to $350 million when fully implemented. “Expanding coverage to the most at-risk group that is currently excluded from coverage was prescient in the January budget and continues to be urgent now,” Wright said.

"UNITED NATIONS (AP) - A major U.N. conference to review the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, considered the cornerstone of global efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, is “likely to be postponed” because of the coronavirus pandemic, a U.N. official said Tuesday. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said that was the assessment from conference president-designate, Ambassador Gustavo Zlauvinen of Argentina, and key organizers of the conference that has been scheduled for April 27-May 22 at U.N. headquarters in New York. The organizers are continuing consultations with all governments “to allow the review conference to undertake its important work when conditions permit,” Haq said. “A decision is expected to be taken in the coming week, following further consultations with regional groups,” he said.  Zlauvenin initially wrote to treaty political groups on March 13 proposing a postponement “after a short, procedural meeting on April 27, for New York-based delegates only and conditions permitting,” Haq said. But “in light of the rapidly evolving situation surrounding the spread of COVID-19,” all options about the April 27 meeting are being considered. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which reached its 50th anniversary March 5, is credited with preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to dozens of nations.  It has succeeded in doing this via a grand global bargain: Nations without nuclear weapons committed not to acquire them; those with them committed to move toward their elimination; and all endorsed everyone’s right to develop peaceful nuclear energy. Treaty members gather every five years to review how it is working That includes every nation except India, Pakistan and North Korea, which possess nuclear weapons, and Israel, which is believed to be a nuclear power but has never acknowledged it. Members try to agree on new approaches to problems, not by updating the treaty which is difficult, but by trying to adopt a consensus final document calling for steps outside the treaty to advance its goals. That has also proven difficult at recent review conferences, U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu warned earlier this month that the specter of an unbridled nuclear arms race is threatening the world for the first time since the 1970s, the height of the Cold War between the United States and the former Soviet Union. She didn’t name any countries but she was clearly referring to the United States and Russia, and possibly China, when she told the U.N. Security Council that “relationships between states - especially nuclear-weapon states - are fractured.” “So-called great power competition is the order of the day.” Nakamitsu said.  Russia-U.S. relations have been at post-Cold War lows since Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea. Russia and the U.S. clashed at the Security Council meeting where Nakamitsu spoke but they joined in supporting a statement saying the treaty “remains the cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.” The council resolved to advance the treaty’s goals and underlined its essential role “in the preservation of international peace, security and stability as well as the ultimate objective of a world without nuclear weapons.”  ",Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty review likely postponed,"Tuesday, March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/24/nuclear-nonproliferation-treaty-review-likely-post/,washington_times
"MEXICO CITY (AP) - Unidentified gunmen shot to death a lawyer and activist who defended a rural tract against development near the Mexican city of Cuernavaca, Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission said Tuesday. The governmental commission issued a statement condemning the killing of Isaac Medardo Herrera on Monday night. His neighborhood activist group in Jiutepec, Morelos posted a statement saying the killers knocked on the door of Herrera’s home and shot him, before fleeing.  Herrera had led a fight over at least four years to stop plans to build a housing development on the Los Venados tract, an environmentally sensitive woodland area in Jiutepec, just south of Cuernavaca. The development was halted and the area was supposed to be used as a nature reserve.  The commission said at least one other activist has been killed in Mexico so far in 2020. The Mexican Center for Environmental Rights reported that 15 land defenders were killed in Mexico in 2019. Morelos, the state where Jiutepec is located, was the third most dangerous for environmental activists in 2019. The state’s semi-tropical climate and abundant water, added to its close proximity to Mexico City, have made it the subject of heavy pressure from developers eager to build homes and vacation properties there.

"PARK CITY, UTAH (AP) - It wasn’t Judith Heumann’s first standing ovation, but it might have been her loudest.  Heumann, who had polio as a baby and uses a wheelchair, has for decades been one of the leading figures of the disability rights movement. When the Brooklyn native, after graduating from college, was denied a teaching license by New York City’s board of education because her wheelchair was declared a fire hazard, she sued and won. In 1977, when the first federal civil rights legislation for disabled people stalled, she led a historic 28-day-long sit-in. The victory paved the way for 1990’s Americans With Disabilities Act.  Her story is one of several central to “Crip Camp: A Disability Revolutionary,” a rousing and rare look at the disability rights movement. It traces the movement’s origins to an upstate New York summer camp for teens with disabilities that was run in 1970s with much of the free spirit of nearby Woodstock. The film, the second backed by Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground Productions following the Oscar-winning “American Factory,” hits Netflix on Wednesday.  For camp attendees who came with polio, cerebral palsy and other disabilities, Jened was a utopia of acceptance and community. And it helped spark a movement. When its campers returned to their homes, they were emboldened to demand to be treated like human beings. Heumann went there. So did Jim LeBrecht, co-director of “Crip Camp.” He was born with spina bifida.  When Heumman was introduced after the premiere of “Crip Camp” at the Sundance Film Festival in January, the response was deafening. “It was as loud as a jet airplane taking off,” LeBrecht recalled, groggy but beaming the morning after the film’s premiere. The Sundance debut for “Crip Camp” was the kind of festival reception filmmakers dream of. It was hailed as a jubilant crowd-pleaser, a likely Oscar contender, and most importantly, a seldom-seen and overdue big-screen moment for people with disabilities. The makers of “Crip Camp” believe the film can be its own galvanizing moment. “I hope this film will ignite other stories,” said Heumann, who joined LeBrecht and his fellow director, Nicole Newnham, for an interview in Park City, Utah, in January. “These stories are out there.” A lot has changed in just two months. “Crip Camp” will be released while much of the nation is hunkered down at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. The filmmakers had a wide range of activities planned around the film’s release, many of which have had to be adapted or curtailed due to the pandemic. Instead, the filmmakers are striving, from the confines of their Bay area homes, to turn planned community screenings virtual and develop educational materials for schools. But “Crip Camp” is also, in a way, suited to the times as a reprieve for housebound viewers.  “It’s hopeful and joyous. It’s a look at how a group of people can come together and effect monumental change. As opposed to 24-hours of coronavirus, this is a moment to go back to camp,” LeBrecht said in a recent interview by phone. “I think that people are going to really want to watch it just because it’s a positive story at a time where it’s tough for all of us.”  “You always hear in these times about a need for happy warriors,” added Newnham. “I feel like that’s what Jim and his friends are.”  “Crip Camp” has a specific starting point but it unfolds as a broader chronicle of a decades-long fight for civil rights - one that has received less attention than other 20th century struggles for equity. At Sundance, the filmmakers heard everywhere: “I never realized.” During the festival, Heummann sent Newnham a text message: “Enjoy walking through the crowds of people whom you have awakened!” By any metric, the stories of people with disabilities are  among the least represented in film and television. Last year, USC Annenberg’s annual inequality report found that, of the 4,445 characters in the most popular movies of 2018, just 1.6% were shown with a disability. U.S. census figures estimate 27.2% of Americans have some form of disability. A 2019 study by the Ruderman Family Foundation found that about half of U.S. households favor authentic portrayals of actors with disabilities. Yet Hollywood, where villains are still regularly signaled by deformity, has a long history of unfavorable, stereotyped or inauthentic depictions of disability. “We’ve learned so much about people around us from film and television, and if what you’re getting is just purely stories about people having tragedies - in the case of ‘Million Dollar Baby’: ‘Please kill me. Please, please.’ - or the kind of super, overcoming story that we sometimes call the ‘super-crip’ story, neither of these people are relatable and neither are reflective of the community in general,” said LeBrecht, a Berkeley, California-based sound designer. Heumann, LeBrecht and Newnham hope “Crip Camp” encourages conversations about how movies and media have fostered false impressions of people with disabilities. “There needs to be a fundamental altering in what goes on in media,” said Heumann, who has written about disability representation for the Ford Foundation. “At Sundance, I’m in a room with hundreds and hundreds of progressives who pride themselves on being progressives, who pride themselves on supporting diversity. And the number of people who say - and it’s not the first time I’ve heard this - ‘We didn’t know.’” “Crip Camp” has already effected some change. LeBrecht, having attended previous Sundance festivals, urged the festival to improve accessibility. He previously was unable to go into the festival’s filmmakers lounge because it didn’t have an elevator. Sundance recently announced that it would provide more resources for attendees with disabilities and program more movies featuring people with disabilities. The changes need to go much deeper than accessibility, Heumman said. It’s about reprogramming how the non-disabled think of people with disabilities.  Due to theaters shuttering, “Crip Camp” will go without its planned limited theatrical release. Given its status as an Academy Awards contender, the documentary will be the first film to test how the film academy handles its usual rules requiring a theatrical release due to the virus. The academy last week said it was “evaluating all aspects of this uncertain landscape.”  “I can only imagine that the academy is going to come up with some revised rules for this but we don’t know what the status of that is at all,” said LeBrecht.  But the crisis has given LeBrecht another reason to reconsider what “Crip Camp” might mean to people now. One statement said in the film - “We know that society wants us dead” - has been on his mind.  “How do we value people? Is it by productivity? Is how well they play the violin? What are our standards for valuing people?” said LeBrecht. “If anything, now is a good time for reflection on that.”  ___ Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP  ","In 'Crip Camp,' a rare spotlight for disability rights","Tuesday, March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/24/in-crip-camp-a-rare-spotlight-for-disability-right/,washington_times
"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) - A private developer has closed a deal with the city of Cheyenne to purchase an inn that closed in 2009 amid financial trouble. The Hitching Post Inn and Conference Center was a social hub for lobbyists and members of the Wyoming Legislature who stayed there during the annual legislative session, but the building has been closed for more than a decade. The purchasing agreement signed by private developer John Koehler was expected to be finalized in mid-April, but could be pushed back amid coronavirus concerns, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported. His limited liability company JPK TR Cheyenne II is expected to donate a portion of the property back to the city, including three of the Hitching Post buildings and access to the Ice and Events Center from Lincolnway, Koehler said. “This is an exciting game-changer for that entire area,” Mayor Marian Orr said. The city wanted to maintain access to the Ice and Events Center from Lincolnway to spur economic development on the western side of town, city officials said. Cheyenne City Council has postponed accepting the donation Monday during a council meeting after having technical difficulties on its livestream, but plans to address the topic again. The donation will also allow the city to put up new signage, improve lighting in the parking lot, and stabilize the abandoned buildings with boards and fencing to mitigate any public safety concerns for residents visiting the Ice and Events Center, officials said. Police have fielded several calls relating to crime and drug use at the location. “It’s been a very dangerous area, and so this is going to allow us as a city, owning those properties, to board them up until we as a community decide what the community needs are and how best to utilize those buildings,” Orr said.

"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Clay County violated a Missouri transparency law by denying a reporter their request to inspect government records, a judge ruled Monday. Judge Roger Prokes ruled Clay County committed two violations of the Missouri Sunshine Law when it rejected a Kansas City Star reporter copies of taxpayers bills to see how much the county spends on outside lawyers. Clay County also demanded The Star pay $4,200 to have a lawyer with the Spencer law firm representing Clay County review the billing records before releasing them to a reporter. Prokes rejected Clay County’s arguments that the law firm invoices The Star is asking for could reveal privileged attorney-client information. “The documents were not prepared in anticipation of litigation, but in anticipation of getting paid,” Prokes wrote. Clay County is currently in an ongoing audit by the Missouri Auditor that citizens requested after they suspected corruption by certain county leaders. Monday’s ruling adds to a string of judicial decisions against the actions and policies of Clay County government. Assistant county administrator, Nicole Brown, said the county plans an appeal. “The County does not believe that the Sunshine Law was intended to require the County’s taxpayers to subsidize the operations of the news media,” Brown said in an email to The Star. “Instead, the Sunshine Law is set up so that those who request records must pay the costs associated with satisfying their request. The County will appeal this decision.” Bernie Rhodes, a lawyer representing The Star in the lawsuit, said the judge’s decision supports Clay County taxpayers’ suspicions. “Today’s result confirms what Clay County taxpayers have known for a long time: That something is going on at the county courthouse that is wrong,” Rhodes said. “We will be filing a request to find out just how much Clay County taxpayers spent to defend this lawsuit which the county just lost.”  ",Judge: Clay County violated law denying reporter's request,"Tuesday, March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/24/judge-clay-county-violated-law-denying-reporters-r/,washington_times
"NEW YORK — A former personal lawyer for President Donald Trump was denied early release from a three-year prison sentence Tuesday after he pleaded guilty to numerous charges, including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III said it seemed Michael Cohen’s request for release to home confinement after serving 10 months in prison “appears to be just another effort to inject himself into the news cycle.” The judge noted that Cohen raised the danger of getting the coronavirus in prison as the latest reason why he believed he was entitled to a reduced sentence. He also rejected the request on other grounds, including that the defense lawyers were making a request that only prosecutors were entitled to make. Pauley noted that Cohen attempted to cooperate with prosecutors after his December 2018 sentencing in Manhattan federal court in the hopes that he could earn a reduced sentence. But he said prosecutors believe he made false statements about facts in his sessions with prosecutors. “Unable to articulate how he advanced any investigation or prosecution, Cohen and his surrogates make extravagant allegations that the Department of Justice - from the Attorney General down to line prosecutors - acted in bad faith. Those ad hominem attacks lack any substance and do not trigger the right to remedy or a hearing before this Court,” Judge Pauley wrote. The judge said it was not for him to second-guess the prosecutors’ decision that Cohen’s false statements and efforts to minimize his crimes justified a decision not to recommend a reduced sentence for Cohen. In asking for early release, Cohen’s lawyers said their client was the victim of a continuing campaign of “character assassination” by prosecutors. They claimed the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan “stubbornly refuses” to acknowledge the breadth, scope and relevance of over 170 hours of testimony he gave to nine government agencies. Cohen, 53, is housed at a federal prison in Otisville, New York, after pleading guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations and lying to Congress, among other charges. He began serving his sentence last May. Cohen maintains he deserves early release for telling investigators about the president’s misdeeds. In court papers, prosecutors say Cohen has offered no evidence that he provided them with substantial assistance of the kind that warrants a significant reduction in sentence. And they say Congressional testimony does not earn a reduction either. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018, abandoning his longtime position of loyalty to Trump. He later met with federal and state prosecutors in New York and with the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, telling them he had lied to Congress to protect Trump. Prior to Cohen’s sentence, Mueller’s team of investigators described his help to their probe, but prosecutors in Manhattan made it clear that Cohen wanted to help them only on his terms, unwilling to submit to the demands that he reveal all of his crimes and cooperate fully and honestly.

"The White House and Senate leaders of both parties have struck an agreement on a sweeping $2 trillion measure to aid workers, businesses and a health care system strained by the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak. Top White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway shortly after midnight. The agreement came after days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure and still needs to be finalized in detailed legislative language. “Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,” Ueland said. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and congressional leaders engaged in final negotiations Tuesday after a tumultuous but productive day Monday. While the two sides had resolved many issues in the sweeping package, some sticking points remained. “We’re trying to finalize all the documents, going through a lot of complicated issues, and we’re making a lot of progress,” Mnuchin said earlier Tuesday. Ravaged in recent days, stocks rocketed as negotiators signaled a resolution was in sight. At issue in the Capitol was an unprecedented economic rescue package. A one-time payment of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child would go directly to the public. A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at the insistence of Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, while Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salary of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. Companies would be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. Opening the Senate on Tuesday, McConnell combined optimism about the chances for a deal with frustration at the delays – and a sober view of the crisis at hand. “The urgency and the gravity of this moment cannot be lost on anyone,” he said. On the negotiations, he said, “It’s taken a lot of noise and a lot of rhetoric to get us here.” Still, “we are very close. We are close to a bill that takes our bold Republican framework, integrates further ideas from both parties, and delivers huge progress.” Earlier Tuesday, Trump urged swift action. “Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today,” he tweeted. “The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy.” Democrats pointed to gains for hospitals, additional oversight of the huge industry stabilization fund, and money for cash-strapped states. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters – including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program bank rescue, officials said. The emerging rescue package is larger than the 2008 bank bailout and 2009 recovery act combined.

"The White House and Senate leaders of both parties announced agreement early Wednesday on unprecedented emergency legislation to rush sweeping aid to businesses, workers and a health care system slammed by the coronavirus pandemic.

And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.” On Capitol Hill, five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress’ top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. Even before the deal was reached, news of the likely but elusive agreement had sent the stock market rocketing on Tuesday.

Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that’s estimated to provide $50 billion to companies who retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers’ paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax.

And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.” At the White House on Tuesday, even as the public-health crisis deepened, President Donald Trump expressed eagerness to nudge many people back to work in coming weeks and held out a prospect, based more on hope than science, that the country could be returning to normal in less than a month. “We have to go back to work, much sooner than people thought,” Trump told a Fox News town hall. He said he’d like to have the country “opened up and just raring to go” by Easter, April 12. But in a White House briefing later, Trump said that “our decision will be based on hard facts and data.” Medical professionals say social distancing needs to be stepped up, not relaxed, to slow the spread of infections. At the White House briefing, the public-health authorities said it was particularly important for people in the hard-hit New York City metropolitan area to quarantine themselves for 14 days, and for those who have recently left the city to do the same. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said pointedly at the briefing, “No one is going to want to tone down anything when you see what is going on in a place like New York City.” On Capitol Hill, five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress’ top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. Even before the deal was reached, news of the likely but elusive agreement had sent the stock market rocketing on Tuesday.  The emerging rescue package would be larger than the 2008 bank bailout and 2009 recovery act combined. The  unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at the insistence of Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, while Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salary of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. “It ensures that all workers are protected whether they work for businesses small, medium or large, along with self-employed and workers in the gig economy,” Schumer said. Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that’s estimated to provide $50 billion to companies who retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers’ paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. Democrats pointed to gains for hospitals, additional oversight of the huge industry stabilization fund, and money for cash-strapped states. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program bank rescue, officials said. Trump in recent days has sounded a note of frustration about the unprecedented modern-day effort to halt the virus’ march by essentially shutting down public activities in ways that now threaten the U.S. economy. Even though Trump’s administration recommended Americans curtail activities for 15 days, starting just over a week ago, the president said he may soon allow parts of the economy, in regions so far less badly hit by the virus, to begin reopening. He continued on that theme Tuesday as he weighed a relaxation of social distancing guidelines after the 15-day period is up. His suggestion that the pandemic could ease and allow a return to normalcy in a mere few weeks is not supported by public health officials or many others in government. On Tuesday, top defense and military leaders warned department personnel that the virus problems could extend for eight to 10 weeks, or longer. Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a Defense Department town hall meeting that the crisis could even extend into July. Trump has balked at using his authority under the recently invoked Defense Protection Act to compel the private sector to manufacture needed medical supplies like masks and ventilators, even as he encourages them to spur production. “We are a country not based on nationalizing our business,” said Trump, who has repeatedly railed against socialism overseas and among Democrats. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi beat a retreat Tuesday from the massive coronavirus wish list of Green New Deal projects, immigration measures and other non-virus changes she and fellow Democrats had proposed just hours earlier. She signaled in several television interviews that her troops would likely accept the deal that will emerge from the Senate, while casting her own 1,404-page bill, with a price tag of $2.5 trillion, as more of a marker for future fights over the direction of American priorities on energy, the work force, elections and immigration. “The easiest way to do it is for us to put aside some of our concerns for another day, and get this done,” the California Democrat told CNBC. GOP lawmakers were incensed at Mrs. Pelosi’s legislation, released late Monday night, saying it threatened to undo the progress toward a deal with its focus on issues that went beyond the immediate coronavirus rescue effort. It would have required airlines receiving bailout money to promise to go carbon-neutral by 2025, revoked several Trump executive orders on unionization within the federal workforce, imposed mandatory nationwide early voting and same-day voter registration, and forgiven $10,000 of student-loan debt across the board. Also, any company taking coronavirus bailout money would also have to permanently raise their minimum wage to $15 by the start of next year. “Everything we’re suggesting just relates to COVID-19,” Mrs. Pelosi told CNN. “It’s not about making long — for the future. It’s about COVID.” Republicans immediately started to use the Pelosi bill against vulnerable Democrats, accusing them of holding struggling workers hostage to a left-wing wish list. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, Arizona Democrat, took to Twitter to point out that none of the offending provisions were part of the Senate negotiations. And an administration official familiar with the talks said the Pelosi bill was a “dead letter” in the Senate discussions. Mrs. Pelosi fanned out on television to say her goal now is to try to pass whatever emerges from the Senate as quickly as possible — possibly by unanimous consent, or a voice vote, which would mean she wouldn’t have to call lawmakers back to Washington, risking coronavirus spread. House Republican leaders are on board that plan, too — though they believe a voice vote is more likely than getting unanimous consent from all members. Republican Whip Steve Scalise, in a call with the whip team, said that would also head off any effort by House Democrats to try to amend the Senate bill — a possibility Mrs. Pelosi did raise several times. Dissonant voices were making themselves heard. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, took to Twitter to call the emergency Senate bill “concerning.” “It seems to give a *HALF TRILLION DOLLARS* away to big corporations, w/ few worker protections,” she wrote. Mrs. Pelosi, while embracing the Senate negotiations, said the House lawmakers who put her shelved bill were an “intellectual resource” that did shape the Senate’s work. She praised new additions to the Senate deal, such as an inspector general to monitor the bailout money. Releasing her bill may end up hurting Mrs. Pelosi’s efforts to sell the Senate legislation, after liberal advocacy groups rushed to praise House Democrats for their far-reaching vision. Immigrant-rights groups were particularly pleased, saying Democrats went out of their way to ensure federal assistance could reach people regardless of immigration status. “We are all in the same boat when it comes to the virus. The virus doesn’t check immigration papers, citizenship status, or ability to pay when it hurts our communities. Nor should our government response,” said Douglas Rivlin, communications director at America’s Voice. But some of the immigration provisions went well beyond assistance and into major policy decisions. The bill would automatically renew millions of foreign guest-workers’ work permits. It would also, for the first time, write a specific protection for illegal-immigrant “Dreamers” into law, ordering the Homeland Security secretary to renew hundreds of thousands of DACA permits. Rosemary Jenks, vice president at NumbersUSA, which advocates for stricter immigration limits, said it struck a dissonant note amid coronavirus’s economic chaos to grant foreign workers permission to compete with Americans. “In the face of massive layoffs of American workers and predictions of unemployment reaching 20 percent or more, it is unconscionable that Democrats would prioritize foreign workers over the American workers who will desperately need those jobs,” Ms. Jenks said. The bill would have automatically renewed the immigration status of anyone whose current permits expired 30 days before the bill is enacted, and at least a year after it becomes law. It would apply to anyone here on Temporary Protected Status, DACA or another deferred deportation program, and regular guest-worker programs such as high-skilled H-1B visa-holders, farm workers on H-2A visas and seasonal non-farm workers on H-2B visas. It would even apply to those here on short-term tourist or business visas. Jessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies, said as much as 50% of the H-2B workers are in sectors deeply affected by coronavirus, such as hospitality or resorts. The law requires companies to try to hire American workers first, but Ms. Vaughan said the requirements aren’t very strict and American workers are displaced. And even if Americans do now compete for those jobs, she said the guest-workers, with renewed permits, aren’t likely to give up and go home. “They are likely to try to find another job here, and with worksite enforcement almost non-existent, they are likely to find it,” she said. “This visa extension provision is more likely to exacerbate the economic fallout of this crisis, not repair it.”  ",‘It’s about COVID’: Pelosi retreats on stimulus ‘wish list’,"Tuesday, March 24, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/24/nancy-pelosi-retreats-coronavirus-stimulus-wish-li/,washington_times
"Sen. Tom Cotton on Wednesday predicted swift passage of a $2 trillion legislative package designed to mitigate some of the negative economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak. “I really want to say to workers and businesses all across the country: Just hang on there for a few more days,” the Arkansas Republican said on “Fox & Friends.” “Help is on the way as soon as this bill passes. I suspect it’ll pass the Senate later today and maybe be signed by the president as early as tomorrow.” Congressional leaders early Wednesday announced a deal on the economic rescue bill after days of haggling over the fine print. About $250 billion will go toward direct payments for individuals and families. It also includes $250 billion for unemployment insurance benefits, about $350 billion in loans to help small businesses make payroll and $500 billion in loans for corporations. It also includes $150 billion for a state and local coronavirus relief fund and $130 billion for hospitals. Democrats touted that the deal bars businesses controlled by the president, vice president, members of Congress or heads of executive departments from getting loans from Treasury programs.

"The White House and Senate leaders struck a deal early Wednesday for a historic $2 trillion economic rescue package for workers and businesses hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation, expected to be enacted within days, will rush payments to Americans and loans to companies suffering in the economic shutdown aimed at stymying the deadly virus. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, described the stimulus bill, which is the biggest in modern U.S. history, as a “wartime level of investment into our nation.” “The men and women of the greatest country on Earth are going to defeat this coronavirus and reclaim our future,” he said. Earlier, as the haggling intensified, President Trump billed the rescue legislation as “the biggest and boldest financial relief package in American history.” The final deal delivered as advertised.

"President Trump said Tuesday that he wants the U.S. open and “raring to go” in less than three weeks, proposing an optimistic end date to the upheaval caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as he pushes to reinvigorate an election-year economy that has been turned on its head. “I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,” he told a Fox News town hall on the pandemic. As doctors and scientists call for greater limits on public interaction, Mr. Trump said the country was not built to shut down and that economic aftershocks could kill more people than the pathogen itself. “We can destroy our country this way by closing it down,” he said. “You’re going to lose more people by putting the country into a massive recession or depression. You’re going to have suicides by the thousands.” Briefing reporters later, he said “that beautiful Easter day” of April 12 is his target, but he will be guided by experts and science. “I just think it would be a beautiful timeline,” Mr. Trump said. The president had asked Americans to stay indoors and avoid large gatherings through the end of March, yet he has signaled potential changes to his guidance by the weekend. He said some parts of the country have been hit harder than others and that influenza and car crashes kill thousands each year without a single business closing. Lawmakers working to finish an economic stimulus package warned Mr. Trump not to be too hasty because failure to defeat the virus would lead to more pain down the road. “The cost to the economy of many more people getting affected and sick is an even bigger cost than we’re seeing now,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, also a California Democrat, pleaded with Mr. Trump to listen to scientists after the U.S. recorded more than 10,000 new cases in a single day at the start of the week. “It makes no sense to make changes to our safety guidelines unless those changes are based strictly on science. Politics should play no role when more and more people are dying every day,” she said. “I hope the president consults with doctors and other experts before making any changes to federal recommendations.” The president said March 16 that people should work and learn at home if possible, avoid groups of 10 or more and use takeout service instead of entering bars and restaurants for 15 days. Governors across the country have issued various degrees of “stay at home” orders as well as directives to shutter nonessential businesses. Scientists say the widespread business closures, a form of “social distancing,” are vital to breaking the virus’ chains of transmission. It will buy time for hospitals so they aren’t overrun with patients. Yet Mr. Trump and others say the economy can’t wither indefinitely and a plan is needed for restarting it. Mr. Trump’s allies said April 12 isn’t a deadline, per se, but a target date for Americans striving to get back to normal. “I don’t think it should be interpreted necessarily as you know, one day we’re on a stop sign, the next day we’re on a green light. I think there’s a lot of different ways to do transition phases to get to that point,” said Marc Short, chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence. “You could have different guidelines on different parts of the country where there are certain hot spots. Some of it could be guidance that’s given to different demographics.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of infectious disease research at the National Institutes of Health, said it is a “flexible situation.” The president said workers should follow safety guidelines as they return to the office during any type of phase-in. “You won’t be shaking hands for at least a while,” Mr. Trump said. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It has infected about 400,000 people worldwide, upending normal life in much of the developed world and forcing officials to postpone the Summer Olympics in Tokyo until next year. Nearly 19,000 people, including nearly 700 in the U.S., have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, Cases in Italy surged to about 70,000, putting it closer to China’s toll. A world-leading 7,000 people have died in Italy. Broadcasters for RAI television on Tuesday interviewed people huddled inside their homes by shouting up to their balcony windows. India, a country of more than 1 billion people, announced a three-week lockdown on Tuesday to limit the virus’ spread. The number of cases in the U.S. has ballooned from several thousand a week ago to more than 53,000 as increased testing roots out infections. It’s a major turnabout from one month ago, when Mr. Trump pointed to just over a dozen domestic cases and several dozen patients repatriated from other countries. “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” he tweeted Feb. 24. Wall Street numbers have tanked since then, erasing the gains of Mr. Trump’s presidency and forcing the Federal Reserve and Congress to reach for stimulus measures. The economic fallout is weighing on Mr. Trump, who was hoping to point to robust markets and low unemployment rates as the centerpiece of his reelection campaign. “Our country has to get back to work,” Mr. Trump said. “We can’t lose the advantage that we have.” The Greater New York City area has emerged as the epicenter of the U.S. crisis. The 15,000 cases reported in the city far exceed that of any state. White House officials asked anyone who has traveled out of the metropolitan area to self-isolate for 14 days so they don’t spread the virus elsewhere. “It’s a very serious situation. They’ve suffered terribly through no fault of their own,” Dr. Fauci said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday said the rate of new infections is doubling about every three days and that the “apex” is likely in 14 to 21 days. “The apex is higher than we thought, and the apex is sooner than we thought,” said Mr. Cuomo, speaking from the Javits Center in New York City. A week ago, he said he didn’t expect the peak for another 45 days. New York has recorded more than 25,600 coronavirus infections and at least 210 deaths related to COVID-19. Both totals are the most of any state in the country. “In many ways, we have exhausted every option available to us,” he said. “We’ve closed all the businesses, we’ve reduced the street density, and we’ve increased testing to the highest level in the country.” He repeated his call for the federal government to leverage the Defense Production Act to increase production of critical supplies such as ventilators, saying it’s inexplicable that there hasn’t been quicker action on that front. “I need the ventilators in 14 days — only the federal government has that power,” he said. Mr. Cuomo said the state has procured 7,000 ventilators, which are critical for treating people who have tested positive for the virus, but that they need 30,000. Mr. Pence said 4,000 ventilators will ship to New York within two days, while Mr. Trump chafed at Mr. Cuomo’s complaints. “He had 16,000 ventilators. He could have had a great price, and he didn’t buy them,” the president said, citing a report from five years ago. South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported Tuesday that Mr. Trump asked President Moon Jae-in whether South Korea could provide medical equipment to the U.S. Mr. Moon replied that his government would provide “maximum support” if available but pointed out that approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration might be required, the report said. Mr. Trump said he would take immediate action for that “within today,” said Blue House spokesman Kang Min-seok. Yonhap noted that South Korea has been praised for its effective and swift response to the spread of the virus, including advanced testing capabilities, and has been exporting test kits to several countries. South Korea, where the outbreak hit earlier than the U.S., has reported more than 9,000 cases of COVID-19, with 120 deaths. The U.S. now has more than 46,000 cases and 593 deaths. The White House readout of the 23-minute phone call made no specific mention of Mr. Trump asking for medical supplies from South Korea. White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said Mr. Trump “reiterated his commitment to employ the full weight of the United States government and work with global leaders to save lives and restore economic growth.” Dr. Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, said the U.S. has conducted more tests for COVID-19 in eight days than South Korea conducted in eight weeks. She said South Korea likely conducted about 290,000 total tests, and the U.S. will be over 300,000 on Thursday. “Our cases will continue to surge,” she said, “because we’re still working on our backlog.” • Dave Boyer and Gabriella Muñoz contributed to this report.

"President Trump tweeted his sarcastic relief on Wednesday about Republican Sen. Mitt Romney testing negative for the COVID-19 disease. “This is really great news! I am so happy I can barely speak,” the president tweeted. “He may have been a terrible presidential candidate and an even worse U.S. Senator, but he is a RINO, and I like him a lot! RINO stands for “Republican In Name Only.” Mr. Romney was the only GOP senator to vote to convict the president on an article of impeachment last month. The Utah senator announced on Tuesday that he had tested negative for the disease. “Nevertheless, guidance from my physician, consistent with the CDC guidelines, requires me to remain in quarantine as the test does not rule out the onset of symptoms during the 14-day period,” Mr. Romney said. Republican strategist John Weaver, who worked with the late Sen. John McCain, tweeted at the president in response: “What the holy hell is wrong with you? People are dying all across the nation, due in part to your inaction, and you are taking time to mock a good man? You are a sorry pathetic excuse of a human. Unfit to lead anything.

"Dr. Anthony Fauci on Tuesday evening said President Trump has an “open mind” about a timeline for dialing back federal guidance tied to the coronavirus, saying Mr. Trump accepts the need for flexibility amid the pandemic. “It’s a back and forth. The president clearly listens. I mean, he has this aspirational goal of hoping that we might be able to do it by a certain date,” Dr. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Fox News. “We talk to him about that. We say we need to be flexible. He realizes that, and he accepts that,” he said. “I mean, he doesn’t want to give up his aspirational goal, but he’s flexible enough to say, OK, let’s look at it on a day-by-day basis.” “He’s been very flexible about it, even though it looks like he’s made this absolute decision on something, he does have an open mind about it,” Dr. Fauci continued. Mr. Trump on Tuesday said he’d love to have the country “opened up and just raring to go” by Easter, which is on April 12. The president on March 16 had announced a 15-day period during which the federal government is advising people to avoid crowds of more than 10 persons, work at home if possible, and eat takeout instead of dining in restaurants. A number of states and localities have enacted their own lockdown orders, bans on gatherings, and business closings. They may or may not choose to follow the lead of the federal government if the guidelines are relaxed. Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, said he’d love to see things opened back up by Easter but that people need to exercise caution. “The one thing we don’t want to see is a relaxing of some of the restrictions on public activities and then a resurgence of the pandemic,” Mr. Cotton said Wednesday on “Fox & Friends.” “Remember, the president didn’t quote-unquote shut down the country,” he said. “These are decisions that are being made by governors and by mayors at the local and the state level based on conditions in their states.” Mr. Cotton said ultimately things would happen on a “rolling basis.” “You won’t just see a single, nationwide set of conditions,” he said. “I think you’ll see it down to the local and state level as the president and the federal government works with our governors and our mayors.”  ",Anthony Fauci: Trump has 'open mind' about timeline for coronavirus guidance," -

"DHAKA,Bangladesh (AP) - Bangladesh’s government on Wednesday released imprisoned opposition leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia for six months on condition that she stays at home and does not attempt to leave the country.  Zia had spent more than two years in the prison cell of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University in the capital, Dhaka. Her family and senior party leaders received her as hundreds of supporters ignored calls to avoid gathering to stop the spread of coronavirus. Wearing a mask, Zia came out in a wheelchair and rode a car to her home in Dhaka’s Gulshan area.  On Tuesday, Law Minister Anisul Huq said Zia, 74, was being released on humanitarian grounds considering her age. She will receive her remaining treatment at home, he said.  Zia was sentenced to 17 years in prison in two corruption cases. Her Bangladesh Nationalist Party says the cases were politically motivated. The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Zia’s archrival, denies the allegation. Zia’s party says she is seriously ill with ailments including respiratory problems and arthritis.  In February, the High Court rejected an appeal by Zia seeking her release for medical treatment in the United Kingdom for chronic arthritis. Zia was convicted in February 2018 on charges of misusing her power by embezzling some $250,000 in donations meant for an orphanage trust. She was later convicted in another corruption case. Zia and Hasina are both part of political dynasties. Zia is the widow of Ziaur Rahman, a general-turned-president who was assassinated in 1981. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s first president and independence leader, who was assassinated in 1975. Bangladesh gained independence through a nine-month war against Pakistan in 1971.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi touted Democratic victories in the Senate’s $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package Wednesday, but did not say when the House would take it up. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” she said in a statement. Tuesday, Mrs. Pelosi made the rounds on talk shows and signaled that her chamber would likely accept the Senate’s deal and attempt to pass it with unanimous consent, if possible. It only takes one member, however, to object and derail a unanimous consent request. “The Republican bill proposed by Senator McConnell on Sunday was a non-starter,” she said. “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people.” The five big wins for Mrs. Pelosi and her members were the massive amount of funds injected into the healthcare system; a surge of unemployment insurance; expansion of relief options for small businesses; billions for education funding; and oversight for assistance funds received by corporations.

"Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on Wednesday touted a deal on a $2 trillion economic rescue package while saying and that lawmakers need to be prepared to do more amid the expanding coronavirus outbreak. “It is a good bill. Does it have everything we need? No,” Mr. Schumer, New York Democrat, said on CNN’s “New Day.” “But this is the art of compromise. This is the art of coming together.” He said people don’t know how long the crisis will last and precisely who is affected. “The unknown is one thing,” he said. “We should be willing [and] able to come back in a bipartisan way and do more if we need it, and I believe we’ll probably have to do that one way or another.” Staff is still drafting actual legislative text, but negotiators announced the contours of the deal overnight Wednesday. It calls for $1,200 checks to go out to many Americans, with a cost of $250 billion for that provision. It also includes $250 billion for unemployment insurance, about $367 billion in loans for small businesses to make payroll, $500 billion in loans for corporations, $150 billion for a state and local relief fund, and $130 billion for hospitals. “I think we will pass it today,” Mr. Schumer said. Mr. Schumer helped cut the deal along with Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland. Senate Democrats had twice derailed procedural votes as lawmakers tried to move the process forward, saying a GOP-written bill was tilted too much toward boosting corporations. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday said a Republican bill offered by Mr. McConnell several days ago was a “non-starter.” House Democrats had countered with their own $2.5 trillion package. “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,” said Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action.” Mr. Schumer said Democrats managed to wring concessions that included additional money for hospitals, strengthened unemployment benefits and additional oversight on “corporate bailouts.” Democrats had objected to a $500 billion loan fund that would boost corporations, likening it to a “slush fund” and saying it gave Treasury too much discretion to shield details. Mr. Schumer said Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts helped craft oversight provisions on that front. There’s expected to be an inspector general and oversight board akin to what happened with the 2008 bank bailouts. “The bottom line there is that we will know very shortly after any contract with the Fed or with the Treasury is signed with a company, any loan is made, we will have full details of the loan document,” Mr. Schumer said. “It’ll be published very, very shortly afterwards.” It’s unclear how quickly the House will be able to move on the package, as members are currently on recess. Leaders have talked about the possibility of pushing it through via unanimous consent given the urgency of the situation, but objections from just one member could thwart those plans. Rep. Justin Amash, an independent from Michigan who left the GOP last year, said the package was a “raw deal for the people.” “It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor,” Mr. Amash said on Twitter.

"Sen. Tom Cotton on Wednesday predicted swift passage of a $2 trillion legislative package designed to mitigate some of the negative economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak. “I really want to say to workers and businesses all across the country: Just hang on there for a few more days,” the Arkansas Republican said on “Fox & Friends.” “Help is on the way as soon as this bill passes. I suspect it’ll pass the Senate later today and maybe be signed by the president as early as tomorrow.” Congressional leaders early Wednesday announced a deal on the economic rescue bill after days of haggling over the fine print. About $250 billion will go toward direct payments for individuals and families. It also includes $250 billion for unemployment insurance benefits, about $367 billion in loans to help small businesses make payroll and a $500 billion loan fund intended to help boost distressed corporations. It also includes $150 billion for a state and local coronavirus relief fund and $130 billion for hospitals. Mr. Cotton said that the deal “is not the bill that Nancy Pelosi proposed earlier this week with lots of extraneous measures.” House Democrats had offered their own $2.5 trillion package that also included provisions related to collective bargaining, climate change and election rules. The senator said the deal is akin to something Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans had proposed days earlier, only with more money for things like unemployment insurance, emergency medical equipment, cities, states and hospitals. Senate Democrats had blocked procedural action to move the process forward, protesting that the GOP was offering too much of a giveaway to big corporations. Mr. Cotton said he’s been hearing from business owners in his state the past several days about why Senate Democrats “dithered” with the package. “They were going to have to start laying off workers tomorrow, [because] they literally have no customers coming in the door, they have no cash with which to make payroll,” he said.

"The White House and Senate leaders of both parties have agreed on unprecedented emergency legislation to rush sweeping aid totaling some $2 trillion to businesses, workers and a health care system slammed by the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, India’s 1.3 billion people joined the global lockdown, and Prince Charles has tested positive for the new coronavirus. Here are some of AP’s top stories Wednesday on the world’s coronavirus pandemic. Follow APNews.com/VirusOutbreak for updates through the day and APNews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak for stories explaining some of its complexities. WHAT’S HAPPENING TODAY: - Trains carrying factory employees back to work after two months in locked-down cities rolled out of Hubei province, the center of China’s virus outbreak, as the government began lifting the last of the controls that confined tens of millions of people to their homes.  - A “cacophony of coughing” in packed emergency rooms. Beds squeezed in wherever there is space. Overworked, sleep-deprived doctors and nurses rationed to one face mask a day and wracked by worry about a dwindling number of available ventilators. Such is the reality inside New York City’s hospitals, which have become the war-zone-like epicenter of the nation’s coronavirus crisis. - Despite what you may have read in a text message or on social media, there are currently no plans for a national quarantine, let alone martial law.  Rumors of a military-enforced national lockdown have been debunked repeatedly by state and federal authorities who say their recurrence shows just how persistent false claims can be during an emergency, and why it’s vital to find reliable sources of information. - For most Americans, the idea of a shared national sacrifice is an abstraction. It’s a memory passed on from a grandparent or through a book or movie. Will America step up as it enters what one historian calls “a new moment”?  -Even as the country has largely hunkered down, some powerful people in Washington have defied preventative measures  aimed at curbing the spread of the contagious coronavirus.  WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover. Here are the symptoms of  the virus compared with the common flu.  One of the best ways to prevent spread of the virus is washing your hands with soap and water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends first washing with warm or cold water and then lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under fingernails before rinsing off. You should wash your phone, too. Here’s how.

The donations will focus on Broadway workers, as well as workers in Las Vegas and in the music industry. Jackson’s estate announced Wednesday that it will give $100,000 apiece to Broadway Cares, Three Square food bank in Nevada and the Recording Academy’s MusiCares. The estate’s co-executor John Branca tells The Associated Press the gifts are personal for the keepers of Jackson’s affairs and legacy and are in line with the singer’s charitable endeavors during his lifetime. ___ IN OTHER NEWS:                 PLAYING THROUGH: Many golf courses around the country have remained open during the coronavirus pandemic. The hope is that golf can provide an outlet for the stir crazy and a dose of normalcy. The question is whether recreational golf safe enough under the circumstances. Courses have barred touching the flagsticks and turned the hole cups upside down so golfers don’t need reach in to retrieve the ball. ___ Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  ",What you need to know today about the virus outbreak,"Wednesday, March 25, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/25/what-you-need-to-know-today-about-the-virus-outbre/,washington_times
"Democratic presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden on Wednesday called on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to rethink his approach to the coronavirus outbreak, urging him to put more faith in the opinions of scientists and health experts. Mr. DeSantis has refused to follow the lead of other governors who have adopted some form of shelter-in-place in their states. The governor has instead asked President Trump to declare Florida a disaster area and issued an executive order requiring people traveling to the state from the New York City area to self-quarantine for two weeks. “While other large states continue to take strong, urgent, and sweeping action to stop the spread of COVID-19, Florida has not,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. “I urge Governor Desantis to let the experts speak to the public and explain why this is the case. In this moment of growing uncertainty and anxiety, Floridians want — and deserve — to hear from the public health officials leading the charge.” The former vice president and 2020 presidential hopeful has been full of praise for the way other governors — including Democrat Andrew Cuomo of New York and Republican Mike DeWine of Ohio — have responded to the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Biden said the stakes are too high to not heed the advice of health care experts. “Floridians deserve science-based action from Governor Ron DeSantis,” he said.  ",Joe Biden calls on Florida Gov.

"President Trump tweeted his sarcastic relief on Wednesday about Republican Sen. Mitt Romney testing negative for the COVID-19 disease. “This is really great news! I am so happy I can barely speak,” the president tweeted. “He may have been a terrible presidential candidate and an even worse U.S. Senator, but he is a RINO, and I like him a lot! RINO stands for “Republican In Name Only.” Mr. Romney was the only GOP senator to vote to convict the president on an article of impeachment last month. The Utah senator announced on Tuesday that he had tested negative for the disease. “Nevertheless, guidance from my physician, consistent with the CDC guidelines, requires me to remain in quarantine as the test does not rule out the onset of symptoms during the 14-day period,” Mr. Romney said. Republican strategist John Weaver, who worked with the late Sen. John McCain, tweeted at the president in response: “What the holy hell is wrong with you? People are dying all across the nation, due in part to your inaction, and you are taking time to mock a good man? You are a sorry pathetic excuse of a human. Unfit to lead anything.

"Dr. Anthony Fauci on Tuesday evening said President Trump has an “open mind” about a timeline for dialing back federal guidance tied to the coronavirus, saying Mr. Trump accepts the need for flexibility amid the pandemic. “It’s a back and forth. The president clearly listens. I mean, he has this aspirational goal of hoping that we might be able to do it by a certain date,” Dr. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Fox News. “We talk to him about that. We say we need to be flexible. He realizes that, and he accepts that,” he said. “I mean, he doesn’t want to give up his aspirational goal, but he’s flexible enough to say, OK, let’s look at it on a day-by-day basis.” “He’s been very flexible about it, even though it looks like he’s made this absolute decision on something, he does have an open mind about it,” Dr. Fauci continued. Mr. Trump on Tuesday said he’d love to have the country “opened up and just raring to go” by Easter, which is on April 12. The president on March 16 had announced a 15-day period during which the federal government is advising people to avoid crowds of more than 10 persons, work at home if possible, and eat takeout instead of dining in restaurants. A number of states and localities have enacted their own lockdown orders, bans on gatherings, and business closings. They may or may not choose to follow the lead of the federal government if the guidelines are relaxed. Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, said he’d love to see things opened back up by Easter but that people need to exercise caution. “The one thing we don’t want to see is a relaxing of some of the restrictions on public activities and then a resurgence of the pandemic,” Mr. Cotton said Wednesday on “Fox & Friends.” “Remember, the president didn’t quote-unquote shut down the country,” he said. “These are decisions that are being made by governors and by mayors at the local and the state level based on conditions in their states.” Mr. Cotton said ultimately things would happen on a “rolling basis.” “You won’t just see a single, nationwide set of conditions,” he said. “I think you’ll see it down to the local and state level as the president and the federal government works with our governors and our mayors.”  ",Anthony Fauci: Trump has 'open mind' about timeline for coronavirus guidance,"Wednesday, March 25, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/25/anthony-fauci-donald-trump-has-open-mind-about-tim/,washington_times
"The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 428,000 people and killed over 19,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. The COVID-19 illness causes mild or moderate symptoms in most people, but severe symptoms are more likely in the elderly or those with existing health problems. More than 109,000 people have recovered so far, mostly in China. TOP OF THE HOUR: - Prince Charles tests positive for coronavirus. - Putin orders military to help with virus outbreak. - Environmentalists say air quality is improving. ___ WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah says he has tested negative for the coronavirus. Romney posted on Twitter, “Thankfully I’ve tested negative for COVID-19.” Romney says guidance from his physician is consistent with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and requires him to remain in quarantine. He says the test “does not rule out the onset of symptoms during the 14-day period.” Romney was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. He was the only Senate Republican to vote against President Donald Trump at Trump’s Senate impeachment trial. ___ CANBERRA, Australia - Two Australians infected with the coronavirus aboard cruise ships have died on consecutive days, bringing the nation’s death toll to nine and focusing attention on the health threat posed by cruises. Queensland Health says a 68-year-old man died in hospital in Toowoomba on Wednesday and had a serious underlying medical condition. The man was a passenger aboard the cruise ship Voyager of the Seas that docked in Sydney on March 18, the day the Australian government banned cruise ship arrivals for a month. A 77-year-old woman who died on Tuesday arrived in Sydney a day later aboard the cruise ship Ruby Princess. It’s 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark without health warnings because the 11-day cruise to New Zealand was considered low risk. That ship has become Australia’s largest source of infections, with at least 133 passengers testing positive. A dozen cruise ships that set out before the Australian cruise ban are due to dock soon. New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian says no passengers will be allowed to disembark in Sydney before new public health measures are agreed upon. ___ KIYV, Ukraine - Ukraine’s government declared the state of emergency due to the coronavirus outbreak.  Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced the decision at a cabinet meeting. He says its effective until April 24 and could be extended.  Ukraine has reported 113 cases of the coronavirus and four deaths.  Earlier this month the country’s government closed the borders for foreigners, suspended air traffic in other countries, shut down schools and banned public events. The state of emergency was declared in several regions of the country on Monday. ___ HARARE, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe’s public hospital doctors are going on strike over what they call a lack of adequate protective gear as the coronavirus begins to spread in a country whose health system has almost collapsed.  The Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association president, Tawanda Zvakada, says doctors are at “high risk” of contracting the virus: “Right now we are exposed and no one seems to care.”  He says doctors have an inadequate stocks of gloves, masks and gowns.  The southern African nation has reported three cases of COVID-19 and recorded its first death this week. ___ THE HAGUE, Netherlands - The Dutch public health institute says the coronavirus has been discovered in sewage in the Netherlands. The institute says DNA tests confirmed the virus in waste water from the southern city of Tilburg and a nearby town, which are in the hardest-hit Dutch region, as well as from the capital Amsterdam. It says symptoms of the disease caused by the virus can include diarrhea in some patients and the virus can be detected in human waste of some infected patients. Dutch sewage workers already wear protective clothing that shield them from the coronavirus. ___ ANKARA, Turkey - Turkey’s foreign minister says at least 32 Turkish nationals have died from the coronavirus abroad, most of them in European countries. Mevlut Cavusoglu says the government was assisting families wanting to return their loved ones’ bodies back home. He says Turkey overnight flew back 2,721 Turkish students stranded in eight countries, following the cancellation of flights over the outbreak. They are being quarantined in student dormitories in three cities. Turkey has reported 44 COVID-19 deaths and a total of 1,872 infections. ___ MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the military to train to help handle the coronavirus outbreak. The Defense Ministry says the four-day exercise that began Wednesday will check the troops’ readiness to deal with contagion. The military will run drills on how to deal with the outbreak at its bases and check the military’s ability to quickly deploy its forces across the vast country. The government has reported 658 cases of the coronavirus in Russia and no deaths. Officials say the low number of cases in Russia compared to Europe could be due to insufficient screening and called for action to brace up for the worst. ___ VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis has reaffirmed the need to protect all life, rallying Christians around the world to pray together for those sick with the coronavirus and the medical personnel who are caring for them. Francis presided over a global noontime prayer Wednesday, in which he begged for God’s mercy amid the pandemic.  The prayer fell on the 25th anniversary of a landmark Vatican document reaffirming the inviolability of all human life from conception to natural death. Francis dedicated his comments to the document, which strongly reaffirmed church teaching opposing abortion and euthanasia. Francis says it is imperative to “relaunch this teaching in the context of a pandemic that threatens human life and the global economy.” Some conservative Christian commentators, as well as U.S. President Donald Trump, have warned the consequences of the financial shutdown aimed at preventing the virus’ spread and protecting the elderly and sick are worse than the virus itself. ___ TOKYO - Japan’s foreign ministry says it has raised its travel warning to its people and urged them not to make any non-essential trips outside of the country. The measures follow similar caution for most of Europe and the U.S. amid the rapid increase in the number of cases in those areas. Also, the ministry says two employees at its embassy in Washington have contracted the virus and isolated themselves. One has no notable symptoms, while the other has a fever. A Japanese official at Japan’s embassy in Macedonia also tested positive for the virus after traveling to Greece to help in the Olympic Flame handover ceremony.  ___ DHAKA, Bangladesh - Authorities in Bangladesh say another 65-year-old man died of coronavirus and the total death toll rose to five while the total number of cases of infection remained at 39. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, says the man with diabetes and hypertension tested positive on March 18 and was being treated in a hospital in Dhaka.  She says no new cases of infection were reported over last 24 hours. But experts say Bangladesh is at the high risk of community transmission as hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis, including many expatriate workers, returned home from Italy and other affected countries in recent weeks.  The government is asking the people to stay at home and military soldiers have been called into some big cities to enforce the social distancing ___ LONDON - Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, has tested positive for the new coronavirus. The prince’s Clarence House office says the 71-year-old is showing mild symptoms of COVID-19 and is self-isolating at a royal estate in Scotland. It says his wife Camilla has tested negative. The palace says Charles “has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.”  ___ MADRID - Spain has now the world’s second highest tally of coronavirus deaths after a 738 spike was recorded Wednesday, the highest so far in one day. With 3,434, Spain surpassed China’s 3,285 and has more than half of Italy’s 6,820. Infections also rose on Wednesday by 20% from a day earlier to 47,610, Spain’s Ministry of Health announced. More than 5,000 people have recovered, the ministry said. The outbreak has hit Spain and put a tragic strain on its healthcare system, especially in the central region around Madrid, with one third of the positive cases and roughly half of the casualties. ___ BRATISLAVA, Slovakia - Slovakia’s new prime minister said a government plane with badly needed high quality respirators from Turkey has landed early on Wednesday. Igor Matovic said the 100,000 respirators will be immediately distributed to hospitals across the country. They will be used by doctors and nurses directly treating patients infected with COVID-19. “The Slovak health sector has been desperately waiting for them for a month,” Matovic said. Since his four-party coalition government was sworn in on Saturday, Matovic repeatedly criticized the previous Cabinet for a failure to secure protective equipment. Slovakia has only 216 infected with the coronavirus but has tested only 4,200 people so far. The new government wants to increase the number of people tested daily. ___ BRUSSELS - A renowned Belgian university is launching a cross-border study in three European countries to assess the nefarious psychological effects of lockdown measures on individuals. Researchers from the Louvain university say they want to find out to what extent the quarantine measures imposed to fight the novel coronavirus epidemics have changed people’s way of life, and to analyze their impact on mental health. Fearing a rise in the number of suicides, health sociologist Vincent Louvain said that governments are often overlooking the side effects of the quarantine measures as they try to stop the spreading of the deadly virus. “Governments are currently putting their energy on managing the epidemic. As a result, other risks are forgotten,” he said, insisting that a large part of the population is psychologically fragile and in need of health care. “The situation could deteriorate in terms of mental health”.  The survey will analyze data collected in Belgium, France and the Netherlands. It will be piloted by the Louvain university in collaboration with a French institute specialized in health economy and the Antwerp university. ___ BRUSSELS - With a soaring infection rate, steadily growing death toll and enforced quarantine, it’s hard to see the positive side of the coronavirus, but the European Environment Agency says that air quality is improving. The EEA said Wednesday that new data confirms “large decreases in air pollutant concentrations - of nitrogen dioxide concentrations in particular - largely due to reduced traffic and other activities, especially in major cities under lockdown measures.” Nitrogen dioxide is mainly emitted by road transport, and the agency says levels of the pollutant in northern Italy, the epicenter of the country’s coronavirus outbreak, are ranging from 21-47% lower this month than in March 2019. Similar trends have been seen in other parts of Europe under lockdown. Levels in Barcelona and Madrid in Spain dropped by 40-55% in the week of March 16-22, while NO2 levels in the Portuguese capital Lisbon also dropped 40% over the same week. The agency notes that air pollution contributes to respiratory and heart disease but that it’s not yet clear whether exposure to such gases might worsen the condition of people with COVID-19. However, EEA chief Hans Bruyninckx insists that crisis measures are not the way to tackle air pollution. “Addressing long-term air quality problems requires ambitious policies and forward-looking investments,” he says. ___ BANGKOK - Thailand’s prime minister says he will take sole charge of the country’s battle against COVID-19, warning the outbreak may get much worse. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s government issued a 16-point order for the national state of emergency set for Thursday until April 30 that forbids most foreigners from entering the country and bans rallies and other gatherings in crowded places. It does not include a curfew that had been expected as a measure to enforce social distancing and uninfected people are not confined to their homes. Prayuth declared that strict measures would be taken against anyone violating the regulations and officials who do not carry out their duties.  He emphasized control of information, calling on the mass media not to interview officials who aren’t authorized to make announcements and warning that social media users spreading ‘fake news’ would be strictly dealt with. The chief of defense forces will be in charge of national security and deal with violations of the law, Prayuth said. Violations are punishable by a prison term of up to two years and a 40,000 baht ($1,220) fine. ___ MOSCOW - Russia’s prime minister ordered provincial governors Wednesday to move more quickly to ready hospital beds for coronavirus patients as the outbreak has spread across the vast country. The government reported 658 cases of the new coronavirus in Russia, up from 495 a day before. That marked a significantly bigger daily increase compared to previous day when the number of infections increased by several dozens. The warning to governors came a day after the mayor of Moscow told Russian President Vladimir Putin that the Russian regions weren’t acting energetically enough to prepare for the outbreak. Mayor Sergei Sobyanin warned that the low number of cases in Russia compared to Europe could be explained by insufficient screening and called for quicker action to brace up for the worst. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova reported that 112,000 people are currently in self-isolation being monitored for coronavirus after return from abroad. Earlier this month, the government has requested all those who returned from the countries plagued by the outbreak to self-quarantine for two weeks. ___ RAMALLAH, West Bank - Tens of thousands of Palestinian workers are expected to return to the occupied West Bank from Israel following orders from the Palestinian Authority. Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh late Tuesday ordered the workers to return and go into 14-day quarantine, the latest in a series of measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak. He says those disregarding the orders will face unspecified legal consequences. Israel has reported more than 2,000 cases and five deaths. The Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank, has reported 58 cases. Israel had allowed 65,000 Palestinian workers to remain in the country during the crisis, but many are expected to return as Israel tightens its own restrictions. Most work in construction, agriculture and manufacturing. Working in Israel pays much better than in the West Bank, where decades of Israeli military rule has hindered economic development. ___ TIRANA, Albania - Albania has declared the natural calamity emergency because of the virus. The government late Tuesday issued the decision at the official gazette saying that the rights are limited “to the level considered necessary to protect the citizens’ health.” That means that all public gatherings, including demonstrations and strikes are prohibited. The government authorities have increased rights, including entering people’s homes to check for virus cases. People are also obliged to report virus symptoms or cases. That situation is to continue for an unspecified time “during the period of infection.” As of Tuesday, Albania had 5 deaths and 123 cases. The country is in a lockdown with all border crossing routes shut, but one flight to Turkey. Schools, cafes, restaurants, gyms and shops are closed, except those offering food items and medicine. Only a limited number of public and private employees can work during an eight-hour time a day while all people may only get out to buy food and medicine. ___ LONDON - Britain’s Parliament is set to shut down for at least four weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic. Lawmakers have continued to attend — though in smaller numbers - despite the spread of COVID-19, which has reached 8,077 confirmed cases and 422 deaths in the U.K. Visitors have been banned from the Parliament buildings and some staff have been working from home. With Britons now ordered to stay home and all but essential shops shut, Parliament is expected to shut down once lawmakers have approved an emergency law on Wednesday giving the government more powers to fight the coronavirus. Lawmakers will vote on a motion suspending Parliament until April 21. They had previously been due to take an Easter break from April 1-20. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said “Parliament has to lead by example, follow the guidelines wherever it can, and ensure that we protect the staff that work in Parliament as well.” ___ JOHANNESBURG - Coronavirus cases across Africa are now above 2,400, and South Africa has more cases than any other African nation with 709. The continent’s most developed country enters lockdown first thing Friday. ___ BERLIN - Germany’s parliament is meeting to approve an enormous package drawn up by the government to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Lawmakers were to vote Wednesday on a series of measures that will allow the government to offer aid totaling more than 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion).  As a precaution, members of parliament were spaced widely apart in Berlin’s Reichstag building for the session. The government is breaking with six years of balanced budgets to borrow what Finance Minister Olaf Scholz called the “gigantic sum” of 156 billion euros to finance the packages and cover an expected shortfall in tax revenue. Parliament’s approval is needed to loosen legal limits on running up debt. Scholz, who is Germany’s vice chancellor, presented the package in place of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is in quarantine at home after a doctor who gave her a vaccination tested positive for the coronavirus. Scholz said that “we as the German government are doing everything necessary and everything possible to cushion the economic and social consequences of managing the crisis.” ___ COLOMBO, Sri Lanka - Sri Lanka police on Wednesday warned of strict legal action against the people who violate a countrywide curfew. In a statement, police said those who violate the curfew will be immediately arrested, even without a warrant, and legal action will be taken against them. The statement did not elaborate on the possible punishment. Within the last 24 hours, police have arrested 420 people who violated the curfew and seized 97 vehicles. The government has imposed the curfew since Friday (March 20), as the Indian Ocean island nation has been struggling to contain the spreading of the virus. The number of positive cases has now jumped to 101. Since Friday, police have detained 2,682 persons for violating the curfew and detained 786 vehicles, police said. Police urged people to stay at home during the curfew, except those who engage in essential services such as health and supply of essential commodities. The government has asked the pharmacies to be kept open during the curfew and allow people to use their prescription as a curfew pass. ___ SEOUL, South Korea - South Korea says it plans to provide coronavirus testing materials to the United States in response to President Donald Trump’s request for help. Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the country is willing to send chemical reagents used to extract genetic material during COVID-19 tests, but at a level that doesn’t affect its own testing capacity. She didn’t provide a detailed estimate on the size of supplies that could be shipped to the United States. The office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in earlier said Trump during a telephone conversation between the leaders asked whether South Korea could send medical equipment and supplies to help the United States cope with its outbreaks. South Korea is pushing an aggressive test-and-quarantine program that some experts say possibly contributed to its lower death toll in comparison with mainland China and hard-hit European nations. As of Wednesday, South Korea had tested around 358,000 people while reporting 9,137 infections and 126 deaths. ___ WASHINGTON - The White House and Senate leaders of both U.S. political parties have struck an agreement on a sweeping $2 trillion measure to aid workers, businesses and a health care system strained by the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak. Top White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway shortly after midnight. The agreement comes after days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure and still needs to be finalized in detailed legislative language. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.

"The $2 trillion rescue bill the White House and Senate hatched to lessen the economic pain from the coronavirus crisis is the biggest stimulus in modern U.S. history. Here’s what’s in it: • About $500 billion in direct payments to American workers and families: • Individuals with federally adjusted annual incomes of less than $75,000 would get checks for $1,200. • Married couples making up to $150,000 would get checks for $2,400. • Families in qualifying households would get $500 per child. • About 90% of Americans would qualify for government checks, though the amount decreases for those making more than $75,000 a year, with an income cap of $99,000 for individuals and $198,000 for couples. • Unemployment insurance benefits would get a $250 billion boost — adding $600 per week to current benefits and covering gig workers such as Uber drivers for the first time. • $500 billion in subsidized loans for big businesses. • $150 billion of stimulus spending for states and local governments. • $130 billion for hospitals.

"Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on Wednesday touted a deal on a $2 trillion economic rescue package while saying and that lawmakers need to be prepared to do more amid the expanding coronavirus outbreak. “It is a good bill. Does it have everything we need? No,” Mr. Schumer, New York Democrat, said on CNN’s “New Day.” “But this is the art of compromise. This is the art of coming together.” He said people don’t know how long the crisis will last and precisely who is affected. “The unknown is one thing,” he said. “We should be willing [and] able to come back in a bipartisan way and do more if we need it, and I believe we’ll probably have to do that one way or another.” Staff is still drafting actual legislative text, but negotiators announced the contours of the deal overnight Wednesday. It calls for $1,200 checks to go out to many Americans, with a cost of $250 billion for that provision. It also includes $250 billion for unemployment insurance, about $367 billion in loans for small businesses to make payroll, $500 billion in loans for corporations, $150 billion for a state and local relief fund, and $130 billion for hospitals. “I think we will pass it today,” Mr. Schumer said. Mr. Schumer helped cut the deal along with Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland. Senate Democrats had twice derailed procedural votes as lawmakers tried to move the process forward, saying a GOP-written bill was tilted too much toward boosting corporations. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday said a Republican bill offered by Mr. McConnell several days ago was a “non-starter.” House Democrats had countered with their own $2.5 trillion package. “This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,” said Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action.” Mr. Schumer said Democrats managed to wring concessions that included additional money for hospitals, strengthened unemployment benefits and additional oversight on “corporate bailouts.” Democrats had objected to a $500 billion loan fund that would boost corporations, likening it to a “slush fund” and saying it gave Treasury too much discretion to shield details. Mr. Schumer said Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts helped craft oversight provisions on that front. There’s expected to be an inspector general and oversight board akin to what happened with the 2008 bank bailouts. “The bottom line there is that we will know very shortly after any contract with the Fed or with the Treasury is signed with a company, any loan is made, we will have full details of the loan document,” Mr. Schumer said. “It’ll be published very, very shortly afterwards.” It’s unclear how quickly the House will be able to move on the package, as members are currently on recess. Leaders have talked about the possibility of pushing it through via unanimous consent given the urgency of the situation, but objections from just one member could thwart those plans. Rep. Justin Amash, an independent from Michigan who left the GOP last year, said the package was a “raw deal for the people.” “It does far too little for those who need the most help, while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, massively growing government, inhibiting economic adaptation, and widening the gap between the rich and the poor,” Mr. Amash said on Twitter.

"Sen. Tom Cotton on Wednesday predicted swift passage of a $2 trillion legislative package designed to mitigate some of the negative economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak. “I really want to say to workers and businesses all across the country: Just hang on there for a few more days,” the Arkansas Republican said on “Fox & Friends.” “Help is on the way as soon as this bill passes. I suspect it’ll pass the Senate later today and maybe be signed by the president as early as tomorrow.” Congressional leaders early Wednesday announced a deal on the economic rescue bill after days of haggling over the fine print. About $250 billion will go toward direct payments for individuals and families. It also includes $250 billion for unemployment insurance benefits, about $367 billion in loans to help small businesses make payroll and a $500 billion loan fund intended to help boost distressed corporations. It also includes $150 billion for a state and local coronavirus relief fund and $130 billion for hospitals. Mr. Cotton said that the deal “is not the bill that Nancy Pelosi proposed earlier this week with lots of extraneous measures.” House Democrats had offered their own $2.5 trillion package that also included provisions related to collective bargaining, climate change and election rules. The senator said the deal is akin to something Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans had proposed days earlier, only with more money for things like unemployment insurance, emergency medical equipment, cities, states and hospitals. Senate Democrats had blocked procedural action to move the process forward, protesting that the GOP was offering too much of a giveaway to big corporations. Mr. Cotton said he’s been hearing from business owners in his state the past several days about why Senate Democrats “dithered” with the package. “They were going to have to start laying off workers tomorrow, [because] they literally have no customers coming in the door, they have no cash with which to make payroll,” he said.

"The White House and Senate leaders of both parties have agreed on unprecedented emergency legislation to rush sweeping aid totaling some $2 trillion to businesses, workers and a health care system slammed by the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, India’s 1.3 billion people joined the global lockdown, and Prince Charles has tested positive for the new coronavirus. Here are some of AP’s top stories Wednesday on the world’s coronavirus pandemic. Follow APNews.com/VirusOutbreak for updates through the day and APNews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak for stories explaining some of its complexities. WHAT’S HAPPENING TODAY: - Trains carrying factory employees back to work after two months in locked-down cities rolled out of Hubei province, the center of China’s virus outbreak, as the government began lifting the last of the controls that confined tens of millions of people to their homes.  - A “cacophony of coughing” in packed emergency rooms. Beds squeezed in wherever there is space. Overworked, sleep-deprived doctors and nurses rationed to one face mask a day and wracked by worry about a dwindling number of available ventilators. Such is the reality inside New York City’s hospitals, which have become the war-zone-like epicenter of the nation’s coronavirus crisis. - Despite what you may have read in a text message or on social media, there are currently no plans for a national quarantine, let alone martial law.  Rumors of a military-enforced national lockdown have been debunked repeatedly by state and federal authorities who say their recurrence shows just how persistent false claims can be during an emergency, and why it’s vital to find reliable sources of information. - For most Americans, the idea of a shared national sacrifice is an abstraction. It’s a memory passed on from a grandparent or through a book or movie. Will America step up as it enters what one historian calls “a new moment”?  - The coronavirus is waging a war of attrition against health care workers throughout the world, but nowhere is it winning more battles at the moment than in Italy and in Spain, where protective equipment and tests have been in severely short supply for weeks. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover. Here are the symptoms of  the virus compared with the common flu.  One of the best ways to prevent spread of the virus is washing your hands with soap and water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends first washing with warm or cold water and then lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under fingernails before rinsing off. You should wash your phone, too. Here’s how.

The donations will focus on Broadway workers, as well as workers in Las Vegas and in the music industry. Jackson’s estate announced Wednesday that it will give $100,000 apiece to Broadway Cares, Three Square food bank in Nevada and the Recording Academy’s MusiCares. The estate’s co-executor John Branca tells The Associated Press the gifts are personal for the keepers of Jackson’s affairs and legacy and are in line with the singer’s charitable endeavors during his lifetime. ___ IN OTHER NEWS:                 PLAYING THROUGH: Many golf courses around the country have remained open during the coronavirus pandemic. The hope is that golf can provide an outlet for the stir crazy and a dose of normalcy. The question is whether recreational golf safe enough under the circumstances. Courses have barred touching the flagsticks and turned the hole cups upside down so golfers don’t need reach in to retrieve the ball. ___ Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  ",What you need to know today about the virus outbreak,"Wednesday, March 25, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/25/what-you-need-to-know-today-about-the-virus-outbre/,washington_times

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday an emerging $2 trillion economic rescue package on Capitol Hill would be “terrible” for his state. “It would really be terrible for the state of New York,” Mr. Cuomo said at his daily briefing on the COVID-19 outbreak in his state. He said that under the deal, the state would get $3.8 billion and New York City would get $1.3 billion. “That is a drop in the bucket as to need,” he said. Mr. Cuomo said he spoke to the state’s congressional delegation Wednesday morning and that he wants something closer to House Democrats’ ante, which he said provided $17 billion to New York state. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, has touted additional money and concessions his party managed to win in the past few days after Senate Democrats blocked procedural action on the package. New York has been the hardest-hit U.S. state in the expanding coronavirus pandemic, with more than 30,800 positive coronavirus cases as of Wednesday morning. Members of the White House coronavirus task force had said Tuesday that people who recently left New York City should self-quarantine for two weeks. Mr. Cuomo said projected hospitalizations are still outpacing capacity, but that there is some evidence that some of the state’s density control measures could be helping slow the rate of hospitalizations. Mr. Cuomo said New York City will start closing some streets to cars so pedestrians have more room to practice social distancing.

"The Koch Network is attacking Turning Point USA over how the pro-Trump campus group is asking members to expose indoctrination in the classroom. The spat between the Koch Network and Mr. Kirk’s group is indicative of a larger competition about how the political right can advance its causes and values on college campuses. The libertarian-leaning Charles Koch Foundation has long-funded efforts promoting academic freedom on college campuses, while Turning Point USA’s mission is to “build the most organized, active, and powerful conservative grassroots activist network” on campuses nationwide according to its website. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk asked his following of conservatives on Sunday to record their professors’ digital classes to reveal the instructors’ agenda. “To all college students who have their professors switching to online classes: Please share any and ALL videos of blatant indoctrination with @TPUSA at TPUSA.com/ContactUs,” Mr. Kirk tweeted. “Now is the time to document & expose the radicalism that has been infecting our schools. Transparency!” Mr. Kirk’s tweet drew criticism from academics online. On Tuesday, the Charles Koch Foundation lambasted Turning Point USA’s conduct as “calling for its members to adopt intimidation tactics against faculty.” “Inciting harassment against scholars isn’t just wrong at a time when many are seeking out new ways to engage their students during a crisis, it’s always wrong,” said Charlie Ruger, Charles Koch Foundation vice president of philanthropy, in a statement. “Targeting, intimidating, and otherwise attempting to silence academics chills the open exchange of ideas and, in turn, chokes off progress.” The Charles Koch Foundation and Turning Point USA have taken vastly different approaches to their campus-focused work. Mr. Ruger said that his group remains proud to work with professors and universities that “demonstrate steadfast commitment to expanding students’ access to a diversity of ideas, now and in the future.” Mr. Kirk’s group is focused on an insurgent audience of students. Mr. Kirk formed Turning Point USA in 2012 and the group’s website said it is on more than 1,500 campuses at high schools and colleges across the country. Mr. Kirk responded to the Koch Network via Twitter on Wednesday, criticizing the foundation’s decision to make the dispute public. “Very disappointed by the dishonest & baseless attack by the Koch foundation,” Mr. Kirk tweeted. “I asked students to share blatant anti-America online lectures by professors to increase transparency. Instead of contacting us privately they publicly attack our amazing students.” The larger fault lines on the political right revealed by the Koch Network’s spat with Turning Point USA look likely to grow in the coming months.

"IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - The staff adviser to Iowa State University’s student government has resigned and received a $47,000 severance payout after student activists demanded his firing over an old Instagram post showing him in blackface. Alex Krumm and university President Wendy Wintersteen agreed that his employment was no longer “in their best interests” and he left the payroll March 1, a separation agreement shows. His departure came days after administrators met with a group called Students Against Racism to discuss its demand for Krumm’s termination and other changes. Krumm served only nine months in his position, which involves advising dozens of elected and appointed student leaders on everything from leadership strategies to financial management. Krumm came under fire for an Instagram post from 2015, four years before he started at Iowa State. The post showed Krumm with his face painted black from years earlier when he played a mime in a student production at Wartburg College in Waverly. “#ThrowbackSunday,” he wrote. The 2009 Wartburg College yearbook shows Krumm and other students with their faces painted several different colors in a production called the Wartburg Mime. The play used mimes to act out “stories from the bible, many centering around the life of Jesus,” the yearbook says. Krumm deleted the post but not before others had saved the image. The photo was published by the student newspaper in October, just as student activists were pushing the administration to respond aggressively to campus incidents of racism and white supremacy. Students descended on Wintersteen’s office in November demanding a zero-tolerance policy toward racism. Among its list of demands, Students Against Racism requested Krumm’s firing and a pledge by the administration to terminate all employees who engage in racist behavior in the future. In a statement, the university condemned the photo and indicated it was investigating Krumm’s intent. “We understand how hurtful and disturbing this image is,” the statement said. “We are still examining the circumstances and context surrounding this incident in order to make an informed decision. Further updates will be provided to Student Government in the future.” Krumm, 32, didn’t reply to messages seeking comment. The separation agreement bars him from publicly discussing his resignation or disparaging any Iowa State employees or students. Several politicians have apologized in recent years after photos surfaced showing they darkened their skin with makeup. Critics say the images are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. Students Against Racism members met with administrators again on Feb. 18. Krumm’s separation agreement shows that he was on paid leave during the last week of February and resigned March 1. The university agreed to write Krumm a check for $47,000, provide him a letter of reference and one year of “outplacement assistance” to help him land a new job. Krumm agreed not to sue the university and to never re-apply for work there. Both sides agreed not to engage in “any conduct or communications” that would disparage one another. Wintersteen signed the agreement, which was recently posted online by the Board of Regents as required by a 2014 executive order. The order outlawed any “confidentiality provision that attempts to prevent disclosure of the agreement itself.” Krumm’s settlement notes that it’s a public record that would be posted online. But it has a confidentiality clause that says both sides will not “disclose or discuss the details of this agreement, the discussions leading to this agreement or” related information. University spokeswoman Angela Hunt declined to comment on the agreement, the second unusual separation deal  signed by Wintersteen in recent weeks. The university is paying former admissions official Consuela Cooper to stay home until she finds a new job or June 15, whichever comes first.

"Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on Wednesday touted a number of concessions Democrats won in the $2 trillion economic rescue package by holding out, including more unemployment insurance, more money for hospitals and additional oversight of where loans for corporations would go. Mr. Schumer said in a letter to his Democratic colleagues that their unity “strengthened their hand” and that the public is benefiting “from Senate Democrats’ resolve in fighting to put workers first.” Not so fast, according to Republicans, who say Mr. Schumer is taking credit for provisions that were GOP ideas or received little opposition. “To sum up, Senator Schumer delayed lifesaving aid to medical professionals and significant relief for families and small businesses in order to claim credit for wins that are either bipartisan or Republican ideas,” said a senior GOP aide. The aide said Senate Republicans never objected to additional oversight of a $500 billion “stabilization fund” to help prop up distressed corporations that Democrats had likened to a slush fund, but rather Democrats wanted to go further and get additional powers to oversee the Trump administration’s response to COVID-19. Mr. Schumer also touted a $150 billion “Marshall Plan” for the country’s health system, which included a $55 billion boost, but the aide said there was never opposition to increasing funds for hospitals. The senator has also touted securing unemployment insurance “on steroids,” but the aide said Senate Republicans had included three months of benefits in their package and didn’t oppose including a fourth. Senate Democrats had blocked procedural action on a legislative package, saying the GOP vision was tilted too heavily toward boosting corporations. But Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, said the $2 trillion deal is similar to what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell laid out a few days ago, with some additional funds for unemployment benefits, hospitals, and medical equipment. “So the bill will be very similar to what we proposed a few days ago, but with some more money that is regrettably going to be necessary to respond to this crisis and help keep our people safe and ultimately get our economy back on its feet,” Mr. Cotton said on “Fox & Friends.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that Democrats would have to take a closer look at the final agreement and that it fell short of their own $2.5 trillion ante. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” said Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her troops won’t vote on the $2 trillion economic rescue package on Wednesday, Democrats said. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told lawmakers that he will give all House members 24 hours’ notice before holding a vote on the package. That means the earliest the House could vote is Thursday afternoon. As the Senate was racing to complete the package, the House gaveled in for a pro forma session on Wednesday morning and gaveled out less than three minutes later. The House adjourned until 11 a.m. Thursday. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, criticized Democrats for delays in getting the measure completed and approved. “Every one of our fellow citizens has been touched by this public health emergency, anxious about sickness and unprecedented economic uncertainty,” he said. “Our hospitals and healthcare workers are nearing their capacity. They need - and expect - their government to act. This agreement to provide relief to American workers, families, and small businesses is critically important - and should be considered without delay. Mr. McCarthy said “we are already behind.” “For the past three days, Democrat leadership in Congress took their eye off the ball, delaying consideration of this bipartisan-crafted bill,” he said. “They insisted on using this crisis as an opportunity to propose completely unrelated legislation that amounted to an ideological wish list.Our country is on the edge, but we must be in this fight together.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - Pressure was mounting on the Trump administration Wednesday to release people from immigration detention facilities where at least one detainee has tested positive for COVID-19 and advocates fear tight quarters and overall conditions could cause rapid spread of the virus. The U.S. holds around 37,000 people in immigration detention. Detainees and advocates say many are vulnerable because of age and pre-existing medical conditions, and because they are often held in open rooms, beds 3-feet apart, and without adequate supplies of masks or other protections. “It’s impossible to stay calm,” said Marco Battistotti, an Italian who is among 170 people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Bristol County jail in Massachusetts. “People are panicking. People are in fear.”  The 54-year-old Battistotti was among about 100 detainees at the county jail near Cape Cod who signed a letter released by a local immigration lawyer detailing conditions inside. They asked to be released to await decisions on their immigration cases.  “I don’t want to die in an ICE jail,” he said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. “Why can’t I fight my case on the outside?” The agency, which reported the positive test of a 31-year-old man from Mexico held in Bergen County, New Jersey, on Tuesday, has announced steps to protect detained migrants and staff from the virus, but hasn’t said whether it plans to review cases for possible release because of the outbreak. It did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the complaints about conditions from the detainees and their advocates.  The administration has tried to balance its overall hard line on immigration, a signature policy of President Donald Trump, and its response to the outbreak, with ICE announcing previously that it would “temporarily adjust” operations to focus on apprehending people who pose a risk to public safety or are subject to mandatory detention because of a criminal record. Immigrant advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are filing lawsuits in California, Maryland, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, seeking court orders for the immediate release of people in immigration detention, especially those at risk because of their age or medical conditions.  It’s unclear how many detainees overall are at higher risk, but one California suit alone had 13 plaintiffs, all over 55.  A panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Monday, citing the “rapidly escalating public health crisis,” ordered the immediate release of a 37-year-old woman who is fighting deportation to Mexico. The woman’s lawyer, Max Carter-Oberstone, said the government told him it would not oppose the decision, which the court took on its own initiative in a rare move on behalf of a woman who he says has been threatened with death by members of a Mexican drug cartel.  “It wasn’t something we asked for or were expecting,” Carter-Oberstone said. “The court is clearly reacting to the greater public health crisis that we’re in right now and re-evaluating how it’s going to dispose of its immigration cases in light of that crisis that we’re all experiencing.”  The situation in immigration detention, which include facilities run by local jurisdictions and private contractors, is similar to that facing jails and prisons, with staff also at risk from a virus that already has sickened at least 55,000 people and killed about 800 in the U.S.  One difference is that more than half of ICE detainees have no criminal charges or conviction and are held only for immigration reasons. Under previous administrations, many would likely have been released on bond as they pursued their cases. ICE has reported one positive test of an employee at a detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and 18 confirmed cases among staff not involved in detaining migrants. A contractor reported a positive case of a staff member at a facility in Harris County, Texas. The agency says it is screening new detainees and isolating detainees who show symptoms of the coronavirus disease. Detainees say those measures won’t do much, with people staying in dorm-like bays with no social distancing possible or in smaller rooms that they sometimes have to clean themselves, with insufficient cleaning supplies. Francisca Morales Diaz, a 45-year-old from Mexico who was released Friday from an ICE detention center in Louisiana, said she and others were issued soap and toilet paper for their own use once a week and they would run out. When they complained, she says they were told there were shortages on the outside as well.  “There isn’t enough medicine. It’s not well-maintained,” Morales told AP. Her fear is that “at any moment, they’re going to come and take me back there.” Ira Alkalay, a lawyer representing some of the detainees at the jail near Cape Cod, said the detainees are responsible for cleaning their unit, which includes a dining area and bathrooms, but aren’t even given bleach. Some who signed the letter suffer from respiratory ailments such as tuberculosis, emphysema and asthma that put them at higher risk to the virus.  “These are not sanitary conditions at all,” Alkalay said. “If the virus is introduced, many people could get sick all at once. Hospitals in the area can become quickly overwhelmed.”  The office of Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson, who has made headlines for offering to send the jail’s ICE detainees to help build Trump’s promised border wall, has stressed there are currently no confirmed or suspected cases of the virus at the facility. “We suspect these detainees are working with outside political activist groups to use the coronavirus crisis to advance their political agenda,” the sheriff’s spokesman, Jonathan Darling, said this week.  Eunice Cho, an ACLU lawyer, said the confined spaces and limited medical treatment in many immigration jails made them especially vulnerable - and if the virus spreads through one facility, the number of sick people who would require advanced care could overwhelm area hospitals. Many ICE jails are in rural areas with smaller hospitals. “This is closely related to the public health of our entire community,” Cho said.  ________________________________ Marcelo reported from Boston.

"The Justice Department could prosecute people who intentionally spread the coronavirus under federal terrorism laws, according to a memo issued late Tuesday. In a memo to Justice Department officials and U.S. Attorneys across the country, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen urged prosecutors to crack down on all coronavirus-related crimes, including intentionally infecting others. “Because coronavirus appears to meet the statutory definition of a ‘biological agent’ … such acts could implicate the nation’s terrorism-related statutes,” Mr. Rosen wrote. “Threats or attempts to use COVID-19 as a weapon could potentially implicate the nation’s terrorism-related statutes.” “Threats or attempts to COVID-19 as a weapon against Americans will not be tolerated,” he continued. The memo also asks prosecutors to take a tough stance on other crimes related to the pandemic, including price gouging, scams and the sale of fake drugs. So far, no individuals have been publicly charged with intentionally spreading the coronavirus. A handful of people around the nation face local charges for falsely claiming they have the virus.

"IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - The staff adviser to Iowa State University’s student government has resigned and received a $47,000 severance payout after student activists demanded his firing over an old Instagram post showing him in blackface. Alex Krumm and university President Wendy Wintersteen agreed that his employment was no longer “in their best interests” and he left the payroll March 1, a separation agreement shows.  His departure came days after administrators met with a group called Students Against Racism to discuss its demand for Krumm’s termination and other changes. Krumm served only nine months in his position, which involves advising dozens of elected and appointed student leaders on everything from leadership strategies to financial management. The severance payment of $47,000 amounts to roughly one year of his annual salary. Krumm came under fire for an Instagram post from 2015, four years before he started at Iowa State. The post showed Krumm with his face painted black from years earlier when he played a mime in a student production at Wartburg College in Waverly. “#ThrowbackSunday,” he wrote. The 2009 Wartburg College yearbook shows Krumm and other students with their faces painted several different colors in a production called the Wartburg Mime. The play used mimes to act out “stories from the bible, many centering around the life of Jesus,” the yearbook says. Krumm deleted the post but not before others had saved the image. The photo was published by the student newspaper in October, just as student activists were pushing the administration to respond aggressively to campus incidents of racism and white supremacy. Students descended on Wintersteen’s office in November demanding a zero-tolerance policy toward racism. Among its list of demands, Students Against Racism requested Krumm’s firing and a pledge by the administration to terminate all employees who engage in racist behavior in the future. In a statement, the university condemned the photo and indicated it was investigating Krumm’s intent. “We understand how hurtful and disturbing this image is,” the statement said. “We are still examining the circumstances and context surrounding this incident in order to make an informed decision. Further updates will be provided to Student Government in the future.” Krumm, 32, didn’t reply to messages seeking comment. The separation agreement bars him from publicly discussing his resignation or disparaging any Iowa State employees or students. Several politicians have apologized in recent years after photos surfaced showing they darkened their skin with makeup. Critics say the images are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. Students Against Racism members met with administrators again on Feb. 18. Krumm’s separation agreement shows that he was on paid leave during the last week of February and resigned March 1. The university agreed to write Krumm the $47,000 check, provide him a letter of reference and one year of “outplacement assistance” to help him land a new job. Krumm agreed not to sue the university and to never re-apply for work there. Both sides agreed not to engage in “any conduct or communications” that would disparage one another. Wintersteen signed the agreement, which was recently posted online by the Board of Regents as required by a 2014 executive order. The order outlawed any “confidentiality provision that attempts to prevent disclosure of the agreement itself.” Krumm’s settlement notes that it’s a public record that would be posted online. But it has a confidentiality clause that says both sides will not “disclose or discuss the details of this agreement, the discussions leading to this agreement or” related information. University spokeswoman Angela Hunt declined to comment on the agreement, the second unusual separation deal  signed by Wintersteen in recent weeks. The university is paying former admissions official Consuela Cooper to stay home until she finds a new job or June 15, whichever comes first.

"Four Senate Republicans opposed a speedy passage to the $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package Wednesday, warning a “massive drafting error” in the bill could incentivize workers leaving their jobs. Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Rick Scott of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina argued that, as written, the bolstered unemployment program could provide more money than some workers earn in their paychecks. “We cannot encourage people to make more money in unemployment than they do with employment,” Tim Scott said. The $2 trillion deal includes $250 billion in a robust unemployment program — providing $600 per week, on top of additional gig-worker benefits, for four months. “I just can’t imagine the effect in South Carolina and other places when you realize you’re getting $24 an hour on unemployment. So every employer in the state has to compete against a $24-an-hour minimum wage,” Mr. Graham said. “The most responsible thing is to fix this now.” The unemployment program was one of Democrats’ top priorities in the five-day negotiation process. The senators said they were hopeful the Senate would accept an amendment to adjust the language so unemployment benefits are capped at 100% of a worker’s paycheck. However, they would not say if they would force the bill to go through all of the Senate’s procedural votes if their amendment vote is not accepted. “We’re not trying to talk process right now,” Mr. Sasse said. The Senate is set to vote on the package Wednesday, but a final version of the bill’s text as not been publicly released. Conservative economist Stephen Moore said President Trump should veto the measure if the problem isn’t fixed. “It’s worth vetoing this bill just to get that out of the bill,” Mr. Moore told The Washington Times. You’re talking about dramatically inhibiting the recovery, which is what we really should be looking for two, three, four months from now — making sure the economy’s really booming. You’re not going to have a boom in the economy if you’re paying people not to work.” Mr. Moore said congressional Republicans shouldn’t have agreed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s demand for four months of expanded unemployment insurance. “It’s crazy. Republicans wanted two months, and they caved in to Pelosi and gave her four,” he said. “And people say, ‘Well, what if the crises aren’t over in two months?’ Well, then you just extend it by a month, but you don’t bake it into the cake.” • Dave Boyer contributed to this report.

"Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on Wednesday touted a number of concessions Democrats won in the $2 trillion economic rescue package by holding out, including more unemployment insurance, more money for hospitals and additional oversight of where loans for corporations would go. Mr. Schumer said in a letter to his Democratic colleagues that their unity “strengthened their hand” and that the public is benefiting “from Senate Democrats’ resolve in fighting to put workers first.” Not so fast, according to Republicans, who say Mr. Schumer is taking credit for provisions that were GOP ideas or received little opposition. “To sum up, Senator Schumer delayed lifesaving aid to medical professionals and significant relief for families and small businesses in order to claim credit for wins that are either bipartisan or Republican ideas,” said a senior GOP aide. The aide said Senate Republicans never objected to additional oversight of a $500 billion “stabilization fund” to help prop up distressed corporations that Democrats had likened to a slush fund, but rather Democrats wanted to go further and get additional powers to oversee the Trump administration’s response to COVID-19. Mr. Schumer also touted a $150 billion “Marshall Plan” for the country’s health system, which included a $55 billion boost, but the aide said there was never opposition to increasing funds for hospitals. The senator has also touted securing unemployment insurance “on steroids,” but the aide said Senate Republicans had included three months of benefits in their package and didn’t oppose including a fourth. Senate Democrats had blocked procedural action on a legislative package, saying the GOP vision was tilted too heavily toward boosting corporations. But Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, said the $2 trillion deal is similar to what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell laid out a few days ago, with some additional funds for unemployment benefits, hospitals, and medical equipment. “So the bill will be very similar to what we proposed a few days ago, but with some more money that is regrettably going to be necessary to respond to this crisis and help keep our people safe and ultimately get our economy back on its feet,” Mr. Cotton said on “Fox & Friends.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that Democrats would have to take a closer look at the final agreement and that it fell short of their own $2.5 trillion ante. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” said Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her troops won’t vote on the $2 trillion economic rescue package on Wednesday, Democrats said. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told lawmakers that he will give all House members 24 hours’ notice before holding a vote on the package. That means the earliest the House could vote is Thursday afternoon. As the Senate was racing to complete the package, the House gaveled in for a pro forma session on Wednesday morning and gaveled out less than three minutes later. The House adjourned until 11 a.m. Thursday. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, criticized Democrats for delays in getting the measure completed and approved. “Every one of our fellow citizens has been touched by this public health emergency, anxious about sickness and unprecedented economic uncertainty,” he said. “Our hospitals and healthcare workers are nearing their capacity. They need - and expect - their government to act. This agreement to provide relief to American workers, families, and small businesses is critically important - and should be considered without delay. Mr. McCarthy said “we are already behind.” “For the past three days, Democrat leadership in Congress took their eye off the ball, delaying consideration of this bipartisan-crafted bill,” he said. “They insisted on using this crisis as an opportunity to propose completely unrelated legislation that amounted to an ideological wish list.Our country is on the edge, but we must be in this fight together.  It’s time for Washington to start acting that way, and send this bill to the president.”  ",Pelosi won’t hold vote on $2 trillion rescue plan until Thursday afternoon at earliest ,"Wednesday, March 25, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/25/house-wont-vote-2-trillion-rescue-plan-until-thurs/,washington_times
"Recent editorials from West Virginia newspapers: ___ March 25 The Bluefield Daily Telegraph on Gov. Jim Justice’s “stay at home” order: It’s now official. Governor Jim Justice has issued a “Stay at Home” order for the Mountain State. The order, which is designed to further combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus, directs all West Virginia residents to stay at home and to limit their movements outside of their homes beyond essential needs. The new rule took effect at 8 p.m. on March 24, and will remain in effect until further notice. Area residents, particularly those young people who are still congregating in large groups, need to take this order seriously. Now is not the time for horseplay and youthful disobedience. With the Stay at Home order in place, West Virginians can still: - Go to the grocery, convenience, or warehouse store. - Go to the pharmacy to pick up medications and other healthcare necessities. - Go to medical appointments (but check with your doctor or provider first). - Go to a restaurant for take-out, delivery or drive-thru. - Care for or support a friend or family member. - Take a walk, ride your bike, hike, jog, and be in nature for exercise – just keep at least six feet between you and others. - Help someone to get necessary supplies. However, the order states that West Virginians should not: - Go to work unless you are providing essential services or work for an essential business as defined by the order. - Visit friends and family if there is no urgent need. - Maintain less than six feet of distance from others when you go out. - Visit loved ones in the hospital, nursing home, skilled nursing facility, or other. Neighboring Virginia has not yet issued a “Stay at Home” order, but the same rules generally apply. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has already canceled school for the remainder of the school year, and has ordered the closure of certain non-essential businesses, including theaters, performing arts centers, museums, indoor entertainment centers, fitness centers, gymnasiums, beauty salons and barber shops . Virginia also is banning gatherings of 10 people or more. This does not include gatherings that involve the provision of health care or medical services, access to essential services for low-income residents, such as food banks; operations of the media; law enforcement agencies; or operations of government. All area residents - young people in particular - are expected to follow these new rules. If we are to overcome this unprecedented threat to public health, we must all practice social distancing. And we should try to stay at home, unless it is absolutely necessary to venture out to purchase essential supplies, like food and medicine. We must be willing to make personal sacrifices now to ensure the health of our family, friends and neighbors. Online: https://www.bdtonline.com ___ March 24 The Martinsburg Journal on ethics laws and recent allegations of insider trading by U.S. senators:  Millions of dollars in stock transactions on behalf of five U.S. senators have raised serious questions about their ethics - and whether they broke laws against insider trading. Clearly, the matter needs to be investigated, but not as a witch hunt with the preconceived notion that someone must be guilty of wrongdoing. If the senators did what they are being accused by some of doing - using information about COVID-19 they received because of their positions to profit or avoid stock market losses - the very minimum punishment ought to be removal from office. Much preferred would be prosecution. And if these five in the U.S. Senate engaged in insider trading, it has to be supposed there are others in government, perhaps in both the legislative and executive branches, who did the same thing. That, too, needs to be investigated as soon as possible. Details of the five situations vary greatly. They involve Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C.; Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; James Inhofe, R-Okla.; Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga.; and David Perdue, R-Ga. Burr and Loeffler were the first to be accused after reporters examined Senate financial reports. They found that Burr sold as much as $1.7 million in stocks in late January and mid-February - just before stock markets around the world began steep dives. Burr insists he made decisions based solely on “public news reports.” Loeffler tells a different story, that she has no involvement in how investments on behalf of her and her husband are handled. They are “made by multiple third-party advisers without my or my husband’s knowledge or involvement,” she insisted in a statement released via Twitter. Inhofe and Perdue have made similar statements. Feinstein says her husband makes investment decisions, in which she takes no part. Where it can be proven lawmakers had nothing to do with stock market decisions, they are blameless. But where they and/or family members handle investments, timing is everything. If beneficial stock sales or purchases were made before there was public knowledge of what the senators knew, there may well be culpability. Again, if that is established, the lawmakers - and any others who engaged in insider trading - must be punished. Online: https://www.journal-news.net ___ March 23 The Gazette-Mail on Gov. Jim Justice’s recent address to state citizens: These are unprecedented times, and leaders are going to process information and handle the situation surrounding the coronavirus differently. Gov. Jim Justice probably had good intentions when he addressed the state on March 21. He was trying to emphasize adhering to safety guidelines from health experts concerning the coronavirus, and implying more drastic measures would be taken if those guidelines weren’t followed. We think. Justice ended a press conference on March 20 saying he wouldn’t be appearing over the weekend unless there were major developments to discuss. Naturally, many were then alarmed when the governor announced he would be speaking at 7 p.m. the next day. There was no major announcement or update. Just a stream of consciousness delivery from the governor, with asides like one insisting if he didn’t appear on television, thousands of lives would be lost, or references to New York state not acting quickly enough to lock itself down - something Justice wasn’t recommending for West Virginia, but had decided to do by March 23. Justice’s off-the-cuff style has worked for him before, but it’s not the best strategy here. March 21’s ramble did little to assuage any fears about the pandemic. He attempted to explain his reasons for the address during a much more organized, informative news conference March 23, but didn’t offer real clarity. West Virginians shouldn’t be fearful, but they should be concerned. They should follow the guidelines from health professionals (staying home as much as possible, frequent hand washing and staying away from large gatherings of more than 10 people, etc.), which is something Justice reiterated on March 21. No one should panic. But the governor appearing on television - after prefacing he would only do so if there were major developments - then engaging in word salad certainly, if not intentionally, seemed to veer toward inciting panic. That isn’t the calm hand of leadership that is needed. It’s apparent the governor thought he needed to say something - and there’s nothing wrong with that, if there is something to say. Justice talks about being a leader - how, in fact, he wants to be a “coach” for the state of West Virginia. But there’s talking about it and actually doing it. An event like the COVID-19 outbreak is a time for leaders to rise and take the helm. The governor seems overwhelmed. He should take the time to assess what needs to be said and when. The difference was all that more apparent on March 23, when there was new information to impart.

"Recent editorials from Georgia newspapers:  ___ March 22 The Augusta Chronicle on finding new ways to worship: Thankfully, America’s freedom of religion allows people not only to worship how they choose, but to choose not to worship. Amid coronavirus concerns, it’s easy to do either one. On March 18, a Connecticut man who died after being diagnosed with COVID-19 was given the sacrament of last rites. Mindful of “social distancing” during the epidemic, a priest delivered the rites over the phone as the man’s family listened from quarantine. Even religion is finding creative workarounds as coronavirus spreads. Worship in Augusta has taken on a completely different look amid precautions for COVID-19. With authorities cautioning to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people, area churches at 11 a.m. Sunday looked more like they do at 3 a.m. on a Tuesday. But many places of worship were prepared. Worshippers with Internet connections will benefit most. Churches have been broadcasting religious services on radio and television for years, including in Augusta. But with the rise several years ago of online video and livestreaming, worship access over the Internet became an interesting alternative. Now it’s a necessity. If there is an upside to be found, it’s that online broadcasts give people an opportunity to “visit” other houses of worship they might have been curious about. So if you’ve never dropped into Reid Memorial Presbyterian, or Trinity on the Hill United Methodist, or Beulah Grove Baptist, fire up your laptop - now’s your chance. You can even stay in pajamas instead of putting on your Sunday best. The Church of the Holy Comforter in Evans provided on its website a bulletin outlining the service. “This particular service of Morning Prayer has been set for use by nonordained persons (lay persons) and congregants to say either alone or together,” its instructions read. On its Facebook page, the Islamic Society of Augusta Community Center posted a video “Sunday school intro” to virtual classes. St. Teresa of Avila Catholic Church in Grovetown broadcast its Mass on Saturday afternoon. Priests and deacons conducted formal rites of worship as if parishioners filled the empty pews. Other churches’ videos showed empty pews, too. But for Catholics, attending Mass is a moral obligation that is literally considered sinful to miss. The bishop of the Diocese of Savannah, which includes the Augusta area’s Catholic churches, suspended all public Masses. That underscores the world’s current grave situation. Spiritual leaders are watching for any changes that might affect how their flocks worship. Rabbi David Sirull told The Augusta Chronicle more than a week ago that he and his congregation are “just going to take this thing one day at a time. The scenario changes every five minutes.” That was a lot of minutes ago.  Even in virus-induced isolation, we encourage everyone to find more ways to stay connected to others you care about. Full relief could be far, far away. Online: https://www.augustachronicle.com ___ March 21 The Savannah Morning News on legislators’ stock transactions before the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.: American Express has long reminded us “membership has its privileges.” When it comes to the world’s most exclusive club, the privileges that come with membership in the United States Senate appear to have been grossly abused. Several senators, including both of our own here in Georgia, made fortuitously timed stock transactions in the time between a late-January briefing to Senate members on the threat posed by the coronavirus and the sharp stock market declines that began in late February. Trades by Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Georgia’s own Sen. Kelly Loeffler have drawn the greatest scrutiny. However, the financial actions of others, including Georgia Sen. David Perdue as well as California Sen. Diane Feinstein and Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, are also being questioned. Sen. Burr made 33 transactions on Feb. 13, unloading a significant percentage of his stock holdings. As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Burr has on-demand classified access to threats to America’s security and receives regular briefings from intelligence agencies. Sen. Burr’s initial response to questions about his financial activities leaves more questions than answers. A spokesperson cited Burr’s concern for the “steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy.” As for Sen. Loeffler, she made 29 transactions in the three weeks following the Senate briefing, including several the day of the closed-door meeting. Of those 29 trades, 27 were sales. One of her two buys was Citrix, a tech developer that specializes in teleworking software used by remote and work-from-home employees. Loeffler has denied violating Senate rules regarding insider information. Financial advisers make stock decisions on her behalf, she said, and she labeled reports as a “ridiculous and baseless attack.” This situation calls for closer examination. Financial advisers make their livelihoods on their ability to anticipate shifts in the markets, and this could prove to be a circumstance free of wrongdoing. This could be coincidence, but it would be irresponsible to just assume as much and not investigate. Sen. Burr has called on the Senate Ethics Committee to review his actions, but an investigation by his peers in a highly partisan climate is not enough. The Justice Department and watchdog agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission should get involved. INVALUABLE PREPARATION TIME LOST As troubling as the senators’ potentially illicit profiteering is, another disturbing point revolves around the Senate briefing itself. The closed-door meeting was open to all senators, regardless of party affiliation, and addressed coronavirus transmission rates. Specifics remain unknown, but the assessment and follow-up information clearly captured Sen. Burr’s attention, as evidenced by his words as well as his market activities. He told a small gathering of his constituents the following in February. “There’s one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything we have seen in recent history,” Burr said, according to a recording obtained by National Public Radio. “It’s probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.” Such a proclamation is chilling, especially now with the spiraling COVID-19 crisis. Why didn’t senators — Democrats and Republicans — and Trump administration officials sound the alarm sooner? Instead of rising to the call, our public servants played politics. Consider these Twitter posts from Sen. Loeffler, the first on Feb. 28 and the second on March 10: “Democrats have dangerously and intentionally misled the American people on Coronavirus readiness” and “Concerned about the #coronavirus? Remember this: The consumer is strong, the economy is strong & jobs are growing, which puts us in the best economic position to tackle #COVID19 & keep Americans safe.” Perhaps much like her stock market trades, Loeffler doesn’t manage her Twitter account either. The real shamefulness in our elected officials’ living in coronavirus denial — at least publicly — is we lost weeks of preparation time. Those hours and days were invaluable given the ongoing dearth of test kits and the looming shortage of medical supplies. Polls routinely show the immense distrust Americans hold for the Senate and the House. The most recent Gallup numbers put Congress’ job approval rating at just 23%. Expect that percentage to probe new lows in the weeks ahead. And for good reason. Online: https://www.savannahnow.com ___ March 21 The Valdosta Daily Times on avoiding price gouging: It is egregious that anyone would try to profiteer off of the COVID-19, coronavirus, pandemic. This is a national heath emergency and still there are unscrupulous people gouging consumers. Price-gouging laws were activated when Gov. Brian Kemp signed a State of Emergency declaration. Attorney General Chris Carr said, “Those who commit price gouging during this pandemic are not only being exploitive, they are interfering with consumers’ ability to obtain products that could help protect them from becoming ill or spreading the virus. Our office will not tolerate this and will hold them accountable.” Basically, the law says that as long as Georgia remains in the State of Emergency, businesses may not charge more for products and services identified by the state than they charged before the declaration of the state of emergency, unless the increased prices accurately reflect an increase in the cost of new stock or the cost to transport it, plus the retailer’s average markup percentage applied during the 10 days immediately prior to the declaration of the state of emergency. Violators of the price-gouging laws can be fined up to $5,000 per violation. We want to share the attorney general’s advice to help protect our readers from coronavirus-related scams. Here are Carr’s recommendations: - Watch out for emails claiming to be from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or experts saying they have information about the virus. For the most up-to-date information about the coronavirus, visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Georgia Department of Public Health and World Health Organization. - Don’t click on links from sources you don’t know. It could download a virus onto your computer or device. Make sure the anti-malware and anti-virus software on your computer is up-to-date. - Ignore online offers for vaccinations. If you see ads touting prevention, treatment or cure claims for the coronavirus, ask yourself: if there’s been a medical breakthrough, would you be hearing about it for the first time through an ad or sales pitch? - Do your homework when it comes to donations, whether through charities or crowdfunding sites. Don’t let anyone rush you into making a donation. If someone wants donations in cash, by gift card, or by wiring money, don’t do it. - Be alert to “investment opportunities.” The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is warning people about online promotions, including on social media, claiming that the products or services of publicly traded companies can prevent, detect, or cure Coronavirus and that the stock of these companies will dramatically increase in value as a result. We encourage our readers to report suspected violations of the price-gouging statute by calling 1-800-869-1123 or complete the online complaint form on the Consumer Protection Division’s website at consumer.ga.gov.

"Even in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak, political vandalism isn’t taking a breather. An Oregon landowner said vandals did about $1,000 worth of damage when they spray-painted a large campaign sign for Jimmy Crumpacker, a candidate for the Republican nomination for the House seat being vacated by retiring Rep. Greg Walden. The sign mounted on a fence said, “Crumpacker for Congress. Pro-Trump. Pro-Life. Pro-Gun.” “Ahhh - tolerance alive and well in Southern Oregon,” said Steven Richie of Ashland, Oregon, in a Facebook post. “Paint overspray all over new fence as well - $1000 plus damage estimate.”  Mr. Crumpacker said the vandalism, which occurred earlier this week, was “really disappointing but unfortunately not surprising.” “We saw vandalism like this happen repeatedly in 2016 to Donald Trump’s lawn signs all throughout the country,” he said. “I hope that this is an isolated incident and that folks with opposing viewpoints can find a better, more productive way of expressing themselves. We’re all better than this.” The landowner has filed a report with the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office, said a Crumpacker spokesman, but no arrests have been made. Mr. Crumpacker, 41, a commodities trader and seventh-generation Oregonian, is one of nearly a dozen Republicans running in the May 19 primary to represent the sprawling, rural Second Congressional District, which takes up the Eastern two-thirds of the state. Mr. Walden, 63, announced in October that he would not seek reelection after representing the district since 1999. Nearly a dozen Republicans and a half-dozen Democrats have entered the primary race to succeed him in a district rated by the Cook Political Report as “solid Republican.” Other Republicans seeking to succeed Mr. Walden include former state Rep. Knute Buehler, the 2018 nominee for governor, and former state Sens. Jason Atkinson and Cliff Bentz.

"Joseph R. Biden doesn’t sound interested in facing off against Sen. Bernard Sanders in another 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate. Mr. Sanders of Vermont and his team signaled this week that they are looking forward to debating Mr. Biden again next month, but the former vice president told reporters in a video conference Wednesday that he’s ready to move on. “My focus is just dealing with this [coronavirus] crisis right now,” Mr. Biden said. “I haven’t thought about any more debates. I think we have had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.” Mr. Biden was marching toward securing the Democratic presidential nomination before the coronavirus pandemic put an end to traditional campaigning and pulled both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders off the campaign trail.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - Pressure was mounting on the Trump administration Wednesday to release people from immigration detention facilities where at least one detainee has tested positive for COVID-19 and advocates fear tight quarters and overall conditions could cause rapid spread of the virus. The U.S. holds around 37,000 people in immigration detention. Detainees and advocates say many are vulnerable because of age and pre-existing medical conditions, and because they are often held in open rooms, beds 3-feet apart, and without adequate supplies of masks or other protections. “It’s impossible to stay calm,” said Marco Battistotti, an Italian who is among 170 people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Bristol County jail in Massachusetts. “People are panicking. People are in fear.”  The 54-year-old Battistotti was among about 100 detainees at the county jail near Cape Cod who signed a letter released by a local immigration lawyer detailing conditions inside. They asked to be released to await decisions on their immigration cases.  “I don’t want to die in an ICE jail,” he said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. “Why can’t I fight my case on the outside?” The agency, which reported the positive test of a 31-year-old man from Mexico held in Bergen County, New Jersey, on Tuesday, has announced steps to protect detained migrants and staff from the virus, but hasn’t said whether it plans to review cases for possible release because of the outbreak. It did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the complaints about conditions from the detainees and their advocates.  The administration has tried to balance its overall hard line on immigration, a signature policy of President Donald Trump, and its response to the outbreak, with ICE announcing previously that it would “temporarily adjust” operations to focus on apprehending people who pose a risk to public safety or are subject to mandatory detention because of a criminal record. Immigrant advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are filing lawsuits in California, Maryland, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, seeking court orders for the immediate release of people in immigration detention, especially those at risk because of their age or medical conditions.  Advocates have also asked a court in Los Angeles to order the Office of Refugee Resettlement to release to eligible sponsors around 1,200 migrant children who were apprehended without parents or legal guardians and have been held in government-contracted shelters for more than 30 days. They said two staff members at two such facilities in New York have tested positive for COVID-19. It’s unclear how many immigration detainees overall are at higher risk, but one California suit alone had 13 plaintiffs, all over 55.  A panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Monday, citing the “rapidly escalating public health crisis,” ordered the immediate release of a 37-year-old woman who is fighting deportation to Mexico. The woman’s lawyer, Max Carter-Oberstone, said the government told him it would not oppose the decision but she still had not been released as of early Wednesday. The court took the action on its own initiative in a rare move on behalf of a woman who says she has been threatened with death by members of a Mexican drug cartel.  “It wasn’t something we asked for or were expecting,” Carter-Oberstone said. “The court is clearly reacting to the greater public health crisis that we’re in right now and re-evaluating how it’s going to dispose of its immigration cases in light of that crisis that we’re all experiencing.”  The situation in immigration detention, which include facilities run by local jurisdictions and private contractors, is similar to that facing jails and prisons, with staff also at risk from a virus that already has sickened at least 55,000 people and killed about 800 in the U.S.  One difference is that more than half of ICE detainees have no criminal charges or conviction and are held only for immigration reasons. Under previous administrations, many would likely have been released on bond as they pursued their cases. ICE has reported one positive test of an employee at a detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and 18 confirmed cases among staff not involved in detaining migrants. A contractor reported a positive case of a staff member at a facility in Harris County, Texas. The agency says it is screening new detainees and isolating detainees who show symptoms of the coronavirus disease. Detainees say those measures won’t do much, with people staying in dorm-like bays with no social distancing possible or in smaller rooms that they sometimes have to clean themselves, with insufficient cleaning supplies. Francisca Morales Diaz, a 45-year-old from Mexico who was released Friday from an ICE detention center in Louisiana, said she and others were issued soap and toilet paper for their own use once a week and they would run out. When they complained, she says they were told there were shortages on the outside as well.  “There isn’t enough medicine. It’s not well-maintained,” Morales told AP. Her fear is that “at any moment, they’re going to come and take me back there.” Ira Alkalay, a lawyer representing some of the detainees at the jail near Cape Cod, said the detainees are responsible for cleaning their unit, which includes a dining area and bathrooms, but aren’t even given bleach. Some who signed the letter suffer from respiratory ailments such as tuberculosis, emphysema and asthma that put them at higher risk to the virus.  “These are not sanitary conditions at all,” Alkalay said. “If the virus is introduced, many people could get sick all at once. Hospitals in the area can become quickly overwhelmed.”  The office of Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson, who has made headlines for offering to send the jail’s ICE detainees to help build Trump’s promised border wall, has stressed there are currently no confirmed or suspected cases of the virus at the facility. “We suspect these detainees are working with outside political activist groups to use the coronavirus crisis to advance their political agenda,” the sheriff’s spokesman, Jonathan Darling, said this week.  Eunice Cho, an ACLU lawyer, said the confined spaces and limited medical treatment in many immigration jails made them especially vulnerable - and if the virus spreads through one facility, the number of sick people who would require advanced care could overwhelm area hospitals. Many ICE jails are in rural areas with smaller hospitals. “This is closely related to the public health of our entire community,” Cho said.  ________________________________ Marcelo reported from Boston.

"The White House and Senate leaders of both parties have agreed on unprecedented emergency legislation to rush sweeping aid totaling some $2 trillion to businesses, workers and a health care system slammed by the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, India’s 1.3 billion people joined the global lockdown, and Prince Charles has tested positive for the new coronavirus. Here are some of AP’s top stories Wednesday on the world’s coronavirus pandemic. Follow APNews.com/VirusOutbreak for updates through the day and APNews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak for stories explaining some of its complexities. WHAT’S HAPPENING TODAY: - A “cacophony of coughing” in packed emergency rooms. Beds squeezed in wherever there is space. Overworked, sleep-deprived doctors and nurses rationed to one face mask a day and wracked by worry about a dwindling number of available ventilators as New York City’s hospitals become the war-zone-like epicenter of the nation’s coronavirus crisis. - Despite what you may have read in a text message or on social media, there are currently no plans for a national quarantine, let alone martial law.  Rumors of a military-enforced national lockdown have been debunked repeatedly by state and federal authorities who say their recurrence shows why it’s vital to find reliable sources of information. - The coronavirus is waging a war of attrition against health care workers throughout the world, but nowhere is it winning more battles at the moment than in Italy and in Spain, where protective equipment and tests have been in severely short supply for weeks. - The pandemic is also touching remote areas spread across rural America, with the people living in those communities where “working from home” can mean driving a tractor alone through a empty field. Tiny towns tucked into Oregon’s windswept plains and cattle ranches miles from anywhere in South Dakota might not have had a single case of the coronavirus, but their main streets are also empty and their medical clinics overwhelmed by the worried. - Restaurants, hotels, airlines, automakers and entertainment venues have been hit hard around the world as cities, states and entire countries have ordered the closure of non-essential businesses and directed residents to remain at home. U.S. Department of Labor figures to be released Thursday are expected to shatter the old record for the greatest number of new unemployment claims filed in a single week. There are more suddenly jobless Americans than during the Great Recession. And more than in the aftermath of major natural disasters such as hurricanes, fires and floods. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover. Here are the symptoms of  the virus compared with the common flu.  One of the best ways to prevent spread of the virus is washing your hands with soap and water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends first washing with warm or cold water and then lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under fingernails before rinsing off. You should wash your phone, too. Here’s how.  Misinformation overload: How to separate fact from fiction and rumor from deliberate efforts to mislead. ___ ONE NUMBER:                 $300,000: The money donated by the Michael Jackson estate to help people in the entertainment industry hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. The donations will focus on Broadway workers, as well as workers in Las Vegas and in the music industry. Jackson’s estate announced Wednesday that it will give $100,000 apiece to Broadway Cares, Three Square food bank in Nevada and the Recording Academy’s MusiCares. The estate’s co-executor John Branca tells The Associated Press the gifts are personal for the keepers of Jackson’s affairs and legacy and are in line with the singer’s charitable endeavors during his lifetime. ___ IN OTHER NEWS:                 PLAYING THROUGH: Many golf courses around the country have remained open during the coronavirus pandemic. The hope is that golf can provide an outlet for the stir crazy and a dose of normalcy. The question is whether recreational golf safe enough under the circumstances. Courses have barred touching the flagsticks and turned the hole cups upside down so golfers don’t need reach in to retrieve the ball. ___ Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  ",What you need to know today about the virus outbreak,"Wednesday, March 25, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/25/what-you-need-to-know-today-about-the-virus-outbre/,washington_times
"The Senate passed the $2.2 trillion emergency stimulus package to assist the overly stressed health-care system and tumbling economy Wednesday night. The bipartisan deal passed on a 96-0 vote. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell touted the unanimous vote as a victory for bipartisanship, despite a drawn-out partisan negotiation process. “We pivoted from one of the most partisan exercises you could ever be engaged in, to a bipartisan, 100 to nothing, $2 trillion rescue package for the country,” the Kentucky Republican said. “Not much to complain about on process when you get that kind of an outcome for the country.” Several senators missed votes because they were self-quarantined. Senate Majority Whip John Thune, South Dakota Republican, was one of the latest to miss the votes; he flew home Wednesday because he wasn’t feeling well. His spokesman said Mr. Thune consulted with the attending Senate physician and his family doctor, and was told, based on how he was feeling, that “there was no need for additional action at this point and [he] was encouraged to continue self-monitoring.” The bill will give $500 billion in direct payments to the American public, bolster unemployment insurance with a surge of $250 billion, provide $500 billion in loans to big businesses, and create a $350 billion loan program for small businesses. It also funnels $130 billion into the stretched-thin health-care system to get more resources and equipment to those directly fighting the disease. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said there’s no way to know when the “plague” will end in the U.S. “When there’s a crisis of this magnitude, the private sector cannot solve it,” Mr. Schumer said. “Government is the only force large enough to staunch the bleeding and begin the healing. This is a time when the American people need their government.” The bill now needs to clear the House for final passage. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, announced during the vote that his chamber will take up the package via a voice vote at 9 a.m. Friday. A voice vote will be unrecorded, but members can still debate and enter their votes in the Congressional record. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on PBS NewsHour earlier Wednesday evening that her party is already looking ahead to address what they would have liked to see in this third coronavirus package in subsequent bills. The Senate stands adjourned until April 20 now that the package has passed out of their chamber. Mr. McConnell said senators would have 24 hours notice if they need to return before then. “Let’s continue to pray for one another, for all of our families, and for our country,” he said.

"The Senate shot down an amendment to cap unemployment benefits for workers Wednesday, setting up a fast track vote for the full $2.2 trillion economic relief package to combat the impact of the coronavirus. The motion failed on a 48-48 vote. It needed 60 votes to pass. Several senators missed votes because they were self-quarantined. Senate Majority Whip John Thune, South Dakota Republican, was one of the latest to miss the votes; he flew home Wednesday because he wasn’t feeling well. His spokesman said Mr. Thune consulted with the attending Senate physician and his family doctor, and was told, based on how he was feeling, that “there was no need for additional action at this point and [he] was encouraged to continue self-monitoring.” Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Rick Scott of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina argued that, as written, the bolstered unemployment program could provide more money than some workers earn in their paychecks. Their amendment would have capped at 100% of a worker’s paycheck. With its failure, lawmakers have paved the way for a speedy passage of the full $2 trillion package. It will give $500 billion in direct payments to the American public, bolster unemployment insurance with a surge of $250 billion, provide $500 billion in loans to big businesses, and creates a $350 billion loan program for small businesses. It also funnels $130 billion into the stretched-thin healthcare system to get more resources and equipment to those directly fighting the disease. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will give members 24 hours to review and debate the bill before they take action on the floor, likely via a voice vote if all members accept that.

"The Senate approved an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package Wednesday night to help workers and businesses shut down by the coronavirus pandemic, but economists warned it won’t be enough to prevent a sharp recession and expectations grew that Congress will need to provide a fourth relief plan within a few months. The measure includes direct payments of $1,200 to most Americans, plus $500 checks per child, at a cost to the government of $250 billion. It creates a $500 billion lending program for distressed businesses, cities, and states, plus a $367 billion employee retention fund for small businesses. It provides $130 billion to hospitals, and four months of expanded unemployment insurance up to 39 weeks in most states. House leaders said they would convene at 9 a.m. Friday to consider the bill and hold a voice vote; President Trump said he will sign it immediately upon passage. The growing size of the package reflected the rapidly increasing harm to the economy from a nearly nationwide lockdown. Just a few days ago, officials had proposed a bill totaling $850 billion. “This is certainly in terms of dollars, far and away the biggest ever done,” Mr. Trump said. “A lot of this money goes to jobs, jobs, jobs, and families, families, families.” Economists and lawmakers alike said the massive plan is primarily a lifeline to help families and businesses get through the next few months, at best. “It doesn’t help the economy,” conservative economist Stephen Moore said of the biggest economic relief package in history. “It just provides people some relief to get through the next couple of months. You’re going to need a real stimulus bill after this one that has tax cuts and regulatory reforms and liability reforms.” Steven Hamilton, an assistant professor of economics at George Washington University, said the pandemic has plunged the U.S. economy into uncharted territory. “I would expect the immediate economic impact to be at least three months, and then, best-case scenario, things are at least headed back in the right direction after six months,” he said. “But the effects will still be felt a year or more from now.” Mr. Trump, asked Wednesday how long he expects the relief package to keep the economy going, replied, “Hopefully a long time.” “If we have to go back [to Congress], we have to go back,” the president said. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said the administration envisioned the aid lasting for about three months. One of the first nationwide measures of the coronavirus’ impact on the economy will come on Thursday morning, when the Labor Department will report on the jobless claims for the past week. Some economists predict the U.S. could see around 3 million new unemployment claims, which would be about 12 times as many as the previous week. “There is a very challenging economic story right in front of us, which is beginning now,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Fox News Channel. “We’re doing the best we can to cushion the economic consequences of the virus.” After expectations that the Senate would approve the bill easily Wednesday, several Republicans raised objections to a Democratic provision that could provide some people with more money in unemployment benefits than they earned while working. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer has bragged that he negotiated “unemployment on steroids.” “We cannot encourage people to make more money in unemployment than they do with employment,” said Sen. Tim Scott, South Carolina Republican. But Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who is still campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he was prepared to block the overall relief package unless the GOP senators drop their objections to the level of unemployment insurance. Mr. Mnuchin downplayed the last-minute hurdle, saying he and the president had spoken to the Republican senators. “I don’t think it will create incentives” against working, he told reporters. “Most Americans … want to keep their jobs.” It was a sign of the pandemic’s massive hit to the economy that almost nobody was expecting the $2 trillion infusion for businesses and workers to restore some economic growth that had been robust only a month ago. “This is not even a stimulus package,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican. “It is emergency relief.” The package includes about $367 billion in loans and other relief for small businesses. Alfredo Ortiz, president and CEO of the Job Creators Network that represents small business, held conversations with Mr. Mnuchin in crafting the package and said he’s hoping it will limit the economic harm to a period of about 60 days. “I think that’s what we need to be looking at here — maybe up to 90 days,” Mr. Ortiz said. “Once we get past this medical crisis, I think there’s going to be a tremendous amount of pent-up demand. People are going to want to go out, they’re going to want to have their lives back.” The blows to the economy have been mounting. On Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that mortgage applications plunged 29.4% last week, as people trying to sell homes have cancelled showings during the outbreak. Because closings are done in person, economists expect sales will decline sharply. Target said Wednesday it was significantly rolling back its expansion plans, deciding to remodel 130 stores this year, less than half of 300 it had planned. It will open only 15 to 20 smaller format stores this year, down from the 36 originally planned. The corporation that owns Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell said in a regulatory filing that 7,000 of its restaurants worldwide are closed, including over 1,000 Pizza Hut Express locations in the U.S. and over 900 KFCs in Britain. Stocks on Wednesday generally continued their rally on the developments with the Senate relief package. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 495 points, or 2.3%, although the index lost more than half of its gains in the final hour of trading as the snag over unemployment benefits emerged. Mr. Moore said the pervasive economic harm of closing down many regions of the country and major industrial sectors underscores the correctness of Mr. Trump’s desire to reopen large portions of the country within a few weeks. “Trump is doing the right thing by talking about getting the economy up and running again, that’s really critical,” Mr. Moore said. “The fact is, the recession is going to last — it depends on how long the economy is shut down. If it’s locked down for three months, then you’re talking about potentially a year-long depression. The economic damage compounds, bankruptcies compound, unemployment compounds, the disruptions to the supply chains — all of that gets ruined if this goes on for more than a month or two.” He said he has two friends suffering from COVID-19, one of whom is on a respirator, and he understands the potential consequences for people of reopening the economy too soon. Mr. Moore noted that Mr. Trump has called himself a “wartime president” partly because of the difficult decisions he’s facing. “You really have to start asking how many trillions of dollars of damage are we willing to do to keep the virus contained,” Mr. Moore said. “And so it’s a hard calculation, but it’s a calculation we have to make. Wartime presidents have to make very tough decisions.” The president defended his goal of reopening many parts of the country by Easter, and said he believes the economy will quickly shake off the effects of the virus. “I don’t think it’s going to end up being such a rough patch,” Mr. Trump said. “I think it’s going to open up like a rocketship. Our country wants to get back to work.” ⦁ This article is based in part on wire-service reports.

"A congressional commission is recommending substantial structural changes to the nation’s military service call-up program, floating the idea of a mandatory requirement for young women to register for the draft for the first time in history. This unprecedented change would require every young man and woman between the ages of 18 and 26 to register with the Selective Service system for conscription in case of a national emergency. The recommendation was in the final 255-page report of the National Commission on Military, National and Public Service, a panel exploring the military-civilian relationship and the call of service to the country backed by the late Arizona Sen. John McCain. “In the event of a draft, the nation must leverage the skills and talents of all Americans, regardless of gender,” commission member Debra Wada said Wednesday during a conference call with reporters. “Including women in the registration process reaffirms the nation’s fundamental belief in a common defense, and signals that all Americans may be expected to serve.” Although the report does not require action from Congress, lawmakers are expected to seriously consider the bipartisan panel’s suggestions. The panel did not explicitly call for the revival of the forced military draft, which was last conducted at the tail end of the Vietnam War. Draft advocates say conscription is needed to fill military manpower needs and address a widening military-civilian gap is which a smaller fraction of the population fights all of the nation’s wars. A 1981 Supreme Court ruling held that an all-male draft was constitutional because women at the time was barred from combat roles. But the Obama administration opened women in the military to some combat roles in December 2015. After 2½ years of research and travel, the 11-member commission produced 164 recommendations, including greater investment into civic education starting in elementary school;  the creation of a White House council to coordinate military and civilian service efforts; and a campaign to promote awareness of service options for a rising generation of Americans. “We envision a nation in which service is a common expectation and experience of all Americans — when it is the norm, not the exception,” Commission Vice Chair Mark Gearan, a former Peace Corps director said. One of the commissions’ main goals is to see 5 million Americans participating in military, national or public service annually by 2031 —  the 70th anniversary of the late President John F. Kennedy’s famous admonition to “ask what you can do for your country.” One recommendation was for a “one-stop shop” where potential volunteers could explore service options and requirements. The report’s authors say the call for expanded service comes by chance at a “once-in-a-generation moment,” when the nation and the world are being stressed by the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. “At a time when our country is having extremely important conversations about our path forward, we should be prioritizing the recommendations coming out of this commission and working to make them a reality,” former Army Gen. Stan McChrystal, who once commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said.

"The coronavirus pandemic has prompted colleges, think tanks, medical journals and governments to release scores of stats and studies — some good, while others fail peer review. The research touches on comparative death counts, the sneezing range of nose droplets, cigarettes and how long the deadly virus can last on a piece of plastic such as a bottle or shopping bag. “The problem with the media is the mindless reporting of ‘cases,’ as more testing means more cases, most of which are asymptomatic,” Steve Milloy, who researches for the Junk Science website, told The Washington Times. “A lot of hysteria, not much good data.” Indeed, as more people are being tested in America, the case load is expanding and the mortality rate is dropping, to .012% from more than 3%. Some recent scientific findings: χ As the U.S. death toll approaches 1,000, The New York Times and other liberal media paint the U.S. mortality rate as near the top globally. Not really, according to a chart created by Our World in Data at Oxford University. Founder Mark Roser crunched the mortality rate numbers on a per-capita basis, per million people, a statistic not produced by most raw data web sites. The U.S. has about 2 deaths per million, while Italy has more than 80, Spain has nearly 40 and France has 10. χ Italy’s imposed isolation on March 9 appears to have reduced the country’s case growth rate, according to an article Tuesday in The Lancet medical journal. Before, experts estimated there would be 30,000 infections by March 15. Actual number for that date: 24,747. “We urge all countries to acknowledge the Italian lesson and to immediately adopt very restrictive measures to limit viral diffusion, ensure appropriate health-system response, and reduce mortality, which appears to be higher than previously estimated, with a crude case-fatality rate of almost 4%,” the article said. χ Press reports consistently say the elderly are at the highest risk from COVID-19. A study on Italy’s outbreak, with an epicenter the in Lombardy region, confirms this — to the extreme. According to the Italian National Institute of Health’s website Epicentro, the country’s 5,019 non-health care worker death toll is almost all seniors: Age 60-69, 11%; age 70-79, 35%; age 80-89, 40%; and 90 and older, 9%. No deaths were reported for 29 years old and younger. χ The New England Journal of Medicine put out a scary report. The coronavirus can live for hours on certain surfaces, with up to a 72-hour span on everyday plastic. But Carolyn Machamer, a professor of cell biology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, says the study exaggerates. “What’s getting a lot of press and is presented out of context is that the virus can last on plastic for 72 hours, which sounds really scary,” Ms. Machamer told the school. “But what’s more important is the amount of the virus that remains. It’s less than 0.1% of the starting virus material. Infection is theoretically possible but unlikely at the levels remaining after a few days. People need to know this.” χ The same New England Journal study said COVID-19 droplets can remain in the air for several hours. Dr. Machamer rebuts this. The New England Journal researchers used an aerosol spray, which produces a finer mist than the liquid from a cough or sneeze that falls to the ground. “While the New England Journal of Medicine study found that the COVID virus can be detected in the air for 3 hours, in nature, respiratory droplets sink to the ground faster than the aerosols produced in this study,” she said. “The experimental aerosols used in labs are smaller than what comes out of a cough or sneeze, so they remain in the air at face-level longer than heavier particles would in nature.” χ A “Viewpoint” article in The Journal of Clinical Investigation promotes antibodies as an immediate preventive measure or therapy for the sick. But as therapy, the serum must be injected soon after the infection is diagnosed. “This Viewpoint argues that human convalescent serum is an option for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease that could be rapidly available when there are sufficient numbers of people who have recovered and can donate immunoglobulin-containing serum,” wrote Arturo Casadevall and Liise-anne Pirofski, both of the Johns Hopkins Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a Trump administration point-man on COVID-19, has said that antibodies stand today as the most promising viral treatment. Drs. Casadevaill and Pirofski explain: “Passive antibody therapy involves the administration of antibodies against a given agent to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to that agent. In contrast, active vaccination requires the induction of an immune response that takes time to develop and varies depending on the vaccine recipient. Thus, passive antibody administration is the only means of providing immediate immunity to susceptible persons.” χ The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization agree that the first two signs of infections are a fever and dry cough. Now the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology has added a new symptom: lost sense of taste. In a Sky News report, the association of ear, nose and throat physicians said: “We have also identified a new symptom (loss of sense of smell and taste) that may mean that people without other symptoms but with just the loss of this sense may have to self-isolate — again to reduce the spread of the virus.” Professor Nirmal Kumarm said: “In young patients, they do not have any significant symptoms such as the cough and fever but they may have just the loss of sense of smell and taste, which suggests that these viruses are lodging in the nose.” χ An article posted Wednesday in the publication New Science points to a new study by Jeffrey Shaman at Columbia University. He purports to document the spread of COVID-19 in China in January, the month the virus went, as they say, viral. Mr. Shaman looked at the spread between Jan. 10 and Jan. 23 and concluded that the infected who had no or mild symptoms, or 86%, created the lion’s share of infected. New Science wrote: “Such undocumented cases are still contagious and the study found them to be the source of most of the virus’s spread in China before the restrictions came in. Even though these people were only 55 percent as contagious as people with symptoms, the study found that they were the source of 79 per cent of further infections, due to there being more of them, and the higher likelihood that they were out and about.” χ A new study in The American Journal of Gastroenterology reported March 20 on a new COVID-19 symptom that might be the most important: diarrhea. Researchers looked at early cases in Wuhan, China, and found that 99 of 204 infected residents first had symptoms of gastrointestinal distress before fever and coughing. And they had a higher incidence of mortality. χ Contrarian news for cigarette smokers: A research article in the European Journal of Internal Medicine said there was no link between Chinese smokers and the severity of their COVID-19. China is a smoker’s holiday with more than 50% of men puffing away, while fewer than 2% of women light up. Because the virus death rate is higher for men, a suspect factor is cigarettes. Researchers looked at patients with severe disease and found no difference in non- and active smokers. “In conclusion,” they wrote. “The results of this preliminary meta-analysis based on Chinese patients suggest that active smoking does not apparently seem to be significantly associated with enhanced risk of progressing towards severe disease in COVID-19.” Junk Science’s Mr. Milloy said of all the scholarship: “If you are looking for useful facts, you aren’t likely to find any anytime soon. Sick and vulnerable people should stay home. The Democrat-owned and operated public health community should be reamed on this. Those are my facts.”  ",Scores of data released on coronavirus,"Wednesday, March 25, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/25/scores-data-released-coronavirus/,washington_times
"The $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief deal will shatter spending records, and if it passes it will go down in history as the law with largest price tag — by far. It costs more than the entire federal government spent in any single year until the 2001 terrorist attacks. It nearly doubles the price tag of the Obama-era Recovery Act, aimed at reviving the economy after the 2008 Wall Street collapse. The bill is the third so far, on top of $112 billion in cash infusions in two earlier bills. And it’s not likely to be the last word, with lawmakers already talking about a fourth bill. That’s all on top of the $4.6 trillion the government was expecting to spend even before COVID-19, meaning total federal spending in 2020 would near $7 trillion. “This is certainly in terms of dollars, by far and away the biggest ever, ever done, and that’s a tremendous thing, because a lot of this money goes to jobs, jobs, jobs. And families, families, families,” President Trump said at the White House. It’s too early to know the damage to the economy, but the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve predicted gross domestic product, once projected to be about $22 trillion this year, could now be slashed in half. If things play out that badly, it would mean federal spending would top 60% of gross domestic product. That would be a new record for the U.S., substantially higher than the 42% seen during World War II, and surging even beyond democratic socialist countries such as Sweden and Norway. Even at the depths of the 2008 Wall Street collapse and the Recovery Act stimulus, federal spending didn’t top 25% of GDP. “These are exceptional times indeed,” said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. “Other things that happened affected sectors of the economy like the dot.bomb in 2001 and the financial crisis in 2008-09, or affected certain areas like Katrina or Sandy or Harvey. This is the first crisis that is going across virtually all sectors and across the entire country. No one really knows what’s on the other side of this.” Those who wrote the bill said the big-ticket items include $500 billion for loan guarantees to large businesses from the Treasury Department; about $350 billion in loan guarantees for small businesses; $250 billion in expanded unemployment insurance payments; $150 billion to states, territories and tribal governments; and $130 billion to hospitals and other health facilities, There’s also tens of billions of dollars set aside for the airline industry; $10 billion in additional borrowing authority for the U.S. Postal Service; a 120-day moratorium on evictions; forgiveness of grants for students who dropped out because of COVID-19 and a six-month deferral of nearly all federal student loan payments and interest; and $25 million to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Mr. Trump said that last item was a Democratic demand, but he found it worthy — though he chopped $10 million off the original $35 million ask. “The Kennedy Center has suffered greatly because nobody can go there,” the president said. The $2.2 trillion price tag Mr. Trump put on the package is far more than the $1 trillion envisioned just 10 days ago, though it’s less than the $2.4 trillion measure House Democrats unveiled earlier this week. “It is a huge, unprecedented price tag. And between the deficit-financed tax cut and the spending binge in good times we left ourselves in a difficult position to respond. But we’re going to have to respond. And deal with what comes,” Mr. Ellis said. He said the bill includes elements of the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the 2009 Recovery Act, as well as a slew of smaller disaster recovery bills. Budget watchdogs said a massive response is needed for such a massive challenge as the virus — but they said the U.S. could have been in better shape to handle the budget challenge, had Washington used the last decade of good economic times to get its fiscal house in order. “Even before this crisis, we were headed towards a $1 trillion deficit, which was reckless during an economic expansion. Now in a matter of moments, that has become many trillions, and we are on track to reach unprecedented levels of debt as share of the economy,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “Once we get through this deadly pandemic and brutal recession, we will be faced with a challenging recovery complicated by our massive debt, made all the more painful by past years of excessive borrowing.” After the last major upheaval, the 2008 Wall Street collapse, federal spending, which had wavered between 17% and 19% of GDP for the previous 15 years, soared to 24% in 2009. It hasn’t dropped below 20% since. Brian Riedl, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said coronavirus spending should, in theory, be short-term, and both tax and spending levels should revert to their previous trajectory. “After all, the long-term fundamentals of the economy have not changed,” he said. “The long-term challenges arise if a large number of companies go out of business, or there is a permanent reduction in the workforce, or Congress makes ‘temporary’ budget provisions permanent.”  ",Coronavirus relief deal will become most expensive ever,"Wednesday, March 25, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-relief-deal-will-become-most-expensive/,washington_times
"Lawmakers call on G20 leaders to secure funds for WHO, IMF and World Bank amid coronavirus outbreak A pair of senior Democratic senators are urging President Trump to secure financial and logistical commitments from global leaders at the upcoming virtual meeting of the G20 nations as countries around the world scramble to contain the spread of the coronavirus. In a letter to Mr. Trump Wednesday, Sens. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, and Patrick Leahy, Vermont Democrat, requested that the president use the emergency meeting to ensure the group of powerful nations, including the U.S., will provide “robust” monetary support to health and finance institutions that are racing to combat the virus. “This pandemic is not a challenge that we can face alone; we must work through every multilateral institution in which we participate,” the senators wrote. “We must unite to combat this virus and the lasting impacts it will have on our citizens’ health and economic well-being. We must put aside political differences. Now is the time for action.” Just days earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it needs the G20 nations to increase the production of hospital gear and drop export bans to ensure that countries with the greatest need are equipped to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Menendez, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Mr. Leahy, Vice Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, called on the group of 20 nations, which take up 90% of the world’s GDP, to commit to fully funding the WHO, International Monetary Fund and World Bank “so these institutions can carry out their missions to drive economic stability and development, and recovery.”  ","Democrats urge Trump to press G20 nations on funding for WHO, IMF and World Bank","Wednesday, March 25, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/25/bob-menendez-patrick-leahy-press-g20-fund-who-imf-/,washington_times
"BISMARCK, N.D. — North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer apologized Wednesday for a late-night tweet in which he used an offensive term to describe House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Cramer blamed autocorrect for the tweet, which he deleted soon after posting it Tuesday evening. The Republican senator was responding to a video clip on Twitter in which Pelosi, D-Calif., was being interviewed on the massive COVID-19 relief bill being negotiated in Congress. The tweet read: “She’s retarded.” Cramer said in an interview that he meant to type, “She’s ridiculous,” and didn’t notice what he actually tweeted until a few minutes later when he went to make another tweet. “It’s a word I just don’t apply to people. I can be pretty tough in my rhetoric, but that’s not a word I apply to people for really good obvious reasons.” He added: “I’m really sorry it happened.” Congressional negotiators finally struck a deal early Wednesday on a $2 trillion package after days of intense negotiations.

"Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy recommended using a voice vote to pass the $2 trillion phase three coronavirus economic package later this week. Mr. McCarthy, California Republican, acknowledged the decision was ultimately up to House Speaker Pelosi but shared his doubts that a unanimous consent request would be successful. “I don’t think this could pass via unanimous consent,” he said. It only takes an objection from one member to tank a “UC” motion. A finalized version phase two bill was nearly derailed by Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert. However, he argued, a voice vote would allow members time to debate the bill and cast their vote — for or against — in the Congressional record. Mr. McCarthy said he hoped that the Democratic leadership would still give members 24 hours to review the bill before scheduling a vote — meaning the House could potentially not vote on the package until Friday. The Senate has scheduled their vote for later Wednesday, but has not released a final version of the text. “I would think that on a bill spending more than $2 trillion that having 24 hours to review it is worth it,” he said.

"Four Senate Republicans opposed a speedy passage to the $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package Wednesday, warning a “massive drafting error” in the bill could incentivize workers leaving their jobs. Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Rick Scott of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina argued that, as written, the bolstered unemployment program could provide more money than some workers earn in their paychecks. “We cannot encourage people to make more money in unemployment than they do with employment,” Tim Scott said. The $2 trillion deal includes $250 billion in a robust unemployment program — providing $600 per week, on top of additional gig-worker benefits, for four months. “I just can’t imagine the effect in South Carolina and other places when you realize you’re getting $24 an hour on unemployment. So every employer in the state has to compete against a $24-an-hour minimum wage,” Mr. Graham said. “The most responsible thing is to fix this now.” The unemployment program was one of Democrats’ top priorities in the five-day negotiation process. The senators said they were hopeful the Senate would accept an amendment to adjust the language so unemployment benefits are capped at 100% of a worker’s paycheck. However, they would not say if they would force the bill to go through all of the Senate’s procedural votes if their amendment vote is not accepted. “We’re not trying to talk process right now,” Mr. Sasse said. The Senate is set to vote on the package Wednesday, but a final version of the bill’s text as not been publicly released. Conservative economist Stephen Moore said President Trump should veto the measure if the problem isn’t fixed. “It’s worth vetoing this bill just to get that out of the bill,” Mr. Moore told The Washington Times. You’re talking about dramatically inhibiting the recovery, which is what we really should be looking for two, three, four months from now — making sure the economy’s really booming. You’re not going to have a boom in the economy if you’re paying people not to work.” Mr. Moore said congressional Republicans shouldn’t have agreed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s demand for four months of expanded unemployment insurance. “It’s crazy. Republicans wanted two months, and they caved in to Pelosi and gave her four,” he said. “And people say, ‘Well, what if the crises aren’t over in two months?’ Well, then you just extend it by a month, but you don’t bake it into the cake.” • Dave Boyer contributed to this report.

"BEIRUT (AP) - Through 15 years of civil war and various bouts of violence since, Lebanon’s Barbar eatery never closed its doors, serving up sandwiches to customers even if it meant doing so from behind sandbags. The coronavirus pandemic, however, has managed to do what various wars could not: Close bars, restaurants and entertainment spots across the tiny Mediterranean country. It’s an economic gut punch at a time when Lebanon is already mired in the worst financial crisis in its history. While residents of many other countries are counting on a government bailout, that’s not an option in the country teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. “We have never gone through something like this - ever,” said Barbar owner Ali Ghaziri, standing outside his shop on Beirut’s normally busy Hamra street, now completely deserted.  Earlier this month, heeding orders from the government amid the spread of the new coronavirus, Ghaziri closed the iconic chain’s two branches in Beirut, leaving only its delivery service operating. Nearby, in Beirut’s Gemayzeh neighborhood, pubs and restaurants usually spilling onto the street with noisy, beer-toting youngsters are shuttered. Even Lebanon’s famous corniche, usually dotted with coffee vans, corn-on-the-cob vendors and people doing their morning exercise, is now empty.  Lebanon has suffered in recent years from a lack of economic growth, high unemployment and a drop in hard currency inflows from abroad. But the financial crisis erupted after nationwide protests over widespread corruption and decades of mismanagement by the ruling political class engulfed the country in October. That in turn has led to bank closures and crippling capital controls on cash withdrawals and transfers, raising fears about depositors’ savings in U.S. dollars. The local currency has already lost up to 60% of its value on the dollar on the black market. Earlier this month, as the crisis deepened, the government announced it would no longer pay its foreign loans, marking the country’s first-ever default amid ongoing popular unrest.  Among the sectors hardest hit by the crisis has been the food and beverage sector, a mainstay of Lebanon’s economy.  Between September and December 2019, more than 800 food and beverage institutions closed and around 25,000 people - or 17% of those who work in the sector - lost their jobs, according to various estimates. In January, a further 200 institutions closed.  The Lebanese government ordered the lockdown in mid-March, closing its only international airport as well as ports and land border crossings until March 29. Restaurants and night clubs were also ordered closed in a severe blow to one of the most vital sectors in Lebanon, known for its cuisine and bustling night life.  “We reached a point where we were hit by one catastrophe after the other, and when we reached the coronavirus crisis we had no more reserves at all,” said Maya Bekhazi Noun, general secretary of the syndicate for restaurant owners. “We were at the bottom, bottom, bottom, taking the last breath,” she said. “This now was a mortal blow to the sector.”  Unlike in other countries under lockdowns, where banks remained open, the banking association in Lebanon decided to defy government orders and close for two weeks, in an apparent effort to preserve liquidity.  “It’s going to be devastating on the economy in the short-term and the long-term,” said economist Kamel Wazni, speaking about businesses that have closed. “There’s going to be a lot of pain among many sectors of the economy.” He said the government will also be affected since it will not be able to collect taxes, further increasing the budget deficit. Lebanon’s prime minister has acknowledged that the state is struggling to tackle the coronavirus fallout amid the crippling crisis. In a report this week, Human Rights Watch said Lebanon’s financial crisis and dollar shortage has resulted in a scarcity of medical supplies necessary to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak While governments abroad scramble to approve stimulus packages to compensate for lost businesses, experts here warn of extremely dire times ahead with no potential for bailouts. Government officials have said they are not seeking an IMF bailout for now, fearing it would come with conditions that would be too painful. Ghaziri, the owner of Barbar, said he is worried about his staff, 75% of whom he had to send home after sales dropped 75%.  His father founded the Barbar chain - a household name in Lebanon - in 1979, four years after the country’s 15-year civil war erupted. The eatery continued to serve up kebabs, shawarma and other treats throughout the conflict and various other wars. They closed for a few hours only when Ghaziri’s grandfather passed away and in 2005 for the funeral of the late Prime Minister Rafik Hariri after he was assassinated.  “During the civil war, there were street battles. So, you could talk yourself out of problems. Now you cannot do anything,” Ghaziri said of the coronavirus.  Some 220,000 people have lost their jobs in Lebanon since October, according to a survey released last month by information provider InfoPro. InfoPro said the number of companies that have closed increased by 20% between November and January. One third of all companies have reduced their work force by 60%. The World Bank had projected 0.2% negative growth in 2020 before the protests began in October but more recent estimates suggest the contraction in the country’s economy could be more than 1% of GDP. Prime Minister Hassan Diab, whose government is negotiating debt restructuring, said Lebanon’s debt reached $90 billion or 170% of GDP, making it one of the highest in the world. According to government estimates, about half of Lebanon’s population could end up living below poverty levels.  Ali Badran lost his job at the restaurant where he worked for 11 years in October as a result of the crisis. He was left jobless just as he was preparing to marry his longtime fiance in a few months.  With no income, the 36-year-old stopped renovation work in the apartment he bought and started looking for a new job as of late October. That was days after massive nationwide protests broke out against the country’s political elite.  On March 1, he started a new job at another restaurant in Beirut but now he is worried the lockdown means he could be laid off again.  “I am worried that if things stay as they are I might lose my new job,” he said.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden returned Wednesday to his longtime habit of gilding his academic credentials. Mr. Biden claimed to be an Ivy League professor at the end of a nearly 8-minute, rambling answer to a question from an 18-year-old on what he was doing to appeal to young voters who may favor Sen. Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination. “There’s a lot we can do. When I left the United States Senate, I became a professor at the University of Pennsylvania,” he said, bringing up that fact to claim that his professorship established a bond with college students. After mentioning a school that bears the Biden name at the University of Delaware, Mr. Biden said, “I’ve spent a lot of time on campus with college students.” In fact, Mr. Biden was given an honorary-professor position one week after he left the vice president’s office in 2017. (He also misstated the time of his becoming the first “Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor,” as he left the Senate in 2009 to become vice president.) He was neither supposed to nor did he ever teach a class, according to his own spokesperson and multiple Philadelphia media accounts. Last July, the Philadelphia Inquirer noted that Penn has paid Mr. Biden $900,000 and asked “what did he do to earn the money?” The paper said Mr. Biden held, “a vaguely defined role that involved no regular classes and around a dozen public appearances on campus, mostly in big, ticketed events.” The Wednesday video meeting was not the first time that Mr. Biden had claimed to be an Ivy League professor. Campaigning last month in South Carolina, according to the Daily Wire, Mr. Biden said that when he left the White House in 2017, instead of “taking a Wall Street job,” he “became a teacher, became a professor.” While Mr. Biden’s formal title at Penn was indeed “professor,” if only an honorary one, “teacher” would be a claim to be doing something Mr. Biden was not. Mr. Biden has a lengthier history of aggrandizing his academic credentials. In 1987, in a presidential campaign that also was rocked by plagiarism charges, Mr. Biden claimed he had graduated in the top half of his law school class. However, the Associated Press reported that “records indicate he finished near the bottom.” That same year he also claimed to have attended law school on a full academic scholarship, which was not true.

"BOSTON (AP) - A panel of three appeals court judges upheld a previous ruling that the U.S. Department of Justice cannot enforce two Rhode Island cities to comply with a grant that they said in a lawsuit would turn local police into federal immigration agents. The decision issued Tuesday by judges with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit in Boston sided with the cities of Providence and Central Falls, the Providence Journal reported.  The federal government, among other things, wanted cities receiving public safety grants to notify federal agents when immigrants in the country illegally are about to be released. The DOJ did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday. The two cities filed the lawsuit in August 2018  after the federal government required recipients of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant to cooperate with authorities in the enforcement of federal immigration law. Both cities are self-described “sanctuary cities”and do not direct their police forces to carry out federal immigration policy.  This week’s decision upheld a 2019 ruling by Judge John J. McConnell Jr.  in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island. McConnell Jr. said in his ruling that “Congress has not granted the power to impose the conditions the DOJ imposed.” “Both the City of Providence and the City of Central Falls are pleased that the First Circuit found DOJ’s attempts to require our police departments to be agents of a federal immigration system to be unlawful and not authorized by Congress,” Patricia Socarras, spokeswoman for Mayor Jorge Elorza’s office, wrote in an email.

"Few can miss the fiery presence of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo as he navigates the coronavirus crisis in the Empire State. Mr. Cuomo — son of previous New York governor Mario Cuomo and brother of CNN host Christopher Cuomo —— has been a relentless presence in the news media as he explains worst case scenarios to the public. Some say the White House could be in his future. “Could a ‘Draft Cuomo’ movement be in the Democrats’ future?” asks National Review columnist John Fund. “Some Democrats are openly talking up New York governor Andrew Cuomo, whose profile has soared during the crisis, as a Joe Biden stand-in. Yesterday, a Draft Cuomo 2020 account on Twitter announced that ‘Times have changed and we need Gov. Cuomo to be the nominee.’” “Of course, the mathematics of how Governor Cuomo could be drafted to become the Democratic nominee are daunting. He has zero delegates and no campaign and can’t be seen as being distracted by politics during a crisis. But Emily Zanotti of The Daily Wire says that if states continue to postpone or cancel upcoming primaries, a window of opportunity could be there,” Mr. Fund said. Then again, there’s always this possibility: CUOMO/BIDEN 2020 — or maybe even SANDERS/CUOMO 2020. In theory, Mr. Biden could take the secondary role. Then again, his fellow Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernard Sanders could consider the governor as a vice presidential running mate. Whatever the equation, such a surprise move could to amp up the campaigns and inspire an avalanche of media coverage. FOR THE LEXICON #StayAliveJoe. This new social media hashtag was inspired by “Stay Alive Joe Biden,” an analysis from The Atlantic. “It’s as if Biden exists primarily as an idea, rather than an actual candidate,” wrote columnist Alex Wagner. “His political power at this point is an idea, held collectively, about how to defeat Trump. The work now is to keep that idea convincing enough, for long enough, among as many people as possible, for the corporeal man to actually win.” THE RACE FIZZLES They were once raucous, daring and aggressive. That was then, this is now. The presidential campaigns of Democratic hopefuls Sen. Bernard Sanders and Joseph R. Biden have been reduced to no-frills virtual appearances or video conferences streamed live from a makeshift settings with technical challenges. In certain respects, the situation harkens back to 1960s-era live TV, which often proved stark and unforgiving for political candidates, particularly in the 1961 presidential debate between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. “There’s a dynamic with candidates where sometimes they come across to voters much better on camera than they do in person, or vice-versa. Sometimes a candidate can be welcoming and charming in person, but terrible on camera. Face-to-face retail politicking is no longer an option, so campaigns are working hard to deliver a message and avoid being seen as “rigid” while addressing supporters via video,” observes Nate Ashworth, editor of Election Central. “Until Sanders decides to call it quits, the entire primary campaign continues as a skeleton with no public appearances and only virtual town halls and livestream web videos where candidates can interact with their supporters. What was once front-page news has now become little more than an afterthought in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic,” says Mr. Ashworth. THE BIRX EFFECT One member of the White House coronavirus task force is earning very positive coverage from a wide range of news organizations. Tasked with coordinating the national response to the pandemic, Dr. Deborah Birx has maintained a helpful, steadfast public presence during daily media appearances before a national audience. The press has taken notice. Both CNN and The Guardian called her a global health “legend” while the New York Times described Dr. Birx as “tough and disciplined” and busy “running what amounts to a coronavirus war room from the vice president’s office.” Fox News characterized Dr. Birx as a “world-renowned medical expert”; Politico cited her “bipartisan credibility” as a clear asset. Indeed, Dr. Birx served two decades in the U.S. Army as a physician. During the Obama administration, she was appointed national coordinator for HIV/AIDS response in 2014, and also became the U.S. State Department’s social representative for global health diplomacy. “Despite her Obama-era appointment, Birx is a Republican and could be characterized as a conservative,” Politico said. Dr. Birx has also won accolades for her fashion choices. “Birx has brought her special brand of sartorial serenity and strength to the country,” reported The New York Post, noting the physician’s trademark scarves and her lack of angular suits and ‘unimaginative’ dresses. She clearly hasn’t bothered with the power-dressing manual. She’s unknowingly writing her own,” the Post said.

"President Trump on Wednesday said parts of the country deserve to get back to normal sooner than others, arguing the “lamestream media” is using the coronavirus to hurt the economy and his reelection chances even as the U.S. suffered its deadliest day of the pandemic and New York said efforts to restrict society have paid off. “There’s big sections of our country that are very little affected,” Mr. Trump told a White House briefing. Mr. Trump has advised Americans to work and learn at home, avoid essential travel and use takeout instead of frequenting restaurants for 15 days. That guidance expires this weekend, however, and the president is eager to reopen the country as he revs up a reelection bid staked on the once-robust economy. The president says New York City and parts of the West Coast might be hampered by the pandemic for some time but he wants to give flexibility to parts of the country, such as the Midwest, that might have less of a problem right now. “It’s confined to certain areas, high-density areas,” he said, adding: “Our country wants to get back to work.” Mr. Trump also personalized the pandemic Wednesday, drawing a straight line between widespread fears around the virus and his electoral prospects. “The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before!” he wrote. His position sets up a clash with health experts who say it will take many weeks to get the pandemic under control. Governors around the country say they want to get their economies humming again, too. But they’re worried Mr. Trump’s push to get things “raring to go” by Easter is too optimistic, citing the arc of the coronavirus outbreak and public health experts’ recommendations. The U.S. recorded at least 185 fatalities on Wednesday alone, making it the worst day so far and the death toll exceeded 900. The total number of U.S. cases is above 65,000. New York is far and away the hardest-hit U.S. state in the coronavirus outbreak. As of Wednesday, there were more than 30,800 positive coronavirus cases in New York state and at least 285 coronavirus-related deaths. As Mr. Trump looks to loosen strict guidance, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said “social distancing” appeared to be slowing down the virus in his state. “The evidence suggests that the density control measures may be working,” Mr. Cuomo said at his daily briefing on the COVID-19 outbreak in his state. He said on Sunday, projected hospitalizations were doubling every two days, compared to a rate of every 4.7 days by Tuesday. “I don’t place a great deal of stock in any one projection,” Mr. Cuomo said, “but this is a very good sign and a positive sign.” He also cited progress in Westchester County, which was the “hottest cluster” in the U.S. before the state ordered closures and ramped up testing. Hoping to ramp up the pressure, he said New York City would try closing some streets to cars so that pedestrians have more space around them when they go out for fresh air. He’s also asking the public not to play basketball or other close-contact sports in playgrounds. Mr. Cuomo is among governors who’ve ordered all non-essential employees to work from home and closed bars and restaurants, except for takeout or carry-out orders. He said no one thinks it’s sustainable to keep the economy closed but there are “two parallel thoughts” at play, in that he’s not willing to risk lives. As Congress rushed to pass stimulus measures for the economy, Mr. Trump congratulated his administration for its response to date, saying its performance has saved lives. “We’ve done one hell of a job,” Mr. Trump said, praising his team. “You wouldn’t even have a country left.” Yet Mr. Trump’s push to open up the country Easter has made health experts uneasy, saying the outbreak hasn’t peaked hard-hit places and may spread to new parts of the nation. It’s unclear if Mr. Trump’s push to loosen White House guidance will matter in certain places. Governors are signaling they’ll put health recommendations first, so the economy doesn’t face greater harm down the road. Ohio Gov. Mike Dewine, a Republican, says the only way to slow it down is through social distancing. He says the outbreak might not peak until May 1. “The truth is that protecting people and protecting the economy are not mutually exclusive,” Mr. DeWine tweeted. “In fact, one depends on the other. We save our economy by first saving lives. And we have to do it in that order.” The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It has infected over 450,000 people worldwide, upending normal life in much of the developed world and forcing Japan and the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Summer Games in Tokyo to 2021. In Europe, Spain has reported over 3,400 deaths from the new coronavirus, making it the second nation to pass China’s death toll of nearly 3,300. Italy was the first country to reach that sobering milestone. Its death toll has surged to over 7,500, by far the worst in the world. It’s gotten so bad that military trucks are transporting coffins out of hard-hit Bergamo. The U.S. is trying to avoid the same fate, though Mr. Cuomo said the state’s needs are still outpacing projected capacity and supplies. Projections put the expected need for hospital beds at 140,000, though the current capacity is about 53,000. Yet coupled with his order that hospitals expand capacity by 50%, plus additional makeshift hospitals being set up with FEMA assistance and other measures, the total supply could end up somewhere around 119,000 beds. Mr. Cuomo said they might have to borrow an idea from Italy, in which one ventilator could be used on multiple patients. Mr. Cuomo said the state is going to need 30,000 ventilators. There are 4,000 in the system, the state purchased an additional 7,000, and the federal government is sending 4,000, he said. The governor is urging the White House to use a “rolling deployment” of ventilators and other gear as different places in the country see a peak in cases. “Let’s talk about addressing the critical need in that hot spot,” he said. “Once you address that hotspot .. then shift to the next hot spot.” Mr. Trump said he’s ready to invoke the Defense Production Act to direct companies to produce more equipment, though companies are coming forward on their own. “It’s a great point of leverage, it’s a great negotiating tool,” Mr. Trump said of the Korean War-era law. Mr. Trump says testing, which lagged at first, is increasing exponentially and now exceeds that of South Korea, which won praise for its response to the coronavirus — although the Asian country conducted more testing per capita. Mr. Trump requested medical equipment from South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday, according to Yonhap News Agency.

"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - The man who committed the worst atrocity in New Zealand’s modern history when he slaughtered 51 worshippers at two Christchurch mosques unexpectedly pleaded guilty to all charges Thursday. The attacks targeting people praying at the mosques a year ago shocked the nation and prompted new laws banning the deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons. It also prompted global changes to social media protocols after the gunman livestreamed his attack on Facebook, where it was viewed by hundreds of thousands of people. The sudden turn in the case took survivors and relatives by surprise, and brought relief to people across New Zealand. Many had feared Australian white supremacist Brenton Harrison Tarrant would try to use his trial as a platform to promote his views. He’d outlined those views in a 74-page manifesto he published online shortly before the attacks. Tarrant, 29, pleaded guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one count of terrorism at the Christchurch High Court. He had previously pleaded not guilty to all charges and his trial had been scheduled to start in June. Tarrant is the first person to be found guilty of terrorism in New Zealand under laws passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S. The change in plea came less than two weeks after New Zealanders commemorated those who died on the anniversary of the March 15, 2019, attacks. “Honestly, I’m still trying to process what just happened,” said Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein was killed in the attack on the Al Noor mosque. “I feel conflicted.” She said that on the one hand, she had wanted to find out more details about what happened at the trial but on the other hand was feeling relieved about not having to face the trauma of sitting through it. Temel Atacocugu, who survived being shot nine times during the attack at Al Noor, said he was surprised by the turn of events and hoped the judge would set an example at the sentencing by imposing the harshest punishment in the country’s history and helping ensure nothing like it would happen again. “I’m happy that he has accepted that he is guilty,” Atacocugu said. ,Judge Cameron Mander has not yet set a sentencing date. Tarrant faces life imprisonment, with the judge having some discretion in deciding the minimum number of years Tarrant must serve before becoming eligible for parole. The change in plea came at a hastily arranged court hearing at a time that New Zealand was beginning a four-week lockdown to try and combat the new coronavirus. The lockdown meant Tarrant appeared in the court via video link from his jail cell in Auckland and only a handful of people were allowed inside the courtroom, including the imams from the two mosques that were attacked.  Mander said it was unfortunate the lockdown prevented victims and family members from being able to attend the hearing but the imams were helping to represent them. He said he wanted to quickly move ahead with the hearing, especially with the COVID-19 response threatening delays to the court schedule. Tarrant, who was wearing a gray prison sweater, showed little emotion as he pleaded guilty. He didn’t indicate why he had changed his pleas, and his lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.  New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who was praised around the world for her empathetic response to the Muslim community after the attacks, said it was “deeply disappointing” the victims didn’t get to attend the hearing. But she said there was “a certain sense of relief that the whole nation, but particularly our Muslim community, are being spared from a trial that could have otherwise acted as a platform.”  Tarrant moved to New Zealand in 2017 and kept a low profile in the university city of Dunedin. He frequented a gym, practiced shooting at a rifle club range and built up an arsenal of weapons. He didn’t appear to be employed, and said in some online posts that he’d inherited a significant amount of money when his father died.  Tarrant appeared to have a fascination with religious conflicts in Europe and the Balkans, and visited a number of sites in Eastern Europe in the years before he committed the massacre. After his attack at the second mosque, Tarrant was driving, possibly to carry out a shooting at a third mosque, when two police officers rammed his car off the road, dragged him out and arrested him.

"Election officials across the country are scrambling to craft contingency plans for elections amid the coronavirus outbreak, seeking to balance public health and citizens’ constitutional rights. Some are pushing for increased vote-by-mail and absentee opportunities, though the unprecedented situation means most are flying somewhat blind ahead of upcoming primaries and the November general election. “It’s tough right now,” said Derek Muller, a professor at Pepperdine University’s Caruso School of Law. “This is not the time to create a new election regime in seven months. This is a time to figure out how we can make do in November, and then maybe you can think about what 2024 might look like.” Without finding a proper balance ahead of November, the country faces the prospect of effectively disenfranchising people who fear they’ll contract the virus if they trek to the polls or putting the public in danger, particularly the elderly, if there aren’t enough alternatives and proper safeguards. There could even be questions surrounding the legitimacy of the results if turnout is substantially depressed and voters feel they weren’t offered enough safe options other than voting on Election Day. This week, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced that he was mailing absentee ballot request forms to every one of the estimated 6.9 million voters in the state. His office said people who want to vote in-person will still be able to do so, but that poll workers will get additional resources to clean equipment properly and that he is trying to help counties hire younger poll workers to avoid the need for elderly people to risk their health. “Georgia has faced challenges before and overcome them, and we can do so again through the grit and ingenuity that has made America a shining example for democracies around the world,” he said. Georgia postponed its March 24 presidential primary to May 19 in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske announced similar plans this week to conduct an all-mail election for the June 9 primary in the state. Her office said all active registered voters in the state will be mailed an absentee ballot, but that there will still be at least one in-person polling location in every county. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate issued a directive extending the absentee voting period to 40 days for people voting by mail in his state’s June primary. “We still plan on having polls open on June 2 for voters who prefer to cast ballots in-person, but this effort will help reduce the risk of infecting others,” Mr. Pate said. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is pushing a “postage-paid vote-by-mail” election for people who haven’t yet voted. Under that plan, the state would mail an absentee ballot request to every registered voter in the state who hasn’t yet voted, while keeping limited in-person locations open for the planned June 2 election. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine had blown past a judge’s ruling to invoke a public health emergency and delay in-person voting in his state’s March 17 presidential primary due to public health concerns over COVID-19. The action comes after Arizona, Illinois, and Florida pressed forward with their March 17 presidential primary contests despite the escalating outbreak. Voters were greeted with polling locations that were closed or had delayed openings as workers were wary of venturing out in public after President Trump announced federal guidance a day earlier saying people should avoid crowds of more than 10 people. A day after the Arizona primary, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs called on the state legislature to grant local boards the authority to conduct an “all-mail” election for the 2020 primary and general elections in August and November respectively. “Under these circumstances and the current uncertainty we face, allowing for all-mail elections would enable counties to conduct fair and secure elections and ensure that voters can safely vote despite an ongoing public health emergency,” Ms. Hobbs said in a letter to state legislative leaders. Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said a good idea in the short term would be to expand no-excuse absentee voting, saying a complete shift to all-mail elections isn’t necessarily a perfect solution. “They’re generally run well,” he said. “I would not want to try something new, so radical, in a high-stakes election like a presidential election for the first time.” Five states had already switched to holding elections almost entirely by mail: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. Mr. Muller said vote-by-mail isn’t best for everyone. For example, he pointed out the frequent difficulties for those living on American Indian reservations — a concern Ms. Hobbs acknowledged in her letter — or some voters with disabilities. “You still have to have some kind of in-person opportunities,” he said. “Somebody spoils the ballot or doesn’t [get] the ballot, they’re going to have to physically show up, too. It can reduce some of the strain, I think, by having no-excuse absentee voting or opportunities where you don’t have lots of people standing in lines.” Senate Democrats on Wednesday said they secured $400 million in the emerging $2 trillion economic rescue package that could go toward helping states expand vote-by-mail and early voting efforts ahead of November. Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Ron Wyden of Oregon are pushing legislation that would prod states to expand early voting and vote-by-mail. “While this funding is a step in the right direction, we must enact election reforms across the country as well as secure more resources to guarantee safe and secure elections,” Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Wyden said in a joint statement. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat and a co-sponsor of the bill, expressed concern earlier this month that other governors - or even President Trump - could look to the precedent Mr. DeWine set and potentially invoke a health emergency to try to delay November’s election. Mr. Trump doesn’t have the power to cancel the election, said Samuel Issacharoff, a constitutional law professor at the NYU School of Law. “The pattern that elections can be postponed or can be suspended, especially in a presidential year, is a very dangerous one,” Mr. Issacharoff said. “If Lincoln could hold elections during the Civil War, it’s really hard to see why President Trump can’t hold elections during a public health emergency.”  ",Coronavirus forces election officials across U.S. to craft contingency plans,"Wednesday, March 25, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-forces-election-officials-across-us-cr/,washington_times
"VENTURA, Calif. (AP) - A California judge has been publicly censured for making dozens of sexist, racially insensitive and dishonest remarks from the bench over a decade, the state Commission on Judicial Performance announced Wednesday. The commission said Judge Jeffrey G. Bennett of Ventura County Superior Court consented to the discipline, which is a step below removal from office. The commission said that Bennett, who was elected in 2008, committed 28 acts of misconduct that violated the state Code of Judicial Ethics.  Most involved remarks “that are offensive, undignified, discourteous, dishonest, sexist, and profane, and that created the appearance of bias and retaliation,” the commission said. “Such comments included remarks to an African American criminal defendant about ’shucking and jiving,’ making crude references to his anatomy, commenting about ‘chicks’ liking a car and about not spending so much time with his telescope if he had a ‘20-year-old smoking hot wife,’ and using profanity in other remarks, according to a commission statement. Bennett acknowledged nearly all of the misconduct, the commission said. Earlier this month, Bennett’s attorneys told the Ventura County Star that the judge “is known for his refreshing ‘tell it like it is’ approach to life and his sense of humor” but that he had apologized to the commission and “implemented a thoughtfully developed plan for improvement and change.”  ",Ventura County judge censured for offensive remarks,"Wednesday, March 25, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/25/ventura-county-judge-censured-for-offensive-remark/,washington_times
"Forget about kissing babies, pressing the flesh or snapping selfies. The coronavirus outbreak has brought a crashing halt to traditional campaigning, forcing candidates to find innovative ways to connect with voters while complying with the social distancing guidelines that define this brave new world. Some even turned to dating apps. Florida Republican Christy McLaughlin tapped into digital apps that allow for more personalized, one-on-one interactions traditionally used for finding love — or hookups — as a way to build relationships with voters. She opened accounts on Tinder, Hinge and Bumble to attract voters to support her bid to replace GOP Rep. Francis Rooney in Florida’s 19th congressional district. Mr. Rooney decided not to run for re-election last year. Ms. McLaughlin, who will be 25 when voters cast their ballots later this year, said she also plans on tossing together FaceTime parties to interact face-to-face with potential voters and is using Snapchat as well. “I figured it would help me reach voters I wouldn’t meet otherwise at club events, and given the quarantine, I typically won’t find them on Facebook either because of lack of mutual friends,” Ms. McLaughlin said. “It is a different group that I am reaching out to in a technological grassroots way.” She said the platforms make it possible for her to message 60 people at any time, and she has even been able to reach older voters who are not the dating applications’ primary demographic. “It’s as if I went to an event and then I talked to a bunch of people individually for a few minutes, but this time you aren’t feeling cramped for time,” she said, noting she had 60 messages from prospective voters with questions awaiting her when she woke up Wednesday morning. The digital campaign efforts go all the way to the top of the ticket. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s Democratic presidential run had momentum, but his omnipresence in mass media got bumped by the coronavirus pandemic. Grounded in his Delaware home because of social distancing guidelines to slow the virus’ spread, Mr. Biden has taken to counterprogramming White House press briefings from a lectern placed in front of a bookshelf. “I’ve been there in the situation room,” Mr. Biden said in a briefing from his rec room. “There are thousands of steps that need to be taken all at once. You need to be planning not just for today but for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Is the White House actively planning for what it will take for the American people to begin to return to something resembling a normal life? I don’t know.” Not satisfied with live streaming from home, Mr. Biden’s search for new tools has reportedly included huddling with the leadership of NowThis News, a digital content organization with a penchant for producing short viral videos benefiting liberal candidates and causes. Some candidates are finding the coronavirus is making it more difficult to gain traction against incumbents with strong name-recognition and a better-established foothold. Arizona candidates have fewer than two weeks remaining to get the signatures necessary to qualify for the ballot. Social distancing guidelines are making it hard to meet voters for Anne Marie Ward, who is challenging incumbent Republican Rep. Paul Gosar in Arizona’s 4th congressional district. To help her gain attention, Ms. Ward made a campaign ad featuring her firing a Barrett M82a1 .50-caliber rifle mounted atop her Humvee in which she asks for people to help her get on the ballot. “If you love God, guns and the great state of Arizona as much as I do, click the link below, sign my petition, and get my name on the ballot,” Ms. Ward said in the digital ad. Her campaign is running the ad on Facebook, primarily aimed at male voters. Being prolific on social media during the coronavirus crisis is critical to a campaign’s success. Eric Wilson, a digital strategist training Republicans, held a webinar Tuesday recommending candidates and campaigns post three-to-five times on Facebook per day and seven or more times on Twitter. He told the campaigns to remember not to simply broadcast their message but to also interact with their audience to successfully use social media and not turn it into “sociopath media.” “Think of your social media channel like a network exec would with his television network or her television network,” Mr. Wilson said. “Think about the different programming that can come into play: You can be behind the scenes, you can be offering documentary-style, you could be doing hard news, you could do entertainment. Think about the different programming you can offer and then stick to that style, offer it consistently.” In calls-to-action via email, Mr. Wilson said the average reader will spend 13 seconds digesting the information. He said to think about the attention span of the audience as compared to the length of an average NASCAR race pitstop and coached the campaigns to present a clear and concise message. With varying predictions about how long the coronavirus outbreak could sideline business-as-usual for candidates and campaigns, Mr. Wilson said to plan on disruption lasting indefinitely and told campaigns to focus on digital content.

"HELENA, Mont. (AP) - State and local law enforcement officers in Montana do not have the authority to arrest people on federal civil immigration detainers, the Montana Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. “This is a major victory for immigrants in Montana,” Alex Rate, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana, said in a statement. “Immigrants throughout Montana must be treated the same as every other individual who is charged with a crime. They will enjoy the presumption of innocence, have the right to post bail and be free pending trial, and be free to step out from underneath the boot of over-aggressive federal immigration officials.” The 7-0 ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Montana and others against Lincoln County in October 2018 after Agustin Ramon - a dual resident of Mexico and France - was arrested on charges of stealing prescription medication from a neighbor’s house in Eureka in August 2018. Ramon’s bail was set at $25,000. But he did not post bond because the sheriff said he would comply with a Department of Homeland Security request to detain Ramon on their behalf for up to another 48 hours after any potential release date. The ACLU argued in January, and the Montana Supreme Court agreed, that telling Ramon he would not be released if he posted bond constituted another arrest and that Montana law does not give local law enforcement officers the authority to arrest people based on civil immigration detainers. “The Legislature has specifically authorized DHS officers to conduct arrest for state crimes … yet it has not done the inverse for state officers,” justices wrote. The Montana decision matches those in several other states, including Minnesota, Massachusetts and New York, said Dan Galindo, an attorney for the ACLU. The justices noted that while the Department of Homeland Security’s detainer policy is not a mandatory policy, President Donald Trump issued an executive order providing that “any jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply” with such requests “are not eligible to receive Federal grants.” “Depending on each jurisdiction’s dependence on federal funding, such policies promulgated by DHS and the President could result in unconstitutional ‘economic dragooning,’ ” the court noted in a footnote. Such coercion has been found unconstitutional in two California counties, the ruling states. “We are thrilled that the Supreme Court picked up on the coercive effect of ‘voluntary’ detainer requests,” Rate said. Justices Jim Rice, Dirk Sandefur and James Shea added that the ruling does not mean “that sheriffs are barred from any and all cooperation with federal authorities, such as communication between the agencies about detainees and their detention status, or cooperation in other arrest contexts.” An attorney for the Montana Association of Counties, who argued the case on behalf of Lincoln County, did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. Ramon pleaded guilty to burglary in January 2019 and was given a six-year deferred sentence. He spent 203 days in jail before he was deported to France.

"LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles County officials say they no longer are including a 17-year-old boy in the tally of coronavirus deaths until they do more to determine his precise cause of death. The county’s public health director, Barbara Ferrer, said Wednesday that she’s asked the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate the death of the youth from the desert city of Lancaster. She said that while the child did test positive for the coronavirus, there were “extenuating circumstances that pointed to an alternative diagnosis as well.” The death is no longer being counted among LA County’s 13 total fatalities from the virus. Gov. Gavin Newsom chided county officials, calling the backtrack a reminder that “in this moment it’s not just speed, it’s accuracy that must be front and center.” A report last week by the CDC found no coronavirus deaths in the U.S. among people 19 and under.

"The Senate passed the $2.2 trillion emergency stimulus package to assist the overly stressed health care system and tumbling economy Wednesday night. The bipartisan deal passed on a 96-0 vote. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell touted the unanimous vote as a victory for bipartisanship, despite a drawn-out partisan negotiation process. “We pivoted from one of the most partisan exercises you could ever be engaged in, to a bipartisan, 100 to nothing, $2 trillion rescue package for the country,” the Kentucky Republican said. “Not much to complain about on process when you get that kind of an outcome for the country.” Several senators missed votes because they were self-quarantined. Senate Majority Whip John Thune, South Dakota Republican, was one of the latest to miss the votes; he flew home Wednesday because he wasn’t feeling well. His spokesman said Mr. Thune consulted with the attending Senate physician and his family doctor, and was told, based on how he was feeling, that “there was no need for additional action at this point and [he] was encouraged to continue self-monitoring.” The bill will give $500 billion in direct payments to the American public, bolster unemployment insurance with a surge of $250 billion, provide $500 billion in loans to big businesses, and create a $350 billion loan program for small businesses. It also funnels $130 billion into the stretched-thin health-care system to get more resources and equipment to those directly fighting the disease. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said there’s no way to know when the “plague” will end in the U.S. “When there’s a crisis of this magnitude, the private sector cannot solve it,” Mr. Schumer said. “Government is the only force large enough to staunch the bleeding and begin the healing. This is a time when the American people need their government.” The bill now needs to clear the House for final passage. House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, announced during the vote that his chamber will take up the package via a voice vote at 9 a.m. Friday. A voice vote will be unrecorded, but members can still debate and enter their votes in the Congressional record. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on PBS NewsHour earlier Wednesday evening that her party is already looking ahead to address what they would have liked to see in this third coronavirus package in subsequent bills. The Senate stands adjourned until April 20 now that the package has passed out of their chamber. Mr. McConnell said senators would have 24 hours notice if they need to return before then. “Let’s continue to pray for one another, for all of our families and for our country,” he said.

"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday said there could well be significant economic pain in the short term in light of the coronavirus outbreak but that there also could be a “good rebound” on the other side of the crisis. “You may well see significant rises in unemployment, significant declines in economic activity, but there can also be a good rebound on the other side of that and that’s actually one of the main things we’re trying to do by assuring the flow of credit in the economy and keeping rates low,” Mr. Powell said on NBC’s “Today” program. “We may well be in a recession,” he acknowledged, while saying there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with the economy and that it performed well through February. Mr. Powell did say he’s not sure about the exact time frame for such a bounceback. “What I’m saying is we don’t know,” he said. “And the sooner we get through this period and get the virus under control, the sooner the recovery can come. We don’t have comparable experiences to go back and look at.” “We know that economic activity will decline, probably substantially, in the second quarter, but I think many expect and I would expect economic activity to resume and move back up the second half of the year,” he said. “Very hard to say precisely when that will be, and it will really depend on the spread of the virus. The virus is going to dictate the timetable here.” Earlier this week, the Fed said it would buy Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities “in the amounts needed” to support the markets as part of new emergency measures to try to mitigate the financial effects of COVID-19. Mr. Powell said the Fed’s authority does not amount to a “blank check.” “It’s not a blank check in the sense that we are limited by the ability to take losses,” he said. “In certain circumstances like the present, we do have the ability to essentially use our emergency lending authorities and the only limit on that will be how much backstop we get from the Treasury Department.” The Fed cut its target interest rate to nearly zero earlier this month, but Mr. Powell said they have “policy room” elsewhere to support the economy.

"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday pumped the brakes on talk of a fourth or even fifth legislative package from Capitol Hill in response to the expanding coronavirus outbreak. He predicted that the House would soon pass a $2 trillion-plus financial rescue package that cleared the Senate Wednesday evening and said it would then be time to let the money go to work. “I’d take a deep breath,” the California Republican said on “Fox & Friends” when asked about more rounds of legislative action. “Let’s let this work…we don’t need to be crafting another bill right now. Let’s let these $2 trillion go to work for us, plus the $8 billion ahead of time and the billions of dollars that we just passed on the second bill.” The House is expected to take up the $2.2 trillion rescue package on Friday morning. Before the “phase three” legislation, Congress had also cleared an $8.3 billion bill to boost federal health funding and a $105 billion bill to try to expand free COVID-19 testing and bolster some safety net programs. The new $2.2 trillion package provides for one-time direct payments of $1,200 for many Americans, plus about $367 billion to help small businesses make payroll, $500 billion in loans for distressed corporations, and more money for hospitals, states, and localities. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said this week that factoring in some $4 trillion of lending authority for the Federal Reserve, the total stimulus could add up to about $6 trillion, or 30% of GDP.

"HAGATNA, Guam (AP) - The governor of Guam temporarily suspended some parts of the Open Government Law in response to the coronavirus outbreak, including the public’s right to attend government meetings. Democratic Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero signed the executive order Tuesday to suspend open meeting rights through April 13, The Pacific Daily News reported  Wednesday. Guam Attorney General Leevin Taitano Camacho recommended suspending sections of the Open Government Law, Leon Guerrero said. Boards and commissions in the U.S. territory will be required to keep minutes and provide meeting information to the governor, lawmakers and the Office of Public Accountability. The governor is authorized by Guam law to suspend the operating rules for government agencies during a public health emergency, she said. Guam declared a health emergency due to the coronavirus outbreak, closing schools and businesses and placing arriving travelers under quarantine. Residents have been asked to practice social distancing. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. Guam had 37 confirmed cases of the virus and one death as of Wednesday, officials said. “Public attendance at public meetings will make it difficult to comply with the social distancing directive,” Leon Guerrero said. Public notice requirements under the Open Government Law could make it difficult for the government to act quickly, she said. “So we can efficiently meet if we have to meet,” Leon Guerrero said. “So people can work very expeditiously to address the crisis as it happens. It is my hope this suspension will end on the 13th of April.”  ",Guam governor suspends public meeting rights due to virus,"Thursday, March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/26/guam-governor-suspends-public-meeting-rights-due-t/,washington_times

"NEW YORK (AP) - Rosario Dawson has graced both the big and small screens, in everything from dramas to comedies to Marvel superhero projects, yet she’s rarely been cast as the lead in a project. That has changed with her USA series “ Briarpatch” where she plays fashionable political fixer Allegra Dill, who returns home to her Texas border town following the bombing death of her police officer sister. She’s turning over all stones, attempting to solve the murder in the quirky, gumshoe drama, which made its debut last month. “I’m not used to being No. 1 on the call sheet and the few times that I have have been small little indie films that I’ve produced myself,” said Dawson.  She says she doesn’t take the series for granted: “I know a lot of actors who shoot pilots and then the show doesn’t ever get picked up and continue. And then we did.” Dawson has consistently stayed busy both on Hollywood sets and political stages with former Democratic presidential candidate and current boyfriend, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (Booker sat in on the interview, snapping pictures with his phone). However, she calls this her toughest role to date, balancing the strenuous physical challenges of the role with her personal challenges as her father battles pancreatic cancer. “It just was so interesting, vacillating between this incredibly raw emotional experience with my dad and then playing this character who is trying to figure out how to deal with her grief and even appreciating her grief because she just lived such a hard life,” said Dawson. “I’ve just never had so many of all of my faculties and energies being pulled out at once.” The Associated Press spoke with Dawson about being a leading actor, inclusion in Hollywood and her longstanding commitment to political activism. Questions and answers have been edited for brevity. ___ AP: What’s this role been like for you as the star of the series? Dawson: I got to see all these different things, not just the intensity of the work and the rigor that’s demanded, but really also the opportunity to be there every single day. There’s so much of so many films and projects that I’ve worked on that I missed because I wasn’t on set. AP: You’ve always been vocal about representation, and even though streaming services have allowed for more diversity, it’s doesn’t seem to reflect that in awards shows like the Oscars. Dawson: The gatekeepers of culture have looked in a very particular way for a really long time, and the reality is they still do. They had a very particular strong hold on want that content would look like. But now with streaming services, there’s demand and they’re starving for as much content as possible. So I think the financial aspect has definitely piqued people’s interest to be more inclusive and more representative.  AP: Eva Longoria and Zoe Saldana joined the LA Collab initiative which hopes to double Latino representation in Hollywood by 2030. Do you think that can help? (A study by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that less than 5% of the nearly 50,000 of speaking or named characters in films from the last 12 years were Latino.) Dawson: We have we have a lot more work to do, especially when you talk about the Latinx community, because we over-index online, we over-consume everything … we’re the largest minority in the country. … The power is there - it’s being recognized. But right now, it’s mostly just being commodified and like taken in as a consumer sort of perspective and what we’re really needing to (do is) push back.  AP: This is the 15th anniversary of Voto Latino, your voter mobilization organization and you’re also in a relationship with a former Democratic presidential candidate. Do you know who you’ll support now? Dawson: This year, and that’s something Cory and I talk about actually quite a lot, is just how critical, and I think we’re seeing that on a regular basis, just how critical it is to have representation that’s actually repetitive of this nation in Congress and in the Senate. And so for me, that’s probably my biggest focus now that he’s no longer the front runner that I can support in the presidential race … But for me, more - not more than that - but I think, in equal terms, but in a sense more because it only happens every 10 years, is the census. That is something that is, I think, really, really critical. And we’re going to see a lot of fervor around this presidential election, but we’re not hearing nearly enough about the census. … So that’s something that I’m really pushing for. ____ Follow AP entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton at twitter.com/garyghamilton  ",Rosario Dawson relishes being the lead on new TV drama ,"Thursday, March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/26/rosario-dawson-relishes-being-the-lead-on-new-tv-d/,washington_times
"Win the West, a new super PAC backing Democratic presidential hopeful Joseph R. Biden, launched a new effort Thursday aimed at defending blue states in the 2020 election and going “on the offensive” in states such as Texas and Arizona that have been trending purple.

As part of its push, the group rolled out a “Leadership Matters” digital ad that uses Mr. Trump’s own words against him, highlighting his push to make budget cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as his assertions that the administration had the coronavirus outbreak “totally under control,” that the virus is a “new hoax” and that it will “one day — it is like a miracle — it will disappear.” The spot then pivots to a speech in which Mr. Biden says the most important job of the president is to protect the health and safety of Americans. “Downplaying it, being overly dismissive or spreading misinformation is only going to hurt us and further advantage the spread of the disease,” Mr. Biden says in the footage. “This administration has left us woefully unprepared for the exact crisis we now face.”  ",New pro-Biden super PAC targets Western battleground states,"Thursday, March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/26/new-pro-biden-super-pac-win-west-launches/,washington_times
"SAN DIEGO (AP) - Immigration attorneys have sported swim goggles and masks borrowed from friends to meet with clients in detention centers. Masked judges are stocking their cramped courtrooms with hand sanitizer for hearings they want to do by phone. While much of daily life has ground to a halt to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, the Trump administration is resisting calls from immigration judges and attorneys to stop in-person hearings and shutter all immigration courts. They say the most pressing hearings can still be done by phone so immigrants aren’t stuck in detention indefinitely. The Justice Department on Monday postponed hearings for asylum-seekers waiting in Mexico, but only after judges in San Diego defied orders to keep their courtrooms running amid the pandemic. The government has delayed hearings for immigrants who aren’t in detention but is moving forward for those who are.  Suspected coronavirus infections have forced immigration courts in New York, New Jersey and Colorado to temporarily shut down in the past week. As a precaution, the government announced the closure of several more Wednesday and said others would be reopened only to accept documents. But many of the 68 U.S. immigration courts continue to hold hearings. That’s leaving judges and attorneys to try to protect themselves. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told lawyers to bring their own masks and gloves, which many hospitals can’t even find. And social distancing in a small courtroom is challenging, with judges passing paperwork back and forth to legal assistants while lawyers and immigrants’ families crowd in. Interpreters fly across the country for hearings. Immigration lawyers and unions for judges and the Homeland Security Department’s own attorneys have jointly demanded that all courts close. “We know the coronavirus is contagious even when people are not symptomatic, and so everyone is very concerned about it. It’s not enough to be reactive. At that point, it’s too late,” said Samuel Cole, an immigration judge in Chicago who is also spokesman for the National Association of Immigration Judges. “So everyone is being put at risk.” Rules change daily as the virus spreads and officials struggle to figure out how and whether they can keep the massive system running. Officials have not ruled out a total closure but were closing specific courts and delaying hearings.  The Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees U.S. immigration courts, said in an email to The Associated Press that it continually evaluates the situation and makes decisions based on public health information. Some courts may close even without a confirmed exposure. “Depending on the nature, scale, scope, and extent of any incident,” the immigration court system will respond appropriately including closing courts, said spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly. She said the court system encourages the use of video teleconferencing for hearings and telephonic appearances by practitioners to reduce the risk. No one, she said, is required to file documents in person. The immigration courts face a backlog of 1.1 million cases, and in many places, lawyers are considered essential workers exempt from state and city orders to stay home. In the criminal courts, some trials have been delayed and some states have closed courtrooms as the virus spreads.  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  Some immigration judges are telecommuting, while others are simply refusing to come in, according to the judges’ union. At a New York City immigration court, attorneys arrived Monday to find all three immigration judges absent, said Andrea Saenz, supervising attorney for Brooklyn Defender Services, which represents detained immigrants.  Hours later, her attorneys learned that the court was closing after a suspected infection. Attorneys say they’re having to decide between risking their health by going to court or staying away and having their client miss out on being released from detention. “It’s a disaster,” Saenz said. In New Jersey, requests for such hearings can be made online, and have been granted them rapidly. But in New York, they are often ignored, attorneys say. After a New York attorney got no response, the immigrant’s mother took a train from Long Island and then a New York City subway to court to hand-deliver the lawyer’s written request for a telephone hearing. The woman has since been diagnosed with the coronavirus, according to a letter from the Association of Deportation Defense Attorneys to the Executive Office for Immigration Review. “Can you imagine the number of people she came into contact with as the result of the decision to keep this court open?” the letter asked. While hearings by phone work for some cases, they don’t for children, according to attorneys who want those proceedings postponed. “How are we supposed to make sure they’re understanding things?” said Laura Barrera, managing attorney for the Tucson Children’s Program at the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project. She said she asked to delay hearings set for Friday for 11 children in government custody but was denied. Now, the plan is to gather together the children from different shelters for a hearing by video, putting them at risk of exposing each other to the virus, Barrera said.  Attorneys also are struggling to meet with their adult clients to build cases. Immigration lawyers in Arizona have been told that detention centers require visitors to wear a surgical mask, eye wear and medical gloves, which are hard to come by even for health providers. Attorney Margarita Silva improvised. When she reached a detention facility in Eloy, Arizona, on Monday, she was wearing her husband’s land surveyor goggles, a mask she borrowed from a friend and medical gloves she got from a hardware store. She said she felt ridiculous wearing the gear to meet a new client. “My goggles were fogging up because every time I breathe into my mask, it goes to my goggles,” Silva said. Another lawyer had only a mask and a second donned swimming goggles, while the guards and detainees at the facility wore nothing, she said. Silva said she wishes immigration authorities would release detainees who don’t have a criminal history or only minor infractions, like her client. That, she said, would relieve the need for so many court hearings. ___ Taxin reported from Orange County, California.

"A majority of Democratic voters support former Vice President Joe Biden’s commitment to pick a woman running mate, and a plurality of those voters want him to select Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to a new Economist/YouGov poll. Eighty percent of Democratic voters surveyed said they supported Mr. Biden’s decision to pick a woman. A plurality of Democrats, 27%, said they want Ms. Warren as his running mate when presented with five different potential nominees, a ‘someone else’ option, and an unsure option. Sen. Kamala Harris received 18% support for her potential vice-presidential candidacy, followed by “not sure” at 14%, Sen. Bernie Sanders at 13% support, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 10% support. “Warren leads in every age group, and with both men and women,” wrote Kathy Frankovic, YouGov polling consultant. “She is well ahead with liberals, while moderate and conservative Democratic voters have no clear favorite.” Whomever Mr. Biden selects could affect his favorability among independents. The Economist/YouGov poll showed Mr. Biden’s favorability rating underwater with independents, while scoring high favorability marks from Democrats and high unfavorability marks from Republicans. A plurality of independents hold a ‘very unfavorable’ or ‘somewhat unfavorable’ view of Mr. Biden, 46%, compared to 37% of independents who view Mr. Biden ‘somewhat’ or ‘very’ favorably. The Economist/YouGov poll surveyed 1,500 U.S. adults from March 22-24 and has a 3.2% margin of error.

"The conservative humorists at Politizoid have reentered the digital arena for the 2020 campaign season, sensing that President Trump’s use of Twitter to boost memes and content supporting his candidacy has “opened a door” for their work. With a captive audience attributable to the coronavirus outbreak’s social distancing requirements nationwide, Politizoid is planning to regularly produce content in the run-up to November. Politizoid formed more than a decade ago to create funny animation lifting Republican lawmakers back into power in 2010. The group faded to the periphery in subsequent years but returned alongside the impeachment of Mr. Trump to lambast the president’s critics. Politizoid’s creative director, who asked to remain anonymous so that his non-political work in Hollywood would not suffer from his conservative politics, said Mr. Trump has instilled new hope in California conservatives. “So many in the political realm still hold to the old adage of running TV ads and now Facebook and such that ‘just run your ads from August to November and just hit em hard,’ but most people really don’t tune into those ads,” Politizoid’s creative director said. “Those that hold the opposing political ideology, they got a 24/7 messaging machine going, and that’s where Politizoid can help really kind of counter [it].” An animated video “Schiff Hits the Fan” depicting Rep. Adam Schiff’s failure to remove President Trump from office as akin to Looney Tunes character Wile E. Coyote’s failed effort to nab Road Runner went viral last fall and represented Politizoid’s entrance into 2020 politics. That initial video racked up more than 500,000 views on YouTube and nearly one million views on Twitter where it was shared by White House social media director Dan Scavino, with many views coming across other platforms as well. Politizoid’s creative director said he is already at work preparing to lampoon former Vice President Joe Biden in the coming months. “I just find it interesting though that ten years later, we’re still animating the same people,” Politizoid’s creative director said. “I guess you could say we’re dusting off our Biden character, getting ready to put him back to work.”  ",Conservative animator mobilizing to boost Trump's 2020 campaign,"Thursday, March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/26/conservative-animator-mobilizing-boost-trumps-2020/,washington_times
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday batted aside talk that he could be part of the 2020 Democratic presidential ticket amid a rise in his national profile during the expanding coronavirus outbreak. “I don’t want to be vice president,” Mr. Cuomo said on WAMC radio. “I told the people of the state of New York I wanted to be governor and I said I would serve as governor and that’s what I want to do.” Host Alan Chartock had raised the possibility and pointed to a recent poll showing Mr. Cuomo with a 73% approval rating among New York City voters. “I am not doing anything different than I have done all my life, right?” Mr. Cuomo said. “I do what I do, right? It’s the same process for me, but to the extent it helps people now, I’m happy.” Seemingly trying to stir the pot, Mr. Chartock pointed out that the same poll showed New York Mayor Bill de Blasio — a sometimes frenemy of Mr. Cuomo — had an approval rating of 40%. Mr. Cuomo has been front and center during the COVID-19 crisis as chief executive of the hardest-hit state. He’s had an on-again, off-again relationship with President Trump and his daily updates on the virus’s impact on New York are routinely broadcast on national cable networks. “People are dying,” the governor said. “There’s nothing I can do about it. I’m trying to do everything I can do. I’m working 24 hours a day. “I think I know how to help, but I can’t stop it. I cannot stop it, and it hurts me,” he continued. “And you know, you talk about the poll says this, the poll says that. I look at that death count and it breaks my heart, and those are the numbers I’m watching.” Earlier in the day, Mr. Cuomo reported that there have been 385 coronavirus-related deaths in New York, up from 285 deaths he had reported Wednesday. The running mate point could be moot, as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden has already said he would tap a woman to be on the ticket if he’s the Democratic nominee. Mr. Biden has accumulated a delegate lead that will be almost impossible for Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, the lone remaining major Democratic contender, to overcome. With traditional campaigning on hold because of the coronavirus, Mr. Biden has been largely relegated to his Wilmington, Delaware home and has been making sporadic media appearances and virtual addresses.

"The White House, under pressure to level the peak of coronavirus infections, is pushing back against “frightening” high-end statistical modeling, one of which has nearly the entire planet catching the virus this year. Dr. Deborah Birx, President Trump’s go-to expert at daily COVID-19 briefings, pointed to estimates that has 600,000 infections in the Chinese city of Wuhan and its surroundings, or that more than half of Germany will be infected. “I know that it has become a place where people are looking at numbers rather than what is needed, because if you do these projections, when you got to those projections that said, like a Germany and others, that implied that 60 percent or 50 percent of the population would get infected, I want to be very clear,” Dr. Birx said at Wednesday’s briefing. “The only way that happens is this virus remains continuously moving through populations in this cycle, and the fall cycle, and another cycle. She added, “I think the numbers that have been put out there are actually very frightening to people. But I can tell you, if you go back and look at Wuhan and Hubei and all of these provinces, when they talk about 60,000 people being infected, even if you said, all right, well, there’s asymptomatics and all of that, so you get to 600,000 people out of 80 million. “That is nowhere close to the numbers that you see people putting out there. I think it has frightened the American people. I think on a freely, on a model that you just run fallout, you can get to those numbers if you have zero controls and you do nothing. And we know that every American is doing something.” A main driver of doomsday predictions is Imperial College in London’s epidemiology center and professor Neil Ferguson. Mr. Ferguson and a colleague posted a new report on Thursday saying that without stringent social distancing and government intervention, the world will suffer 7 billion infections out of a population of 7.8 billion, with 40 millions deaths. Imperial college said that with decisive action those numbers could be cut in half–––20 million dead and 3.5 billion infected.. Skeptics say these numbers are unlikely. China, with one billion people, appears to have put a lid on the morality count at just over 3,100, if the communist regime’s numbers are to be believed. South Korean also has limited deaths to under 200. The U.S. death count is rising fairly rapidly this week. The number doubled in four days, pushing over 1,000 out of about 70,000 confirmed cases. Coronavirus tests, at first limited, have reached a steady pace nearing 500,000 competed. This Tuesday is the White House’s imposed deadline for statistically showing that the infection rate is beginning to level off. The news media credits Imperial College’s drastic predictions with prompting the United Kingdom and U.S. government officials to shut down big sections of their economies to force business closures and keep people at home. “Sobering coronavirus study prompted Britain to toughen its approach,” Reuters reported on March 18, pointing to Mr. Ferguson’s charts. He said 2 million Americans and 500,000 in Britain would die unless severe an social separation is imposed. “To avoid a rebound in transmission, these policies will need to be maintained until large stocks of vaccine are available to immunize the population—which could be 18 months or more,” said Imperial’s authors. “However, there are very large uncertainties around the transmission of this virus, the likely effectiveness of different policies and the extent to which the population spontaneously adopts risk reducing behaviors.” A number of U.S officials have repeated Mr. Ferguson’s dark vision. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says as many as 80 percent of his  state’s 20 million population could contract the virus. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said his strict shut-down orders are to save “thousands of lives.” This week Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine said between 38,000 and 160,000 in the U.S. will die over the next four months, Yahoo News reported  ",White House dismisses doomsday COVID-19 death toll,"Thursday, March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/26/white-house-dismisses-doomsday-covid-19-death-toll/,washington_times
"President Trump’s job approval rating has soared to new heights since the coronavirus outbreak began. A new Pew Research Center survey found Mr. Trump’s approval rating scored its highest marks since March 2017. Mr. Trump’s approval rating has risen 5 percentage points since January, to 45%, while 52% of Americans disapprove of his job performance. “Trump’s approval rating has improved among both Republicans and Democrats,” according to the Pew Research Center. “Among Republicans and Republican learners, 85% now approve of Trump’s job performance, compared with 80% in January. Among Democrats and Democratic learners, the share approving increased from 7% to 12% over the same period.” Some of Mr. Trump’s sharpest gains came with black and Hispanic voters. Black and Hispanic voters’ approval of Mr. Trump rose 10 percentage points each since January. Eighteen percent of black voters now approve of Mr. Trump, and 37% of Hispanic voters do. Mr. Trump’s approval rating with women has also increased 6 percentage points in the same timeframe. The Pew Research Center’s findings are consistent with other recent polls finding approval of the president improving. For example, a Harris poll released last week showed Mr. Trump’s approval rating up 4 percentage points in under one week’s time.

"SEATTLE (AP) - Two detainees with health conditions that make them vulnerable to COVID-19 have been released from an immigration jail in Tacoma, their attorneys said Thursday. The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project and the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington sued March 16 on behalf of nine detainees with underlying conditions, saying they’d face special danger if the coronavirus spreads in the jail. A federal judge last week declined to immediately order their release, but after the attorneys filed another request on Tuesday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released two of the seven from its Northwest detention center. Matt Adams, legal director of the Immigrant Rights Project, said it’s not clear why those two were released while the others remain in custody.  ICE did not immediately return an email seeking comment. U.S. District Judge James L. Robart has ordered the agency to respond to the immigration rights groups’ latest filing by Monday. The released detainees are Alfredo Espinoza Garza, a Mexican citizen who previously had to be hospitalized for a heart attack he suffered while in detention, and Leonidas Plutin Hernandez, a 59-year-old Cuban with high blood pressure, Adams said. Concern has been mounting nationwide over what outbreaks in jails and prisons would mean for inmates and surrounding communities alike, as patients from large outbreaks behind bars could overwhelm hospitals. Several jurisdictions have taken steps to reduce jail populations. In Washington, attorneys have asked the state Supreme Court to order the release of older imates, those with underlying health conditions and those within 18 months of their release date. In his order denying release last week, Robart said he was aware of the gravity and rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 crisis, but that there is no evidence of an outbreak at the privately run, 1,575-bed jail. Nor had the plaintiffs shown that ICE’s precautions, which include suspending visitation and assessing detainees for symptoms, are inadequate, he said. Since then, the groups said, circumstances have changed: The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, citing the risk of the disease, ordered the release of a detainee pending a final decision on her case; two infectious disease experts retained by the Department of Homeland Security wrote a letter to Congress warning of the “tinderbox” conditions for the virus in immigration detention facilities; and ICE has had confirmed COVID cases among an employee and detainee in New Jersey.

"President Trump said Thursday he is redrafting his coronavirus guidelines so that governors can decide whether to maintain, tighten or relax “social distancing” measures that are slowing the spread of the disease but devastating the economy. In a letter, Mr. Trump told governors that expanded testing and disease-tracking models will help them label counties as high-, low- or medium-risk for transmission as they finetune policies that have brought normal life to a standstill. “I am deeply inspired by the unflinching dedication of Americans in every state who are rallying together to defeat the virus,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I look forward to witnessing that same boundless spirit drive our recovery and quickly return us to the path of exceptional health, safety and prosperity for all of our citizens.” Mr. Trump asked Americans to work and learn at home, avoid unnecessary travel and use takeout instead of entering restaurants for 15 days, a period that lasts until Tuesday. But the president has made it clear he wants to get places with a lighter level of transmission back to normal quickly. Mr. Trump, who faces reelection in November, is upset about the pandemic’s devastating impact on the once-robust economy and says the country wasn’t built to be shut down. His letter doesn’t explicitly say how the ranking system will work in easing restrictions that, in many places, have shuttered schools, turned church services into YouTube livestreams and closed many stores, leaving only necessities like gas stations, pharmacies and grocery stores. Mr. Trump will have the opportunity to fill in the gaps at a press conference later Thursday The president said this week he’d like to see the U.S. opened up and “raring to go” by Easter, or April 12. Governors are skittish about that timeline, saying the virus will dictate when they can get their economies running, though Mr. Trump’s letter suggests a step-by-step approach. “There is still a long battle ahead, but our efforts are already paying dividends,” he wrote. “As we enhance protections against the virus, Americans across the country are hoping the day will soon arrive when they can resume their normal economic, social and religious lives.”  ",Trump says new coronavirus guidelines are on the way,"Thursday, March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/26/donald-trump-says-new-coronavirus-guidelines-are-w/,washington_times
"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Wake County is now North Carolina’s largest county, the U.S. Census Bureau said on Thursday as its annual population estimates show the county containing Raleigh surpassing Mecklenburg County. The census said Wake County had an estimated 1,111,761 people as of July 1, with Mecklenburg close behind at 1,110,356. The July 2018 estimates by the census had Mecklenburg ahead of Wake by roughly 2,500 people. Mecklenburg, dominated by Charlotte and its banking, airline and other corporate hubs, had been comfortably ahead of Wake County for generations. Wake had last been North Carolina’s population leader during the 1890 census, according to data provided by the state demographer.  But Wake, with the continued expansion of the technology sector associated with Research Triangle Park, has been closing the gap during the 21st century. Raleigh and Charlotte historically have been competitors for the state’s political power and economic engines. While both counties have grown by 20% over the past decade, the in-migration of out-of-state residents to Wake County has been more robust, said Rebecca Tippett, director of Carolina Demography, a research consulting group affiliated with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “There are a lot of employers in the Triangle, and there are major universities there,” said Tippett, adding that the high-quality health care in the region is also attracting older adults who may have children or grandchildren in the area. The rest of the top 10 most-populated counties remained unchanged compared to the year before. Guilford County is third at 537,174, followed by Forsyth County (382,295) and Cumberland County (335,509). Next in order are Durham, Buncombe, Union, New Hanover and Gaston counties. Charlotte remains the state’s largest city. The census report also said the Raleigh-Cary metropolitan area, comprised of Wake, Franklin and Johnston counties, was the 10th fastest-growing region from 2010 to 2019, increasing 23% to almost 1.4 million people. Coastal Brunswick County had the most year-over-year growth among North Carolina’s 100 counties, the census said, its population increasing over 4% to nearly 143,000 people. The census estimates show the population in 31 counties decreasing over the year. The highest percentage drop happened in Tyrrell County, which is also the smallest in population by raw figures. There are now 4,016 people living in Tyrrell, a loss of over 2% compared to July 2018. Tippett said the number of counties with decreasing net populations is lower compared to several years ago, when young people were leaving at higher rates. North Carolina’s statewide population grew by 1% for the year ending July 1, reaching an estimated 10,488,084 people, ranking ninth among the states. More specific totals will originate from the decennial census now underway nationwide.

"SAN DIEGO (AP) - Immigration attorneys have sported swim goggles and masks borrowed from friends to meet with clients in detention centers. Masked judges are stocking their cramped courtrooms with hand sanitizer for hearings they want to do by phone. While much of daily life has ground to a halt to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, the Trump administration is resisting calls from immigration judges and attorneys to stop in-person hearings and shutter all immigration courts. They say the most pressing hearings can still be done by phone so immigrants aren’t stuck in detention indefinitely. The U.S. Justice Department on Monday postponed hearings for asylum-seekers waiting in Mexico, but only after judges in San Diego defied orders to keep their courtrooms running amid the pandemic. The government has delayed hearings for immigrants who aren’t in detention but is moving forward for those who are.  Suspected coronavirus infections have forced immigration courts in New York, New Jersey and Colorado to temporarily shut down in the past week. As a precaution, the government announced the closure of several more Wednesday and said others would be reopened only to accept documents. But many of the 68 U.S. immigration courts continue to hold hearings. That’s leaving judges and attorneys to try to protect themselves. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told lawyers to bring their own masks and gloves, which many hospitals can’t even find. And social distancing in a small courtroom is challenging, with judges passing paperwork back and forth to legal assistants while lawyers and immigrants’ families crowd in. Interpreters fly across the country for hearings. Immigration lawyers and unions for judges and the Homeland Security Department’s own attorneys have jointly demanded that all courts close. “We know the coronavirus is contagious even when people are not symptomatic, and so everyone is very concerned about it. It’s not enough to be reactive. At that point, it’s too late,” said Samuel Cole, an immigration judge in Chicago who is also spokesman for the National Association of Immigration Judges. “So everyone is being put at risk.” Rules change daily as the virus spreads and officials struggle to figure out how and whether they can keep the massive system running. Officials have not ruled out a total closure but were closing specific courts and delaying hearings.  The Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees U.S. immigration courts, said in an email to The Associated Press that it continually evaluates the situation and makes decisions based on public health information. Some courts may close even without a confirmed exposure. “Depending on the nature, scale, scope, and extent of any incident,” the immigration court system will respond appropriately, including closing courts, spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly said. The court system encourages the use of video teleconferencing for hearings and telephonic appearances by practitioners to reduce the risk, Mattingly said. No one, she said, is required to file documents in person. The immigration courts face a backlog of 1.1 million cases, and in many places, lawyers are considered essential workers exempt from state and city orders to stay home. In the criminal courts, some trials have been delayed and some states have closed courtrooms as the virus spreads.  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  Some immigration judges are telecommuting, while others are simply refusing to come in, according to the judges’ union. At a New York City immigration court, attorneys arrived Monday to find all three immigration judges absent, said Andrea Saenz, supervising attorney for Brooklyn Defender Services, which represents detained immigrants.  Hours later, her attorneys learned that the court was closing after a suspected infection. Attorneys say they’re having to decide between risking their health by going to court or staying away and having their client miss out on being released from detention. “It’s a disaster,” Saenz said. In New Jersey, requests for such hearings can be made online and have been granted rapidly. But in New York, they are often ignored, attorneys say. After a New York attorney got no response, the immigrant’s mother took a train from Long Island and then a New York City subway to court to hand-deliver the lawyer’s written request for a telephone hearing. The woman has since been diagnosed with the coronavirus, according to a letter from the Association of Deportation Defense Attorneys to the Executive Office for Immigration Review. “Can you imagine the number of people she came into contact with as the result of the decision to keep this court open?” the letter asked. While hearings by phone work for some cases, they don’t for children, according to attorneys who want those proceedings postponed. “How are we supposed to make sure they’re understanding things?” said Laura Barrera, managing attorney for the Tucson Children’s Program at the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project. She said she asked to delay hearings set for Friday for 11 children in government custody but was denied. Now, the plan is to gather together the children from different shelters for a hearing by video, putting them at risk of exposing each other to the virus, Barrera said.  Attorneys also are struggling to meet with their adult clients to build cases. Immigration lawyers in Arizona have been told that detention centers require visitors to wear a surgical mask, eye wear and medical gloves, which are hard to come by even for health providers. Attorney Margarita Silva improvised. When she reached a detention facility in Eloy, Arizona, on Monday, she was wearing her husband’s land surveyor goggles, a mask she borrowed from a friend and medical gloves she got from a hardware store. She said she felt ridiculous wearing the gear to meet a new client. “My goggles were fogging up because every time I breathe into my mask, it goes to my goggles,” Silva said. Another lawyer had only a mask and a second donned swimming goggles, while the guards and detainees at the facility wore nothing, she said. Silva said she wishes immigration authorities would release detainees who don’t have a criminal history or only minor infractions, like her client. That, she said, would relieve the need for so many court hearings. ___ Taxin reported from Orange County, California.

"The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF THE HOUR: - Army sending two field hospitals to New York City. - WHO director says “millions could die” without aggressive action. - With more than 6,000 new infections in Italy, worldwide total exceeds 500,000. ___ WASHINGTON - U.S. Army leaders said Thursday that two field hospitals are on their way to New York City and will be able to begin treating patients at the Javits Center on Monday. The Army combat units from Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Campbell, Kentucky, will include as many as 700 personnel and almost 300 beds. Those medical personnel will also be able to help staff additional beds and medical equipment that are being brought in by state and local authorities. Gen. James McConville, chief of staff of the Army, said they will begin setting up the units this weekend at the center. Officials expect there will be a couple thousand beds in the center to treat patients that do not have the virus. An Army combat hospital from Fort Carson, Colorado, will be heading to Seattle. McConville said advance staff are already there, and are working with local officials to review several potential locations to set up the unit. ___ JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s economy, the most industrialized in Africa, is expected to be hard hit by the coronavirus. Already in recession and carrying an unemployment rate of 29%, South Africa goes into a three-week lockdown Friday. Many firms are trying to avoid shedding more jobs, but some are laying off workers. If the lockdown is extended beyond 21 days, significant job losses can be expected. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the creation of a Rand 3.8 billion ($220 million) fund to help distressed firms and affected workers, including a temporary employee relief scheme. A group of concerned citizens has started a relief scheme for household workers who are being laid off because of the lockdown. The economic downturn caused by the virus is expected to reduce GDP growth of Africa’s three largest economies - Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt - from an expected 3.8% to 2.8%, according to NKC African Economics. ___ WARSAW, Poland - Poland’s lawmakers have voted to approve extraordinary measures allowing them to attend sessions and vote remotely. The temporary move is intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by avoiding bringing the 460 members of the lower house together. As a precaution against the virus, the vote Thursday was held in 12 different parliament halls so as not to divide the lawmakers into small groups. The new rules of remote attendance and voting will be applied in a vote Friday on the government “anti-crisis shield” for business, worth tens of billions of euros and intended to cushion the negative effects of the pandemic on Poland’s economy and to save jobs. It is to take effect immediately after approval from the Senate and from President Andrzej Duda, expected next week. Many of the lawmakers Thursday were wearing masks and gloves to protect against the virus, but the leader of the ruling party, 70-year-old Jaroslaw Kaczynski, was not. A nation of 38 million, Poland has confirmed 1,163 cases of coronavirus infections. Fourteen people have died. ___ WASHINGTON - A 52-year-old man detained in New Jersey has become the second person in U.S. immigration detention to test positive for COVID-19. The unidentified man was being held at the Essex County Correctional Facility in Newark. A statement Thursday from the county says the man was admitted to a local hospital on March 22 for an issue unrelated to the outbreak. But the county says the man started to show symptoms of the coronavirus. A test came back positive for the virus. U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement had no immediate comment. The agency previously reported a positive test of a 31-year-old man held in Bergen County, New Jersey. It comes as immigrant advocates around the country urge the government to release migrants from detention centers because of the risk of a potential outbreak among detainees. ___ FRANKFURT, Germany - Volkswagen says it is extending the shutdown of its German car, truck and parts plants for another four days until April 9. At the same time, the company said it is working “a comprehensive package of measures” to restart production when that becomes possible. The company said it would use its experience from China, where its plants have resumed production “and the market seems to be gradually returning to normal.” The company said it had no cases of coronavirus among its employees in China. ___ COLOMBO, Sri Lanka - Sri Lanka’s police chief on Thursday ordered the cancellation of leave for all police officers for two weeks, the latest measure intended to enhance the fight against the coronavirus in the island nation. There have been 102 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Sri Lanka. Leave will be canceled for police officers until April 10. Police have already set up about 600 special roadblocks across the country to prevent nonessential travels. The government is urging people to stay home to prevent the disease being spread. A nationwide curfew has been in effect since March 20 and the government has banned nonessential travel between Sri Lanka’s 25 districts. The Indian Ocean island nation is divided into 25 districts for administrative purposes. Police are strictly enforcing the curfew. During the last six days, police have arrested 3,296 people and seized 794 vehicles for violations. ___ MEXICO CITY - More than a year into his term, Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador attended his first international summit Thursday, though the topic - the coronavirus pandemic - meant he didn’t have to leave home to get there. López Obrador, who has not left Mexico since taking office in December 2018, urged the online gathering of the world’s top 20 industrialized economies to help those with fewer resources. He proposed that the United Nations take control of “everything related to medicine and equipment” to combat the virus so that there is an even playing field. “When these things occur, he with the greatest economic possibilities hoards,” he said at his daily news conference, which followed the G20 session. López Obrador specifically noted the ability of the neighboring United States to spend billions of dollars on in-demand items like ventilators for those in most critical need, making them harder for other countries to find and driving up the cost. López Obrador has long maintained that he has too much to do in Mexico to spend time traveling abroad like other heads of state. He has delegated that work to his foreign secretary while at the same time sharply curtailing international travel by other government officials as part of his austerity measures. ___ GENEVA - The head of the World Health Organization has warned G20 leaders that “without aggressive action in all countries, millions could die” from the new coronavirus outbreak. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a video message to the leaders of the world’s top powers, said “only time will tell” what the full economic, political and social fallout will be. “But we know that the price we end up paying depends on the choices we make now,” Tedros said. “This is a global crisis that demands a global response.” He noted “sacrifices” made by some countries including “drastic social and economic restrictions” like shutting schools and businesses and urging people to stay home. “These measures will take some of the heat out of the epidemic, but they will not extinguish it,” he said. “We must do more.” Tedros called for training and deployment of health workers to test, isolate and treat cases - and trace their contacts. He decried a global shortage of personal protective equipment that endangers front-line responders. He urged countries to boost output of such items, and lift export bans and boost distribution of them. “The actions we take now will have consequences for decades to come,” he said. “We are at war with a virus that threatens to tear us apart - if we let it.” ___ BERLIN - Germany’s central state of Hesse says it is taking in 14 patients from Italy and France who are seriously ill with the new coronavirus. Authorities said Thursday that 10 patients from Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region and four from Grand-Est in France would be transferred to Hesse. At least five of Germany’s 16 states have made similar offers, with some already taking in patients. Hesse’s governor, Volker Bouffier, said that “in the crisis we stand together.” He said the patients would be distributed across several hospitals in the state of about 6.2 million. Germany’s foreign ministry tweeted that the country has so far offered to take in 47 patients from Italy. The number of patients from France wasn’t provided. Germany has confirmed more than 43,000 cases of COVID-19 but so far just 239 deaths, a far lower rate than most European countries. Experts said Thursday that the country has prepared a large number of specialist hospital beds for what is expected to be a continued rise in the number of patients requiring intensive treatment. ___ MEMPHIS, Tenn. - The National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis is planning a virtual commemoration of the death of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., 52 years after he was killed in the Tennessee city. The museum will produce a digital broadcast on April 4 featuring segments from past ceremonies, with remarks from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. James Lawson, friends and colleagues of the late civil rights leader. A choir performance, an excerpt of his famed speech “The Mountaintop” and a moment of silence also are planned. King was fatally shot while standing on the balcony of the old Lorraine Motel on April 4, 1968. ___ LONDON - The British government has unveiled another massive income support scheme, this time for 5 million or so self-employed people, many of whom face financial ruin from the shock of the coronavirus pandemic. Treasury chief Rishi Sunak said the new Self-Employed Income Support Scheme will replicate the one he announced last week for those workers that firms retained rather than lay off. At a virtual press briefings, Sunak said the government will pay self-employed people, who have been adversely affected by the coronavirus outbreak, a grant worth 80% of their average monthly profits over the past three years, up to 2,500 pounds ($2,975) per month. He said the scheme will cover 95% of Britain’s self-employed and will only be open to those who make the majority of their income from self-employment so only the “genuinely self-employed” benefit. He said the scheme, which will be open for at least three months, should be in a position to start handing over the grants by the start of June. “The scheme I have announced today is fair. It is targeted at those who need it the most and crucially, it is deliverable,” he said. ___ KYIV, Ukraine - The president of Ukraine says the country’s borders will be entirely closed by the end of Friday. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the closure includes Ukrainian citizens abroad. He charged diplomats with taking responsibility for Ukrainians outside the country. “Today we don’t have time to wait. We faced a difficult choice between citizens who are still abroad and the security of 40 million citizens within the country,” Zelenskiy said. Ukraine has recorded 156 cases of novel coronavirus infection and five deaths. ___ MIAMI - Miami-area hospitals say they are treating crew members from two Costa Cruise ships, the Magica and Favolosa. The ships remain offshore, but about a dozen sick crew members were sent Thursday to Jackson Health, the University of Miami and Baptist Health. The hospitals said in a joint statement that “while we are all committed to preserving resources for our own residents, an international community like Miami would never turn our backs on people aboard ships at our shores.” Carnival Corp., which owns the cruise line, says the ships are empty except for crew members. They both were last in port at the Caribbean island of St. Maarten, the Magica on March 17 and the Favolosa on Saturday, according to vesselfinder.com. The cruise line says about 30 crew members have shown flu-like symptoms, but only about a dozen have been evacuated so far. The Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection and local agencies are working to get the sick crew members to shore. ___ FRANKFURT, Germany - German airline Lufthansa and its budget arm Eurowings are leaving neighboring seats empty on all flights from and within Germany as a means of ensuring physical distance. The distancing measure takes effect on Friday, the airline said in a statement Thursday. Passengers will board at terminal gates and not by bus whenever possible. The airline said the distancing measure would not apply to flights to Germany in order to help as many German residents as possible get home. Distancing measures have already been implemented at check-in and during on-board service. ___ ROME - Italy has reported 6,153 new coronavirus infections, pushing the global total over half a million, based on a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Italy now has 80,539 cases, almost as many as China. Italy’s Civil Protection Agency reported 662 deaths on Thursday, bringing the country’s death toll to 8,165, which is the highest in the world. ___ MOSCOW - The Russian military said its personnel have deployed to Bergamo in northern Italy on to help local clinics treat coronavirus patients. Russian Maj. Gen. Sergei Kikot said the Russian military personnel is split in eight teams, each having doctors, nurses and support workers. Kikot leads the group of Russian military medics sent to Italy earlier this week on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s orders to help fight the epidemic. At Italian authorities’ request, they will be sent to sanitariums for the elderly patients in Bergamo to assist the local medical staff. The Russian group also has disinfection equipment. ___ WASHINGTON - The Navy says an outbreak of COVID-19 infections aboard an aircraft carrier in the Pacific has forced it to divert to Guam so that all 5,000 aboard will undergo testing. The acting secretary of the Navy, Thomas Modly, told reporters that the carrier remains “operationally capable.” Even so, other officials said the number of infected sailors has risen sharply, from three reported initially to “dozens” as of Thursday. Modly said the carrier, which is the first U.S. Navy ship to have a reported outbreak while at sea, had about 800 COVID-19 test kits aboard and more were being delivered. He said the initially reported cases were sailors with relatively mild symptoms. The Navy said earlier this week that the Theodore Roosevelt’s most recent port call was in Vietnam.

"Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, accused Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak of “partisan politics” for restricting the use of hydroxychloroquine after President Trump touted it as a treatment for COVID-19. “Neither of us is a doctor & neither knows what treatment is most effective against this disease,” said Mr. Cruz in a late Wednesday tweet. “Your order prohibits NV doctors—outside of a hospital—from prescribing what they, in their medical judgment, think can help their patients. That’s partisan politics; this is a crisis.” Mr. Sisolak, a Democrat, signed an emergency order Tuesday limiting doctors from prescribing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which are commonly used to treat malaria, for the novel coronavirus to patients in a hospital setting. His order came after an Arizona man died and his wife was hospitalized after ingesting the aquarium cleaner chloroquine phosphate in an effort to protect against COVID-19. In response, Mr. Sisolak noted that Texas recently adopted limits on hydroxychloroquine amid reports that prescribers have been hoarding the drug, which has been used off-label in combination with the antibiotic azythromycin to treat the virus. The governor cited the risk of “bad actors … creating a shortage of critical drugs for those that need it the most.” “We’re in a pandemic. As leaders, let’s stand together as Americans to forget the partisan politics, put the health & safety of our citizens first, & commit to sharing accurate information,” tweeted Mr. Sisolak. “We can mitigate and stop #COVID19 if we do it together.” The Texas State Board of Pharmacy order adopted March 20 limits prescriptions of four drugs, including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, to 14 days, but does not restrict their use to inpatients only. Neither of us is a doctor & neither knows what treatment is most effective against this disease. Your order prohibits NV doctors—outside of a hospital—from prescribing what they, in their medical judgment, think can help their patients.

"NOGALES, Ariz. (AP) - Protesters are demanding stricter screenings for coronavirus on southbound traffic at the U.S.-Mexico border. They say they’re concerned that travelers from the U.S. could import new cases of the coronavirus into Mexico. On Wednesday, protesters on the Mexican side of the border blocked the Mexico-bound lanes in the twin border cities of Ambos Nogales for several hours. The group of citizens who call themselves the Sonorans for Health and Life parked two cars across the lanes leading out of a port of entry. About a half-dozen protesters then stood in the blocked lanes, holding signs and slogans such as “We demand control of the border.” The United States implemented restrictions on non-essential travelers at its ports of entry with Mexico starting last Saturday.  Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been criticized for downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus threat and moving slowly to implement preventative measures, even as governors of states including Sonora and the mayor of Mexico City imposed restrictions and urged people to stay home.

"TORONTO — Canada has told the Trump administration that a proposal to put troops at the U.S.-Canada border amid the pandemic is entirely unnecessary and would damage relations between the two longtime allies. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government has been in discussions with the White House about convincing the U.S. not to do it. “Canada and the United States have the longest un-militarized border in the world and it is very much in both of our interests for it to remain that way,” Trudeau said. According to a U.S. official, the Department of Homeland Security did make a formal request to the Pentagon for military forces to provide additional security along the northern border, between entry points. The official said that the request was made a few days ago and the Defense Department has done some initial planning but there has been no final decision on whether or not to approve the request. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said there was no discussion about closing the border, only about beefing up efforts to prevent any illegal crossings. It wasn’t clear if by Thursday afternoon whether the department was still pursuing the request, or if approved, whether it would be filled by active duty or National Guard troops. Another Trump administration official said they are considering additional actions to ensure “personnel at our borders have the resources and operational support needed to address the profound public health threat of uncontrolled cross-border movement during a pandemic.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss internal discussions. Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said they have told the Trump administration there is no justification for troops. Very few people cross into the border into the U.S. from Canada illegally and Canada has universal health care and widespread testing for the virus. And COVID-19 cases are surging more in the U.S. than in Canada. “What we have said is, ‘We really do not believe at all that there would be a public health justification for you to take this action,’” Freeland said. “And we have said ‘We really don’t think is the right way to treat a trusted friend and military ally.’” Freeland said the specifics of what the U.S. is proposing is a question for American officials to answer and declined to say what the Trump administration is contemplating. She said they are “very directly and very forcefully” expressing the view that “this is an entirely unnecessary step” that Canada would “view as damaging to the relationship.” Freeland stressed that they are talking about a potential decision by the U.S. and said they first learned of the proposal a few days ago. Trudeau’s office has been in direct contact with the White House and Canada’s defense and public safety ministers have spoken to their counterparts. “Our understanding is that a decision has yet not been acted upon or fully taken. But having said that, decisions are taken speedily by all governments around the world including ours,” Freeland said. “Canada is strongly opposed to this U.S. proposal.” Canada has more than 3,400 cases, 35 deaths and has tested over 158,000 people. Canada relies on the U.S. for 75 percent of its exports. About 18 percent of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. The two countries have already closed the border both ways to all non-essential travel. “This is strictly showmanship on the part of the American president. It will have no practical impact. It is an attempt to impress the American public that the president is doing something,” said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. Bruce Heyman, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada, said it would be a serious misuse of resources and a dangerous and inappropriate use of American troops. “It makes no military sense. It makes no economic sense. It makes no sense at any level other than Donald Trump’s political level,” Heyman said. • Lolita Baldor and Ben Fox contributed to this report from Washington.

"The White House, under pressure to level the peak of coronavirus infections, is pushing back against “frightening” high-end statistical modeling, one of which has nearly the entire planet catching the virus this year. Dr. Deborah Birx, President Trump’s go-to expert at daily COVID-19 briefings, pointed to estimates that has 600,000 infections in the Chinese city of Wuhan and its surroundings, or that more than half of Germany will be infected. “I know that it has become a place where people are looking at numbers rather than what is needed, because if you do these projections, when you got to those projections that said, like a Germany and others, that implied that 60 percent or 50 percent of the population would get infected, I want to be very clear,” Dr. Birx said at Wednesday’s briefing. “The only way that happens is this virus remains continuously moving through populations in this cycle, and the fall cycle, and another cycle. She added, “I think the numbers that have been put out there are actually very frightening to people. But I can tell you, if you go back and look at Wuhan and Hubei and all of these provinces, when they talk about 60,000 people being infected, even if you said, all right, well, there’s asymptomatics and all of that, so you get to 600,000 people out of 80 million. “That is nowhere close to the numbers that you see people putting out there. I think it has frightened the American people. I think on a freely, on a model that you just run fallout, you can get to those numbers if you have zero controls and you do nothing. And we know that every American is doing something.” A main driver of doomsday predictions is Imperial College in London’s epidemiology center and professor Neil Ferguson. Mr. Ferguson and a colleague posted a new report on Thursday saying that without stringent social distancing and government intervention, the world will suffer 7 billion infections out of a population of 7.8 billion, with 40 millions deaths. Imperial college said that with decisive action those numbers could be cut in half — 20 million dead and 3.5 billion infected. Skeptics say these numbers are unlikely. China, with more than one billion people, appears to have put a lid on the morality count at just over 3,100, if the communist regime’s numbers are to be believed. South Korean also has limited deaths to under 200. The U.S. death count is rising fairly rapidly this week. The number doubled in four days, pushing over 1,000. There are about 70,000 confirmed cases. Coronavirus tests, at first limited, have reached a steady pace nearing 500,000 completed. The White House’s imposed deadline for statistically showing that the infection rate is beginning to level off is this upcoming Tuesday. The news media credits Imperial College’s drastic predictions with prompting the United Kingdom and U.S. government officials to shut down big sections of their economies to force business closures and keep people at home. “Sobering coronavirus study prompted Britain to toughen its approach,” Reuters reported on March 18, pointing to Mr. Ferguson’s charts. He said 2 million Americans and 500,000 in Britain would die unless severe an social separation is imposed. “To avoid a rebound in transmission, these policies will need to be maintained until large stocks of vaccine are available to immunize the population—which could be 18 months or more,” said Imperial’s authors. “However, there are very large uncertainties around the transmission of this virus, the likely effectiveness of different policies and the extent to which the population spontaneously adopts risk reducing behaviors.” A number of U.S officials have repeated Mr. Ferguson’s dark vision. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says as many as 80 percent of his  state’s 20 million population could contract the virus. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said his strict shut-down orders are to save “thousands of lives.” This week Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine said between 38,000 and 160,000 in the U.S. will die over the next four months, Yahoo News reported.

"The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF THE HOUR: - Death toll in France nears 1,700, fifth-highest of any country. - WHO director says “millions could die” without aggressive action. - With more than 6,000 new infections in Italy, worldwide total exceeds 500,000. ___ PARIS - France’s virus death toll is continuing to climb fast, increasing 27% in one day Thursday to 1,696 victims, including a 16-year-old. The overall number of confirmed cases grew 15% over the previous day to more than 29,000, according to national health agency chief Jerome Salomon. But he acknowledged that the real number is much higher because France is only testing people with severe symptoms. He said doctors estimate another 42,000 people who have sought medical advice for milder symptoms recently also have the virus. Salomon did not provide details about the 16-year-old who died, citing medical privacy. He noted that thousands of people with the virus in France have recovered, and expressed hope that confinement measures would start bringing deaths down soon. France has reported the fifth-highest number of deaths from the virus of any country. France’s government has come under criticism for its limited number of tests, and for waiting until last week to impose nationwide confinement measures even as the virus spread rapidly in neighboring Italy and Spain. ___ BATON ROUGE, La. - The number of known coronavirus cases in Louisiana jumped by more than 500 Thursday, surpassing 2,300, with 86 deaths, the state health department said. A 17-year-old was among the latest deaths, the first in the state of someone under 18. The higher infection numbers reflect the increase in testing. In Thursday’s figures, the number tested rose nearly 6600, to 18,000. Coronavirus has now been found in 53 of 64 parishes, although Gov. John Bel Edwards has said he believes it’s present in every parish, even as statewide mandates banning crowds and closing businesses continue. “We won’t see the impact of the distancing and the closing of schools and people staying home for a couple of weeks. … We are not near the peak of this yet,” said Dr. Catherine O’Neal, an infectious disease expert and chief medical officer at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. ___ WASHINGTON - U.S. Army leaders said Thursday that two field hospitals are on their way to New York City and will be able to begin treating patients at the Javits Center on Monday. The Army combat units from Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Campbell, Kentucky, will include as many as 700 personnel and almost 300 beds. Those medical personnel will also be able to help staff additional beds and medical equipment that are being brought in by state and local authorities. Gen. James McConville, chief of staff of the Army, said they will begin setting up the units this weekend at the center. Officials expect there will be a couple thousand beds in the center to treat patients that do not have the virus. An Army combat hospital from Fort Carson, Colorado, will be heading to Seattle. McConville said advance staff are already there, and are working with local officials to review several potential locations to set up the unit. ___ JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s economy, the most industrialized in Africa, is expected to be hard hit by the coronavirus. Already in recession and carrying an unemployment rate of 29%, South Africa goes into a three-week lockdown Friday. Many firms are trying to avoid shedding more jobs, but some are laying off workers. If the lockdown is extended beyond 21 days, significant job losses can be expected. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the creation of a Rand 3.8 billion ($220 million) fund to help distressed firms and affected workers, including a temporary employee relief scheme. A group of concerned citizens has started a relief scheme for household workers who are being laid off because of the lockdown. The economic downturn caused by the virus is expected to reduce GDP growth of Africa’s three largest economies - Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt - from an expected 3.8% to 2.8%, according to NKC African Economics. ___ WARSAW, Poland - Poland’s lawmakers have voted to approve extraordinary measures allowing them to attend sessions and vote remotely. The temporary move is intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by avoiding bringing the 460 members of the lower house together. As a precaution against the virus, the vote Thursday was held in 12 different parliament halls so as not to divide the lawmakers into small groups. The new rules of remote attendance and voting will be applied in a vote Friday on the government “anti-crisis shield” for business, worth tens of billions of euros and intended to cushion the negative effects of the pandemic on Poland’s economy and to save jobs. It is to take effect immediately after approval from the Senate and from President Andrzej Duda, expected next week. Many of the lawmakers Thursday were wearing masks and gloves to protect against the virus, but the leader of the ruling party, 70-year-old Jaroslaw Kaczynski, was not. A nation of 38 million, Poland has confirmed 1,163 cases of coronavirus infections. Fourteen people have died. ___ WASHINGTON - A 52-year-old man detained in New Jersey has become the second person in U.S. immigration detention to test positive for COVID-19. The unidentified man was being held at the Essex County Correctional Facility in Newark. A statement Thursday from the county says the man was admitted to a local hospital on March 22 for an issue unrelated to the outbreak. But the county says the man started to show symptoms of the coronavirus. A test came back positive for the virus. U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement had no immediate comment. The agency previously reported a positive test of a 31-year-old man held in Bergen County, New Jersey. It comes as immigrant advocates around the country urge the government to release migrants from detention centers because of the risk of a potential outbreak among detainees. ___ FRANKFURT, Germany - Volkswagen says it is extending the shutdown of its German car, truck and parts plants for another four days until April 9. At the same time, the company said it is working “a comprehensive package of measures” to restart production when that becomes possible. The company said it would use its experience from China, where its plants have resumed production “and the market seems to be gradually returning to normal.” The company said it had no cases of coronavirus among its employees in China. ___ COLOMBO, Sri Lanka - Sri Lanka’s police chief on Thursday ordered the cancellation of leave for all police officers for two weeks, the latest measure intended to enhance the fight against the coronavirus in the island nation. There have been 102 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Sri Lanka. Leave will be canceled for police officers until April 10. Police have already set up about 600 special roadblocks across the country to prevent nonessential travels. The government is urging people to stay home to prevent the disease being spread. A nationwide curfew has been in effect since March 20 and the government has banned nonessential travel between Sri Lanka’s 25 districts. The Indian Ocean island nation is divided into 25 districts for administrative purposes. Police are strictly enforcing the curfew. During the last six days, police have arrested 3,296 people and seized 794 vehicles for violations. ___ MEXICO CITY - More than a year into his term, Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador attended his first international summit Thursday, though the topic - the coronavirus pandemic - meant he didn’t have to leave home to get there. López Obrador, who has not left Mexico since taking office in December 2018, urged the online gathering of the world’s top 20 industrialized economies to help those with fewer resources. He proposed that the United Nations take control of “everything related to medicine and equipment” to combat the virus so that there is an even playing field. “When these things occur, he with the greatest economic possibilities hoards,” he said at his daily news conference, which followed the G20 session. López Obrador specifically noted the ability of the neighboring United States to spend billions of dollars on in-demand items like ventilators for those in most critical need, making them harder for other countries to find and driving up the cost. López Obrador has long maintained that he has too much to do in Mexico to spend time traveling abroad like other heads of state. He has delegated that work to his foreign secretary while at the same time sharply curtailing international travel by other government officials as part of his austerity measures. ___ GENEVA - The head of the World Health Organization has warned G20 leaders that “without aggressive action in all countries, millions could die” from the new coronavirus outbreak. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a video message to the leaders of the world’s top powers, said “only time will tell” what the full economic, political and social fallout will be. “But we know that the price we end up paying depends on the choices we make now,” Tedros said. “This is a global crisis that demands a global response.” He noted “sacrifices” made by some countries including “drastic social and economic restrictions” like shutting schools and businesses and urging people to stay home. “These measures will take some of the heat out of the epidemic, but they will not extinguish it,” he said. “We must do more.” Tedros called for training and deployment of health workers to test, isolate and treat cases - and trace their contacts. He decried a global shortage of personal protective equipment that endangers front-line responders. He urged countries to boost output of such items, and lift export bans and boost distribution of them. “The actions we take now will have consequences for decades to come,” he said. “We are at war with a virus that threatens to tear us apart - if we let it.” ___ BERLIN - Germany’s central state of Hesse says it is taking in 14 patients from Italy and France who are seriously ill with the new coronavirus. Authorities said Thursday that 10 patients from Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region and four from Grand-Est in France would be transferred to Hesse. At least five of Germany’s 16 states have made similar offers, with some already taking in patients. Hesse’s governor, Volker Bouffier, said that “in the crisis we stand together.” He said the patients would be distributed across several hospitals in the state of about 6.2 million. Germany’s foreign ministry tweeted that the country has so far offered to take in 47 patients from Italy. The number of patients from France wasn’t provided. Germany has confirmed more than 43,000 cases of COVID-19 but so far just 239 deaths, a far lower rate than most European countries. Experts said Thursday that the country has prepared a large number of specialist hospital beds for what is expected to be a continued rise in the number of patients requiring intensive treatment. ___ MEMPHIS, Tenn. - The National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis is planning a virtual commemoration of the death of the Rev.

"The Trump administration’s ban on aborted human fetal tissue in federally funded research has come under renewed fire as Democrats and pro-choice advocates accuse the White House of hampering the search for coronavirus cures. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat, called on the administration to lift the “illogical and harmful” restrictions, citing a report about a National Institutes of Health immunologist who has sought an exemption for his COVID-19 research. Mr. Nadler said the Department of Health and Human Services “must authorize this research immediately and while the ban on fetal tissue research should be lifted permanently, at the very least it must be lifted during this pandemic. “That the Trump Administration prioritizes their illogical and harmful anti-science agenda over stopping this pandemic shows once again that they would rather score political points with their anti-abortion friends than save millions of lives,” Mr. Nadler said in a Friday statement. Meanwhile, pro-life advocates blasted such efforts as an attempt to take advantage of the coronavirus crisis to promote the pro-choice agenda. “There are lots of ethical alternatives, and frankly, they’re better and more modern science compared to the old thing of doing aborted fetal tissue,” said David Prentice, the vice president and research director of the pro-life Charlotte Lozier Institute who holds a doctorate in cellular biology. “It just strikes me as, they’re pleading for the funds. They don’t want to let a good crisis go to waste.” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton tweeted: “The ‘researcher’ behind the purchase of organs of aborted beings pushes #coronavirus as an excuse for taxpayer funding.” He referred to Kim Hasenkrug, an immunologist at the National Institutes of Health’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana, who has sought an exemption to conduct experiments for COVID-19 treatments on “humanized mice” implanted with human fetal lung tissue from elective abortions, according to a March 18 report in The Washington Post. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, Illinois Democrat, reacted by accusing the White House of “once again prioritizing ideology over science.” NARAL Pro-Choice America said the administration “cares more about promoting anti-choice policies than enabling scientists to conduct crucial research during a time of crisis.” The Montana lab referred inquiries to Health and Human Services spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley, who said Tuesday that “no decision has been made” on the request for an exemption from the June 5 policy. The department also cited Mr. Trump’s aggressive response to the coronavirus outbreak, including “kick-starting the development of vaccines and therapeutics through every possible avenue.” “The Trump Administration has activated a whole-of-government, whole-of-America approach to prepare for and respond to COVID-19,” said the HHS statement. “President Trump’s bold, decisive actions at the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak bought the United States extremely valuable time to prepare.” The Lozier Institute, the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, disputed the contention that “aborted baby parts” are needed to develop a vaccine. It said more than 60 potential treatments are under investigation, “none of which need aborted fetal tissue to fight coronavirus.” “Those who advocate experimentation using body parts harvested from aborted children are shamelessly exploiting the coronavirus pandemic, playing on people’s fears at a vulnerable time so that a select few can continue to use aborted fetal tissue in their research,” said the institute. “The fact is that there are modern, successful alternatives available.” Judicial Watch released internal documents last month that showed the NIH paid $18,100 to Advanced Bioscience Resources from December 2016 to August 2018 for livers and thymuses from second-trimester abortions, including 26 purchases from Mr. Hasenkrug, for HIV research. Mr. Hasenkrug serves as an affiliate associate professor at Montana State University and the University of Montana. In 2016, he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology, according to his biography. Pro-choice advocates were outraged last year when the HHS discontinued research at intramural facilities — those within the NIH system — that required “new acquisition of fetal tissue from elective abortions.” “Promoting the dignity of human life from conception to natural death is one of the very top priorities of President Trump’s administration,” the HHS said in its June 5 statement.

"While the political jockeying gets more attention, candidates in the 2020 Democratic presidential race are advancing serious policy proposals. The Washington Times takes a weekly look at how the candidates’ proposals stack up against each other. All eyes were on the $2.2 trillion financial rescue package making its way through Congress this week. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont both said that proper oversight will be needed and that more needs to be done, but they offered different policy prescriptions for how to move the country forward amid the unprecedented coronavirus crisis. Joseph R. Biden Mr. Biden, who had hoped for quick passage of the $2.2 trillion economic rescue package, on Thursday laid out a series of emergency steps he would take to try to make sure the money is going where it’s supposed to be going. Mr. Biden called the congressional package a “very important step” but said there is more he would do if elected president. “It would be catastrophic to reopen everything without a plan and then have a spike in cases and shut it back down,” he said. Mr. Biden has been talking to media and cutting videos from his Wilmington, Delaware, home as the coronavirus has ground traditional political campaigning to a halt. He said he would establish a task force that reports directly to him to track all the spending and touted his oversight of the implementation of the post-2008 economic recovery act. Mr. Biden also said he would call in major banks and tell them to get the small business loans in the stimulus package out the door. “If they don’t make small business a priority, I would seek authority … to make sure they had to do that,” he said. For larger corporations seeking taxpayer money, Mr. Biden’s campaign said he would hold the line on banning stock buybacks and pay raises for executives. He also said he wants to build on the current deal with proposals such as forgiving at least $10,000 of federal student loans per person, increasing Social Security checks by $200 per month, and providing emergency paid sick leave for everyone who needs it, including those in the gig economy and the self-employed. “This was a very good start, but more has to be done,” he said. “Congress is doing its job. The president has to do his now. This is all about implementation, priorities, detail, accountability. Do it now.” Bernard Sanders Mr. Sanders on Thursday said he reluctantly voted for the package because people across the country are hurting, but that he remains deeply concerned about its implementation as well as a special fund for corporations that he predicted President Trump would try to exploit. “I think you have a president who is fundamentally dishonest, who is corrupt, and we have now given him $500 billion to play with, with not enough oversight,” Mr. Sanders said on WAMU radio’s “1A” program. “That is the most dangerous part of this whole bill.” Democrats have derided the $500 billion in loans for distressed corporations as a “slush fund,” though they touted that they managed to secure additional oversight in the negotiations. Republicans say they never objected to the structure of the oversight and that Democrats were seeking to claim additional powers tied to the administration’s coronavirus response. Mr. Sanders also said some of his “anti-worker” Republican colleagues wanted to prevent some workers from receiving the additional $600 per week in unemployment benefits provided for in the bill on top of their current benefits, which are generally set by the states. Several Republican senators had raised last-minute objections, saying that the provision might make it more lucrative for many Americans to go on unemployment rather than try to hold onto their current jobs. Mr. Sanders on Wednesday had threatened to block speedy passage of the bill to secure additional oversight over the $500 billion fund if the GOP senators didn’t drop their objections. He mocked the Republican viewpoint in a floor speech Wednesday. “Oh my God — the universe is collapsing. Imagine that,” he said. “Somebody [who’s] making 12 bucks an hour now, like the rest of us, faces an unprecedented economic crisis…might be making a few bucks more for four months. Oh my word! Will the universe survive?” Mr. Sanders also called for $2,000 checks to go out to Americans each month for the duration of the crisis. The bill calls for one-time checks of at least $1,200 to go out to millions of Americans. He said there will likely be another major piece of legislation in the coming weeks or months. “I have very little doubt that while this is a start, we’re going to have to come back and address the needs of working people in a far more substantial way,” he said Thursday.

"The Justice Department will allow older, nonviolent federal inmates to be placed in home confinement to avoid a larger outbreak of the coronavirus inside federal prisons, Attorney General William P. Barr said Thursday. “We want to be sure our institutions don’t become petri dishes and it doesn’t spread rapidly through an institution — but we have protocols that are designed to stop that and we are using all the tools we have,” Mr. Barr told reporters at a press conference. Mr. Barr said there were “concerns” for the plight of more than 10,000 inmates aged 60 or older confined in the nation’s 122 federal prisons. One prisoner in Louisiana, he said, is in critical condition with a coronavirus infection. So far, there have been few coronavirus cases reported in federal prisons. As of Thursday, there are six inmates and four staffers publicly known to be infected at federal prisons across the country. The attorney general’s comments come as politicians and civil rights groups on both sides of the political spectrum urge the Justice Department to release elderly and non-violent federal inmates. Reform Alliance, a group advocating for smaller prison populations, praised the decision. “Protecting vulnerable incarcerated people from exposure to COVID-19 is not just good for their safety, but also for others behind bars and correctional staff who are at risk of spreading the disease back into their communities,” the group said in a statement. “We applaud the Attorney General for working to balance public safety with the need to keep our prisons safe from this pandemic, and we urge federal prison authorities to implement AG Barr’s directive in good faith.” On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of senators demanded Mr. Barr move low-level offenders out of federal prisons. “Conditions of confinement do not afford individuals the opportunity to take proactive steps to protect themselves, and prisons often create the ideal environment for the transmission of contagious disease,” the senators wrote in a letter to Mr. Barr and Michael Carvajal, director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Some states and municipalities have already released nonviolent and elderly prisoners amid the pandemic. Los Angeles County released more than 600 inmates early, Cleveland let go over 200, and other localities are mulling similar measures.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tried to take a victory lap of sorts Thursday as the House moved to pass a $2.2 trillion economic rescue plan to battle the coronavirus pandemic and send it to President Trump for his immediate signature on Friday. “I anticipate and feel certain that we will have a strong bipartisan vote,” Mrs. Pelosi said of the expected action on Friday. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, agreed with that assessment but criticized Mrs. Pelosi for delaying negotiations while attempting to insert a “wish list” of liberal priorities into the package. “We just watched in the last week 3.28 million people laid off,” he said of the weekly unemployment claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday. “That is multiplying higher than we ever watched in the financial crisis. How many people were laid off as the Democrats fought to change the election law or implement the Green New Deal?” The Green New Deal was never included in the House proposal, but there were provisions seeking to reduce airlines’ greenhouse gas emissions and provide expanded tax credits for solar and wind power. Mrs. Pelosi boasted that Democrats had “won the day” in obtaining what they wanted from the Senate’s $2.2 trillion coronavirus recovery package, while hinting at other items she would like to see included in a forthcoming bill. Mrs. Pelosi called the week-long negotiations with the White House and Senate Republican a “jiu-jitsu” that secured greater protections for workers and higher unemployment benefits. Mr. McCarthy called her characterization “an outright lie.” “The fundamental portions of this bill [have] not changed since Sunday,” Mr. McCarthy said. “The only few additions were funding of things that had nothing to do with the coronavirus,” citing $25 million for the Kennedy Center in Washington. “She spent time thanking her members on wins,” Mr. McCarthy said. “America’s suffering does not care to hear about these superficial and fabricated claims. What Democrats did was a total disgrace. History will not be kind to the days that added to the millions who were unemployed.” Mrs. Pelosi said she would like to see another package include more money to state and local governments, another increase for food stamps and clearer definitions of who is eligible for benefits. “There are so many things that we didn’t get in these bills, yet, in the way we need to,” she said. However, Mr. McCarthy was less enthusiastic about pushing ahead into phase four, arguing that Congress should wait to see how its first three bills are impacting the economy. “If these bills are done correctly, put them to work,” he said. “If something is needed in the future let’s make that decision.” The House, which has not entirely reconvened since going on recess two weeks ago, is reconfiguring its process to pass the massive recovery package Friday morning. The pandemic has complicated the process of holding a vote for 430 lawmakers. Leadership plans to hold a voice vote, rather than attempt to pass the bill by unanimous consent — which only takes one objection to derail. A voice vote, which simply determines if there are more ayes called out than nays, will be unrecorded, but members can record their opinion of the bill in the congressional record. If a lawmaker demands the presence of a quorum, all the available House members who aren’t self-quarantining will need to reconvene and pass the vote in person on Saturday at the earliest. To encourage participation in the debate without risking travel, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, is urging members to send in videos of their remarks that will be aired by C-SPAN. “C-SPAN is coordinating technical details with the leadership offices and organizing its own internal operations to process the many individual videos the network is currently anticipating the members’ statements will air in blocks during prime time the week of March 30th,” the network said in a statement.

"MINNEAPOLIS — U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s husband has been released from a hospital where he was being treated for low oxygen and pneumonia as a result of the coronavirus, the senator said Thursday. Klobuchar, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said in a statement that her husband, John Bessler, “took a good turn, was just released and is now recovering at home.” “Thanks to those who cared for him and for all front line health care workers,” she said. Klobuchar announced Monday that Bessler has the coronavirus and was admitted to a Virginia hospital where he was placed on oxygen, but not a ventilator. Bessler, a law professor at the University of Baltimore, became ill when he was in Washington and Klobuchar was in Minnesota, she said. He initially thought he had a cold, but quarantined himself immediately anyway. He got tested after he began coughing up blood, and was admitted to the hospital, where he was put on oxygen but not a ventilator. Klobuchar said earlier this week that she and Bessler had been in different places and she was outside the 14-day window for getting sick, so her doctor advised her not to get tested herself. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Klobuchar said Monday that it took five days for Bessler to be tested, noting that such delays are a problem facing many. Bessler has taught at the University of Baltimore School of Law since 2009. According to a bio on the university’s website, he teaches courses in civil procedure, contracts, capital punishment, international human rights law and other topics. He is also an author. During Klobuchar’s campaign for president, he was often by her side. When Klobuchar was in Washington during impeachment proceedings and couldn’t campaign in Iowa herself, Bessler and the couple’s daughter acted as her surrogates, and met with countless Iowa voters on her behalf.

"CAIRO (AP) - Malak el-Kashif left home on her birthday seven years ago. Walking into an uncertain future, she was underdressed for the weather and armed with little- except for some makeup, a few women’s accessories and 50 Egyptian pounds (at the time about six American dollars).  “I was afraid but I didn’t hesitate,” she said. “There weren’t any other solutions.”  That night, el-Kashif was a 13-year-old boy named Abdel-Rahman. She has since emerged as perhaps Egypt’s most outspoken transgender woman activist.  It’s a label that in a largely conservative and patriarchal society has meant battling a war on multiple fronts. “When you declare you are different, you should get ready for war. A big war,” she said. “The society will stomp on you and treat you like you are the enemy.”  She has been ostracized by her family and scorned by some who accuse her of tampering with God’s creation. She has been attacked by others scandalized by her activism for LGBTQ rights. Legally, she still holds a male’s identity card.  None of this has deterred her from publicly advocating for transgenders’ rights. She appeared on a television show in a blonde wig—which she now sees as a cringe-worthy fashion faux pas. On her Facebook page, she has campaigned for transgenders, chronicled her transition and posted photos with a rainbow background. She rails against homophobia, sexual harassment, bullying and the patriarchy.  “If I wanted to hide, then I would have hidden and just stayed at my parents’ and not become a trans and saved myself all of this. … It’s just not me, not Malak,” she said. “Malak is someone else.”  –  Officially transitioning in Egypt can be complex. It involves medical tests, psychological treatment for two years and approvals by medical specialists and religious authorities. Success is far from assured.  Osama Abdel-Hay, head of the doctors’ syndicate’s “gender correction” committee, said a cleric used to sit on the committee alongside medical specialists. He stopped attending meetings and the committee’s work was disrupted for years, he said. “He wasn’t supportive of the decisions of the committee,” he said, refusing to elaborate. Abdel-Hay said he didn’t recall how many approvals were given to transgenders. His assistant scribbled on a piece of paper summing up the committee’s work between 2014 and 2017: 87 approvals for “physical” reasons but zero for “gender identity disorder.” Thirty-one were left unresolved.  Now, under a new system, the medical committee sends the cases it approves to Al-Azhar’s Islamic Research Academy. Out of three cases sent to the religious scholars, two were rejected. The approved one cited a fertility disorder.  “I think they are sensitive to changing the sex because they don’t want to change the creation of God,” he said, referring to the religious establishment in Egypt. The syndicate that oversees the committee doesn’t want to clash with Al-Azhar over this issue, he said, but added, “if there was no religious opinion in the process, approvals would have been faster.”  Abdel-Hady Zarei, who heads the fatwa committee at Al-Azhar, said there cannot be one religious opinion for the cases. Instead, each must be studied by a group of religious scholars who hear from medical specialists. Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, he said, adding the issue “is put in the hands of the medical specialists because they are the experts.”  The surgery must provide a benefit or prevent a harm, he said. There may be a consensus “one case will lead to a correction” while another “is just a tendency or desire toward the other gender.”  Nazeer Ayad, secretary-general of the Islamic Research Academy, told The Associated Press that sex “change or correction” is only allowed in “exceptional cases,” like when the sex cannot be determined as either male or female.  “It’s a medical issue,” he said. “The academy and the sharia scholars make their decision based on what the doctors say.”  El-Kashif said she never received a response to her case. She was diagnosed with “gender identity disorder,” she said. The term was replaced in the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic guide by “gender dysphoria” - a conflict between assigned gender at birth and the one a person identifies with, which may lead to significant distress.  An approval would have allowed her to have the surgeries at a public hospital, paving the way for changing her ID.  She argued the decision should be purely medical.  “When you get sick, do you see a doctor or a sheikh? A doctor,” she said. “When a woman is giving birth does she go to the hospital or to the mosque? The hospital.”  — El-Kashif grew up in a religious, traditional household where she memorized parts of the Quran. At a home where “a man is a man and a woman is a woman,” she enjoyed more freedom as a boy than her sisters or the girls in her neighborhood.  The advantages did not matter. After playing with two girlfriends, making dresses for dolls, the then 9-year-old declared to her mother: “I am not a boy. I am a girl.” She was banished to her room. When her father arrived, he beat her, she said.  The worst part came next. She called it “my struggle with the mirror” phase. Years of asking Who am I? If I am a boy then why do I think this way? If I am a girl then why do I look the way I do?  “This was the hardest phase ever, even harder than confronting society, harder than prison,” she said. “It was a huge fight that no one could protect me from.”  Compounding her dilemma, she didn’t have the vocabulary to explain her situation. That changed when her sister said the actress in a movie she was watching was transgender. She started researching.  She experimented with makeup and set up fake identities online. On her birthday, she received an ultimatum: follow the rules or leave. “I picked the tougher option.”  El-Kashif’s mother declined comment for this story. Sometimes, el-Kashif slept in a park or stayed up all night. For money, she swept up hair at a salon or mopped staircases.  –  El-Kashif’s battles are etched on her slender body. The scars peeking underneath her top are from the time she threw herself from the fifth floor. The ones on her arm are a reminder of cutting herself with razors more times than she can count.  Then there are the invisible wounds that chronicle a life of hardship and defiance.  There’s the day she went out in a black wig and pink shoes. She said her father and brother found her and tore her clothes off her body as they took her home. There is the fear she will die alone and the feeling that when her mother looked at her, she saw not her child but a “freak.”  In a moment of reconciliation, el-Kashif posted a picture of silver socks and a pink watch on Facebook. “My mother brought these to me and said she felt she gave birth to me all over again. … I am very happy, the happiest person on earth,” she wrote. The relationship is complicated with ups and downs.  El-Kashif punctuates her recounting of painful life events with jokes and sarcastic comments. As she talks, she smokes heavily, fidgets or plays with her hair—which she had colored red and often wears a lipstick shade to match. “She is traumatized. This is (what happens) when you topple the temple,” said Mozn Hassan, a leading feminist activist and a friend of el-Kashif’s. “These people, that Malak is one example of, experience multilayers of violence and exclusion all the time.”  Reda al-Danbouki, executive director of the Women’s Center for Guidance and Legal Awareness, said “most trans people (here) prefer to remain silent so they can retain even a small part of their rights. They don’t want a confrontation with society on top of what happens with their families.” El-Kashif “has shocked the patriarchy.”  –  El-Kashif’s activism extends beyond advocating for the LGBTQ community. She was arrested last year after she called for protests following a fatal train crash because of what she saw as government negligence. She was imprisoned in a men’s prison. The arrest, her third, sparked an outcry as activists and rights groups feared for her safety, especially due to her gender identity. She said she was held in solitary confinement.  Hassan said pressure mounted on authorities at the time to isolate her from male prisoners to spare her possible violence.  After her release, el-Kashif filed a lawsuit demanding special places for holding transgenders in prisons and police stations.  Now, she lives in a sparsely furnished rental. One of the drawings in her room shows bare legs, one shackled by an iron ball. A note taped to the mirror carries a grim reminder: “Quit the chemistry. Otherwise, it will do to you what it did before,” a reference to abuse of anti-depressants.  Day-to-day life can be hard. On a trip to a bank, an employee said he would have to call the police to witness any transaction because her ID showed a teenage boy.  Shortly before her birthday last year, el-Kashif posted a picture of herself online writing that she had completed her gender transition surgeries.  “Today is the day I defeated society,” she wrote. “From this day on, there’s only Malak.”  She was flooded with thousands of messages. Some congratulated her; many insulted her.  The comments ranged from “pray to God to heal you” or “you have lost in this life and the afterlife” to “If you were my son, I would have set you on fire.”  But other encounters have left her feeling like she’s making a difference.  One mother approached her at a hospital and said she sought medical help for her daughter after hearing el-Kashif’s story. Another time, a transgender man stopped her to let her know that “To me, you are resistance.”  ___  Fam reported from Winter Park, Fla.  ___  Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

"In some parts of the U.S., authorities say gun shops aren’t essential businesses and should close during stay-at-home orders meant to slow the coronavirus. In other places, officials are stopping background checks for concealed carry permits. Elsewhere, city leaders have invoked emergency powers allowing bans on gun sales. As the nation grapples with a pandemic that has upended daily life, some gun rights advocates are concerned about an erosion of Second Amendment rights just as Americans are buying firearms in record numbers to try to ensure their safety. “When there’s a national emergency, people are looking for food, water, shelter - that part is important to the survival of our nation,” said Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works in Austin. “They are also looking for the Second Amendment to protect their families.” He’s scaled back how long he’s open each day but said he won’t close his shop and doesn’t believe he should be forced to.  In recent weeks, firearm sales have skyrocketed. Background checks - the key barometer of gun sales - already were at record numbers in January and February, likely fueled by a presidential election year. Since the coronavirus outbreak, gun shops have reported long lines and runs on firearms and ammunition. Background checks were up 300 percent on March 16 compared with the same date a year ago, according to federal data shared with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gunmakers. Since Feb. 23, each day has seen roughly double the volume over 2019, according to Mark Oliva, spokesman for the group.  “When people aren’t able to provide for their own security or their own safety, they’re going to take measures to make sure that they can. That’s why we have that Second Amendment,” Oliva said. “This is a public safety issue.” The federal background check system has been overwhelmed by the massive increase in firearm sales. What might normally take a few minutes is taking much longer, and a backlog on background checks has ballooned to about 80,000, Oliva said.  If a background check takes longer than three business days, gun dealers are permitted to allow the sale to go through unless a state has stricter waiting periods. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation has advised gun dealers not to feel beholden to complete the sale if they have concerns about the potential buyer. “We are cautioning retailers that they may want to exercise patience and prudence,” Oliva said. Even some gun control advocates say it might not be wise to shut down federally licensed firearms dealers, whose sales require background checks. That could force buyers to use a website or seek a private sale that doesn’t require a check, making it more difficult to trace a firearm if it’s used in a crime. There are risks to both closing a gun shop or keeping it open, said David Chipman, a retired agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “If you keep it open, there’s the risk of first-time buyers who are largely buying out of fear and panic and untrained,” said Chipman, now senior policy adviser for Giffords, a gun control advocacy group. Gun control advocates are concerned about a large number of new owners lacking the usual access to training on how to store and handle their weapon properly. They also worry that Americans who are stocking up now eventually will sell their firearms privately.  “If we can imagine how horrible this crisis is … the people who hoarded the guns might decide six months from now - once they see no zombies around but they’ve run out of tuna and beef jerky - that they need the money to buy food,” Chipman said. In a number of U.S. cities, including New Orleans, the mayor has issued an emergency proclamation that declares the authority to restrict sales of firearms and ammunition.  In some states that have ordered people to stay home, gun stores were not among the businesses deemed essential and allowed to stay open, like grocery stores.  That has led to confusion in California, where for the second time this week, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva ordered gun shops to close, challenging a finding by the legal counsel for the nation’s most populous county that the stores are essential businesses. David Prince, owner of Eagle Gun Range in Farmers Branch, Texas, near Dallas, had to temporarily close his store under Dallas County’s stay-at-home order, then was allowed to reopen Wednesday when gun stores were reclassified as essential. Prince said gun stores are critical because they give people the chance to defend themselves. “I always knew people were going to want to protect themselves. What I was concerned about was the look in their faces, they are covered in fear,” Prince said. “If I give them the ability to have a firearm, it gives them a fighting chance to defend their family.” The range that is part of his store is considered nonessential and has been forced to close, meaning new gun buyers can’t use it to train on how to handle their firearm. ___ Pane reported from Boise, Idaho.

"Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, has filed suit in Texas to allow clinics there to continue to perform abortions during the coronavirus health emergency. On March 23, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton notified Planned Parenthood that, because abortions were elective procedures, they did not qualify as critical or essential medical services during a state-ordered business slowdown. “The Texas Attorney General’s enforcement threats are a blatant effort to exploit a public health crisis to advance an extreme, anti-abortion agenda, without any benefit to the state in terms of preventing or resolving shortages of (personal protective equipment) or hospital capacity,” the lawsuit reads. Planned Parenthood attorneys also noted Mr. Paxton appeared to have extended the ban to “medication abortions,” which the clinic says involves no surgery and thus, “this appears to be the only oral medication targeted in this manner.” In his letter, Mr. Paxton “warned all licensed health care professionals and all licensed health care facilities, including abortion providers that, pursuant to Executive Order GA 09 issued by Gov. Greg Abbott, they must postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary.” Abortion clinics in Texas reportedly complied this week with the order, which is set to expire on April 21. In neighboring Louisiana, the state’s three abortion clinics also closed this week in response to a similar mandate from Gov. John Bel Edwards. “As a result of these threats,” Planned Parenthood’s lawyers wrote in their suit filed in federal district court Wednesday, “this week plaintiffs have already been forced to turn away patients in need of time-sensitive care.” The legal wrangling over abortion in Texas mirrors fights that have broken out on hot-button social issues elsewhere as both sides complain politicians are using the crisis to force their positions. In California, for example, Second Amendment advocates claim authorities targeted gun stores first when calling for the closure of “nonessential” businesses. The sheriff in Los Angeles County ordered gun stores there to close Thursday afternoon. Pro-life groups say the Texas order was legal and broad, given it requires postponement of “all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life of, a patient who without immediate performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences, as determined by the patient’s physician.”  ",Planned Parenthood sues over Texas abortion ban during coronavirus crisis,"Thursday, March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/26/planned-parenthood-sues-over-texas-abortion-ban-du/,washington_times
"It looks like President Trump is winning the public approval war out there, no matter how much bad press he receives during the coronavirus crisis. The media, in fact, is 16 percentage points below Mr. Trump according to a wide ranging Gallup poll gauging public reaction to the assorted responses to the pandemic. “Americans are generally positive in their evaluations of how each of nine leaders and institutions has handled the response to the coronavirus situation. Eight of the nine receive majority positive ratings — led by U.S. hospitals, at 88% approval. Only the news media gets a more negative than positive review,” writes analyst Justin McCarthy. Some simple numbers: 60% of Americans give Mr. Trump a thumbs up for his response to coronavirus, 44% approved of the news media’s response. Republicans are standing by the president; 93% approve of the Trump response — while only 25% gave the nod to the press. Yes, partisan divides are plenty in the findings. Find more numbers in the Poll du Jour at column’s end. WAY TO GO: U.S. TOPS WORLD RESPONSE Don’t doubt that America is ready for the challenges ahead. The nation is, actually, No. 1 in terms of disaster readiness according to the most serious of sources. “Despite claims by the mainstream media and the Democratic Party that the United States was ‘ill-prepared’ to handle the coronavirus pandemic and that actions by Trump administration made us vulnerable, the United States was actually ranked the best-prepared country in the world to handle a pandemic in a study by Nuclear Threat Initiative and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security published in late 2019,” writes Matt Margolis, a columnist for PJ Media. The U.S. has a “Global Health Security Index” score of 83.5 out of a possible 100 — the highest ranking in the analysis of 195 nations. Britain placed second with a score of 77.9, Netherlands third at 75.6. Australia fourth at 75.5 and Canada fifth at 75.3. Scores are based on a nation’s ability to prevent, detect or respond to health emergencies such a “the emergence or release of pathogens,” among other factors. “The Trump administration has been the target of a significant amount of misinformation being disseminated by the Democrats and the mainstream media designed to undermine confidence in the administration’s handling of the pandemic, including false reports that Trump ‘dissolved’ the White House pandemic response office and that Trump cut funding to the CDC and NIH,” Mr. Margolis noted. “Despite these false reports, Trump’s approval ratings have improved in the past few weeks,” he says. A SOMEWHAT ASTONISHING HEADLINE “President Trump is as popular as he’s ever been right now,” notes CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza, who cites new findings from both the aforementioned Gallup poll and other findings from Monmouth University. “What accounts for Trump’s rise? Simple: His response to the coronavirus crisis. The heightened approval for how Trump has managed this crisis — particularly among independents and even Democrats — is what is pushing up his overall approval numbers,” Mr. Cillizza notes. A TIMELY TWEAK A cranky narrative has emerged from several news organizations in recent days, implying that Fox News compromised its coverage of the coronavirus pandemic and was minimizing the danger of the virus. A sample: The network was “playing down risks for weeks” according to The Independent, a British paper. New York Times media columnist Ben Smith also joined in the fray, citing recent Fox News coverage which he said depicted the coronavirus pandemic as “a Democratic- and media-led plot against President Donald J. Trump” rather than a deadly health threat. “Critics sometimes compare Fox, in its loyalty to Trump, to ‘state TV’” but that description is off. State TV implies command and control. The most-watched news channel in America has become, since the fall of its powerful founder, Roger Ailes, much more like the Trump White House: a family business where it’s not entirely clear who is in charge,” Mr. Smith wrote this week. In an interview with MSNBC, he suggested that Fox News went into a “reflexive defense of the president’s attacks on the media.” But sometimes even esteemed journalists tweak their opinions. Mr. Smith had a subtle positive observation — a clarification — about his opinion of the situation, tucked into the conversation and referencing the network’s leading primetime host. “When Sean Hannity says this is the latest hoax, I don’t think he thinks the virus is a hoax. He thinks that the media coverage is actually transcending what’s happening to people on the ground,” Mr. Smith told MSNBC.

"BOSTON (AP) - The Massachusetts Senate has barred state Sen. Dean Tran from interacting with his staff except through official emails in the wake of an ethics investigation. The action followed the release of a report Thursday that found the Fitchburg Republican had his staff conduct campaign work during regular Senate business hours during his 2018 campaign and was aware that his staff was performing campaign work on state time, using public resources. The report also found Tran asked his staff to engage in inappropriate fundraising work using public resources during the 2018 campaign and continued to expect his staff to do campaign work to prepare for his 2020 reelection campaign. Tran’s campaign manager threatened at least one Senate staffer with termination if the staffer did not work on Tran’s 2020 campaign, the report found. The committee recommended Tran to be removed from his position as assistant minority whip for the remainder of the legislative session and be segregated from his staff and that his contact with them only be in writing, using Senate email, and strictly limited to official Senate business. Democratic Senate President Karen Spilka said the recommendations were adopted Thursday by the Senate in “a bipartisan and unanimous manner.” In an email, Tran disputed the findings. “The Senate Counsel report is riddled with lies and hearsay to fit a narrative and there was no opportunity to challenge the credibility until the report was published,” Tran said. “I was personally attacked in the 2017 special election, they tried to attack my voting record in the 2018 election, and I expected the same this year, but what I didn’t expect was for the attack to come by way of the internal and partisan process. “  ",State senator sanctioned after release of ethics report,"Thursday, March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/26/state-senator-sanctioned-after-release-of-ethics-r/,washington_times
"The idea of giving homeowners a timeout from paying their monthly mortgages during the coronavirus outbreak is spreading across the country like, well, like coronavirus. A growing list of states have either made deals or ordered lenders in their states to temporarily waive mortgage payments and halt foreclosures and evictions — anything to keep the financial woes of the COVID-19 outbreak from ending up on the streets. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who lead two of the states hardest-hit by the virus, both announced three-month suspensions of mortgage payments for those suffering financial hardship from the coronavirus crisis. It’s a tantalizing option for governors in other states as millions of suddenly unemployed Americans face the prospect of choosing between making a mortgage payment or keeping cash on hand for necessities like food and medicine. Consumer Reports, a nonpartisan consumer advocacy group, urged the Mortgage Bankers Association in a letter Thursday to take steps to provide options to homeowners facing financial hardship. The California-New York model is spreading as state governments have forced businesses to close their doors in an attempt to blunt the pandemic. Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina all called for temporary halts on foreclosures and evictions, and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan ordered landlords to drop all evictions for the duration of the state of emergency in the state. He also barred utilities from shutting off service or charging late fees. The Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Federal Housing Administration last week announced forbearance — or delayed payment — programs for loans backed by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and in Ginnie Mae, which account for 60% of home loans. Congress’ $2 trillion economic rescue bill for the coronavirus crisis, which is expected to reach President Trump’s desk as soon as Friday, codifies the six-month forbearance option for every federally-backed mortgage. While homeowners get a reprieve, mortgage companies would still be on the hook for interest and principle when borrowers skip monthly payments. The mortgage industry is pressing the Trump administration and Congress to set up a lending program worth billions to keep banks and mortgage services afloat. “The unprecedented and unexpected wave of forbearance requests will place a significant strain on mortgage servicers. Even if a quarter of all borrowers request forbearance for six months or longer, cash demands on servicers could exceed $75 billion and could climb well above $100 billion,” said Mike Fratantoni, senior vice president and chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. “That is why it is absolutely critical for the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury to immediately establish a liquidity facility so that otherwise solvent mortgage servicers can borrow from the Fed to support these forbearance programs. This needed backstop for servicers will ultimately support homeowners during these challenging times,” he said. The program in the economic rescue bill would allow homeowners an initial six-month forbearance of mortgage payments and a six-month extension if needed. The legislation also freezes foreclosure proceedings on federally backed loans. When announcing the mortgage reprieve in California, Mr. Newsom said millions of families can breathe a sigh of relief. “These new financial protections will provide relief to California families and serve as a model for the rest of the nation. I thank each of the financial institutions that will provide this relief to millions of Californians who have been hurt financially from COVID-19,” he said. The California Democrat worked with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Citigroup — along with hundreds of state-chartered financial institutions — to ensure Californians could request a grace period on payments if impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Those banks are offering mortgage forbearance for 90 days to borrowers who qualify and late payments won’t be reported to creditors. Foreclosure sales and evictions have also been put on pause for 60 days in California. And for 90 days, late fees will be refunded or waived. Bank of America said some of their customers can request a deferral of payments for home equity loans, according to multiple reports. Days before California made its moves, Mr. Cuomo signed an order mandating businesses to decrease in-office workers by 75% to enforce work-at-home policies in New York, which has the most COVID-19 cases and fatalities. In the same order, Mr. Cuomo said the Department of Financial Services directed New York state mortgage providers to provide relief to borrowers for three months. Mortgage payments would be waived for financial hardships caused by the spread of the virus and mandated quarantines. Grace periods, waived late fees and postponing foreclosures were also included in his order. Mr. Cuomo also instructed state banks to waive ATM fees and overdraft fees. “We know there is going to be an economic impact across the state and we are taking new actions to support the thousands of New Yorkers and small businesses who are suffering. It’s going to be hard, it’s going to be disruptive, but we will get through this together,” he said. On the federal level, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Dr. Ben Carson said there will be a 60-day break for homeowners with mortgages through the FHA. The Trump administration also pressed mortgage services to offer forbearance for any homeowner in financial distress. “It is important, if you’re having difficulty, to actually contact the people who have made the loan, who established the mortgage because it doesn’t happen automatically,” said Mr. Carson. “What we’re trying to do is bridge the gap, recognizing that it’s a lot easier for us to take these measures and for Congress to take the measures that they’re taking so that we don’t destroy a very excellent system and have to start all over again,” he said.

"WASHINGTON — The White House coronavirus response coordinator says the task force is concerned about certain counties in the Midwest that appear to be seeing a rapid increase in cases. Dr. Deborah Birx listed two counties: Wayne County in Michigan and Cook County in Illinois. She said at Thursday’s White House briefing that the task force is not only looking at where the cases are today, but where they will be in the future so the Federal Emergency Management Agency can be alerted to where the next hotspots will be. Birx says the two counties both are in urban areas or in communities that serve an urban area. Chicago is the seat of Cook County, which is one of the most populous counties in the United States.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The $2 trillion legislative package moving through Congress to shore up the U.S. economy devastated by the coronavirus was carefully written to prevent President Donald Trump and his family from profiting from the federal fund. But the fine print reveals that businesses owned by Trump and his family still may be eligible for some assistance. The massive relief fund, rushed through the Senate and expected to soon be passed by the House, includes language inserted by Democrats that explicitly prevents Trump, who did not divest from his company before taking office, from using the federal money as a windfall for his struggling hotel and country club business.  Ethics groups warn, though, that the 880-page bill contains loopholes in the ethics ban and wording elsewhere could theoretically allow the banned parties to still benefit from the federal giveaways. After analyzing the massive bill, the DC-based ethics group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said Trump and his family might still benefit from provisions in the package that are aimed more broadly at various parts of the U.S. economy.  “While they still may benefit from parts of this bill, on first read it appears only in ways that would benefit many others,” said CREW spokesman Jordan Libowitz. Certain hotel owners, including those employing thousands of people, will be eligible for small-business loans, a provision that could potentially help Trump’s company continue to pay wages for his employees. The Trump Organization could also benefit from a $15 billion change to the tax code won by retailers and restaurants. Six of the Trump Organization’s seven most profitable clubs and hotels are shut down because of restrictions imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including the lush Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and hotels in Las Vegas, Ireland and Scotland. Several others, including the hotel in Washington, just a few blocks from the White House, have remained open but with curtailed operations. Trump turned over control of his business to his adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, when he took office. He did not rule out accepting federal funds for the businesses when pressed about it earlier this week. “I don’t know,” Trump said. “I just don’t know what the government assistance would be for what I have. I have hotels. Everybody knew I had hotels when I got elected. They knew I was a successful person when I got elected, so it’s one of those things.” The pandemic comes at a fraught time for the Trump real estate empire. Several properties are losing money while some residential buildings and hotels paying to brand themselves with the Trump name have removed the name because of his politics.  The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment. The hotel industry has been devastated by the slowdown in travel. Many hotels are closed. For the week ending March 21, occupancy rates plummeted 56% to an average of 30%. Last year, occupancy rates averaged near 70%. The industry was mainly looking for help for small businesses in the stimulus bill. Most U.S. hotels are operated by franchisees, and 33,000 of the 56,000 hotels in the U.S. are classified as small businesses. Those hotels will be eligible for loans from the Small Business Administration. The package also contains $454 billion in loans for larger businesses that have been hurt by the virus. Moreover, the family real estate firm of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, could also benefit from the economic package. Kushner stepped down from his prior role as CEO but, like Trump, he did not sell off his multi-million dollar investment portfolio, which included investments in the family firm and other holdings partnered with his parents and siblings. Instead, Kushner has retained passive ownership stakes in his family firm’s interests, which potentially might allow him to sidestep the ethics ban - depending on whether one of those interests seeks federal aid. Under the wording of the legislation’s ethics rules, the ban only kicks in when the affected party retains more than 20% ownership in a stake requesting federal aid from the stimulus.  Some of Kushner’s stakes in his family firm’s interests, according to his most recent 2019 financial disclosure and to a New York Times analysis, appear to be minority holdings below that 20% threshold. Kushner could potentially also benefit from a separate $300 billion stimulus provision aimed at aiding small businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Under the stipulations of the stimulus, eligible companies under that size limit could obtain up to $10 million in forgivable federal loans as long as they retained their workers for the duration of the coronavirus crisis. The AP emailed representatives for Jared Kushner and Kushner Companies, asking about their intentions regarding the stimulus, but did not immediately receive replies.  ___ Lemire reported from New York.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - Three immigrant children in U.S. government custody at a New York facility have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said Thursday. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, said it has suspended releases from centers in New York that house immigrant children who were apprehended by U.S. border authorities without their parents or a guardian.  Five staff members and a contractor at three separate facilities in New York also recently tested positive for the virus, as well as a staff member at a Texas facility and a foster parent in Washington state, the office said in a statement. The announcement came a day after immigrant advocates asked a federal judge in Los Angeles to order the agency to release about 1,200 immigrant children who have been in government custody more than 30 days due to concerns about the virus. The judge has scheduled a videoconference on the request for Friday. The office is tasked with the custody and care of immigrant children caught traveling alone across the U.S.-Mexico border. It contracts with shelters across the United States to house these children until they can be released to fitting sponsors, most often their relatives. There are about 3,500 children in the office’s custody.

"Joseph R. Biden ostensibly could be running his presidential campaign from the dwarf planet of Pluto, while President Trump bulldozes ahead from the center of the political universe in Washington. The COVID-19 pandemic has basically thrown the presidential campaign into limbo and put traditional campaigning on ice. It has left Mr. Biden, 77, in the tricky position of trying to reinvent himself online, unite the Democratic Party and build an internet army from the recreation room of his home in Delaware. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been the star of the show in the nation’s capital. Flanked by doctors, administration officials and public health gurus, his almost daily White House briefings have been must-watch television, driving the storyline from Washington and driving his critics mad. Mr. Trump’s focus on the economy and clashes with the press over his rosy outlook have infuriated far-left activists. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee is circulating a petition calling on news media to boycott the Trump briefings. The committee says the briefings “have turned into a torrent of lies and misinformation” that mislead the public and put more lives at risk. Mr. Trump, however, is getting positive marks from the general public. The latest Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans, including 1 in 4 Democrats, approve of the president’s response to the crisis and that nearly half of voters give his overall performance a thumbs up, marking an uptick from earlier this month. Democrats, however, insist that the bounce will be short-lived and that Mr. Trump’s response won’t age well. “All of us have a reflex to trust the commander in chief when we are under attack. I mean, it is a self-preservation reflex. It is a traditional American reflex,” said former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. “In this case, though, as this crisis continues to roll forward, people will come to understand that trusting the president could be deadly right now for themselves and their families. He is still thinking like a guy with hotel investments instead of like the commander in chief. “The after-action report on this won’t be pretty,” he said. “This was not something that was suddenly sprung upon us without warning.” Mr. O’Malley said Mr. Biden has been a study in contrast, offering the nation a calm and steady voice in a time of crisis. He also said Mr. Biden distanced himself from Mr. Trump early on by sounding the alarm on the coronavirus outbreak when the president was downplaying the threat. “The danger for him is speaking in any sort of way that looks overtly calculating, political or self-promotional, and I don’t think he has done that,” Mr. O’Malley said. Still, Mr. Biden’s foray into the land of pixels has been a wayward adventure. On the one hand, it has provided him with a bullhorn he can use to knock the Trump administration, stay connected with voters and reach out to others, such as millennials, who have been slow to warm to his bid. On the other hand, the Biden livestreams and interviews with the likes of Whoopi Goldberg at times have been full of gaffes, cringeworthy moments and a teleprompter issue or two. Mr. Biden has stumbled over words, jumped between thoughts, and made up claims on the fly, including the suggestion that he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Trump retweeted a series of the stumbles that mocked Mr. Biden as the “Democrat’s best & finest!” “It’s no surprise the Biden campaign is struggling to adapt technologically. After all, Biden is entirely dependent on the teleprompter, thinks record players are widespread, and says one clips coupons in the stock market,” said Steve Guest, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee. “Meanwhile, the RNC and the Trump campaign are running circles around the Biden campaign when it comes to adapting our field effort to the constraints imposed by the coronavirus,” he said. Mr. Biden also has been upstaged by other Democrats, most notably Andrew Cuomo. The New York governor has received high praise for the way he has handled the crisis in his state. Despite all that, Democrats say the current situation could help the Biden campaign by giving it time to reset after a rapid rise in the Democratic primary race and to build out a more robust operation ahead of a likely general election showdown with Mr. Trump. He is starting from a solid position. A Monmouth University poll released this week found that Mr. Biden is leading Mr. Trump by a 48% to 45% margin and that he is the preferred candidate of voters in more than 300 swing counties across the nation. Outside groups, meanwhile, have started to lend a hand. The Win the West super PAC, led by former Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and former Biden speechwriter Matt Littman, has launched a campaign targeting battleground states including Texas and Arizona. The group also started airing a “Leadership Matters” digital ad using Mr. Trump’s own words against him. The ad highlights the president’s push to cut the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and his claims that the administration had the coronavirus outbreak “totally under control” and that the virus is a “new hoax.” The spot then pivots to a speech in which Mr. Biden says the most important job of the president is to protect the health and safety of Americans. “Downplaying it, being overly dismissive or spreading misinformation is only going to hurt us and further advantage the spread of the disease,” Mr. Biden says in the ad. “This administration has left us woefully unprepared for the exact crisis we now face.”  ",Biden hunkers down in Delaware as Trump takes center stage,"Thursday, March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/26/joe-biden-hunkers-down-delaware-donald-trump-takes/,washington_times
"LOS ANGELES (AP) - An executive with the company that owns Santa Anita urged the California Horse Racing Board on Thursday to continue live racing despite a statewide stay-at-home order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Santa Anita in Arcadia, outside Los Angeles, and Golden Gate Fields in the San Francisco Bay area are among a handful of U.S. tracks continuing to race without fans. Both are owned by The Stronach Group. “We are very different from almost every other industry. Horses need exercise,” Aidan Butler, acting executive director of California racing operations for Stronach, told the board during its monthly meeting held via conference call. “The second we stop racing, the whole ecosystem becomes in jeopardy.” The issue of continuing live racing during the pandemic wasn’t on the board’s agenda, but the question was raised by board member Wendy Mitchell. Several animal activists condemned the board for allowing live racing to go on during a public comment period on the call. Nationwide, Stonach-owned Gulfstream and Tampa Bay Downs in Florida, Oaklawn in Arkansas and Remington in Oklahoma City are staging live racing while the NBA and NHL have put their seasons on hold. Major League Baseball was supposed to begin its season on Thursday, but it has been postponed. “You can’t look at all tracks the same,” Butler said. “In California, we are not subsidized. We can sustain as long as we can keep the sport going.” Gov. Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home order for California has resulted in businesses shutting down or dramatically scaling back to protect against the spread of the virus.  Coronovirus cases in California are increasing as more testing is done. A tally by Johns Hopkins University counted over 3,200 confirmed cases and at least 65 deaths. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  Dr. Rick Arthur, equine medical director for the board, said continuing to race “certainly isn’t a medical necessity” for horses. “It is a health consideration that they train,” he said. “These are very fit, healthy, very good feeling athletes, and you just can’t keep them in a stall. You have to get them out and train them.” Santa Anita’s stable area has about 1,700 horses and 750 workers on the grounds. The track has racing Friday, Saturday and Sunday each week. Arthur, whose office is located in the stable area, said “rather extraordinary” efforts have been made to maintain sanitary conditions. “I want to make sure we’re making the best decision for the state of California and taking what the governor said very, very seriously,” Mitchell said. “Other tracks around the country are shutting down.” Keeneland in Kentucky canceled its upcoming spring meet, and Aqueduct in New York cut short its meet after a backstretch employee who lives and works at Belmont Park tested positive for the virus. “The optics of us continuing racing while the rest of the world is at home, I understand looks terrible,” Butler told the board. However, he said a track’s stable area is “by its nature kind of a quarantined area.” Santa Anita’s backstretch workers typically live in dorms on the property and have access to an on-site health clinic. Butler said food that was to be used when the track was open to the public was re-directed to stable workers and food delivery has been set up so they don’t have to leave the property. “I’m not trying to be alarmist,” Butler said. “I can assure you if we don’t keep everybody together and safe we’re going to end up with a bunch of homeless people and a bunch of animal issues.” Anyone coming to Santa Anita from out of state is first required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Cliff Goodrich, executive director of the California Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Foundation, said if racing stops workers would have nowhere to go and “end up out in communities with the risking of infecting others.” He said he wasn’t aware of any backstretch workers being tested yet or of any coronavirus infections. Goodrich said it costs $20,000 a day to maintain the stable area. “Right now the only funding source we have is advanced deposit wagering,” he said. “If that shuts down, we would have to shut our doors and not be able to treat backstretch workers.” Several animal activists used their two minutes during the public comment portion to assail the board. Some said they watched last weekend’s racing at Santa Anita online and noticed social distancing wasn’t being practiced and people were not wearing masks or gloves. “Since you haven’t tested one person at the racetrack, who knows how many people are infected?” a woman said. “Horse racing is not essential to keep open.” Oscar De La Torre, an advocate for backstretch workers, urged the board to keep workers and their families at the forefront.  “These workers are very vulnerable,” he said. “The fact that people can still work has given them a lot of certainty in their lives. We just need to make sure we’re thinking about the workers and their families at this time and allowing them the opportunities to continue to work, of course with safety first.” Another activist said she noticed workers touching each other’s equipment during last weekend’s races. “This is very irresponsible,” she said. “Coronavirus does not know any boundaries.”   ",Activists assail California board for keeping tracks open,"Thursday, March 26, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/26/activists-assail-california-board-for-keeping-trac/,washington_times
"MIAMI (AP) - A former aide to the mayor of Miami who was previously charged in state court with groping a teenage boy at City Hall and then sending him a lewd photograph is now facing federal child porn charges. The U.S. attorney’s office in Miami filed a criminal complaint Wednesday against Rene Pedrosa, 48. Charges include producing child pornography, receiving child pornography and enticing a minor into sexual activity. Online court records didn’t list an attorney for Pedrosa. Pedrosa was a high-profile spokesman for Miami Mayor Francis Suarez until the investigation became public, triggering his resignation last month. Before that, Pedrosa was a longtime reporter for a Miami Spanish-language television station. According to the federal complaint, Pedrosa contacted the 16-year-old victim in November through Instagram to discuss a web design job at the mayor’s office. During a meeting later that month at City Hall, Pedrosa touched the teen inappropriately, investigators said. Pedrosa and the teen later exchanged explicit photos through text, the complaint said. The teen’s mother reported Pedrosa to Miami police in January. Pedrosa was charged last month with battery and transmitting pornography to a minor, state court records show. The Miami-Dade state attorney’s office asked Gov. Ron DeSantis to assign the case to a different prosecutor because of contacts Pedrosa had with the Miami office.

"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota is suing the federal government on behalf of a U.S. citizen who alleges he was unlawfully detained.  The ACLU-MN filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court in Minnesota on behalf of Ali Abdalla. Abdalla came to the U.S. as a Somali refugee. When his father became a U.S. citizen, Abdalla - who was a teenager at the time - automatically became one, too.  But Abdalla alleges U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement unlawfully held him for 11 months in three different jails - including for five months after a judge ruled he was a citizen while the government appealed. Abdalla had suffered a traumatic brain injury at an old job, and officials at Nobles County Jail provided him anxiety medication, the ACLU-MN said. But when he was transferred to Sherburne County Jail, workers refused to let him take that medication, the organization alleges. The lawsuit alleges false arrest, false imprisonment and deprivation of liberty without due process. It seeks damages and requests a jury trial. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Minneapolis said Thursday the office declines comment at this time.

"LOS ANGELES — California hired retired state workers and transferred other employees to help process an avalanche of over 1 million unemployment claims amid a surge of job losses from the coronavirus pandemic, the state said Thursday. The announcement came as Los Angeles saw a 50% jump in newly confirmed coronavirus cases, which could top 1 million within weeks, a public health official said. While the state had some of the first cases of the virus in the nation from travelers coming from the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, it has managed to keep its numbers below those in New York, which is at the heart of the crisis. California had more than 3,200 confirmed cases and 68 deaths at midday, according to numbers kept by Johns Hopkins University. By comparison, New York had more than 37,000 cases and 385 deaths. About a third of the nation’s record-level of unemployment claims are in California, where thousands of businesses have been forced to shut down following Gov. Gavin Newsom’s order for people to stay at home unless their jobs are deemed essential or they’re buying food, medicine, visiting a doctor or exercising. The Employment Development Department said it was working around the clock to process claims and had moved staff from other departments to help handle the load. “We know there are many Californians who are really struggling to provide for their families because of the massive economic impact,” Director Sharon Hilliard said in a news release. “EDD is employing all means necessary to get benefit payments out to those in need.” In Los Angeles, the number of confirmed cases jumped from about 800 to over 1,200 in 24 hours, which was directly correlated to an increase in the availability of test kits, public health Director Barbara Ferrer said. About 10% of people tested are positive for COVID-19. Deaths in the nation’s most populous jumped from 12 to 21. If each infected person spreads the virus to two others, the number could quickly overwhelm hospitals, Ferrer said as she urged people to avoid exposure. “We have to assume that the spread of COVID-19 is happening all across the county,” Ferrer said. “If we don’t curtail that spread, within a few weeks there could be over a 1 million people infected in LA County.” ___ Dil reported from Sacramento.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday batted aside talk that he could be part of the 2020 Democratic presidential ticket amid a rise in his national profile during the expanding coronavirus outbreak. “I don’t want to be vice president,” Mr. Cuomo said on WAMC radio. “I told the people of the state of New York I wanted to be governor, and I said I would serve as governor, and that’s what I want to do.” Host Alan Chartock had raised the possibility and pointed to a recent poll showing Mr. Cuomo with a 73% approval rating among New York City voters. “I am not doing anything different than I have done all my life, right?” Mr. Cuomo said. “I do what I do, right? It’s the same process for me, but to the extent it helps people now, I’m happy.” Seemingly trying to stir the pot, Mr. Chartock pointed out that the same poll showed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio — a sometimes frenemy of Mr. Cuomo — had an approval rating of 40%. Mr. Cuomo has been front and center during the COVID-19 crisis as chief executive of the hardest-hit state. He’s had an on-again, off-again relationship with President Trump and his daily updates on the virus’s impact on New York are routinely broadcast on national cable networks. “People are dying,” the governor said. “There’s nothing I can do about it. I’m trying to do everything I can do. I’m working 24 hours a day. “I think I know how to help, but I can’t stop it. I cannot stop it, and it hurts me,” he continued. “And you know, you talk about the poll says this, the poll says that. I look at that death count and it breaks my heart, and those are the numbers I’m watching.” Earlier in the day, Mr. Cuomo reported that there have been 385 coronavirus-related deaths in New York, up from 285 deaths he had reported Wednesday. The running mate point could be moot, as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden has already said he would tap a woman to be on the ticket if he’s the Democratic nominee. Mr. Biden has accumulated a delegate lead that will be almost impossible for Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, the lone remaining major Democratic contender, to overcome. With traditional campaigning on hold because of the coronavirus, Mr. Biden has been largely relegated to his Wilmington, Delaware home and has been making sporadic media appearances and virtual addresses.

"PHUKET, Thailand (AP) - From the sun-soaked beaches of Thailand to the foothills of Mount Everest in Nepal, tourists across Asia are finding their dream vacations have turned into travel nightmares as airlines cancel flights and countries close their borders in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds of tourists escaping cold weather in Europe were scrambling this week to find alternative ways to return home from the Thai island of Phuket in the Adaman Sea.  Ksenia Vostriakova and her friends were scheduled to fly back to Moscow on an April 3 Singapore Airlines flight, but it was among those canceled when the airline slashed its operations. They have booked a flight on Qatar Airways for April 6 and are hoping nothing else changes. “Now we’re really worried that this flight also might be canceled,” Vostriakova said, adding that their Thai visas run out in mid-April. “We might still stay here because everything changes.” Thailand went under a state of emergency this week as the government gives itself new powers to deal with the virus crisis. The country, which last year welcomed 39 million tourists, announced it was closing its borders to nearly all foreigners. It’s national airline Thai Airways said it was suspending almost all of its flights. It’s a trend seen around the region and the world. The Airports Council International Asia-Pacific said Friday that 12 major hubs in Asia-Pacific had seen an average decrease in air traffic of more than 80% in the second week of March versus the same period last year. Up to 10,000 tourists are believed to be stranded in Nepal after the government ordered a complete lockdown that halted all flights and road travel to prevent the spread of the virus, the country’s tourism board said. Most businesses and government offices were also shut.  Spring is the tourist season for Nepal when thousands of visitors come to hike the mountain trails. At the Lukla Airport, the only gateway to the Mount Everest region, there were more than 200 trekkers stranded, according to Dhurba Shrestha, an airport official. Even if the highways were open, the closest road is three days trek downhill. Officials were working on arrangements of special flights to at least get tourists back to the capital, Kathmandu. The German government on Friday arranged a rescue flight - a Qatar Airways charter - that left the capital with 305 people on board, mostly German nationals. In Kathmandu’s tourist enclave, visitors could still be found wandering around empty streets. A handful of restaurants and hotels were still open, but most shops were shuttered. Police were blocking locals from moving around but not tourists. “We were supposed to leave on March 21 but we are still in Nepal and waiting for our embassy to help us arrange a flight,” said New Lee Kuan, from Malaysia. The Indian Ocean island nation of Sri Lanka said that it was ready to help an estimated 18,000 tourists return home either via scheduled flights that are still operating or special charters if required. The country is under a nationwide curfew until at least next week. In Indonesia, more than 2,500 foreign tourists were stranded in Bali, the most famous of the country’s more than 17,000 islands. The government has granted all tourists automatic visa extensions, a move made after long lines formed at immigration offices. “This is good news that helped us a lot,” said Ruben Evert Ernst, a German on vacation with his partner whose visa had been set to expire in a few days. Visitors to Thailand haven’t been so lucky. Hundreds of tourists seeking visa extensions were crowded Friday under a row of awnings next to a makeshift immigration office that’s been set up on the outskirts of Bangkok after throngs formed at the main building. There wasn’t enough room for the tourists to keep their distance and stay in the shade so most were pressed up almost against one another. “I woke up today at 5:30 to get here on time so it’s very stressful,” said Murdoch Baghaie, from Sacramento, California. “I’m supposed to be a tourist enjoying the scenery. Nothing like enjoying Thailand anymore.” Shopping malls, bars, sit-down restaurants, public swimming pools and many other places have all been ordered closed in Thailand. At least for now, Phuket’s beaches remain open. That’s good news for Russian tourist Vitaliy Kurikov, who has been spending his days playing with his son on the white sands of Bagntao beach. “If they close the beaches, I really don’t know what to do,” he said.  ___ Associated Press journalists Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, Bharatha Mallawarachi in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Upendra Mansingh in Kathmandu, Nepal, and Tassanee Vejpongsa in Bangkok contributed to this report.

"House lawmakers from across the country were scrambling to get back to Washington Friday morning in time for a possible roll-call vote on a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package after a Republican lawmaker threatened to block leaders’ plans to hold an informal voice vote. House leadership began advising lawmakers on Thursday night to return to Washington from their districts if possible because they anticipate that Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky could call for a roll-call vote on the package that was approved by the Senate earlier this week. Leaders in both parties were pushing for a voice vote, which does not require most members to be present, to minimize the health risk for lawmakers who would need to travel long distances to vote in person. It would take only one lawmaker to object to a voice vote. Mr. Massie on Thursday tweeted his concerns about the bill and the Senate process for approving it. “The senate did some voodoo just like with Obamacare. Took a House Bill (HR 748) dealing with taxes, stripped every word, and put their bill in it. The House is just as responsible for killing the origination clause as the Senate.  It’s the House’s job to reject the process,” Mr. Massie tweeted. In a radio interview on Thursday, Mr. Massie said he plans to vote against the package, which includes direct payments of $1,200 to most taxpayers, $500 billion in loans for distressed corporations and $367 billion in job-retention loans for small businesses. “If it were just about helping people to get more unemployment [benefits] to get through this calamity that, frankly, the governors have wrought on the people, then I could be for it,” Mr. Massie said on KRC radio in Kentucky.  “But this is $2 trillion. Divide $2 trillion by 350 million people — it’s almost $6,000 for every man, woman and child. I’m talking about spending. This won’t go to the men, women and children. So if you have a family of five, this spending bill represents $30,000 of additional U.S. national debt because there is no plan to pay for it.” Mr. Massie, who voted in favor of the first $8.3 billion coronavirus aid measure, said the House shouldn’t hold an informal voice vote on such an expensive package. “I’m having a really hard time with this. Because they’re saying, ‘Well it’s hard to travel, yadda yadda yadda,’ ” Mr. Massie said. “Well, [Wednesday] night, 96 out of 100 senators voted. All we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote. I know there are people saying, ‘Oh, you gotta vote for it. You can’t slow this down.’ Meanwhile, they spent a week in the Senate arguing how much money should go to the Kennedy Center.” The Kennedy Center would receive $25 million under the bill, an expense that President Trump said he supports. “So many are trying to get their pork in this bill!” Mr. Massie tweeted this week.His threat to derail the voice vote was infuriating some colleagues. “Dear @RepThomasMassie: If you intend to delay passage of the #coronavirus relief bill [Friday] morning, please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend ~$200,000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt,” tweeted Rep. Dean Phillips, Minnesota Democrat.

"President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged in a phone call early Friday to cooperate in the battle against the coronavirus, a sign of easing tensions between the two nations. “Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!” Mr. Trump has refrained in recent days using the phrase “Chinese virus” to describe the outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China. He told Fox News he would stop using the term but didn’t regret it, noting that China blamed U.S. soldiers for starting the pandemic. The U.S. this week passed China in the number of reported coronavirus cases, with more than 85,000. China has reported 3,296 deaths, compared with 1,296 in the U.S. Mr. Xi told Mr. Trump in the phone call that relations between the two sides were at a “critical moment,” according to China’s official Xinhua News Agency. He vowed to help the U.S. “I am very worried about the outbreak in the U.S., and I’ve noticed the series of measures being taken by the U.S. president,” Mr. Xi said, according to Xinhua. “Chinese people sincerely hope the outbreak can be contained very soon. Both sides will benefit if we cooperate. Both will lose if we fight each other.” The Chinese leader said cooperation “is the only correct choice.” “I hope the U.S side could take real actions. The two sides should work together to enhance cooperation fighting the virus and develop non-confrontational” relations, he said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday criticized “the disinformation campaign that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in to try to deflect from what has really taken place here.” • This article was based in part on wire service reports.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - With rare bipartisanship and speed, Washington is about to deliver massive, unprecedented legislation to speed help to people and businesses as the coronavirus pandemic takes a devastating toll on the U.S. economy and health care system. The House is set to pass the sprawling $2.2 trillion measure on Friday morning after an extraordinary 96-0 Senate vote late Wednesday. President Donald Trump marveled at the unanimity Thursday and is eager to sign the package into law. The relief can hardly come soon enough. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday the economy “may well be in recession” already, and the government reported a shocking 3.3 million burst of weekly jobless claims, more than four times the previous record. The U.S. death toll has surpassed 1,200 from the virus. It is unlikely to be the end of the federal response. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that issues like more generous food stamp payments, aid to state and local governments and family leave may be revisited in subsequent legislation. “There’s so many things we didn’t get in … that we need to,” Pelosi told reporters Thursday. The legislation will pour $1,200 direct payments to individuals and a flood of subsidized loans, grants and tax breaks to businesses facing extinction in an economic shutdown caused as Americans self-isolate by the tens of millions. It dwarfs prior Washington efforts to take on economic crises and natural disasters, such as the 2008 Wall Street bailout and President Barack Obama’s first-year economic recovery act. But key elements are untested, such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses. Millions of rebate payments will go to people who have retained their jobs. Policymakers worry that bureaucracies like the Small Business Administration may become overwhelmed, and conservatives fear that a new, generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning to the workforce. A new $500 billion subsidized lending program for larger businesses is unproven as well. First the measure must clear Congress. Leaders in both parties had hoped to pass the measure with a sparsely attended voice vote - remarkable for a bill of such magnitude - so scattered lawmakers don’t have to risk exposure by travelling back to Washington. But now it is feared iconoclastic Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., an opponent of the bill, may seek to force a roll call vote. Democratic leaders summoned members back to Washington, at least those who are able and willing to return. Friday’s House session will also be unprecedented. Originally scheduled as a non-working “pro forma” meeting, the session will be extended to a debate on the bill - all conducted under social distancing rules to minimize the risk of transmitting the virus. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, one of the House’s conservative leaders, said he wasn’t aware of anyone planning to block a voice vote Friday but planned to talk more with colleagues before the vote. “If that’s the method used to get this to the American people, to get this passed, then I think lots of members are probably OK with that,” Jordan said Thursday as he drove back to Washington. “I know the plan is for it to be a voice vote, and that’s what the leadership has said they’re for, and I think that’s fine.” Wednesday night’s unanimous Senate vote on the bill was especially striking - a united front that followed days of sometimes tumultuous negotiations and partisan eruptions. Democrats twice voted to block the bill to seek further add-ons and changes. “The power of the argument that we had - that you need a strong government to solve these problems, both health and economic - carried the day,” Schumer told The Associated Press on Thursday. “Had we not stood up on those two votes it wouldn’t have happened.” Underscoring the effort’s sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House’s best guess of the spending it contains. The rescue bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis. “We call them checks in the mail, but most of them will be direct deposits,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday. “It will be within three weeks. We’re determined to get money in people’s pocket immediately.” The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department’s discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible. There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads. Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit that’s estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers’ paycheck up to $10,000. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A huge tax break for interest costs and operating losses limited by the 2017 tax overhaul was restored at a $200 billion cost in a boon for the real estate sector. An additional $45 billion would fund additional relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for local response efforts and community services.  Most people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.  ___ Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.

"Joseph R. Biden ostensibly could be running his presidential campaign from the dwarf planet of Pluto, while President Trump bulldozes ahead from the center of the political universe in Washington. The COVID-19 pandemic has basically thrown the presidential campaign into limbo and put traditional campaigning on ice. It has left Mr. Biden, 77, in the tricky position of trying to reinvent himself online, unite the Democratic Party and build an internet army from the recreation room of his home in Delaware. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been the star of the show in the nation’s capital. Flanked by doctors, administration officials and public health gurus, his almost daily White House briefings have been must-watch television, driving the storyline from Washington and driving his critics mad. Mr. Trump’s focus on the economy and clashes with the press over his rosy outlook have infuriated far-left activists. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee is circulating a petition calling on news media to boycott the Trump briefings. The committee says the briefings “have turned into a torrent of lies and misinformation” that mislead the public and put more lives at risk. Mr. Trump, however, is getting positive marks from the general public. The latest Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans, including 1 in 4 Democrats, approve of the president’s response to the crisis and that nearly half of voters give his overall performance a thumbs up, marking an uptick from earlier this month. Democrats, however, insist that the bounce will be short-lived and that Mr. Trump’s response won’t age well. “All of us have a reflex to trust the commander in chief when we are under attack. I mean, it is a self-preservation reflex. It is a traditional American reflex,” said former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. “In this case, though, as this crisis continues to roll forward, people will come to understand that trusting the president could be deadly right now for themselves and their families. He is still thinking like a guy with hotel investments instead of like the commander in chief. “The after-action report on this won’t be pretty,” he said. “This was not something that was suddenly sprung upon us without warning.” Mr. O’Malley said the former vice president has been a study in contrast, offering the nation a calm and steady voice in a time of crisis. He also said Mr. Biden distanced himself from Mr. Trump early on by sounding the alarm on the coronavirus outbreak when the president was downplaying the threat. “The danger for him is speaking in any sort of way that looks overtly calculating, political or self-promotional, and I don’t think he has done that,” Mr. O’Malley said. Still, Mr. Biden’s foray into the land of pixels has been a wayward adventure. On the one hand, it has provided him with a bullhorn he can use to knock the Trump administration, stay connected with voters and reach out to others, such as millennials, who have been slow to warm to his bid. On the other hand, the Biden livestreams and interviews with the likes of Whoopi Goldberg at times have been full of gaffes, cringeworthy moments and a teleprompter issue or two. Mr. Biden has stumbled over words, jumped between thoughts, and made up claims on the fly, including the suggestion that he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Trump retweeted a series of the stumbles that mocked Mr. Biden as the “Democrat’s best & finest!” “It’s no surprise the Biden campaign is struggling to adapt technologically. After all, Biden is entirely dependent on the teleprompter, thinks record players are widespread, and says one clips coupons in the stock market,” said Steve Guest, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee. “Meanwhile, the RNC and the Trump campaign are running circles around the Biden campaign when it comes to adapting our field effort to the constraints imposed by the coronavirus,” he said. Mr. Biden also has been upstaged by other Democrats, most notably Andrew Cuomo. The New York governor has received high praise for the way he has handled the crisis in his state. Despite all that, Democrats say the current situation could help the Biden campaign by giving it time to reset after a rapid rise in the Democratic primary race and to build out a more robust operation ahead of a likely general election showdown with Mr. Trump. He is starting from a solid position. A Monmouth University poll released this week found that Mr. Biden is leading Mr. Trump by a 48% to 45% margin and that he is the preferred candidate of voters in more than 300 swing counties across the nation. Outside groups, meanwhile, have started to lend a hand. The Win the West super PAC, led by former Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and former Biden speechwriter Matt Littman, has launched a campaign targeting battleground states including Texas and Arizona. The group also started airing a “Leadership Matters” digital ad using Mr. Trump’s own words against him.

"U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Friday said that some areas in the country are going to need “a lot more” than the 15-day period that’s coming to a close during which the federal government advised the public to avoid crowds and stay at home if possible. “I think in some places definitely we’re going to need a lot more,” Dr. Adams said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “Some places haven’t hit their peak yet, and what we’re looking to do in the next week or two is really give people the testing data that they need to make informed choices.” President Trump announced the 15-day timeline on March 16 as a way to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus amid the expanding pandemic. He said this week that it would be great if the U.S. could open back up by Easter, or April 12. “Some places, it doesn’t matter if it’s Easter or if it’s Memorial Day, or if it’s Labor Day — we know that we want people to be thinking about what they can do now so that we can quickly get through this with as few deaths and as few hospitalizations as possible,” Dr. Adams said. Mr. Trump on Thursday said in a letter to the nation’s governors that the administration is working on new guidelines for state and local officials to use in making decisions about potentially relaxing some of the restrictions that have been put into place. The president said new testing capabilities will help classify counties, and that they plan to suggest guidelines labeling counties as low-risk, medium-risk or high-risk. Dr. Adams was asked how those classifications would work practically in terms of slowing the spread without more consistency across the country. “The way it works is through cooperation,”  he said. “We want to make sure people are talking to each other so that if they’re in a high-risk area, they’re taking appropriate precautions,” Dr. Adams said. “If they are in a lower-risk area, it doesn’t mean that you stop social distancing, it doesn’t mean that you stop washing your hands, it doesn’t mean you stop doing the things that we’re telling everyone to do.” “But it means you may not have to be on total lockdown the way that we see New York City and places in California are,” he said. The U.S. now has the most positive coronavirus cases in the world with more than 85,900, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, with at least 1,300 coronavirus-related deaths. New York has been the hardest-hit individual state, but new hotspots have been developing in various places around the country, including in Louisiana.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - House leaders’ plan for swift action on a $2.2 trillion package to ease the coronavirus pandemic ‘s devastating toll on the U.S. economy and health care system ran into complications Friday as a maverick conservative threatened to delay passage until most lawmakers return to Washington for a vote. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who’s opposed to the massive bill, set the House on edge by threatening to try to force a roll call vote. Party leaders had hoped to pass the measure by voice vote without lawmakers having to take the risk of travelling to Washington. Massie took to Twitter to suggest he’d require a quorum of lawmakers - some 216 lawmakers - to be present and voting. Massie didn’t respond to a reporter’s requests for comment. Numerous high-ranking Republicans have called Massie in an attempt to persuade him to let the voice vote proceed, according to a top House GOP aide. They included House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., whom President Donald Trump has chosen as his new chief of staff.  If those efforts fail and a roll call is needed, Republicans believe they will have more than 100 of their members back at the Capitol, according to the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.  Democratic leaders urged lawmakers who are “willing and able” to come to the Capitol to do so. Massie’s move infuriated lawmakers, forcing many to trek to Washington for a vote they’re not even sure will occur. If a quorum can’t assemble Friday, more members would have to travel for a Saturday session.  “Heading to Washington to vote on pandemic legislation. Because of one Member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House,” Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., wrote on Twitter. “Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed. Disgraceful. Irresponsible.” South Dakota GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson posted a selfie photograph of himself and three other lawmakers from the upper Midwest traveling to Washington on an otherwise empty plane. Friday’s House session comes after an extraordinary 96-0 Senate vote late Wednesday. President Donald Trump marveled at the unanimity Thursday and is eager to sign the package into law. The relief can hardly come soon enough. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday the economy “may well be in recession” already, and the government reported a shocking 3.3 million burst of weekly jobless claims, more than four times the previous record. The U.S. death toll from the virus rose to 1,300. House leaders in both parties had hoped to pass the measure with a sparsely attended voice vote - remarkable for a bill of such magnitude - so scattered lawmakers don’t have to risk exposure by travelling back to Washington. Originally scheduled as a non-working “pro forma” meeting, the session will be extended to a debate on the bill - all conducted under social distancing rules to minimize the risk of transmitting the virus. “If that’s the method used to get this to the American people, to get this passed, then I think lots of members are probably OK with that,” said Rep. Jim Jordan Thursday as he drove back to Washington. “I know the plan is for it to be a voice vote, and that’s what the leadership has said they’re for, and I think that’s fine.” It is unlikely to be the end of the federal response. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said issues like more generous food stamp payments, aid to state and local governments and family leave may be revisited in subsequent legislation. “There’s so many things we didn’t get in … that we need to,” Pelosi told reporters Thursday. The legislation will pour $1,200 direct payments to individuals and a flood of subsidized loans, grants and tax breaks to businesses facing extinction in an economic shutdown caused as Americans self-isolate by the tens of millions. It dwarfs prior Washington efforts to take on economic crises and natural disasters, such as the 2008 Wall Street bailout and President Barack Obama’s first-year economic recovery act. But key elements are untested, such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses. Millions of rebate payments will go to people who have retained their jobs. Policymakers worry that bureaucracies like the Small Business Administration may become overwhelmed, and conservatives fear that a new, generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning to the workforce. A new $500 billion subsidized lending program for larger businesses is unproven as well. The bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House’s best guess of the spending it contains. The legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis. The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department’s discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible. There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads. Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit that’s estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers’ paycheck up to $10,000. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A huge tax break for interest costs and operating losses limited by the 2017 tax overhaul was restored at a $200 billion cost in a boon for the real estate sector. An additional $45 billion would fund additional relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for local response efforts and community services.  Most people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.  ___ Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.

"PHUKET, Thailand (AP) - From the sun-soaked beaches of Thailand to the foothills of Mount Everest in Nepal, tourists across Asia are finding their dream vacations have turned into travel nightmares as airlines cancel flights and countries close their borders in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Thousands of tourists escaping cold weather in Europe were scrambling this week to find alternative ways to return home from the Thai island of Phuket in the Adaman Sea.  Ksenia Vostriakova and her friends were scheduled to fly back to Moscow on an April 3 Singapore Airlines flight, but it was among those canceled when the airline slashed its operations. They have booked a flight on Qatar Airways for April 6 and are hoping nothing else changes. “Now we’re really worried that this flight also might be canceled,” Vostriakova said, adding that their Thai visas run out in mid-April. “We might still stay here because everything changes.” Thailand went under a state of emergency this week as the government gives itself new powers to deal with the virus crisis. The country, which last year welcomed 39 million tourists, announced it was closing its borders to nearly all foreigners. Its national airline, Thai Airways, said it was suspending almost all of its flights. It’s a trend seen around the region and the world. The Airports Council International Asia-Pacific said Friday that 12 major hubs in Asia-Pacific had seen an average decrease in air traffic of more than 80% in the second week of March versus the same period last year. Up to 10,000 tourists are believed to be stranded in Nepal after the government ordered a complete lockdown that halted all flights and road travel to prevent the spread of the virus, the country’s tourism board said. Most businesses and government offices were also shut.  Spring is the tourist season for Nepal when thousands of visitors come to hike the mountain trails. At the Lukla Airport, the only gateway to the Mount Everest region, there were more than 200 trekkers stranded, according to Dhurba Shrestha, an airport official. Even if the highways were open, the closest road is three days trek downhill. Officials were working on arrangements of special flights to at least get tourists back to the capital, Kathmandu. The German government on Friday arranged a rescue flight - a Qatar Airways charter - that left the capital with 305 people on board, mostly German nationals. In Kathmandu’s tourist enclave, visitors could still be found wandering around empty streets. A handful of restaurants and hotels were still open, but most shops were shuttered. Police were blocking locals from moving around but not tourists. “We were supposed to leave on March 21 but we are still in Nepal and waiting for our embassy to help us arrange a flight,” said New Lee Kuan, from Malaysia. The Indian Ocean island nation of Sri Lanka said that it was ready to help an estimated 18,000 tourists return home either via scheduled flights that are still operating or special charters if required. The country is under a nationwide curfew until at least next week. In Indonesia, more than 2,500 foreign tourists were stranded in Bali, the most famous of the country’s more than 17,000 islands. The government has granted all tourists automatic visa extensions, a move made after long lines formed at immigration offices. “This is good news that helped us a lot,” said Ruben Evert Ernst, a German on vacation with his partner whose visa had been set to expire in a few days. Visitors to Thailand haven’t been so lucky. Hundreds of tourists seeking visa extensions were crowded Friday under a row of awnings next to a makeshift immigration office that’s been set up on the outskirts of Bangkok after throngs formed at the main building. There wasn’t enough room for the tourists to keep their distance and stay in the shade so most were pressed up almost against one another. “I woke up today at 5:30 to get here on time so it’s very stressful,” said Murdoch Baghaie, from Sacramento, California. “I’m supposed to be a tourist enjoying the scenery. Nothing like enjoying Thailand anymore.” Shopping malls, bars, sit-down restaurants, public swimming pools and many other places have all been ordered closed in Thailand. At least for now, Phuket’s beaches remain open. That’s good news for Russian tourist Vitaliy Kurikov, who has been spending his days playing with his son on the white sands of Bang Tao beach. “If they close the beaches, I really don’t know what to do,” he said.  ___ Associated Press journalists Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, Bharatha Mallawarachi in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Binaj Gurubacharya in Kathmandu, Nepal, and Tassanee Vejpongsa in Bangkok contributed to this report.

"House lawmakers from across the country were scrambling to get back to Washington Friday morning in time for a possible roll-call vote on a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package after a Republican lawmaker threatened to block leaders’ plans to hold an informal voice vote. House leadership began advising lawmakers on Thursday night to return to Washington from their districts if possible because they anticipate that Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky could call for a roll-call vote on the package that was approved by the Senate earlier this week. Leaders in both parties were pushing for a voice vote, which does not require most members to be present, to minimize the health risk for lawmakers who would need to travel long distances to vote in person. It would take only one lawmaker to object to a voice vote. Mr. Massie on Thursday tweeted his concerns about the bill and the Senate process for approving it. “The senate did some voodoo just like with Obamacare. Took a House Bill (HR 748) dealing with taxes, stripped every word, and put their bill in it. The House is just as responsible for killing the origination clause as the Senate.  It’s the House’s job to reject the process,” Mr. Massie tweeted. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, also has threatened to force a roll-call vote, citing her concerns that the legislation favors corporations. “With the health risks of travel, there is no easy choice here,” she told CNN on Wednesday. “But essential workers are showing up and putting their health at risk every day, and if the final text of a bill is set up to hurt them, it may be something we have to do.” Rep. Kevin Brady, Texas Republican, tweeted at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez sarcastically, “Yes, @AOC, do it. Go ahead - delay a House vote. Block help for the worker at a closed plant. The single mom laid off. The server w/no hours. The teetering local business. The family w/CV-19. Reveal to America YOUR socialism: cruel gov’t control that cares only for itself.” President Trump on Thursday said he expected the House to swiftly pass the measure so he can sign it immediately, but he acknowledged that one lawmaker could delay it. “There could be one grandstander maybe,” Mr. Trump said. “You might have one grandstander. And for that, we will have to come back and take a little more time. But it will pass. It’ll just take a little longer. But let’s see whether or not we have a grandstander.” In a radio interview on Thursday, Mr. Massie said he plans to vote against the package, which includes direct payments of $1,200 to most taxpayers, $500 billion in loans for distressed corporations and $367 billion in job-retention loans for small businesses. “If it were just about helping people to get more unemployment [benefits] to get through this calamity that, frankly, the governors have wrought on the people, then I could be for it,” Mr. Massie said on KRC radio in Kentucky.  “But this is $2 trillion. Divide $2 trillion by 350 million people — it’s almost $6,000 for every man, woman and child. I’m talking about spending. This won’t go to the men, women and children. So if you have a family of five, this spending bill represents $30,000 of additional U.S. national debt because there is no plan to pay for it.” Mr. Massie, who voted in favor of the first $8.3 billion coronavirus aid measure, said the House shouldn’t hold an informal voice vote on such an expensive package. “I’m having a really hard time with this. Because they’re saying, ‘Well it’s hard to travel, yadda yadda yadda,’ ” Mr. Massie said. “Well, [Wednesday] night, 96 out of 100 senators voted. All we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote. I know there are people saying, ‘Oh, you gotta vote for it. You can’t slow this down.’ Meanwhile, they spent a week in the Senate arguing how much money should go to the Kennedy Center.” The Kennedy Center would receive $25 million under the bill, an expense that President Trump said he supports. “So many are trying to get their pork in this bill!” Mr. Massie tweeted this week.His threat to derail the voice vote was infuriating some colleagues. “Dear @RepThomasMassie: If you intend to delay passage of the #coronavirus relief bill [Friday] morning, please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend ~$200,000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt,” tweeted Rep. Dean Phillips, Minnesota Democrat.  ",Lawmakers racing back to D.C. to vote on $2.2T coronavirus rescue plan after lone Republican objects," -

"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden on Thursday said President Trump doesn’t have the power to postpone the November election amid health concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. “No, he doesn’t have the authority to do that,” Mr. Biden said on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” “Now, it’s possible [he] may start a drumbeat saying it should be postponed.” Mr. Biden pointed out that elections were held during events such as the Civil War. “I think you’re going to see more of what Amy Klobuchar has been proposing, and that is being able to vote early in your areas and by mail,” he said. Asked if Ms. Klobuchar, a former 2020 Democratic presidential rival and senator from Minnesota, is on his short list for a running mate, Mr. Biden said: “She is fully qualified to be a president.” Democrats have slammed Mr. Trump for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, but he has enjoyed some of the best approval ratings of his presidency recently, and polling has shown majorities approving of the president’s response to COVID-19, the disease cause by the new coronavirus. Earlier this month, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine invoked a health emergency to postpone in-person voting in his state’s presidential primary. A number of other states have also moved to postpone their primaries, effectively freezing the 2020 Democratic presidential race in place for the time being. Mr. Biden has built an almost insurmountable lead in delegates over Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, his lone remaining major Democratic rival. Legal experts agree that Mr. Trump can’t unilaterally cancel the election, but they say he could try to use some of his discretion to set rules on where people are able to vote. “People are already talking about Trump canceling the election in November, which is something that he can’t do,” said Rick Hasen, a law professor at University of California Irvine. “Although I am concerned that he could issue orders that would close polling places.” Mr. Hasen said potential solutions include expanding the availability of no-excuse absentee and vote-by-mail options, which some states are already instituting.

"U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Friday said “hot spots” for the expanding coronavirus outbreak such as Detroit, Chicago and New Orleans are going to have a worse week next week compared to where they were this week.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The House kicked off debate on a $2.2 trillion package to ease the coronavirus pandemic’s devastating toll on the U.S. economy and health care system on Friday, even as a maverick conservative threatened to delay passage until most lawmakers return to Washington for a vote. That left many angry lawmakers scrambling to return to the nation’s capital amid a pandemic in which Americans have been urged to self-quarantine or keep their distance from one another. As the House gaveled into session Friday morning, there was no doubt that, one way or the other, the chamber would eventually give final congressional approval to the largest economic relief package in U.S. history.  “While no one will agree with every part of this rescue bill, we face a challenge rarely seen in America’s history.

Took a House Bill (HR 748) dealing with taxes, stripped every word, and put their bill in it. The House is just as responsible for killing the origination clause as the Senate.  It’s the House’s job to reject the process,” Mr. Massie tweeted. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, also has threatened to force a roll-call vote, citing her concerns that the legislation favors corporations. “With the health risks of travel, there is no easy choice here,” she told CNN on Wednesday. “But essential workers are showing up and putting their health at risk every day, and if the final text of a bill is set up to hurt them, it may be something we have to do.” Rep. Kevin Brady, Texas Republican, tweeted at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez sarcastically, “Yes, @AOC, do it. Go ahead - delay a House vote. Block help for the worker at a closed plant. The single mom laid off. The server w/no hours. The teetering local business. The family w/CV-19. Reveal to America YOUR socialism: cruel gov’t control that cares only for itself.” President Trump on Thursday said he expected the House to swiftly pass the measure so he can sign it immediately, but he acknowledged that one lawmaker could delay it. “There could be one grandstander maybe,” Mr. Trump said. “You might have one grandstander. And for that, we will have to come back and take a little more time. But it will pass. It’ll just take a little longer. But let’s see whether or not we have a grandstander.” The president slammed Mr. Massie in a tweet Friday morning, saying the Kentucky congressman was inadvertently aiding the Democrats. “He is a disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!” Mr. Trump tweeted. In a radio interview on Thursday, Mr. Massie said he plans to vote against the package, which includes direct payments of $1,200 to most taxpayers, $500 billion in loans for distressed corporations and $367 billion in job-retention loans for small businesses. “If it were just about helping people to get more unemployment [benefits] to get through this calamity that, frankly, the governors have wrought on the people, then I could be for it,” Mr. Massie said on KRC radio in Kentucky.  “But this is $2 trillion. Divide $2 trillion by 350 million people — it’s almost $6,000 for every man, woman and child. I’m talking about spending. This won’t go to the men, women and children. So if you have a family of five, this spending bill represents $30,000 of additional U.S. national debt because there is no plan to pay for it.” Mr. Massie, who voted in favor of the first $8.3 billion coronavirus aid measure, said the House shouldn’t hold an informal voice vote on such an expensive package. “I’m having a really hard time with this. Because they’re saying, ‘Well it’s hard to travel, yadda yadda yadda,’ ” Mr. Massie said. “Well, [Wednesday] night, 96 out of 100 senators voted. All we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote. I know there are people saying, ‘Oh, you gotta vote for it. You can’t slow this down.’ Meanwhile, they spent a week in the Senate arguing how much money should go to the Kennedy Center.” The Kennedy Center would receive $25 million under the bill, an expense that President Trump said he supports. “So many are trying to get their pork in this bill!” Mr. Massie tweeted this week.His threat to derail the voice vote was infuriating some colleagues. “Dear @RepThomasMassie: If you intend to delay passage of the #coronavirus relief bill [Friday] morning, please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend ~$200,000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt,” tweeted Rep. Dean Phillips, Minnesota Democrat. • Gabriella Muñoz contributed to this report.  ",Lawmakers racing back to D.C. to vote on $2.2T coronavirus rescue plan after lone Republican objects," -

"BOSTON (AP) - Civil rights groups have filed a class action lawsuit calling for the release of all immigration detainees at a Massachusetts jail. Lawyers for Civil Rights and other organizations argue in their federal suit filed late Thursday that detainees at the Bristol County House of Corrections in Dartmouth are living in “cruel and inhumane conditions” that put them at risk of an outbreak of the new coronavirus. They say the detainees are not being provided sanitizer or disinfectant and only limited amounts of soap. The groups also say corrections officers have reported to work with virus-like symptoms and new detainees are being brought into the facility without being tested or screened.  Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson denied the allegations and dismissed the suit as “absurd and completely frivolous.” He also said his office has no legal authority to release immigration detainees, who are held in custody on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE said it continues “to maintain confidence” in the jail but declined to comment on the specifics of the suit. __ TAX DEADLINE Massachusetts has postponed its state income tax filing deadline to July 15.

"WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) - A Texas man faces federal charges after he made online posts threatening Democrats, including U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, authorities said. Gavin Weslee Blake Perry, 27, of Wichita Falls, was charged Wednesday with transmitting a threatening communication in interstate commerce. According to federal prosecutors, Perry wrote on Facebook that Democrats, including Pelosi, “will be removed at any cost necessary and yes that means by death.” Perry remained jailed Friday and court records do not list an attorney who could speak on his behalf. Federal prosecutors said Perry admitted making the Facebook posts and that he told law enforcement he did so because he wanted to warn Americans to beware of the government.

"America’s coronavirus infections have  surged to the most in the world.  Italy shut down its industry. Masses of unemployed Indian laborers got food handouts and South Africa began a three-week lockdown. The U.S. cities of Chicago and Detroit saw concerning increases in infections. Here are some of AP’s top stories Friday on the world’s coronavirus pandemic. Follow APNews.com/VirusOutbreak for updates through the day and APNews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak for stories explaining some of its complexities. WHAT’S HAPPENING TODAY: - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for the new coronavirus,  but remains in charge of the U.K.’s response to the outbreak. Johnson, 55, said Friday that he was tested for COVID-19 on the advice of the chief medical officer after showing “mild symptoms” involving a temperature and a persistent cough. - Some leaders are hailing a potential breakthrough: Simple pin-prick blood tests or nasal swabs that can determine within minutes if someone has, or previously had, the virus. But scientists have challenged their accuracy. - For the millions of Americans living under some form of lockdown, i t’s the not knowing when the restrictions will end which is also causing sharp anxiety.  Will important life events be delayed for a few weeks, a few months or much longer? - Advocates and prison guards are calling for reforms to head off a potential outbreak in the federal prison system, which has been plagued for years by violence, misconduct and staffing shortages. ___ WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover. Here are the symptoms of  the virus compared with the common flu.  One of the best ways to prevent spread of the virus is washing your hands with soap and water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends first washing with warm or cold water and then lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under fingernails before rinsing off. You should wash your phone, too. Here’s how.  Misinformation overload: How to separate fact from fiction and rumor from deliberate efforts to mislead.

In the latest episode of “Ground Game: Inside the Outbreak,” AP Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace and host Ralph Russo discuss what this all means. ___ IN OTHER NEWS:                 BEAT GOES ON: Locked down due to the coronavirus pandemic, the nightclubs in the German capital have decided to keep the beat going - at least online. Berlin’s nightclubs were closed March 13 to help slow the spread of the virus. In response, some formed a streaming platform to let DJs, musicians and artists keep performing.                 NOT A PEEP:  No more Peeps are being hatched for at least a couple of weeks - but it shouldn’t affect Easter baskets. The Just Born confections company in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, says its production facilities there and in Philadelphia have closed through April 7.

"U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Friday said “hot spots” for the expanding coronavirus outbreak such as Detroit, Chicago and New Orleans are going to have a worse week next week compared to where they were this week. Dr. Adams said they’re hopeful that numbers in New York, the hardest-hit state, will start to slow next week. “We also see hot spots like Detroit, like Chicago, like New Orleans that will have a worse week next week than what they had this week,” he said on “CBS This Morning.” In a separate interview, Dr. Adams said some areas in the country are going to need “a lot more” than the 15-day period that’s coming to a close soon during which the federal government advised the public to avoid crowds and stay at home if possible. “I think in some places definitely we’re going to need a lot more,” Dr. Adams said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “Some places haven’t hit their peak yet, and what we’re looking to do in the next week or two is really give people the testing data that they need to make informed choices.” President Trump announced the 15-day timeline on March 16 as a way to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus amid the expanding pandemic. He said this week that it would be great if the U.S. could open back up by Easter, or April 12. “Some places, it doesn’t matter if it’s Easter or if it’s Memorial Day, or if it’s Labor Day — we know that we want people to be thinking about what they can do now so that we can quickly get through this with as few deaths and as few hospitalizations as possible,” Dr. Adams said on ABC. Mr. Trump on Thursday said in a letter to the nation’s governors that the administration is working on new guidelines for state and local officials to use in making decisions about potentially relaxing some of the restrictions that have been put into place. The president said new testing capabilities will help classify counties, and that they plan to suggest guidelines labeling counties as low-risk, medium-risk or high-risk. Dr. Adams was asked on ABC how those classifications would work practically in terms of slowing the spread without more consistency across the country. “The way it works is through cooperation,”  he said. “We want to make sure people are talking to each other so that if they’re in a high-risk area, they’re taking appropriate precautions,” Dr. Adams said. “If they are in a lower-risk area, it doesn’t mean that you stop social distancing, it doesn’t mean that you stop washing your hands, it doesn’t mean you stop doing the things that we’re telling everyone to do.” “But it means you may not have to be on total lockdown the way that we see New York City and places in California are,” he said. The U.S. now has the most positive coronavirus cases in the world with more than 86,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. There have been more than 1,300 coronavirus-related deaths. New York has been the hardest-hit individual state, with more than 37,200 positive cases and at least 385 deaths as of Thursday. But as Dr. Adams said, new hot spots have been developing in various places around the country, including in Louisiana. Gov. John Bel Edwards on Thursday said the New Orleans area could run out of ventilators by early April if the rate of new cases does not slow.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The House kicked off debate Friday on a $2.2 trillion package to ease the coronavirus pandemic’s devastating toll on the U.S. economy and health care system, even as a maverick conservative threatened to delay passage until most lawmakers return to Washington for a vote. That left many angry lawmakers scrambling to return to the nation’s capital during a pandemic in which Americans have been urged to self-quarantine or keep their distance from one another. President Donald Trump vented his anger as well, on Twitter. Shortly after the House opened, Trump called Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who had threatened to try to force a roll call vote, “a third rate Grandstander” who “just wants publicly.”  But there was little doubt that, one way or the other, the chamber would eventually give final congressional approval to the largest economic relief package in U.S. history.  “While no one will agree with every part of this rescue bill, we face a challenge rarely seen in America’s history. We must act now, or the toll on lives and livelihoods will be far greater,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas. Massie, who’s opposed to the massive bill, set the House on edge by threatening to try to force a roll call vote. Party leaders had hoped to pass the measure by voice vote without lawmakers having to take the risk of traveling to Washington. Massie used Twitter to suggest he’d require a quorum of lawmakers - some 216 - to be present and voting. Massie didn’t respond to a reporter’s requests for comment. Numerous high-ranking Republicans have called Massie in an attempt to persuade him to let the voice vote proceed, according to a top House GOP aide. They included House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., whom Trump has chosen as his new chief of staff.  If those efforts fail and a roll call is needed, Republicans believe they will have more than 100 of their members back at the Capitol, according to the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.  Democratic leaders urged lawmakers who are “willing and able” to come to the Capitol to do so. Massie’s move infuriated lawmakers, forcing many to trek to Washington for a vote they’re not even sure will occur. If a quorum can’t assemble Friday, more members would have to travel for a Saturday session.  “Heading to Washington to vote on pandemic legislation. Because of one Member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House,” Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., wrote on Twitter. “Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed. Disgraceful. Irresponsible.” South Dakota GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson posted a selfie photograph of himself and three other lawmakers from the upper Midwest traveling to Washington on an otherwise empty plane. Friday’s House session comes after an extraordinary 96-0 Senate vote late Wednesday. Trump marveled at the unanimity Thursday and is eager to sign the package into law. The relief can hardly come soon enough. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday the economy “may well be in recession” already, and the government reported a shocking 3.3 million burst of weekly jobless claims, more than four times the previous record. The U.S. death toll from the virus rose to 1,300. House leaders in both parties had hoped to pass the measure with a sparsely attended voice vote - remarkable for a bill of such magnitude - so scattered lawmakers didn’t have to risk exposure by traveling back to Washington. Originally scheduled as a non-working “pro forma” meeting, the session was extended to a three-hour debate on the bill - all conducted under social distancing rules to minimize the risk of transmitting the virus. “If that’s the method used to get this to the American people, to get this passed, then I think lots of members are probably OK with that,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Thursday as he drove back to Washington. “I know the plan is for it to be a voice vote, and that’s what the leadership has said they’re for, and I think that’s fine.” It is unlikely to be the end of the federal response. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said issues like more generous food stamp payments, aid to state and local governments and family leave may be revisited in subsequent legislation. “There’s so many things we didn’t get in … that we need to,” Pelosi told reporters Thursday. The legislation will give $1,200 direct payments to individuals and a make way for a flood of subsidized loans, grants and tax breaks to businesses facing extinction in an economic shutdown caused as Americans self-isolate by the tens of millions. It dwarfs prior Washington efforts to take on economic crises and natural disasters, such as the 2008 Wall Street bailout and President Barack Obama’s first-year economic recovery act. But key elements are untested, such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses. Millions of rebate payments will go to people who have retained their jobs. Policymakers worry that bureaucracies like the Small Business Administration may become overwhelmed, and conservatives fear that a new, generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning to the workforce. A new $500 billion subsidized lending program for larger businesses is unproven as well. The bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House’s best guess of the spending it contains. The legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis. The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department’s discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible. There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads. Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit that’s estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers’ paycheck up to $10,000. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A huge tax break for interest costs and operating losses limited by the 2017 tax overhaul was restored at a $200 billion cost in a boon for the real estate sector. An additional $45 billion would fund additional relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for local response efforts and community services.  Most people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.  ___ Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.

"The House passed the bipartisan $2 trillion emergency economic stimulus package Friday afternoon, paving the way for an influx of funds to the overly stressed healthcare system and assistance for those hit by the tumbling economy. “I thank all members on both sides of the aisle for the seriousness with which we have all taken this important challenge,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. After a bit of procedural maneuvering, the package passed on a voice vote. Rep. Thomas Massie, who wanted to force a recorded vote on the package, accused Congressional leadership of orchestrating a “fix.” “It’s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY,” he tweeted. “Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote?” The bill will give $500 billion in direct payments to the American public, bolster unemployment insurance with a surge of $250 billion, provide $500 billion in loans to big businesses, and creates a $350 billion loan program for small businesses. It also funnels $130 billion into the stretched-thin healthcare system to get more resources and equipment to those directly fighting the disease. The package passed one day after jobless claimed skyrocketed to a record 3.28 million in the past week, as businesses cut back as they shutter for public health concerns. “We have never experienced that before in our lives, not even in the great depression,” Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican said. “The CARES Act is our modern-day all American Marshall plan.” While the Senate passed the package with unanimous support, some Republican members opposed the bill because of their concern about the hefty pricetag and how the funds are being appropriated. “This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing,” Mr. Massie said in a tweet. President Trump said Thursday that he would sign the bill into law as soon as possible after it cleared the House.

"Calls on Capitol Hill are mounting for the State Department to investigate China’s alleged efforts to cover up the initial spread of the coronavirus outbreak that has swept the world, killing thousands in its wake. In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday, Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is urging the department to consider launching a multilateral investigation with other democratic countries to look into any moves to cover up the coronavirus spread, which began in the Wuhan province in China last November. “By causing a local outbreak to become a pandemic, their system, which is designed to censor anything that could be a threat to the regime, is putting millions of American lives at risk,” the Texas Republican wrote. The U.S. has the most confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker as of Friday, with more than 1,300 deaths from the virus. Mr. McCaul claims China has launched a disinformation campaign about the virus “in an attempt to transfer blame to the United States and that is exacerbating this dire situation. “The State Department has demonstrated considerable flexibility and ingenuity in refuting CCP’s various lies, and I urge you and your team to continue these efforts and to coordinate with willing allies,” he continued. Earlier this week, Mr. Pompeo criticized “the disinformation campaign that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in to try to deflect from what has really taken place here.” The ranking member was not alone Friday in his claims that China has moved to cover up the virus’ severity. A pair of Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unveiled legislation that would call on China to publicly state there is no evidence that COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, originated anywhere else but China, and condemns the government’s censorship of doctors and journalists during the early days of the outbreak. “Chinese officials destroyed early COVID-19 test kits, suppressed information and refused international assistance,” Sen. Marcia Blackburn, Tennessee Republican said. “The Communist Party is so petrified of the truth that they kicked out journalists and fabricated a story of where the virus originated.” “The Chinese Communist Party wasted precious weeks on a cynical coverup instead of containing the China virus at its epicenter,” Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, added. “Our first priority after protecting Americans must be holding China accountable for unleashing this plague on the world.” President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier Friday pledged in a phone call to cooperate in the battle against the coronavirus, a sign of easing tensions between the two nations. “Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!” Mr. Trump has refrained in recent days using the phrase “Chinese virus” to describe the outbreak that originated in Wuhan. He told Fox News he would stop using the term but didn’t regret it, noting that China blamed U.S. soldiers for starting the pandemic.

"President Trump said Friday the federal government bought ventilators from “some wonderful companies” even as he threatened to wield war-production powers against General Motors, saying he’s unhappy with automaker’s efforts and demands amid the coronavirus crisis. Mr. Trump will announce the companies and the number of ventilators later Friday. The machines, which help people breathe, are vital to the coronavirus response since the virus causes respiratory distress. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other governors have pleaded with Mr. Trump to find and ship more ventilators to their hospitals, saying it’s too difficult for them to find them on the open market. The president on Friday blamed GM for some of the hiccups. GM previously agreed to produce ventilators with Ventec Life Systems, Inc., as automakers refocus their production capability toward the crisis. The New York Times reported the administration pulled back from purchasing tens of thousands of the machines after the price tag came in at $1 billion. The paper said the deal might still happen but the Federal Emergency Management Agency wanted to shop around. Mr. Trump said he might force GM to make the machines through the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law that allows the president to compel production from private industries. The president says GM scaled back the terms of the agreement. “They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, ‘very quickly,’” Mr. Trump tweeted. “Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke ‘P.’” Mr. Trump, who was referring to GM CEO Mary T. Barra, later explained that “P” meant the production act. The Washington Times has sought comment from GM about the status of the deal. Mr. Trump, in his series of tweets, said GM “MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!” GM no longer owns the Lordstown plant. It sold the plant to Workhorse, which makes electric trucks. Mr. Trump trumpeted the sale on Twitter at the time. Also Friday, Mr. Trump said he delivered thousands of ventilators to New York, only for the state to place them in storage. Melissa DeRosa, a top Cuomo aide, said the ventilators arrived Wednesday and are being deployed to hospitals as they need them. “We don’t know which hospitals will have the need yet — this is evolving in real time,” she tweeted. She said the federal government gave New York 2,000 ventilators, but they need 30,000. “We have to be smart about what we have & be able to move on a dime,” she wrote. “Lives are at stake.”  ","Trump slams GM, says it wanted ‘top dollar’ for ventilators","Friday, March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/trump-slams-gm-says-it-wanted-top-dollar-ventilato/,washington_times
"The leaders of the House Armed Services Committee announced Friday they have formally begun the process of creating the annual defense policy bill and have introduced a “by request” version of the legislation. Panel Chairman Rep. Adam Smith, Washington Democrat, and ranking member Mac Thornberry, Texas Republican, have repeatedly insisted the crafting process of the massive National Defense Authorization Act would not be sidelined despite having most of Congress’ focus on the spread of the coronavirus outbreak across the country. “As the nation grapples with the COVID-19 crisis, the Committee continues to adhere to the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Sergeant at Arms, and the House Attending Physician,” Mr. Smith and Mr. Thornberry said in a statement. The procedural move — which outlines requests from the Pentagon and will later be replaced with formal language — marks the starting point for the committee to formulate the must-pass legislation that effectively dictates the administration’s defense policy for the upcoming year. The panel is expected to consider the bill next month with a full House vote in May. But increased attention on coronavirus-related legislation, paired with heightened precautions that are being taken on Capitol Hill to prevent the spread among lawmakers, could force a delay. “During this time of uncertainty, the Committee remains focused on completing the FY21 NDAA and performing rigorous oversight through formal communications and teleconferences,” the members said, “which can and will be accomplished while protecting the health of our members and staff.”  ","Smith, Thornberry launch defense policy bill process amid coronavirus pandemic","Friday, March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/adam-smith-mac-thornberry-launch-defense-policy-bi/,washington_times

Mr. Kerry said there is the silver lining, however: “Finally, something the president and I can agree on!” Mr. Trump, who’s heavily criticized Mr. Kerry and his work on Iran, ripped Mr. Massie as a “third rate Grandstander” earlier in the day and said he should be thrown out of the GOP. The president is leaning on Congress to quickly stop the economic bleeding from the coronavirus. “Never knew John Kerry had such a good sense of humor! Very impressed!” Mr. Trump tweeted. Mr. Massie says he has well-founded concerns about the bill and the Senate process for approving it. “The Senate did some voodoo just like with Obamacare. Took a House Bill (HR 748) dealing with taxes, stripped every word, and put their bill in it. The House is just as responsible for killing the origination clause as the Senate.  It’s the House’s job to reject the process,” Mr. Massie tweeted. Fellow conservatives rallied to his defense, with one telling Mr. Trump to “back off.” “He is defending the Constitution today by requiring a quorum.  There’s nothing 3rd rate about that, [Mr. Trump],” Rep. Chip Roy, Texas Republican, tweeted. “I may miss vote if he forces roll call (flights) but it will pass. Back off.” Rep. Paul Gosar, Arizona Republican, tweeted he doesn’t always agree with Mr. Massie on policy or strategy but that he “doesn’t warrant this dressing down” from the president. • Gabriella Muñoz contributed to this report.

"Vice President Mike Pence on Friday said President Trump’s Easter target date for reopening parts of the U.S. amid the coronavirus outbreak was an “aspirational goal” and that they want to get people back to work as soon as they “responsibly” can. “The president expressed, really, an aspirational goal,” Mr. Pence said on CNBC. “The president said he would love to see it around Easter.” He said whenever the day does come to move forward, they would try to “responsibly” start to reopen parts of the country. “But let me be very clear: there’s going to be areas of the country where we continue to lean in to mitigation efforts,” he said. He described the greater New York City area, New Jersey, New Orleans, Detroit, Seattle, and California as problem areas. “But there are areas of the country, as Dr. Deborah Birx said yesterday … where there’s frankly very little outbreak of coronavirus,” he said. He cited Mr. Trump’s letter to governors on Thursday saying the administration would take a look at county-level data to identify various levels of risk in different regions of the country. “In the days ahead, we’re going to be giving guidance specifically to different regions of the country about how, as the president says, we might be able to open up the country and get people back to work just as soon as we responsibly can,” he said. Mr. Trump on March 16 announced a 15-day period during which people have been advised to avoid crowds and stay at home if possible. That period is nearing an end. The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted lives for millions of Americans as governors and local leaders have imposed their own stay-at-home orders and business closings. There are now more than 86,000 coronavirus cases in the U.S. — the most of any country in the world - and more than 1,300 coronavirus-related deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker. The Labor Department on Thursday reported that there were more than 3.2 million initial jobless claims for the week ending March 21, shattering records.

"House lawmakers from across the country were scrambling to get back to Washington Friday morning in time for a possible roll-call vote on a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package after a Republican lawmaker threatened to block leaders’ plans to hold an informal voice vote. House leadership began advising lawmakers on Thursday night to return to Washington from their districts if possible because they anticipate that Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky could call for a roll-call vote on the package that was approved by the Senate earlier this week. Leaders in both parties were pushing for a voice vote, which does not require most members to be present, to minimize the health risk for lawmakers who would need to travel long distances to vote in person. It would take only one lawmaker to object to a voice vote. Mr. Massie on Thursday tweeted his concerns about the bill and the Senate process for approving it. “The senate did some voodoo just like with Obamacare. Took a House Bill (HR 748) dealing with taxes, stripped every word, and put their bill in it. The House is just as responsible for killing the origination clause as the Senate.  It’s the House’s job to reject the process,” Mr. Massie tweeted. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, also has threatened to force a roll-call vote, citing her concerns that the legislation favors corporations. “With the health risks of travel, there is no easy choice here,” she told CNN on Wednesday. “But essential workers are showing up and putting their health at risk every day, and if the final text of a bill is set up to hurt them, it may be something we have to do.” Rep. Kevin Brady, Texas Republican, tweeted at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez sarcastically, “Yes, @AOC, do it. Go ahead - delay a House vote. Block help for the worker at a closed plant. The single mom laid off. The server w/no hours. The teetering local business. The family w/CV-19. Reveal to America YOUR socialism: cruel gov’t control that cares only for itself.” President Trump on Thursday said he expected the House to swiftly pass the measure so he can sign it immediately, but he acknowledged that one lawmaker could delay it. “There could be one grandstander maybe,” Mr. Trump said. “You might have one grandstander. And for that, we will have to come back and take a little more time. But it will pass. It’ll just take a little longer. But let’s see whether or not we have a grandstander.” The president slammed Mr. Massie in a tweet Friday morning, saying the Kentucky congressman was inadvertently aiding the Democrats. “He is a disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!” Mr. Trump tweeted. In a radio interview on Thursday, Mr. Massie said he plans to vote against the package, which includes direct payments of $1,200 to most taxpayers, $500 billion in loans for distressed corporations and $367 billion in job-retention loans for small businesses. “If it were just about helping people to get more unemployment [benefits] to get through this calamity that, frankly, the governors have wrought on the people, then I could be for it,” Mr. Massie said on KRC radio in Kentucky.  “But this is $2 trillion. Divide $2 trillion by 350 million people — it’s almost $6,000 for every man, woman and child. I’m talking about spending. This won’t go to the men, women and children. So if you have a family of five, this spending bill represents $30,000 of additional U.S. national debt because there is no plan to pay for it.” Mr. Massie, who voted in favor of the first $8.3 billion coronavirus aid measure, said the House shouldn’t hold an informal voice vote on such an expensive package. “I’m having a really hard time with this. Because they’re saying, ‘Well it’s hard to travel, yadda yadda yadda,’ ” Mr. Massie said. “Well, [Wednesday] night, 96 out of 100 senators voted. All we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote. I know there are people saying, ‘Oh, you gotta vote for it. You can’t slow this down.’ Meanwhile, they spent a week in the Senate arguing how much money should go to the Kennedy Center.” The Kennedy Center would receive $25 million under the bill, an expense that President Trump said he supports. “So many are trying to get their pork in this bill!” Mr. Massie tweeted this week.His threat to derail the voice vote was infuriating some colleagues. “Dear @RepThomasMassie: If you intend to delay passage of the #coronavirus relief bill [Friday] morning, please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend ~$200,000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt,” tweeted Rep. Dean Phillips, Minnesota Democrat. • Gabriella Muñoz contributed to this report.

"A top aide to D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has died from the coronavirus, she announced Friday. George Valentine, the deputy director of the Mayor’s Office of Legal Counsel, died Friday morning of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, after being admitted to the hospital Wednesday, Ms. Bowser said. “It’s devastating for everybody, of course we are very sorry,” Ms. Bowser said, noting that Mr. Valentine had worked for D.C. government for two decades. She said city officials are tracing his movements and contacts. Ms. Bowser said she doesn’t believe she had contact with him. The D.C. Department of Health announced 36 new cases of COVID-19 Thursday night, and now has a total of 267 cases and four deaths. “The only reason we should be leaving our home is to buy groceries, pick up medicine, exercise alone or with your own family, or if you have been advised to seek medical attention or if you are performing an essential job,” Ms. Bowser said. Meanwhile, the D.C. Board of Elections encouraged residents to vote by mail for the city’s June 2 primary and Ward 2 special election. Michael Bennett, chairman of the D.C. Board of Elections, said Thursday he wanted to make sure that all voters, Board of Elections staff and poll workers are safe and that all votes will be counted for the primary and the June 16 Ward 2 special election. The elections board asked that residents request their vote-by-mail ballot online, on the voting application, by mailing or calling the board directly. Once the ballot is completed, Mr. Bennett said voters can mail it back in a prepaid envelope or drop it off at a voter center. Mr. Bennett said 20 voter centers will be open across the city, at least two in each ward. For the June 2 primary election, voters will be able to vote in person from May 22 until June 2. For the special election, polls will be open June 12 through June 16. Mr. Bennett asked that voters voluntarily stagger when they vote. A schedule with recommended voting times by alphabetical order will be released soon.

"Rep. Thomas Massie, Kentucky Republican, will demand the House take a recorded vote on the $2 trillion coronavirus economic emergency stimulus package. However, the House will have enough members to reach a quorum, a leadership aide told The Washington Times, so a final vote on the package can still proceed Friday. Mr. Massie accused Congressional leadership of orchestrating a “fix.” It’s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY.Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote? #SWAMP House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dragged out her remarks on the House floor ahead of the vote to ensure enough members were present, while still social distancing, to block Mr. Massie’s request. Members scrambled to make it to Capitol Hill Friday morning after Mr. Massie hinted Thursday that he would oppose a voice vote on the package. “The Constitution requires that a quorum of members be present to conduct business in the House. Right now, millions of essential, working-class Americans are still required to go to work during this pandemic…Is it too much to ask that the House do its job, just like the Senate did?” he tweeted. The House needs a majority of its members present — at least 216 — in order to vote if a member forces the quorum issue. Mr. Massie has faced a wave of backlash from his colleagues on the Hill and President Trump who argue the move risks spreading the virus amongst members in the chamber and during their travel.

"BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Visitors to Idaho 18 and over who can legally possess firearms will be allowed to carry a concealed handgun without a permit or training within city limits under legislation signed into law by Gov. Brad Little. The Republican governor signed the bill Wednesday, according to information on his website. Idaho residents 18 and older are allowed to carry a concealed handgun within city limits in Idaho without a permit or training following a law that went into place last summer. The legislation signed by Little extends that to legal residents of the United States and U.S. armed services members. Backers say the measure clears up confusion when people travel from rural areas to a city with a concealed firearm. Concealed carry is allowed in rural areas. Opponents say allowing teenagers to carry a concealed weapon without any required training within city limits is a bad idea and could lead to shootings.

"BOSTON (AP) - All visitors arriving in Massachusetts are being asked to self-quarantine for 14 days as the state tightens its efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Charlie Baker said Friday. The Republican governor said travelers coming into Massachusetts through the state’s airports and by train will be given flyers instructing them about the quarantine. Instructions will also be placed at highway rest stops and on electronic highway message boards. Baker said there is no enforcement mechanism at this point. More on developments in Massachusetts:  ___ TAX DEADLINE Massachusetts is postponing its state income tax filing deadline to July 15.  Gov. Baker and Democratic leaders in the Massachusetts House and Senate announced the agreement Friday.  Baker said the extension would be automatic and taxpayers would not need to file any additional forms to qualify. He said the extension would provide flexibility to taxpayer while protecting the state’s strong fiscal footing. The extension corresponds with the Internal Revenue Service’s recent decision to push back the April 15 federal tax deadline. ___ ICE DETAINEES LAWSUIT Civil rights groups have filed a class action lawsuit calling for the release of all immigration detainees at a Massachusetts jail. Lawyers for Civil Rights and other organizations argue in their federal suit filed late Thursday that detainees at the Bristol County House of Corrections in Dartmouth are living in “cruel and inhumane conditions” that put them at risk of an outbreak of the new coronavirus. They said the detainees are not being provided sanitizer or disinfectant and only limited amounts of soap. The groups also said corrections officers have reported to work with virus-like symptoms, and new detainees are being brought into the facility without being tested or screened. Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson denied the allegations and dismissed the suit as “absurd and completely frivolous.” He also said his office has no legal authority to release immigration detainees, who are held in custody on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. John Mohan, a spokesman for ICE’s Boston office, said ICE continues “to maintain confidence” in the jail but declined to comment on the specifics of the suit. ___ DEBT COLLECTION REGULATION Attorney General Maura Healey announced Friday that her office has filed an emergency regulation she said will help protect consumers from unfair and deceptive debt collection practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The regulation takes effect immediately and bars creditors from engaging in debt collection methods that require people to leave their homes and have in-person contact, including filing new lawsuits against consumers, visiting their homes or places of work, or repossessing their cars, Healey said the emergency regulation will remain in effect for 90 days or until the end of the declared state of emergency. .

"The U.S. House on Friday approved a $2.2 trillion rescue packag e, rushing it to President Donald Trump for his signature. The measure tosses a life preserver to a U.S. economy and health care system left flailing by the coronavirus pandemic.  America’s coronavirus infections have  surged to the most in the world.  Italy shut down its industry. Masses of unemployed Indian laborers got food handouts and South Africa began a three-week lockdown. The U.S. cities of Chicago and Detroit saw concerning increases in infections. Here are some of AP’s top stories Friday on the world’s coronavirus pandemic. Follow APNews.com/VirusOutbreak for updates through the day and APNews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak for stories explaining some of its complexities. WHAT’S HAPPENING TODAY: - For the millions of Americans living under some form of lockdown, it’s the not knowing when the restrictions will end which is also causing sharp anxiety. Will important life events be delayed for a few weeks, a few months or much longer? - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for the new coronavirus,  but remains in charge of the U.K.’s response to the outbreak. Johnson, 55, said Friday that he was tested for COVID-19 on the advice of the chief medical officer after showing “mild symptoms” involving a temperature and a persistent cough. - Some leaders are hailing a potential breakthrough: Simple pin-prick blood tests or nasal swabs that can determine within minutes if someone has, or previously had, the virus. But scientists have challenged their accuracy. - Los Angeles recorded its first case of coronavirus five weeks before New York City, yet New York is now the U.S. epicenter of the disease. Public health officials are keeping a wary eye and warning that LA could end up being as hard hit as New York in coming weeks, in part because a planned increase in testing may uncover a dramatic surge in cases.  - Are gun shops ‘essential’ businesses during a pandemic? Americans in areas of stay-at-home directives are mixed on whether gun shops are an essential business and should remain open. That’s led some gun rights advocates to worry about an erosion of Second Amendment rights. Americans are buying firearms in record numbers. ___ WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover. Here are the symptoms of  the virus compared with the common flu.  One of the best ways to prevent spread of the virus is washing your hands with soap and water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends first washing with warm or cold water and then lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under fingernails before rinsing off. You should wash your phone, too. Here’s how.  Misinformation overload: How to separate fact from fiction and rumor from deliberate efforts to mislead.                 TRACKING THE VIRUS:  Drill down and zoom in at the individual county level, and you can access numbers that will show you the situation where you are, and where loved ones or people you’re worried about live. ___ INSIDE THE OUTBREAK PODCAST: The Senate approved a massive $2.2 trillion rescue package to help revive the American economy. In the latest episode of “Ground Game: Inside the Outbreak,” AP Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace and host Ralph Russo discuss what this all means. ___ IN OTHER NEWS:                 BEAT GOES ON: Locked down due to the coronavirus pandemic, the nightclubs in the German capital have decided to keep the beat going - at least online. Berlin’s nightclubs were closed March 13 to help slow the spread of the virus. In response, some formed a streaming platform to let DJs, musicians and artists keep performing.                 NOT A PEEP:  No more Peeps are being hatched for at least a couple of weeks - but it shouldn’t affect Easter baskets.

But the company says it had already produced and shipped the Easter supply of its signature marshmallow confection to outlets. ___ Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  ",What you need to know today about the virus outbreak,"Friday, March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/what-you-need-to-know-today-about-the-virus-outbre/,washington_times
"WASHINGTON (AP) - Acting with exceptional resolve in an extraordinary time, the House rushed President Donald Trump a $2.2 trillion rescue package Friday, tossing a life preserver to a U.S. economy and health care system left flailing by the coronavirus pandemic.  The House approved the sweeping measure by a voice vote, as strong majorities of both parties lined up behind the most colossal economic relief bill in the nation’s history. It will ship payments of up to $1,200 to millions of Americans, bolster unemployment benefits, offer loans, grants and tax breaks to businesses large and small and flush billions more to states, local governments and the nation’s all but overwhelmed health care system.  “Today we’ve all acknowledged our nation faces an economic and health emergency of historic proportions,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  President Donald Trump said he would sign the bill immediately. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story is below.  With exceptional resolve in an extraordinary time, the House on Friday debated a $2.2 trillion package tossing a life preserver to a U.S. economy and health care system left flailing by the coronavirus pandemic, even as one maverick Republican threatened leaders’ plans for swift passage.  Democratic and Republican leaders were working in tandem and hoping to quickly pass the measure by voice vote to accommodate members scattered around the country and reluctant to risk flying back to the Capitol. There were hand sanitizers at the end of each aisle in the chamber, where most lawmakers sat scattered apart from one another.  There was no doubt the House would give overwhelming final congressional approval to the largest economic bailout legislation in U.S. history. For the most part, Democrats who saw a taxpayer giveaway to big business and Republicans who considered it ladened with waste were set to back the measure for the greater good of keeping the economy alive.  But libertarian Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., was threatening to slow action by demanding a roll call vote. That would force many lawmakers to make the journey to Washington to cast a vote on legislation that is certain to pass anyway, and it infuriated President Donald Trump and lawmakers from both parties.  Trump, who is certain to sign the legislation, tweeted that Massie is “a third rate Grandstander” and said he should be drummed out of the GOP. “He is a disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!” Trump wrote. Massie, who opposes the massive bill, was in the chamber during the debate, chatting occasionally with others and checking his phone. He did not respond to reporters’ repeated efforts to reach him. Posting on Twitter, he cited a section of the Constitution that requires a majority of lawmakers - some 216 of them - to be present and voting to conduct business. The debate was mostly conciliatory, with members of both parties praising the measure as a rescue for a ravaged nation. The lecturns in the chamber’s well were wiped down between many of the speeches.  “While no one will agree with every part of this rescue bill, we face a challenge rarely seen in America’s history. We must act now, or the toll on lives and livelihoods will be far greater,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas. “We have no time to dither,” said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va. “We have no time to engage in ideological or petty partisan fights. Our country needs us as one.” But still, there were outbursts. Freshman Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., donned pink latex gloves and yelled well beyond her allotted one minute, saying she was speaking “not for personal attention but (to encourage you) to take this disease seriously.” Much of what she said could not be heard above Republican shouts.  Numerous high-ranking Republicans called Massie in an attempt to persuade him to let the voice vote proceed, according to a top House GOP aide. They included House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., whom Trump has chosen as his new chief of staff. The aide spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.  Democratic leaders urged lawmakers who are “willing and able” to come to the Capitol to do so. And members of both parties were clearly upset with Massie.  “Heading to Washington to vote on pandemic legislation. Because of one Member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House,” Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., wrote on Twitter. “Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed. Disgraceful. Irresponsible.” South Dakota GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson posted a selfie of himself and three other lawmakers from the upper Midwest traveling to Washington on an otherwise empty plane. Friday’s House session followed an extraordinary 96-0 Senate vote late Wednesday. The bill’s relief can hardly come soon enough.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday the economy “may well be in recession” already, and the government reported a shocking 3.3 million burst of weekly jobless claims, more than four times the previous record. The U.S. death toll from the virus rose to 1,300. It is unlikely to be the end of the federal response. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said issues like more generous food stamp payments, aid to state and local governments and family leave may be revisited in subsequent legislation. The legislation will give $1,200 direct payments to individuals and make way for a flood of subsidized loans, grants and tax breaks to businesses facing extinction in an economic shutdown caused as Americans self-isolate by the tens of millions. It dwarfs prior Washington efforts to take on economic crises and natural disasters, such as the 2008 Wall Street bailout and President Barack Obama’s first-year economic recovery act. But key elements are untested, such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses.  Policymakers worry that bureaucracies like the Small Business Administration may become overwhelmed, and conservatives fear that a new, generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning to the workforce. A new $500 billion subsidized lending program for larger businesses is unproven as well. The bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House’s best guess of the spending it contains. The legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis. The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department’s discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible. There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads. Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit that’s estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers’ paycheck up to $10,000. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A huge tax break for interest costs and operating losses limited by the 2017 tax overhaul was restored at a $200 billion cost in a boon for the real estate sector. An additional $45 billion would fund additional relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for local response efforts and community services.  Most people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.

"In some parts of the U.S., authorities say gun shops aren’t essential businesses and should close during stay-at-home orders meant to slow the coronavirus. In other places, officials are stopping background checks for concealed carry permits. Elsewhere, city leaders have invoked emergency powers allowing bans on gun sales. As the nation grapples with a pandemic that has upended daily life, some gun rights advocates are concerned about an erosion of Second Amendment rights just as Americans are buying firearms in record numbers to try to ensure their safety. “When there’s a national emergency, people are looking for food, water, shelter - that part is important to the survival of our nation,” said Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works in Austin. “They are also looking for the Second Amendment to protect their families.” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton agrees, issuing a legal opinion Friday saying that emergency orders in his state can’t restrict gun sales. Any order that excludes gun stores from “essential” businesses that can stay open are in conflict with state law banning limits on gun sales, Paxton said. “Under our laws, every Texan retains their right to purchase and possess firearms,” he said. In recent weeks, firearm sales have skyrocketed. Background checks - the key barometer of gun sales - already were at record numbers in January and February, likely fueled by a presidential election year. Since the coronavirus outbreak, gun shops have reported long lines and runs on firearms and ammunition. Background checks were up 300% on March 16, compared with the same date a year ago, according to federal data shared with the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gunmakers. Since Feb. 23, each day has seen roughly double the volume over 2019, according to Mark Oliva, spokesman for the group.  “When people aren’t able to provide for their own security or their own safety, they’re going to take measures to make sure that they can. That’s why we have that Second Amendment,” Oliva said. “This is a public safety issue.” The federal background check system has been overwhelmed by the massive increase in firearm sales. What might normally take a few minutes is taking much longer, and a backlog on background checks has ballooned to about 80,000, Oliva said.  If a background check takes longer than three business days, gun dealers are permitted to allow the sale to go through unless a state has stricter waiting periods. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation has advised gun dealers not to feel beholden to complete the sale if they have concerns about the potential buyer. “We are cautioning retailers that they may want to exercise patience and prudence,” Oliva said. Even some gun control advocates say it might not be wise to shut down federally licensed firearms dealers, whose sales require background checks. That could force buyers to use a website or seek a private sale that doesn’t require a check, making it more difficult to trace a firearm if it’s used in a crime. There are risks to both closing a gun shop or keeping it open, said David Chipman, a retired agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “If you keep it open, there’s the risk of first-time buyers who are largely buying out of fear and panic and untrained,” said Chipman, now senior policy adviser for Giffords, a gun control advocacy group. Gun control advocates are concerned about a large number of new owners lacking the usual access to training on how to store and handle their weapon properly. They also worry that Americans who are stocking up now eventually will sell their firearms privately.  “If we can imagine how horrible this crisis is … the people who hoarded the guns might decide six months from now - once they see no zombies around but they’ve run out of tuna and beef jerky - that they need the money to buy food,” Chipman said. In a number of U.S. cities, including New Orleans, the mayor has issued an emergency proclamation that declares the authority to restrict sales of firearms and ammunition.  In some states that have ordered people to stay home, gun stores were not among the businesses deemed essential and allowed to stay open, like grocery stores.  That has led to confusion in California, where for the second time this week, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva ordered gun shops to close, challenging a finding by the legal counsel for the nation’s most populous county that the stores are essential businesses. David Prince, owner of Eagle Gun Range in Farmers Branch, Texas, near Dallas, who temporarily closed his store under Dallas County’s stay-at-home order, then was allowed to reopen Wednesday when gun stores were reclassified locally as essential while the state awaited Paxton’s decision. Prince said gun stores are critical because they give people the chance to defend themselves. “I always knew people were going to want to protect themselves. What I was concerned about was the look in their faces, they are covered in fear,” Prince said. “If I give them the ability to have a firearm, it gives them a fighting chance to defend their family.” The range that is part of his store is considered nonessential and has been forced to close, meaning new gun buyers can’t use it to train on how to handle their firearm. ___ Pane reported from Boise, Idaho.

"MoveOn has waged a new attack campaign against Sen. Richard Burr for allegedly profiting off of non-public information before the stock market cratered in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Burr is not up for reelection until 2022, but the progressive ad campaign on Facebook and at the Raleigh News & Observer aims to force North Carolina Republican from office immediately. The ads feature a black-and-white photograph of Mr. Burr with one hand colored red to show he was caught red-handed and brand him a “pandemic profiteer.” Mr. Burr, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, reportedly sold approximately $1.7 million in stocks after learning of the coronavirus’s potentially calamitous impact before such information available to him became public knowledge. He also reportedly shared warnings with private donors while publicly espousing America’s preparedness to combat the virus. “In public, Senator Burr misleadingly reassured voters about America’s novel coronavirus preparedness, parroting the Trump-GOP party line. But behind the scenes, he was selling off up to $1.7 million in personal stock holdings,” reads the MoveOn ad on Facebook. “Senator Burr was caught red handed using private information for his personal profit, at our expense — it’s time for him to resign.” MoveOn ran its ads to “take over” the homepage of the Raleigh News & Observer website Thursday, and splashed banner ads across the North Carolina newspaper’s digital articles as well. MoveOn has paid as much as $2,000 on anti-Burr ads that began running on Facebook on March 21. Mr. Burr’s office did not immediately respond to request for comment. Mr. Burr has previously said in a statement he relied on news reports to make his stock moves, and he said he personally requested the Senate Ethics Committee review his actions. The progressive group’s advocacy campaign is not a purely partisan cause, as many of Mr. Burr’s right-leaning allies have called for his resignation. Fox News personality Tucker Carlson has suggested he resign and fellow Republican lawmakers have pressured Mr. Burr also, including Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida who requested the Senate immediately remove Mr. Burr from the leadership of the Intelligence Committee. Mr. Gaetz has also called on Sen. Thom Tillis, North Carolina Republican, to refer Mr. Burr to the Justice Department for prosecution.

"The House passed a bipartisan $2.2 trillion emergency economic relief package Friday, paving the way for an influx of funds to the besieged healthcare system and aid for workers and businesses reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. The measure, which includes direct payments of $1,200 for most Americans, now heads to the White House for President Trump’s signature. “I thank all members on both sides of the aisle for the seriousness with which we have all taken this important challenge,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before the final vote. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, called the package “our modern-day all-American Marshall plan.” “We have never experienced that before in our lives, not even in the great depression,” Mr. McCarthy said. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, who managed the Republicans’ debate, called the pandemic “the crisis of a lifetime.” Lawmakers approved the biggest rescue plan in history on a voice vote, but not before Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who objected to the cost of the bill and the hasty process for approving it, created some last-minute drama. Mr. Massie tried to force a recorded vote, prompting many lawmakers from both parties to rush back to Washington overnight from across the country to ensure that a quorum of at least 216 would be present to defeat his move. Party leaders had wanted to avoid the need for lawmakers to travel great distances and crowd into the House chamber, to limit the health risks from the coronavirus. As the moment for a final vote neared, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged more lawmakers to come from their offices and take seats in the public gallery, rather than on the floor, to allow enough spacing between members. “Come on my colleagues, to the gallery,” she said. When enough lawmakers were seated, a voice vote was held, and Mr. Massie stood to object. “I came here to make sure our republic doesn’t die by unanimous consent in an empty chamber, and I request a recorded vote,” Mr. Massie said. When not enough lawmakers agreed to his request, Mr. Massie objected that a quorum wasn’t present. He was overruled again. The motion was declared adopted, and the chamber erupted with cheers and applause. Mr. Massie accused congressional leadership of orchestrating a “fix,” complaining that he was denied time to speak on the bill. “It’s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY,” he tweeted. “Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote?” The bill will give direct payments of about $3,400 to the average family of four, bolster unemployment insurance with a surge of $250 billion, provide $500 billion in loans to big businesses, and create a $350 billion loan and grant program for small businesses. It also funnels $130 billion into the stretched-thin healthcare system to get more resources and equipment to those directly fighting the disease. The package passed one day after jobless claimed skyrocketed to a record 3.28 million in the past week, as businesses cut back as they shutter for public health concerns. While the Senate passed the package with unanimous support, some Republican members opposed the bill because of their concern about the hefty price tag and how the funds are being appropriated. “This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing,” Mr. Massie said in a tweet.

"Rep. Thomas Massie is uniting the country. President Trump and former Secretary of State John Kerry both ripped into the Kentucky Republican for threatening to force a roll-call vote on the coronavirus-rescue package that was approved by the Senate earlier this week. Breaking news: Congressman Massie has tested positive for being an asshole. He must be quarantined to prevent the spread of his massive stupidity. He’s given new meaning to the term #Masshole. (Finally, something the president and I can agree on!) https://t.co/N1CNLPsZjc House leadership began advising lawmakers on Thursday night to return to Washington from their districts if possible, even as health experts tell people across the country to shelter in place. “Breaking news: Congressman Massie has tested positive for being an asshole. He must be quarantined to prevent the spread of his massive stupidity,” Mr. Kerry tweeted. “He’s given new meaning to the term #Masshole.”Mr. Massie attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Kerry said there is the silver lining, however: “Finally, something the president and I can agree on!” Mr. Trump, who’s heavily criticized Mr. Kerry and his work on Iran, ripped Mr. Massie as a “third rate Grandstander” earlier in the day and said he should be thrown out of the GOP. The president is leaning on Congress to quickly stop the economic bleeding from the coronavirus. “Never knew John Kerry had such a good sense of humor! Very impressed!” Mr. Trump tweeted. Mr. Massie says he has well-founded concerns about the bill and the Senate process for approving it. “The Senate did some voodoo just like with Obamacare. Took a House Bill (HR 748) dealing with taxes, stripped every word, and put their bill in it. The House is just as responsible for killing the origination clause as the Senate.  It’s the House’s job to reject the process,” Mr. Massie tweeted. Fellow conservatives rallied to his defense, with one telling Mr. Trump to “back off.” “He is defending the Constitution today by requiring a quorum.  There’s nothing 3rd rate about that, [Mr. Trump],” Rep. Chip Roy, Texas Republican, tweeted. “I may miss vote if he forces roll call (flights) but it will pass. Back off.” Rep. Paul Gosar, Arizona Republican, tweeted he doesn’t always agree with Mr. Massie on policy or strategy but that he “doesn’t warrant this dressing down” from the president. • Gabriella Muñoz contributed to this report.

"Rep. Thomas Massie, Kentucky Republican, will demand the House take a recorded vote on the $2 trillion coronavirus economic emergency stimulus package. However, the House will have enough members to reach a quorum, a leadership aide told The Washington Times, so a final vote on the package can still proceed Friday. Mr. Massie accused Congressional leadership of orchestrating a “fix.” It’s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY.Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote? #SWAMP House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dragged out her remarks on the House floor ahead of the vote to ensure enough members were present, while still social distancing, to block Mr. Massie’s request. Members scrambled to make it to Capitol Hill Friday morning after Mr. Massie hinted Thursday that he would oppose a voice vote on the package. “The Constitution requires that a quorum of members be present to conduct business in the House. Right now, millions of essential, working-class Americans are still required to go to work during this pandemic…Is it too much to ask that the House do its job, just like the Senate did?” he tweeted. The House needs a majority of its members present — at least 216 — in order to vote if a member forces the quorum issue. Mr. Massie has faced a wave of backlash from his colleagues on the Hill and President Trump who argue the move risks spreading the virus amongst members in the chamber and during their travel.

"The U.S. House on Friday approved a $2.2 trillion rescue packag e, rushing it to President Donald Trump for his signature. The measure tosses a life preserver to a U.S. economy and health care system left flailing by the coronavirus pandemic.  America’s coronavirus infections have  surged to the most in the world.  Italy has shut down its industry. Masses of unemployed Indian laborers got food handouts and South Africa began a three-week lockdown. The U.S. cities of Chicago and Detroit saw increases in infections. Here are some of AP’s top stories Friday on the world’s coronavirus pandemic. Follow APNews.com/VirusOutbreak for updates through the day and APNews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak for stories explaining some of its complexities. WHAT’S HAPPENING TODAY: - For the millions of Americans living under some form of lockdown, it’s the not knowing when the restrictions will end which is also causing sharp anxiety. Will important life events be delayed for a few weeks, a few months or much longer? - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for the new coronavirus,  but remains in charge of the U.K.’s response to the outbreak. Johnson, 55, said Friday that he was tested for COVID-19 on the advice of the chief medical officer after showing “mild symptoms” involving a temperature and a persistent cough. - Some leaders are hailing a potential breakthrough: Simple pin-prick blood tests or nasal swabs that can determine within minutes if someone has, or previously had, the virus. But scientists have challenged their accuracy. - Los Angeles recorded its first case of coronavirus five weeks before New York City, yet New York is now the U.S. epicenter of the disease. Public health officials are keeping a wary eye and warning that LA could end up being as hard hit as New York in coming weeks, in part because a planned increase in testing may uncover a dramatic surge in cases.  - The Vatican says Pope Francis will celebrate Holy Week ceremonies in the confines of Vatican City, including a Good Friday Way of the Cross service on the steps of St. Peter’s Basilica instead of Rome’s Colosseum as customary. - Are gun shops ‘essential’ businesses during a pandemic? Americans in areas of stay-at-home directives are mixed on whether gun shops are an essential business and should remain open. That’s led some gun rights advocates to worry about an erosion of Second Amendment rights. Americans are buying firearms in record numbers. ___ WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover. Here are the symptoms of  the virus compared with the common flu.  One of the best ways to prevent spread of the virus is washing your hands with soap and water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends first washing with warm or cold water and then lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under fingernails before rinsing off. You should wash your phone, too. Here’s how.  Misinformation overload: How to separate fact from fiction and rumor from deliberate efforts to mislead.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - Acting swiftly in an extraordinary time, the House rushed President Donald Trump a $2.2 trillion rescue package Friday, tossing a life preserver to a U.S. economy and health care system left flailing by the coronavirus pandemic.  The House approved the sweeping measure by a voice vote, as strong majorities of both parties lined up behind the most colossal economic relief bill in the nation’s history. It will ship payments of up to $1,200 to millions of Americans, bolster unemployment benefits, offer loans, grants and tax breaks to businesses large and small and flush billions more to states, local governments and the nation’s all but overwhelmed health care system.  Trump said he would sign the measure immediately.  “The American people deserve a government wide, visionary, evidence-based response to address these threats to their lives and their livelihood. And they need it now,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.  “We are going to help Americans through this. We are going to do this together,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.  Passage came after Democratic and Republican leaders banded together and outmaneuvered a maverick GOP lawmaker who tried forcing a roll call vote.  With many lawmakers scattered around the country and reluctant to risk flying back to the Capitol, that could have delayed approval.  But after Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a libertarian who often bucks the GOP leadership, tried insisting on a roll call vote, the presiding officer - Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Md. - ruled that there was no need for one and the bill passed.  For the most part, Democrats who saw a taxpayer giveaway to big business and Republicans who considered it ladened with waste backed the measure for the greater good of keeping the economy alive.  There were hand sanitizers at the end of each aisle in the chamber, where most lawmakers sat well apart from one another.  Massie’s moved infuriated Trump and many lawmakers, who would have been forced to return to the Capitol to vote on legislation that was certain to pass anyway.  Trump tweeted that Massie is “a third rate Grandstander” and said he should be drummed out of the GOP. “He is a disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!” Trump wrote. Massie, who opposed the massive bill, was in the chamber during the debate, chatting occasionally with others and checking his phone. Posting on Twitter, he cited a section of the Constitution that requires a majority of lawmakers - some 216 of them - to be present and voting to conduct business. The debate was mostly conciliatory, with members of both parties praising the measure as a rescue for a ravaged nation. The lecturns in the chamber’s well were wiped down between many of the speeches.  “While no one will agree with every part of this rescue bill, we face a challenge rarely seen in America’s history. We must act now, or the toll on lives and livelihoods will be far greater,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas. “We have no time to dither,” said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va. “We have no time to engage in ideological or petty partisan fights. Our country needs us as one.” But still, there were outbursts. Freshman Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., donned pink latex gloves and yelled well beyond her allotted one minute, saying she was speaking “not for personal attention but (to encourage you) to take this disease seriously.” Much of what she said could not be heard above Republican shouts.  Numerous high-ranking Republicans called Massie in an attempt to persuade him to let the voice vote proceed, according to a top House GOP aide. They included McCarthy and Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., whom Trump has chosen as his new chief of staff. The aide spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.  Democratic leaders urged lawmakers who are “willing and able” to come to the Capitol to do so. And members of both parties were clearly upset with Massie.  “Heading to Washington to vote on pandemic legislation. Because of one Member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House,” Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., wrote on Twitter. “Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed. Disgraceful. Irresponsible.” South Dakota GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson posted a selfie of himself and three other lawmakers from the upper Midwest traveling to Washington on an otherwise empty plane. Friday’s House session followed an extraordinary 96-0 Senate vote late Wednesday. The bill’s relief can hardly come soon enough.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday the economy “may well be in recession” already, and the government reported a shocking 3.3 million burst of weekly jobless claims, more than four times the previous record. The U.S. death toll from the virus rose to 1,300. It is unlikely to be the end of the federal response. Pelosi said issues like more generous food stamp payments, aid to state and local governments and family leave may be revisited in subsequent legislation. The legislation will give $1,200 direct payments to individuals and make way for a flood of subsidized loans, grants and tax breaks to businesses facing extinction in an economic shutdown caused as Americans self-isolate by the tens of millions. It dwarfs prior Washington efforts to take on economic crises and natural disasters, such as the 2008 Wall Street bailout and President Barack Obama’s first-year economic recovery act. But key elements are untested, such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses.  Policymakers worry that bureaucracies like the Small Business Administration may become overwhelmed, and conservatives fear that a new, generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning to the workforce. A new $500 billion subsidized lending program for larger businesses is unproven as well. The bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House’s best guess of the spending it contains. The legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis. The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department’s discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible. There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads. Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit that’s estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers’ paycheck up to $10,000. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A huge tax break for interest costs and operating losses limited by the 2017 tax overhaul was restored at a $200 billion cost in a boon for the real estate sector. An additional $45 billion would fund additional relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for local response efforts and community services.  Most people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.

"PHUKET, Thailand (AP) - From the sun-soaked beaches of Thailand to the foothills of Mount Everest in Nepal, tourists across Asia are finding their dream vacations have turned into travel nightmares as airlines cancel flights and countries close their borders in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Thousands of tourists escaping cold weather in Europe were scrambling this week to find alternative ways to return home from the Thai island of Phuket in the Andaman Sea.  Ksenia Vostriakova and her friends were scheduled to fly back to Moscow on an April 3 Singapore Airlines flight, but it was among those canceled when the airline slashed its operations. They have booked a flight on Qatar Airways for April 6 and are hoping nothing else changes. “Now we’re really worried that this flight also might be canceled,” Vostriakova said, adding that their Thai visas run out in mid-April. “We might still stay here because everything changes.” Thailand went under a state of emergency this week as the government gives itself new powers to deal with the virus crisis. The country, which last year welcomed 39 million tourists, announced it was closing its borders to nearly all foreigners. Its national airline, Thai Airways, said it was suspending almost all of its flights. It’s a trend seen around the region and the world. The Airports Council International Asia-Pacific said Friday that 12 major hubs in Asia-Pacific had seen an average decrease in air traffic of more than 80% in the second week of March versus the same period last year. Up to 10,000 tourists are believed to be stranded in Nepal after the government ordered a complete lockdown that halted all flights and road travel to prevent the spread of the virus, the country’s tourism board said. Most businesses and government offices were also shut.  Spring is the tourist season for Nepal when thousands of visitors come to hike the mountain trails. At the Lukla Airport, the only gateway to the Mount Everest region, there were more than 200 trekkers stranded, according to Dhurba Shrestha, an airport official. Even if the highways were open, the closest road is three days trek downhill. Officials were working on arrangements of special flights to at least get tourists back to the capital, Kathmandu. The German government on Friday arranged a rescue flight - a Qatar Airways charter - that left the capital with 305 people on board, mostly German nationals. In Kathmandu’s tourist enclave, visitors could still be found wandering around empty streets. A handful of restaurants and hotels were still open, but most shops were shuttered. Police were blocking locals from moving around but not tourists. “We were supposed to leave on March 21 but we are still in Nepal and waiting for our embassy to help us arrange a flight,” said New Lee Kuan, from Malaysia. The Indian Ocean island nation of Sri Lanka said that it was ready to help an estimated 18,000 tourists return home either via scheduled flights that are still operating or special charters if required. The country is under a nationwide curfew until at least next week. In Indonesia, more than 2,500 foreign tourists were stranded in Bali, the most famous of the country’s more than 17,000 islands. The government has granted all tourists automatic visa extensions, a move made after long lines formed at immigration offices. “This is good news that helped us a lot,” said Ruben Evert Ernst, a German on vacation with his partner whose visa had been set to expire in a few days. Visitors to Thailand haven’t been so lucky. Hundreds of tourists seeking visa extensions were crowded Friday under a row of awnings next to a makeshift immigration office that’s been set up on the outskirts of Bangkok after throngs formed at the main building. There wasn’t enough room for the tourists to keep their distance and stay in the shade so most were pressed up almost against one another. “I woke up today at 5:30 to get here on time so it’s very stressful,” said Murdoch Baghaie, from Sacramento, California. “I’m supposed to be a tourist enjoying the scenery. Nothing like enjoying Thailand anymore.” Shopping malls, bars, sit-down restaurants, public swimming pools and many other places have all been ordered closed in Thailand. At least for now, Phuket’s beaches remain open. That’s good news for Russian tourist Vitaliy Kurikov, who has been spending his days playing with his son on the white sands of Bang Tao beach. “If they close the beaches, I really don’t know what to do,” he said.  ___ Associated Press journalists Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, Bharatha Mallawarachi in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Binaj Gurubacharya in Kathmandu, Nepal, and Tassanee Vejpongsa in Bangkok contributed to this report.  ___ This story has been corrected to show the correct spelling of a sea as Andaman, not Adaman.

The sad truth is that most of this money in this bill is unrelated to fighting the coronavirus.

"RENO, Nev. (AP) - The Nevada Supreme Court ruled Washoe County prosecutors lack jurisdictional authority - at least for now - to prosecute a Salvadoran immigrant in Reno for two of the four killings that he’s accused of committing outside the county. The high court ordered Judge Connie Steinheimer to reconsider her refusal to dismiss some of the charges accusing Wilber Martinez Guzman of going on a six-day killing rampage in northern Nevada in January 2019. But the justices explained Thursday she could deny the motion again if she determines the crimes were sufficiently related to justify prosecuting him in Washoe County for all the shootings, including two in nearby Douglas County. For now, they said Steinheimer has incorrectly concluded the Washoe County grand jury enjoyed statewide authority to indict him on the Douglas County counts. “Territorial jurisdiction of the district court does not extend statewide,” Justice Elissa Cadish wrote in the unanimous, 14-page opinion. Federal officials have said Martinez-Guzman is in the U.S. illegally, but they don’t know how or when he crossed the Mexico border. The case has drawn the attention of President Donald Trump, who says it shows the need for a border wall. A Washoe County grand jury indicted Martinez Guzman on 10 counts last year. Investigators say he stole a revolver from Gerald and Sharon David in southwest Reno Jan. 4, 2019, before traveling to rural Douglas County where he shot Constance Koontz Jan. 9 and Sophia Renken Jan. 12, then returned to rob and kill the Davids Jan. 15. District Attorneys Chris Hicks of Washoe County and Mark Jackson of Douglas County said they sought a single indictment in Reno partly to expedite prosecution. They insisted the crimes are linked because he shot all four victims with the same gun he stole from the Reno couple he had worked for in 2018 as a landscaper. “The facts of this case are so intertwined that his possession of the firearm was an act requisite to consummation of the crimes in Douglas County,” Jackson said. Public defenders wrote in the motion to dismiss the Douglas County counts last July that a county grand jury was “never intended to serve as a roving commission inquiring into statewide crimes.” “This is the first (time) where a prosecutor asked a grand jury to indict on a crime that did not occur in the county,” John Reese Petty told the Supreme Court during oral arguments in November. Prosecutors told the justices the intent for the Douglas County killings was formed in Washoe County. But Petty said nothing suggests Martinez Guzman “suddenly formed this criminal intent to go on a crime spree across Nevada.” “There’s no grand conspiracy, no grand scheme or plan that (he) made in Washoe County,” Petty said Steinheimer agreed with prosecutors about statewide jurisdiction and threw out the motion to dismiss without advancing to the next step to determine the extent the crimes were related. The justices said that’s now what she must do. “The district court shall review the evidence presented to the Washoe County grand jury to determine whether there is sufficient connection between the Douglas County offenses and Washoe County,” Cadish wrote. “A dismissal at this stage would not prevent Douglas County from initiating its own criminal proceedings regarding Martinez Guzman’s alleged Douglas County offenses,” she added. ___ This story corrects an earlier version that misspelled Wilber Martinez Guzman’s first name.

"BOSTON (AP) - All visitors arriving in Massachusetts are being asked to self-quarantine for 14 days as the state tightens its efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Charlie Baker said Friday. The Republican governor said travelers coming into Massachusetts through the state’s airports and by train will be given flyers instructing them about the quarantine. Instructions will also be placed at highway rest stops and on electronic highway message boards. Baker said there is no enforcement mechanism at this point. More on developments in Massachusetts:  ___ TAX DEADLINE Massachusetts is postponing its state income tax filing deadline to July 15.  Gov. Baker and Democratic leaders in the Massachusetts House and Senate announced the agreement Friday.  Baker said the extension would be automatic and taxpayers would not need to file any additional forms to qualify. He said the extension would provide flexibility to taxpayer while protecting the state’s strong fiscal footing. The extension corresponds with the Internal Revenue Service’s recent decision to push back the April 15 federal tax deadline. ___ ICE DETAINEES LAWSUIT Civil rights groups have filed a class action lawsuit calling for the release of all immigration detainees at a Massachusetts jail. Lawyers for Civil Rights and other organizations argue in their federal suit filed late Thursday that detainees at the Bristol County House of Corrections in Dartmouth are living in “cruel and inhumane conditions” that put them at risk of an outbreak of the new coronavirus. They said the detainees are not being provided sanitizer or disinfectant and only limited amounts of soap. The groups also said corrections officers have reported to work with virus-like symptoms, and new detainees are being brought into the facility without being tested or screened. Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson denied the allegations and dismissed the suit as “absurd and completely frivolous.” He also said his office has no legal authority to release immigration detainees, who are held in custody on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. John Mohan, a spokesman for ICE’s Boston office, said ICE continues “to maintain confidence” in the jail but declined to comment on the specifics of the suit. ___ MEDICAL REINFORCEMENTS Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders said Friday that the state is working with medical schools in Massachusetts to streamline the early graduation of qualified fourth-year students to let graduates aid with the state’s COVID-19 response. The state Board of Registration in Medicine will provide medical school graduates who have matched as an intern, resident or fellow with a Massachusetts health care facility or training program with emergency 90-day medical licenses. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. ___ DEBT COLLECTION REGULATION Attorney General Maura Healey announced Friday that her office has filed an emergency regulation she said will help protect consumers from unfair and deceptive debt collection practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The regulation takes effect immediately and bars creditors from engaging in debt collection methods that require people to leave their homes and have in-person contact, including filing new lawsuits against consumers, visiting their homes or places of work, or repossessing their cars, Healey said the emergency regulation will remain in effect for 90 days or until the end of the declared state of emergency. .

"WASHINGTON (AP) - Acting with unity and resolve unseen since the 9/11 attacks, the House of Representatives gave near-unanimous approval Friday to historic legislation designed to prevent the economy from collapsing and rush resources to overburdened health care providers and struggling families during the deepening coronavirus epidemic. The unprecedented $2.2 trillion relief package passed the chamber by voice vote after an impassioned session conducted along the social distancing guidelines imposed by the crisis. Many lawmakers sped to Washington to participate - their numbers swollen after a maverick Republican signaled he’d try to force a roll call vote - though dozens of others remained safely in their home districts. The vote sent the bill to President Donald Trump, who has said he’ll immediately sign it. The Senate passed the bill unanimously late Wednesday. “The American people deserve a government-wide, visionary, evidence-based response to address these threats to their lives and their livelihood and they need it now,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. The $2.2 trillion legislation will speed government payments of $1,200 to most Americans and increase jobless benefits for millions of people thrown out of work. Businesses big and small will get loans, grants and tax breaks. It will send unprecedented billions to states and local governments, and the nation’s all but overwhelmed health care system. “This pathogen does not recognize party lines, and no partisan solution will defeat it. Neither will the government acting alone,” said GOP Whip Liz Cheney of Wyoming. “This is not a time for cynicism or invective or second-guessing. This is a time to remember that we are citizens of the greatest nation on Earth, that we have overcome every challenge we have faced, and we will overcome this one.” Despite reservations, arch conservatives joined with progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to back the bill, which moved quickly through a Congress that’s been battered by partisanship and is itself not immune to the suffering the virus has caused. Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., announced Friday that he has tested positive, just the latest infection in Congress. Tea party Republicans said government orders to shutter businesses merited actions that conflict with small-government ideology. Liberals accepted generous corporate rescues that accompany larger unemployment benefits, deferrals of student loans, and an enormous surge of funding for health care and other agencies responding to the crisis.  “I’m going to have to vote for something that has things in it that break my heart,” said conservative Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz.  Many lawmakers summoned the bipartisan spirit of 9/11 and efforts to fight terrorism. Others praised the roles low-income workers play in keeping the country going and the heroism of health care workers. Some, like Iowa Democrat Abby Finkenauer, who had just learned of two additional coronavirus-related deaths in her district, came close to tears. Others couldn’t restrain their partisan impulses. Republicans chided Democratic leaders for delays and provisions they see as extraneous, such as funding for public broadcasting and the arts; Democrats said too many elements are a bailout for corporations that may not need it. Still, in a chamber increasingly dominated by lawmakers whose chief skill often seems to be partisan attacks, Friday’s debate was a noteworthy break. “We have no time to dither,” said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va. “We have no time to engage in ideological or petty partisan fights. Our country needs us as one.” The run-up to the vote contained an element of drama because libertarian conservative Thomas Massie, R-Ky., announced plans to seek a vote. The leaders of both parties united to prevent that because it would have forced lawmakers back to the Capitol or blemished their voting records if they stayed home. Instead, they made sure enough lawmakers would attend Friday’s session to block Massie’s move under the rules, and lawmakers took the unprecedented step of sitting in the visitors galleries to establish the necessary quorum. The House promptly adjourned for a weeks-long recess but will return later in the spring to consider further legislation. “This bill is not only a rescue package, it’s a commitment - a commitment that your government, and the people whom you elected to serve you, will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future,” said Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. The legislation will give $1,200 direct payments to individuals and make way for a flood of subsidized loans, grants and tax breaks to businesses facing extinction in an economic shutdown caused as Americans self-isolate by the tens of millions. It dwarfs prior Washington responses to crises like 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, and natural disasters. The massive CARES Act started as a draft plan among Republicans controlling the Senate who were seeking a greater voice in the coronavirus response efforts — especially after Pelosi was a dominant force in earlier legislation imposing a sick leave mandate on businesses. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Democratic participation a week ago, and signed off on a major expansion of unemployment insurance, but his efforts to freeze out Pelosi and force a quick agreement were met with Democratic demands for large infusions of aid to states and hospitals, as well as an assortment of smaller items. McConnell and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York wrestled for days, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other administration officials. Negotiations finally produced a deal early Wednesday morning, and the Senate passed the measure by a 96-0 vote. Key elements are untested, such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses. Rebate payments will go to people who have retained their jobs. Agencies like the Small Business Administration and state unemployment systems will be severely taxed, and conservatives fear that a new, generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning to the workforce.  The bill amounts to a bridge loan for much of the economy and carries a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget.  The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. There is also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads. It also seeks to strengthen the safety net for the poor and homeless. Schools and students would get relief, small business loans payments would be deferred. Evictions from public housing would be put on pause. Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit designed to help companies keep workers on payroll. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A huge tax break for interest costs and operating losses limited by the 2017 tax overhaul was restored at a $200 billion cost in a boon for the real estate sector. Most people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.

"President Trump signed a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package into law Friday to provide direct payments to most Americans and aid to workers and businesses idled by the coronavirus outbreak. “I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,” the president said at the White House. Among the five congressional Republicans with the president in the Oval Office were Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. There were no Democratic lawmakers in attendance at the signing ceremony. “It’s a proud moment for all of us,” Mr. McConnell said. Vice President Mike Pence said the new law means that “today, every American family, every American business can know that help is on the way.” The president’s signature capped a frantic week of deal-making between the White House and congressional Democrats as major portions of the economy ground to a halt to stop the spread of the virus. The measure provides $500 billion in loans for distressed companies, beefed-up unemployment insurance for 39 weeks in most states, $350 billion in loans and grants for small businesses and direct payments of $1,200 to most Americans. The checks should go out within three weeks, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin has said. As he signed the biggest economic package in history, the president quipped, “I never signed anything with a ‘T’ on it.” “We got hit by the invisible enemy and we got hit hard,” Mr. Trump said. He said the economy would come roaring back, adding, “I think we are going to have a tremendous rebound.”  ","Trump signs $2 trillion economic rescue plan to rush aid to businesses, workers hurt by pandemic"," -

"The House passed a bipartisan $2.2 trillion emergency economic relief package Friday, paving the way for an influx of funds to the besieged healthcare system and aid for workers and businesses reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. The measure, which includes direct payments of $1,200 for most Americans, now heads to the White House for President Trump’s signature at 4 p.m. “I thank all members on both sides of the aisle for the seriousness with which we have all taken this important challenge,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before the final vote. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, called the package “our modern-day all-American Marshall plan.” “We have never experienced that before in our lives, not even in the great depression,” Mr. McCarthy said. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, who managed the Republicans’ debate, called the pandemic “the crisis of a lifetime.” There have been about 95,000 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in the U.S. and 1,475 deaths as of Friday afternoon. Lawmakers approved the biggest rescue plan in history on a voice vote, but not before Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who objected to the cost of the bill and the hasty process for approving it, created some last-minute drama. Mr. Massie tried to force a recorded vote, prompting many lawmakers from both parties to rush back to Washington overnight from across the country to ensure that a quorum of at least 216 would be present to defeat his move. Party leaders had wanted to avoid the need for lawmakers to travel great distances and crowd into the House chamber, to limit the health risks from the coronavirus. As the moment for a final vote neared, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged more lawmakers to come from their offices and take seats in the public gallery, rather than on the floor, to allow enough spacing between members. “Come on my colleagues, to the gallery,” she said. When enough lawmakers were seated, a voice vote was held, and Mr. Massie stood to object. “I came here to make sure our republic doesn’t die by unanimous consent in an empty chamber, and I request a recorded vote,” Mr. Massie said. When not enough lawmakers agreed to his request, Mr. Massie objected that a quorum wasn’t present. He was overruled again. The motion was declared adopted, and the chamber erupted with cheers and applause. Mr. Massie accused congressional leadership of orchestrating a “fix,” complaining that he was denied time to speak on the bill. “It’s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY,” he tweeted. “Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote?” The bill will give direct payments of about $3,400 to the average family of four, bolster unemployment insurance with a surge of $250 billion, provide $500 billion in loans to big businesses, and create a $350 billion loan and grant program for small businesses. It also funnels $130 billion into the stretched-thin healthcare system to get more resources and equipment to those directly fighting the disease. The package passed one day after jobless claimed skyrocketed to a record 3.28 million in the past week, as businesses cut back as they shutter for public health concerns. While the Senate passed the package with unanimous support, some Republican members opposed the bill because of their concern about the hefty price tag and how the funds are being appropriated. “This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing,” Mr. Massie said in a tweet. Mr. Trump said he would sign the bill into law as soon as possible after it cleared the House. Some Republicans, such as Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, joined Mr. Massie in opposition to the package. Although Mr. Buck applauded the president’s efforts to help struggling businesses and families, he said, “we can’t do so at the expense of our children and our grandchildren’s future.” “The truth is this bill will spend $6 trillion, not $2 trillion,” Mr. Buck said in reference to additional lending authority and other relief efforts by the Federal Reserve. “There is no attempt by Congress to reduce spending elsewhere in the budget to pay for this bill. The sad truth is that most of this money in this bill is unrelated to fighting the coronavirus. We believe that the fight against the virus will take six to eight weeks, yet this bill spends money decades into the future.” While there is a clear need to help, he said, “This bill is not the answer.”  ",House passes $2 trillion coronavirus aide package on voice vote,"Friday, March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/house-passes-2-trillion-coronavirus-aide-package-v/,washington_times
"President Trump on Friday used war-time production powers to require General Motors to “accept, perform, and prioritize” federal contracts for ventilators. Mr. Trump had invoked the Defense Production Act for leverage over U.S. companies some time ago. Yet he hadn’t been forcing industries to make anything, saying they’d come forward on their own. The president said he ran out of patience with GM, an automaker, as it shifted its efforts toward the coronavirus. “Our negotiations with GM regarding its ability to supply ventilators have been productive, but our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,” Mr. Trump said. “GM was wasting time. Today’s action will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives.” Ventilators, which help people breathe, are vital to the coronavirus response since the virus causes respiratory distress. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other governors have pleaded with Mr. Trump to find and ship more ventilators to their hospitals, saying it’s too difficult for them to find them on the open market. Mr. Trump’s order empowers Health Secretary Alex Azar to compel production from GM. “The secretary shall use any and all authority available under the act to require General Motors Company to accept, perform, and prioritize contracts or orders for the number of ventilators that the secretary determines to be appropriate,” a memorandum on the order says. GM previously agreed to produce ventilators with Ventec Life Systems, Inc.The New York Times reported the administration pulled back from purchasing tens of thousands of the machines after the price tag came in at $1 billion. The paper said while the deal was not dead, the Federal Emergency Management Agency wanted to shop around. Mr. Trump blamed GM for the hiccups in a series of tweets Friday. “They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, ‘very quickly.’ Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke ‘P.’” Mr. Trump, who was referring to GM CEO Mary T. Barra, explained that “P” meant the Defense Production Act. He said GM should produce the ventilators at its “stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant.” GM no longer owns the Lordstown plant. It sold the plant to Workhorse, which makes electric trucks. Mr. Trump trumpeted the sale on Twitter at the time.

"DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) - Syria’s president and one of the United Arab Emirates’ most powerful leaders spoke on the phone on Friday - signalling a major thaw in Damascus’ troubled relations with Arab countries, which had mostly boycotted President Bashar Assad and backed his opposition.  The official Emirati news agency said Assad and Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan discussed efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak and reviewed preventive measures to fight it.  Sheikh Mohammed, believed to be the Emirates’ day-to-day ruler, said Syria and the UAE need to “place the humanitarian solidarity over political issues during this common challenge ‘we are all facing’,” according to the report. The crown prince of the oil-rich Abu Dhabi affirmed that Syria “will not be left alone during these delicate and critical circumstances.”  Syria’s health system and infrastructure have been decimated by years of conflict. Although Damascus has recorded only five cases of infection with coronavirus, there are concerns the fast-spreading virus may prove a major test for the government.  The UAE had been a supporter of the Syrian opposition during the early years of the war, now in its tenth year. But as the war wound down and with the Syrian army capturing most of the territory that was once lost to the opposition, the UAE and a few Arab countries made limited and usually indirect openings toward Assad’s government. In late 2018, the UAE reopened its embassy in Damascus, for the first time since an organized Arab diplomatic boycott soon after the Syrian war erupted in 2011. The embassy representation is at a charge d’affairs level but its very reopening was a sign that more rapprochement is likely to follow.  Friday’s phone call, however, is the first publicized contact between an Arab leader and Assad.  The Syrian opposition, which controls one overpopulated stretch of territory in northwestern Syria, is now mainly supported by Turkey, which the UAE and other Arab countries view with suspicion because of its embrace of regional Islamists.  Syria’s official presidency Twitter account said the crown prince stressed that the UAE will support the “Syrian people during these exceptional times.”   ","Syria, UAE leaders discuss coronavirus, a thaw in relations","Friday, March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/syria-uae-leaders-discuss-coronavirus-a-thaw-in-re/,washington_times
"WASHINGTON (AP) - When it came time to heave the largest aid package in U.S. history over the finish line, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows was the closer, working with Democrats to get it done. He wasn’t just any member of Congress. In a highly unusual arrangement, Meadows has been pulling off a balancing act, simultaneously maintaining his seat representing North Carolina in the House while also acting as the de facto White House chief of staff during one of the biggest crises faced by any president in modern history. Meadows is expected to resign from Congress as early as Friday, after which he will formally take over the chief of staff role still technically held by Mick Mulvaney, who never shook his “acting” title. In truth, it was nearly two weeks ago that aides to Mulvaney helped pack up his office and move out of the West Wing, raising questions about who, exactly, has been in charge. “I’m still a member of Congress; Mick Mulvaney’s still the acting chief, officially,” Meadows told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. He said he would “end up resigning as a member of Congress” toward the end of the month. But Meadows’ efforts over the last week shine a light on his likely role going forward. While Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland did much of the heavy lifting for the White House in talks about the aid package, Democrats and Republicans said Meadows played a key role in the late stages. The co-founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus shuttled between Capitol Hill leadership offices and meetings with top Democratic negotiator Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Meadows’ role as a compromise-seeker on a bipartisan package marked an unlikely change of roles for a lawmaker who made his name in Congress as the man who toppled Republican former House Speaker John Boehner in 2015. The Freedom Caucus declined to back the $2 trillion stimulus bill, but it didn’t oppose it either, a testament to Meadows’ ability to soothe GOP objections to the big-spending bill. In the view of one top Democrat, he was “the closer” who knew what was needed to get the bill past the finish line and deliver on the most important variable: ensuring the deal was something Trump would agree to sign into law. Schumer gave a shout-out to Meadows by name on the Senate floor along with Mnuchin and Ueland ahead of Wednesday’s late-night vote on the $2.2 trillion bill. Reviled by Democrats and a thorn to Republican leadership on Capitol Hill, the Freedom Caucus has a reputation for attention-grabbing moves that often backfire spectacularly for the party. The GOP’s 2017 Obamacare repeal effort was bedeviled in the House by the caucus’ stubborn demands. But lawmakers recognize that Meadows has Trump’s ear, and have grown to respect his feel for the House GOP conference. He and GOP leader Kevin McCarthy have also worked to move beyond past differences, although a distrust of Meadows lingers among many Republicans who’ve clashed with him over the years. One Republican close to the talks said that during the negotiations, Meadows worked to push the president’s priorities as the package moved through Congress. His involvement also helped temper concerns from some conservatives who remain wary of Mnuchin - a former Democrat and Goldman Sachs banker - and see him as too eager to sign onto Democratic proposals. “Mark is respected by everyone in the House and certainly respected by conservatives in the House. I think he’s respected by everyone in the Senate, by conservatives in the Senate as well,” said Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of Meadows’ best friends in Congress. Trump announced on Mar. 6 - just as the country was beginning to recognize the dire threat posed by the coronavirus - that he had decided to shake up his senior staff and would be replacing Mulvaney as chief of staff. He had been hankering to make the move for months as part of a larger effort to surround himself with loyalists, but waited until the impeachment saga ended to act. Mulvaney and Meadows, longtime friends, had intended to spend the interim period together at the White House to ensure a smooth transition, but those plans were partially scuttled when both men were forced into self-isolation after potential exposure to the virus. Both tested negative. Some White House staffers have described confusion over who was supposed to be running the West Wing over the past several weeks.  Some of the murkiness of Meadows’ status is deliberate, as his dual status tests the Constitution’s prohibition on a sitting member of Congress holding an “office under the United States.” White House aides have pointed out that Meadows is not drawing a salary. But in practice, they have acknowledged that his “in-waiting” status is a technicality until he formally resigns his seat. Meadows’ spokesman Ben Williamson said that during the transition, Meadows wasn’t doing his job as a lawmaker “full-time,” but that he remained in Congress because it helped his office function more effectively. When a lawmaker leaves office, the House clerk’s office formally manages affairs until a successor is elected. Jordan said he saw nothing wrong with Meadows making the transition to the White House while still in Congress. “He was many times working for his constituents, but he was also looking at the interests of the president, particularly on policy areas and investigation areas, where he thought the president was getting a bad deal from Democrats,” Jordan said, referring both to impeachment and the Russia investigation. Regardless of when the official hand-off happens, Meadows inherits a job that has been dramatically reduced in influence. Trump spurned efforts by his previous chiefs of staff - Meadows will be his fourth - to create clear chains of command and streamline the flow of information and access to the president. For months now, Mulvaney has been largely cut out of the administration’s biggest decisions, from coordinating his defense against impeachment to the fight against the coronavirus. “In effect, what’s happened is Trump, with Mulvaney’s help, redefined the job out of existence,” said Chris Whipple, author of “The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency.” He called the current arrangement both “bizarre” and “unprecedented.” “It’s clear, three years in, that Trump has no interest in empowering a chief of staff to do the job,” he added. Meadows’ allies say he enters the White House with realistic expectations about his role. Rather than attempting to centralize the flow of information through his office - which predecessors have tried to do in an effort to control the impulsive president - they said he intends to focus heavily on the administration’s communications strategy and organizing the White House for the coming reelection fight. Meadows, a longtime Trump confidant and sounding board, is known as a policy wonk with smart political instincts. But the former restaurant owner and real estate developer has little experience in crisis management. What Trump needs now more than ever, critics say, is a chief of staff who can tell him things he doesn’t want to hear.  “In a crisis, like this, that is exponentially more important,” said Whipple. House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Thursday that Meadows would make a “great” chief of staff and strengthen the White House’s relationship with Capitol Hill. “He’s had great relationships on both sides of the aisle, too, so it’s a benefit to all,” McCarthy said. ___ Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report. ___ Follow Miller and Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller and https://twitter.com/colvinj.

Public defenders wrote in the motion to dismiss the Douglas County counts last July that a county grand jury was “never intended to serve as a roving commission inquiring into statewide crimes.” “This is the first (time) where a prosecutor asked a grand jury to indict on a crime that did not occur in the county,” John Reese Petty told the Supreme Court during oral arguments in November. Prosecutors told the justices the intent for the Douglas County killings was formed in Washoe County. But Petty said nothing suggests Martinez Guzman “suddenly formed this criminal intent to go on a crime spree across Nevada.” “There’s no grand conspiracy, no grand scheme or plan that (he) made in Washoe County,” Petty said Steinheimer agreed with prosecutors about statewide jurisdiction and threw out the motion to dismiss without advancing to the next step to determine the extent the crimes were related. The justices said that’s now what she must do. “The district court shall review the evidence presented to the Washoe County grand jury to determine whether there is sufficient connection between the Douglas County offenses and Washoe County,” Cadish wrote. “A dismissal at this stage would not prevent Douglas County from initiating its own criminal proceedings regarding Martinez Guzman’s alleged Douglas County offenses,” she added.

"The U.S. House on Friday approved a $2.2 trillion rescue package, rushing it to President Donald Trump, who then signed it. The measure tosses a life preserver to a U.S. economy and health care system left flailing by the coronavirus pandemic.  America’s coronavirus infections have  surged to the most in the world.  Italy has shut down its industry. Masses of unemployed Indian laborers got food handouts and South Africa began a three-week lockdown. The U.S. cities of Chicago and Detroit saw increases in infections. Here are some of AP’s top stories Friday on the world’s coronavirus pandemic. Follow APNews.com/VirusOutbreak for updates through the day and APNews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak for stories explaining some of its complexities. WHAT’S HAPPENING TODAY: - For the millions of Americans living under some form of lockdown,  not knowing when the restrictions will end is also causing sharp anxiety. Will important life events be delayed for a few weeks, a few months or much longer? - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for the new coronavirus,  but remains in charge of the U.K.’s response to the outbreak. Johnson, 55, said Friday that he was tested for COVID-19 on the advice of the chief medical officer after showing “mild symptoms” involving a temperature and a persistent cough. - Some leaders are hailing a potential breakthrough: Simple pin-prick blood tests or nasal swabs that can determine within minutes if someone has, or previously had, the virus. But scientists have challenged their accuracy. - Los Angeles recorded its first case of coronavirus five weeks before New York City, yet New York is now the U.S. epicenter of the disease. Public health officials are keeping a wary eye and warning that LA could end up being as hard-hit as New York in coming weeks, in part because a planned increase in testing may uncover a dramatic surge in cases.  - The Vatican says Pope Francis will celebrate Holy Week ceremonies in the confines of Vatican City, including a Good Friday Way of the Cross service on the steps of St. Peter’s Basilica instead of at Rome’s Colosseum as is customary. - Are gun shops “essential” businesses during a pandemic? Americans in areas of stay-at-home directives are mixed on whether gun shops should remain open. That’s led some gun rights advocates to worry about an erosion of Second Amendment rights. Americans are buying firearms in record numbers. ___ WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover. Here are the symptoms of  the virus compared with the common flu.  One of the best ways to prevent spread of the virus is washing your hands with soap and water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends first washing with warm or cold water and then lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under fingernails before rinsing off. You should wash your phone, too. Here’s how.  Misinformation overload: How to separate fact from fiction and rumor from deliberate efforts to mislead.                 TRACKING THE VIRUS:  Drill down and zoom in at the individual county level, and you can access numbers that will show you the situation where you are, and where loved ones or people you’re worried about live. ___ INSIDE THE OUTBREAK PODCAST: The Senate approved a massive $2.2 trillion rescue package to help revive the American economy. In the latest episode of “Ground Game: Inside the Outbreak,” AP Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace and host Ralph Russo discuss what this all means. ___ IN OTHER NEWS:                 TAKEOUT REIMAGINED: Across the United States, restaurateurs are transforming operations to try to stay afloat. Some are even giving away a roll of coveted toilet paper with takeout orders. The National Restaurant Association warns the outbreak could cost 5 million to 7 million jobs and hundreds of billions in losses and is pushing for a special federal relief package for restaurants.                 BEAT GOES ON: Locked down due to the coronavirus pandemic, the nightclubs in the German capital have decided to keep the beat going - at least online. Berlin’s nightclubs were closed on March 13 to help slow the spread of the virus. In response, some formed a streaming platform to let DJs, musicians and artists keep performing.                 NOT A PEEP:  No more Peeps are being hatched for at least a couple of weeks - but it shouldn’t affect Easter baskets. The Just Born confections company in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, says its production facilities there and in Philadelphia have closed through April 7. But the company says it had already produced and shipped the Easter supply of its signature marshmallow confection to outlets. ___ Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  ",What you need to know today about the virus outbreak,"Friday, March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/what-you-need-to-know-today-about-the-virus-outbre/,washington_times
"President Trump signed a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package into law Friday to provide direct payments to most Americans and aid to workers and businesses idled by the coronavirus outbreak. “This will deliver urgently needed relief to our nation’s families, workers and businesses,” the president said at the White House. “I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together, setting aside their differences and putting America first.” The average family of four will receive payments of about $3,400 within three weeks. The measure provides $500 billion in loans for distressed companies, beefed-up unemployment insurance for 39 weeks in most states, $350 billion in grants and loans for small businesses and direct payments of $1,200 to most Americans, plus $500 per child. As he signed the biggest economic package in history, the president quipped, “I never signed anything with a ‘T’ on it.” “It’s going to go a long way and it’s going to make a lot of people very happy,” Mr. Trump said. Among the five congressional Republicans with the president in the Oval Office were Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. There were no Democratic lawmakers in attendance at the signing ceremony. “It’s a proud moment for all of us,” Mr. McConnell said. Vice President Mike Pence said the new law means that “today, every American family, every American business can know that help is on the way.” The president’s signature capped a frantic week of deal-making between the White House and congressional Democrats as major portions of the economy ground to a halt to stop the spread of the virus. “We got hit by the invisible enemy and we got hit hard,” Mr. Trump said. He said the economy would come roaring back, adding, “I think we are going to have a tremendous rebound.”  ","Trump signs $2 trillion economic rescue plan to rush aid to businesses, workers hurt by pandemic","Friday, March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/trump-signs-2-trillion-economic-plan-rush-aid-busi/,washington_times
"President Trump on Friday used war-time production powers to require  General Motors to “accept, perform, and prioritize” federal contracts  for ventilators. Mr. Trump had invoked the Defense Production Act for  leverage over U.S. companies some time ago. Yet he hadn’t been forcing  industries to make anything, saying they’d come forward on their own. The president said he ran out of patience with GM, an automaker, as it shifted its efforts toward the coronavirus. “Our  negotiations with GM regarding its ability to supply ventilators have  been productive, but our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow  the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its  normal course,” Mr. Trump said. “GM was wasting time. Today’s action  will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save  American lives.” The order came hours after GM said it would marshal  1,000 American workers to build ventilators with Ventec Life Systems at a  plant in Indiana. Ventilators, which help people breathe, are vital to the coronavirus response since the virus causes respiratory distress. New  York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other governors have pleaded with Mr. Trump  to find and ship more ventilators to their hospitals, saying it’s too  difficult for them to find them on the open market. Mr. Trump said by working with GM and other companies, he expects to make or procure 100,000 ventilators in the next 100 days. “If they need them in New York, we’re gonna have plenty,” he said. The  president continued to insist that he doesn’t think the U.S. will need  that many ventilators, however, even musing that any surplus might be  sent to other countries. “We can help Italy, we can help U.K.,” he said. Mr. Trump’s order empowers Health Secretary Alex Azar to compel production from GM. “The  secretary shall use any and all authority available under the act to  require General Motors Company to accept, perform, and prioritize  contracts or orders for the number of ventilators that the secretary  determines to be appropriate,” a memorandum on the order says. Mr. Trump previously resisted “nationalizing” U.S. industries and said the Defense Production Act served as great leverage. Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, said taking the next step was the right move. “We can’t follow Italy; we must build more ventilators NOW to save lives tomorrow,” he said. The  U.S. has recorded roughly 100,000 coronavirus infections, overtaking  Italy and China for the most in the world. About 1,500 people in the  country have died and nearly 900 have officially recovered from the  disease, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. GM previously agreed to produce ventilators with Ventec Life Systems, Inc.The  New York Times reported the administration pulled back from purchasing  tens of thousands of the machines after the price tag came in at $1  billion. The paper said while the deal was not dead, the Federal  Emergency Management Agency wanted to shop around. The Trump administration blamed GM for the hiccups. “We  thought we had a deal for 40,000 ventilators and all of a sudden 40,000  came down to 6,000. And then they talked about a higher price than we  were discussing,” Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office. “So I didn’t like  it. So we did activate it with respect to General Motors. Hopefully, we  won’t need the full activation. We’ll find out but we need the  ventilators.” Earlier Friday, he said GM should produce the  ventilators at its “stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some  other plant.” GM no longer owns the Lordstown plant. It sold the  plant to Workhorse, which makes electric trucks. Mr. Trump trumpeted the  sale on Twitter at the time. Mr. Trump reiterated his grievances  over the company generally, citing its decision to move out of Lordstown  despite his pledge to preserve blue-collar jobs.Peter Navarro,  assistant to the president, also said a long list of companies that have  come forward to produce medical gear but said it ran into “roadblocks”  with GM. GM, for its part, said it has been working hard to fulfill the federal government’s needs. “Ventec,  GM and our supply base have been working around the clock for weeks to  meet this urgent need. Our commitment to build Ventec’s high-quality  critical care ventilator, VOCSN, has never wavered,” GM said in a  statement. “The partnership between Ventec and GM combines global  expertise in manufacturing quality and a joint commitment to safety to  give medical professionals and patients access to life-saving technology  as rapidly as possible. The entire GM team is proud to support this  initiative.” Mr. Trump also said aerospace company Boeing will be producing face masks for hospital workers. “There’s going to do thousands of these per week,” Mr. Trump said. The  White House also praised Apple for producing a website that helps  Americans determine whether they should be tested for the coronavirus  disease known as COVID-19.

"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first leader of a major country to test positive for the coronavirus while disturbing new outbreaks appeared in the United States, deaths surged in Italy and Spain and the world warily trudged through the pandemic that has sickened more than a half-million people.  As different populations strive for cures, Iranian media reported nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened by ingesting methanol as a purported safeguard against the disease.  More than 595,000 people have contracted the virus around the world and about 27,000 have died. While the U.S. now leads the world in reported infections, five countries exceed its roughly 1,700 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France.  Johnson announced he tested positive for the virus but was continuing to work from self-quarantine. Another casualty was a conference to review the implementation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, postponed indefinitely.  The treaty is considered the cornerstone of global efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and the 191 parties hold a major conference every five years to discuss how it is working. The meeting had been scheduled to begin on April 27 at U.N. headquarters in New York. The deaths in Iran come amid longstanding bans on drinking alcohol in the Islamic Republic that prompts drinkers to rely on bootleggers whose products aren’t always safe.  As the death toll continued to climb in France, health workers there received a huge show of gratitude - from the Eiffel Tower. “Merci,” French for ‘Thank you,” and “Stay at home” in English were emblazoned in lights at night on the world-famous landmark. In a possibly hopeful sign, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared a new rapid test from Abbott Laboratories, which the company says can detect the coronavirus in about 5 minutes. Medical device maker Abbott announced the emergency clearance of its cartridge-based test Friday night, saying the test delivers a negative result in 13 minutes when the virus is not detected. While New York remained the worst hit city in the U.S., Americans braced for worsening conditions elsewhere, with worrisome infection numbers being reported in New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit.  “We are not through this. We’re not even halfway through this,” said Joseph Kanter of the Louisiana Department of Health, which has recorded more than 2,700 cases, more than five times what it had a week ago. The United States became the first country to surpass 100,000 infections on Friday, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. New Orleans’ sprawling Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, along the Mississippi River, was being converted into a massive hospital as officials prepared for thousands more patients than they could accommodate.  Economic catastrophe had already arrived in the city, where many already live in poverty and the tourism industry has screeched to a halt. “I’ve never been unemployed. But now, all of a sudden: Wop!” said John Moore, the musician best known as Deacon John, who has no gigs to perform with much of the city shut down. “It ain’t just me. It’s everybody.”  In New York, where there are more than 44,000 cases statewide, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 passed 6,000 on Friday, double what it had been three days earlier. Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for 4,000 more temporary beds across New York City, where the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center has already been converted into a hospital.  The struggle to defeat the virus will take “weeks and weeks and weeks,” Cuomo told members of the National Guard working at the Javits Center.  President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act on Friday, ordering General Motors to begin manufacturing ventilators. Trump had earlier rejected Cuomo’s pleas for tens of thousands more of the machines and the governor’s calls to implement the Korean War-era production law.  Trump signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package, after the House approved the sweeping measure by voice vote. Lawmakers in both parties lined up behind the law to send checks to millions of Americans, boost unemployment benefits, help businesses and toss a life preserver to an overwhelmed health care system. More than 595,000 people have contracted the virus around the world and about 27,000 have died. While the U.S. now leads the world in reported infections, five countries exceed its roughly 1,700 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France. Dr. John Brooks of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans remained “in the acceleration phase” of the pandemic and that all corners of the country were at risk. “There is no geographic part of the United States that is spared from this,” he said.  In Europe, Italy recorded its single biggest 24-hour rise in deaths, with 969 more victims, to bring its total number of fatalities to 9,134. The country now has more than 86,000 cases, surpassing China to record the grim distinction of the second-most infections in the world, behind the U.S. Italian President Sergio Mattarella called it “a sad page in our history.”  Italian epidemiologists warn that the country’s number of cases is likely much higher than reported - perhaps by five times - although two weeks into a nationwide lockdown the daily increase seems to be slowing, at least in northern Italy. Spain, with the world’s fourth-biggest number of cases, reported another 7,800 infections for a total of more than 64,000. The country said health workers accounted for about 15 percent of its cases. Deaths in Spain climbed past 4,900 - the world’s second-highest total after Italy. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. Johns Hopkins reported more than 130,000 people have recovered, about half in China. Stocks skidded in Europe and on Wall Street, where major indexes closed down about 3%, giving up some of the gains the market had piled up over the previous three days. The head of the International Monetary Fund said it was clear that the global economy has now entered a recession that could be as bad or worse than the 2009 downturn. ___ Sedensky reported from Philadelphia and Rising reported from Berlin.

"UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The 191 parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty have decided to postpone a conference to review its implementation because of the coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations said Friday. The treaty is considered the cornerstone of global efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and the parties hold a major conference every five years to discuss how it is working. The meeting had been scheduled for April 27-May 22 at U.N. headquarters in New York. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the review conference will be held “as soon as the circumstances permit, but no later than April 2021.” The U.N. said earlier this week that the conference was likely to be postponed, but the conference president-designate, Ambassador Gustavo Zlauvinen of Argentina, wanted to consult governments that are parties to the treaty. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which reached its 50th anniversary March 5, is credited with preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to dozens of nations. It has succeeded in doing this via a grand global bargain: Nations without nuclear weapons committed not to acquire them; those with them committed to move toward their elimination; and all endorsed everyone’s right to develop peaceful nuclear energy. The 191 state parties include every nation except India, Pakistan and North Korea, which possess nuclear weapons, and Israel, which is believed to be a nuclear power but has never acknowledged it. Members try to agree on new approaches to problems, not by updating the treaty, which is difficult, but by trying to adopt a consensus final document calling for steps outside the treaty to advance its goals. That has also proven difficult at recent review conferences, U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu warned earlier this month that the specter of an unbridled nuclear arms race is threatening the world for the first time since the 1970s, the height of the Cold War between the United States and the former Soviet Union. She didn’t name any countries but she was clearly referring to the United States and Russia, and possibly China, when she told the U.N. Security Council that “relationships between states - especially nuclear-weapon states - are fractured.” “So-called great power competition is the order of the day.” Nakamitsu said.  Russia-U.S. relations have been at post-Cold War lows since Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea. Russia and the U.S. clashed at the Security Council meeting where Nakamitsu spoke but they joined in supporting a statement saying the treaty “remains the cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.” The council resolved to advance the treaty’s goals and underlined its essential role “in the preservation of international peace, security and stability as well as the ultimate objective of a world without nuclear weapons.”  ",Virus delays review of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ,"Saturday, March 28, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/28/virus-delays-review-of-the-nuclear-nonproliferatio/,washington_times
"RENO, Nev. (AP) - Criminal charges have been dropped in Nevada against three topless protesters who were arrested at a rally for Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders in Carson City in February.

"LOS ANGELES (AP) - A federal judge on Friday said she doesn’t want a sudden, large-scale release of immigrant children from U.S. government custody but wants to know why they’re still being held as the coronavirus spreads. U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles said she wants to be sure immigrant children who were caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border alone are released to suitable sponsors in an orderly fashion and aren’t put in danger. But she said she wants children out of government-contracted facilities who have been held longer than they should. Gee didn’t immediately issue a final ruling during the teleconferenced hearing, which came after immigrant advocates asked her to order the prompt release of immigrant children over coronavirus concerns. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, said four children in its custody in New York tested positive for the coronavirus, as well as eight staff, contractors or foster parents in New York, Washington and Texas. The office is tasked with the custody and care of immigrant children caught traveling across the border without parents or a guardian. It contracts with shelters across the country to house these children until they can be released to fitting sponsors, most often their relatives in the United States. There are currently about 3,500 children in the office’s custody. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover.

"Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC pouncing on President Trump’s past comments about the novel coronavirus, intensified its efforts Friday in the face of potential litigation. Days after Mr. Trump’s reelection campaign threatened to sue television stations that run a Priorities USA advertisement highlighting the president’s previous remarks about the coronavirus, the super PAC shared a Spanish-language version of the spot being geared toward Hispanic voters. “The Trump campaign is doing everything possible to prevent us from seeing this announcement,” said Daniela Martins, the super PAC’s national Hispanic media director. “Even if he tries to intimidate us, we will continue to hold Trump accountable for how his lack of leadership has put us in danger,” she said on Twitter where the ad was shared. Priorities USA prompted Mr. Trump’s campaign to take action this week in the form of cease-and-desist letters sent to TV stations airing the original Priorities USA ad, a 30-second montage of recent sound bites of him discussing the coronavirus accompanied by a chart showing the surging number of confirmed domestic cases of the disease it causes, COVID-19. “The coronavirus,” Mr. Trump is heard saying at the start of the ad. “This is their new hoax.” Priorities USA said on Tuesday that the spot would be shown on stations in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — four battleground states that be critical to Mr. Trump securing a second term in office — as part of a $6 million campaign TV and digital ad buy. Alex W. Cannon, a lawyer for the Trump campaign, told TV stations the next day that the ad takes the president’s comments out of context and that they could be sued for showing it. “PUSA’s ad’s central point is deliberately false and misleading, your station has an obligation to cease and desist from airing it immediately to comply with FCC licensing requirements, to serve the public interest, and to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation,” he wrote in the letters. Priorities USA reacted Thursday by announcing it would spend an additional $600,000 to have the ad run in Arizona as well. Mediaite was the first outlet to report on the Spanish-language campaign, which consists of two similar 15-second ads with subtitles. They are geared specifically toward voters in Florida, the website reported. The super PAC also plans to spend another $17 million on digital ads that will be shown in the five states between the Democratic National Convention in July and the general election in November, McClatchy reported Friday. Discovered in China in late December, the coronavirus quickly spread around the world in the weeks afterward, when the first U.S. case documented nearly a month later on January 20. More than 99,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the U.S. as of Friday, according to data maintained by Johns Hopkins University, which has put the disease’s domestic death toll at over 1,500 people and counting.

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Four gun-owners rights organizations on Friday sued Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva over his repeated attempts this week to shut down firearms dealers, contending that his actions violate citizens’ constitutionally guaranteed right to bear arms. “Shuttering access to arms necessarily shutters the Constitutional right to those arms,” says the federal lawsuit filed by the Second Amendment Foundation, National Rifle Association of America, California Gun Rights Foundation, and Firearms Policy Coalition on behalf of individual gun buyers and a Los Angeles firearm and ammunition retailer. Meanwhile, libertarian economist and actor Ben Stein sued Gov. Gavin Newsom, challenging whether California’s unprecedented restrictions on social movement can actually be enforced. Gun-owner rights organizations have asked the federal government to end the debate nationwide over whether gun shops can remain open despite growing stay-at-home orders aimed at reducing the spread of the coronavirus. They want the U.S. government to specifically add them to official lists of essential services. They say the Los Angeles lawsuit is the first in California to challenge forced closures. It could end a patchwork of such decisions that has Villanueva ordering them closed to the public in the nation’s most populous county, while other California sheriffs declare them to be vital. Villanueva’s office did not respond to telephone and email requests for comment. The sheriff first ordered a total shutdown on Tuesday, saying long lines from panic buyers risked spreading the coronavirus. The disease causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  He again on Thursday ordered the stores closed to the public, challenging the county legal counsel’s finding that the stores are essential businesses that should remain open. However, his second order said the stores may still supply security guard companies, and anyone who already has purchased a gun and possesses a valid safety certificate can pick up their firearms. Those exceptions aren’t good enough, the lawsuit says, because gun stores provide “the only lawful means to buy, sell, and transfer firearms and ammunition available to typical, law-abiding Californians.”  It also argues the shutdown violates the constitutional right to due process, and says even those who can pick up their previously purchased firearms now can’t buy the ammunition they need to go with them. Meanwhile, Stein’s lawsuit in Sacramento County Superior Court asks that a judge clarify the rights that citizens have under Newsom’s executive order, which it notes has not been enacted into law by state legislators nor by voters at the ballot box. His requirement that residents stay home except for essential errands “approximates the house arrest of 39.5 million healthy and uninfected California citizens,” says the lawsuit filed by the actor perhaps best known for his dry, monotone delivery in the 1986 movie “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.” “Ben respects the governor and he respects people doing social distancing and good health hygiene. But what he has an issue with is that the governor’s order appears to be dictatorial,” said prominent right-wing attorney Larry Klayman, the founder of Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch who sued on Stein’s behalf. He argued that Newsom’s order, while laudable as a recommendation, “cannot be enforced.” Newsom administration officials did not respond to requests for comment. It’s unclear when or if the suit might be considered, because most court functions have been shut down due to the coronavirus. So far, officials generally deny that they are conducting stops or making arrests if someone doesn’t comply. But Stein, who lives in Beverly Hills, said in the lawsuit and on Klayman’s radio show Friday that a friend who is a pastor has been threatened with arrest if he holds religious services even for fewer than 10 people. “This is outrageous, this is a police state, and it’s an interference with freedom of religion, it’s an interference with freedom of assembly,” Stein said on the show. “It’s what I call a soft police state.”  ",Gun groups sue Los Angeles sheriff over shutdown order,"Friday, March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/gun-groups-sue-los-angeles-sheriff-over-shutdown-o/,washington_times

The official Emirati news agency said Assad and Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan discussed efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak and reviewed preventive measures to fight it.  Sheikh Mohammed, believed to be the Emirates’ day-to-day ruler, said Syria and the UAE need to “place the humanitarian solidarity over political issues during this common challenge ‘we are all facing’,” according to the report. The crown prince of the oil-rich Abu Dhabi affirmed that Syria “will not be left alone during these delicate and critical circumstances.”  Syria’s health system and infrastructure have been decimated by years of conflict. Although Damascus has recorded only five cases of infection with coronavirus, there are concerns the fast-spreading virus may prove a major test for the government.  The UAE had been a supporter of the Syrian opposition during the early years of the war, now in its tenth year. But as the war wound down and with the Syrian army capturing most of the territory that was once lost to the opposition, the UAE and a few Arab countries made limited and usually indirect openings toward Assad’s government. In late 2018, the UAE reopened its embassy in Damascus, for the first time since an organized Arab diplomatic boycott soon after the Syrian war erupted in 2011. The embassy representation is at a charge d’affairs level but its very reopening was a sign that more rapprochement is likely to follow.  Friday’s phone call, however, is the first publicized contact between an Arab leader and Assad.  The Syrian opposition, which controls one overpopulated stretch of territory in northwestern Syria, is now mainly supported by Turkey, which the UAE and other Arab countries view with suspicion because of its embrace of regional Islamists.  Syria’s official presidency Twitter account said the crown prince stressed that the UAE will support the “Syrian people during these exceptional times.”   ","Syria, UAE leaders discuss coronavirus, a thaw in relations","Friday, March 27, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/syria-uae-leaders-discuss-coronavirus-a-thaw-in-re/,washington_times
"WASHINGTON (AP) - When it came time to heave the largest aid package in U.S. history over the finish line, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows was the closer, working with Democrats to get it done. He wasn’t just any member of Congress. In a highly unusual arrangement, Meadows has been pulling off a balancing act, simultaneously maintaining his seat representing North Carolina in the House while also acting as the de facto White House chief of staff during one of the biggest crises faced by any president in modern history. Meadows is expected to resign from Congress as early as Friday, after which he will formally take over the chief of staff role still technically held by Mick Mulvaney, who never shook his “acting” title. In truth, it was nearly two weeks ago that aides to Mulvaney helped pack up his office and move out of the West Wing, raising questions about who, exactly, has been in charge. “I’m still a member of Congress; Mick Mulvaney’s still the acting chief, officially,” Meadows told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. He said he would “end up resigning as a member of Congress” toward the end of the month. But Meadows‘ efforts over the last week shine a light on his likely role going forward. While Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland did much of the heavy lifting for the White House in talks about the aid package, Democrats and Republicans said Meadows played a key role in the late stages. The co-founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus shuttled between Capitol Hill leadership offices and meetings with top Democratic negotiator Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Meadows‘ role as a compromise-seeker on a bipartisan package marked an unlikely change of roles for a lawmaker who made his name in Congress as the man who toppled Republican former House Speaker John Boehner in 2015. The Freedom Caucus declined to back the $2 trillion stimulus bill, but it didn’t oppose it either, a testament to Meadows‘ ability to soothe GOP objections to the big-spending bill. In the view of one top Democrat, he was “the closer” who knew what was needed to get the bill past the finish line and deliver on the most important variable: ensuring the deal was something Trump would agree to sign into law. Schumer gave a shout-out to Meadows by name on the Senate floor along with Mnuchin and Ueland ahead of Wednesday’s late-night vote on the $2.2 trillion bill. Reviled by Democrats and a thorn to Republican leadership on Capitol Hill, the Freedom Caucus has a reputation for attention-grabbing moves that often backfire spectacularly for the party. The GOP’s 2017 Obamacare repeal effort was bedeviled in the House by the caucus’ stubborn demands. But lawmakers recognize that Meadows has Trump’s ear, and have grown to respect his feel for the House GOP conference. He and GOP leader Kevin McCarthy have also worked to move beyond past differences, although a distrust of Meadows lingers among many Republicans who’ve clashed with him over the years. One Republican close to the talks said that during the negotiations, Meadows worked to push the president’s priorities as the package moved through Congress. His involvement also helped temper concerns from some conservatives who remain wary of Mnuchin - a former Democrat and Goldman Sachs banker - and see him as too eager to sign onto Democratic proposals. “Mark is respected by everyone in the House and certainly respected by conservatives in the House. I think he’s respected by everyone in the Senate, by conservatives in the Senate as well,” said Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of Meadows‘ best friends in Congress. Trump announced on Mar. 6 - just as the country was beginning to recognize the dire threat posed by the coronavirus - that he had decided to shake up his senior staff and would be replacing Mulvaney as chief of staff. He had been hankering to make the move for months as part of a larger effort to surround himself with loyalists, but waited until the impeachment saga ended to act. Mulvaney and Meadows, longtime friends, had intended to spend the interim period together at the White House to ensure a smooth transition, but those plans were partially scuttled when both men were forced into self-isolation after potential exposure to the virus. Both tested negative. Some White House staffers have described confusion over who was supposed to be running the West Wing over the past several weeks.  Some of the murkiness of Meadows’ status is deliberate, as his dual status tests the Constitution’s prohibition on a sitting member of Congress holding an “office under the United States.” White House aides have pointed out that Meadows is not drawing a salary. But in practice, they have acknowledged that his “in-waiting” status is a technicality until he formally resigns his seat. Meadows’ spokesman Ben Williamson said that during the transition, Meadows wasn’t doing his job as a lawmaker “full-time,” but that he remained in Congress because it helped his office function more effectively. When a lawmaker leaves office, the House clerk’s office formally manages affairs until a successor is elected. Jordan said he saw nothing wrong with Meadows making the transition to the White House while still in Congress. “He was many times working for his constituents, but he was also looking at the interests of the president, particularly on policy areas and investigation areas, where he thought the president was getting a bad deal from Democrats,” Jordan said, referring both to impeachment and the Russia investigation. Regardless of when the official hand-off happens, Meadows inherits a job that has been dramatically reduced in influence. Trump spurned efforts by his previous chiefs of staff - Meadows will be his fourth - to create clear chains of command and streamline the flow of information and access to the president. For months now, Mulvaney has been largely cut out of the administration’s biggest decisions, from coordinating his defense against impeachment to the fight against the coronavirus. “In effect, what’s happened is Trump, with Mulvaney’s help, redefined the job out of existence,” said Chris Whipple, author of “The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency.” He called the current arrangement both “bizarre” and “unprecedented.” “It’s clear, three years in, that Trump has no interest in empowering a chief of staff to do the job,” he added. Meadows’ allies say he enters the White House with realistic expectations about his role. Rather than attempting to centralize the flow of information through his office - which predecessors have tried to do in an effort to control the impulsive president - they said he intends to focus heavily on the administration’s communications strategy and organizing the White House for the coming reelection fight. Meadows, a longtime Trump confidant and sounding board, is known as a policy wonk with smart political instincts. But the former restaurant owner and real estate developer has little experience in crisis management. What Trump needs now more than ever, critics say, is a chief of staff who can tell him things he doesn’t want to hear.  “In a crisis, like this, that is exponentially more important,” said Whipple. House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Thursday that Meadows would make a “great” chief of staff and strengthen the White House’s relationship with Capitol Hill. “He’s had great relationships on both sides of the aisle, too, so it’s a benefit to all,” McCarthy said. ___ Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report. ___ Follow Miller and Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller and https://twitter.com/colvinj.

"The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF THE HOUR: - Albania introduces permit amid stricter measures - Stranded tourists flown to safety from Mount Everest - Germany won’t loosen restrictions on public life before April 20 ___ TIRANA, Albania - The Albanian government has announced that people will have to apply for a permit to go out for necessities following stricter measures to contain the virus outbreak. Prime Minister Edi Rama says people can apply online via e-albania.al or with a text message. Only one person per family may go out. The only shops open are those selling food, medicine and other basic items and people may only go out between 5 a.m. and 1 p.m. from Monday to Saturday.  No movement or business activity will be allowed from Saturday at 1 p.m. to Monday at 5 a.m., with police and military forces patrolling the streets. Albania has reported 186 cases of the new coronavirus with 10 deaths. ___ KATHMANDU, Nepal - Scores of tourists on the foothills of Mount Everest have been flown to safety days after being stranded on the only airstrip serving the world’s highest mountain. Dhurba Shrestha, an official at the Tenzing Hillary Airport in Lukla, says that 174 foreign tourists and four Nepali nationals left the mountain by air on Saturday in 12 small planes and two helicopters. The airport at Lukla, located at an altitude of 2,800 meters (9,184 feet), is the only airport in the Mount Everest region. Foreign embassies and local travel agents have been urging Nepal’s government to allow these rescue flights to the Everest region since the country imposed a lockdown last week. Nepal’s government has halted all flights and ground transportation, shutting down offices and shuttering businesses to control the spread of the coronavirus. Nepal has four confirmed cases including one person who has recovered. ___ ISLAMABAD - The foreign ministry says China is sending a plane containing medical personnel and supplies to aid Pakistan in the fight to contain the spread of COVID-19.  Pakistan is a key link in China’s ambitious multi-billion dollar, one-road project linking South and Central Asia to China.  China is also a key military supplier for Pakistan, having supplied the country with missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.  Pakistan currently has 1,321 confirmed cases, 10 deaths and 23 patients who have recovered. Most of the infected people returned from Iran where the confirmed cases are more than 30,000 with more than 2,300 deaths. ___ BERLIN - Chancellor Angela Merkel’s chief of staff says Germany won’t loosen its restrictions on public life before April 20. German authorities closed non-essential shops and banned gatherings of more than two people in public at the beginning of the week. Schools, bars, restaurants and clubs are also closed. Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told Saturday’s edition of the daily Tagesspiegel that “we are not going to talk about any easing before April 20 – until then, all measures will remain in place.” He said that officials will say “in a timely manner before then” what will happen after that date. Braun said that “the older and the sick will have to reduce their contacts for significantly longer.” Germany has recorded more than 50,000 cases of the new coronavirus, according to a tally by John Hopkins University, with 351 deaths - a lower death rate than in many other countries. ___ COLOMBO, Sri Lanka - Sri Lanka police say they have arrested thousands, including many who were praying in a mosque, for violating a countrywide curfew imposed as a part of stringent measures designed to contain the spread of coronavirus. The number of positive cases has risen to 106 and the government has ordered police to strictly impose the curfew to ensure social distancing across the country. On a tip that a group of people were praying in a mosque in the town of Horowpathana, about 124 miles (200 kilometers) north of Capital Colombo, police and health officials went to the mosque and arrested 18 while several dozens have fled. The government has banned nonessential travel. Police have arrested 4,600 and seized 1,125 vehicles for violating curfew since March 20. ___ UNITED NATIONS - The United Nations says 86 staff members around the world have reported cases of COVID-19. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said most of the infected staff members are in Europe, but there are also staffers in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the United States that have the coronavirus. To try to reduce transmission, he said the vast majority of U.N. staffers are working from home. At U.N. headquarters in New York, where a normal day would see staffers’ passes swiped 11,000 times, the number of swipes Friday morning stood at 140, Dujarric said. In Geneva, he said, the number of staff at the U.N. office has dropped from around 4,000 people on a regular day to just about 70 on Thursday. In Vienna, more than 97% of U.N. staff are now working remotely, he said. And, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 99% of staff are working from home. ___ UNITED NATIONS - The 191 parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty have decided to postpone a conference to review its implementation because of the coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations said Friday. The treaty is considered the cornerstone of global efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and the parties hold a major conference every five years to discuss how it is working. The meeting had been scheduled for April 27-May 22 at U.N. headquarters in New York. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the review conference will be held “as soon as the circumstances permit, but no later than April 2021.” The U.N. said earlier this week that the conference was likely to be postponed, but the conference president-designate, Ambassador Gustavo Zlauvinen of Argentina, wanted to consult governments that are parties to the treaty. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which reached its 50th anniversary March 5, is credited with preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to dozens of nations. It has succeeded in doing this via a grand global bargain: Nations without nuclear weapons committed not to acquire them; those with them committed to move toward their elimination; and all endorsed everyone’s right to develop peaceful nuclear energy.

"BERLIN (AP) - The number of confirmed coronavirus infections worldwide topped 600,000 on Saturday as new cases stacked up quickly in Europe and the United States and officials dug in for a long fight against the pandemic. The latest landmark came only two days after the world passed half a million infections, according to a tally by John Hopkins University, showing that much work remains to be done to slow the spread of the virus. It showed more than 602,000 cases and a total of over 27,000 deaths. While the U.S. now leads the world in reported infections - with more than 104,000 cases - five countries exceed its roughly 1,700 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France.  “We cannot completely prevent infections at this stage, but we can and must in the immediate future achieve fewer new infections per day, a slower spread,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is in quarantine at home after her doctor tested positive for the virus, told her compatriots in an audio message. “That will decide whether our health system can stand up to the virus.” The virus already has put health systems in Italy, Spain and France under extreme strain. Lockdowns of varying severity have been introduced across Europe. Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, said that Germany - where authorities closed nonessential shops and banned gatherings of more than two in public - won’t relax its restrictions before April 20. As the epicenter has shifted westward, the situation has calmed in China, where some restrictions on people’s lives have now been lifted. Six subway lines restored limited service in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, after the city had its official coronavirus risk evaluation downgraded from high to medium on Friday. Five districts of the city of 11 million people had other restrictions on travel loosened after their risk factor was downgraded to low. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and lead to death. More than 130,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins’ tally. In one way or another, the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak have been felt by the powerful and the poor alike. On Friday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first leader of a major country to test positive for the virus. He said he would continue to work from self-quarantine. Countries are still scrambling bring home some citizens stranded abroad by border closures and a near-shutdown of flights. On Saturday, 174 foreign tourists and four Nepali nationals on the foothills of Mount Everest were flown out days after being stranded on the only airstrip serving the world’s highest mountain. In neighboring India, authorities sent a fleet of buses to the outskirts of the capital to meet an exodus of migrant workers desperately trying to reach their home villages during the world’s largest lockdown. Thousands of people, mostly young male day laborers but also families, had fled their New Delhi homes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown that began on Wednesday and effectively put millions of Indians who live off daily earnings out of work. In a possibly hopeful sign, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared a new rapid test from Abbott Laboratories, which the company says can detect the coronavirus in about 5 minutes. Medical device maker Abbott announced the emergency clearance of its cartridge-based test Friday night, saying the test delivers a negative result in 13 minutes when the virus is not detected. While New York remained the worst-hit city in the U.S., Americans braced for worsening conditions elsewhere, with worrisome infection numbers being reported in New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit.  New Orleans’ sprawling Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, along the Mississippi River, was being converted into a massive hospital as officials prepared for thousands more patients than they could accommodate.  In New York, where there are more than 44,000 cases statewide, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 passed 6,000 on Friday, double what it had been three days earlier. Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for 4,000 more temporary beds across New York City, where the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center has already been converted into a hospital.  The struggle to defeat the virus will take “weeks and weeks and weeks,” Cuomo told members of the National Guard working at the Javits Center.  President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act on Friday, ordering General Motors to begin manufacturing ventilators. Trump had previously rejected Cuomo’s pleas for tens of thousands more of the machines and the governor’s calls to implement the Korean War-era production law.  Trump signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package, after the House approved the sweeping measure by voice vote. Lawmakers in both parties lined up behind the law to send checks to millions of Americans, boost unemployment benefits, help businesses and toss a life preserver to an overwhelmed health care system. Dr. John Brooks of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans remained “in the acceleration phase” of the pandemic and that all corners of the country were at risk. “There is no geographic part of the United States that is spared from this,” he said.  ___ Sedensky reported from Philadelphia.

"BERLIN (AP) - The number of confirmed coronavirus infections worldwide topped 600,000 on Saturday as new cases stacked up quickly in Europe and the United States and officials dug in for a long fight against the pandemic. The latest landmark came only two days after the world passed half a million infections, according to a tally by John Hopkins University, showing that much work remains to be done to slow the spread of the virus. It showed more than 607,000 cases and a total of over 28,000 deaths. While the U.S. now leads the world in reported infections - with more than 104,000 cases - five countries exceed its roughly 1,700 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France.  “We cannot completely prevent infections at this stage, but we can and must in the immediate future achieve fewer new infections per day, a slower spread,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is in quarantine at home after her doctor tested positive for the virus, told her compatriots in an audio message. “That will decide whether our health system can stand up to the virus.” The virus already has put health systems in Italy, Spain and France under extreme strain. Lockdowns of varying severity have been introduced across Europe, nearly emptying streets in normally bustling cities, including Paris where drone photos showed the city’s landmarks eerily deserted.  Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, said that Germany - where authorities closed nonessential shops and banned gatherings of more than two in public - won’t relax its restrictions before April 20. Spain, where stay-at-home restrictions have been in place for nearly two weeks, reported 832 more deaths on Saturday, its highest daily total yet, bringing its total to 5,690. Another 8,000 confirmed infections pushed that count above 72,000. Doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers in its worst-hit regions are falling ill at an alarming rate and working nonstop. More than 9,000 health workers in the country have been infected. “We are completely overwhelmed,” said ambulance medic Pablo Rojo at Barcelona’s Dos de Maig hospital. “Seven or eight (patients transported today) and all with COVID-19. … And the average age is decreasing. They’re not 80 years old anymore, they are now 30 and 40 years old.” “Sometimes you become a bit paranoid, you don’t know any more when you pick up the phone if you have cleaned your hands, if you’ve sanitized them or not. You touch your face with your hands,” Rojo said. Spain has struggled to get coronavirus tests and protective gear for health workers. The government has started flights to transport the supplies directly from China to reduce waiting times.  As the epicenter has shifted westward, the situation has calmed in China, where some restrictions on people’s lives have now been lifted. Six subway lines restored limited service in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, after the city had its official coronavirus risk evaluation downgraded from high to medium on Friday. Five districts of the city of 11 million people had other restrictions on travel loosened after their risk factor was downgraded to low. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and lead to death. More than 130,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins’ tally. In one way or another, the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak have been felt by the powerful and the poor alike. On Friday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first leader of a major country to test positive for the virus. He said he would continue to work from self-quarantine. Countries are still scrambling bring home some citizens stranded abroad by border closures and a near-shutdown of flights. On Saturday, 174 foreign tourists and four Nepali nationals on the foothills of Mount Everest were flown out days after being stranded on the only airstrip serving the world’s highest mountain. In neighboring India, authorities sent a fleet of buses to the outskirts of the capital to meet an exodus of migrant workers desperately trying to reach their home villages during the world’s largest lockdown. Thousands of people had fled their New Delhi homes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown that began on Wednesday and effectively put millions of Indians who live off daily earnings out of work. In parts of Africa, virus prevention measures have taken a violent turn as countries impose lockdowns and curfews or seal off major cities, with police in Kenya firing tear gas and officers elsewhere captured in mobile phone footage whacking people with batons. In the United States, New York remained the worst-hit city, but Americans braced for worsening conditions elsewhere, with worrisome infection numbers being reported in New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit.  New Orleans’ sprawling Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, along the Mississippi River, was being converted into a massive hospital as officials prepared for thousands more patients than they could accommodate.  In New York, where there are more than 44,000 cases statewide, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 passed 6,000 on Friday, double what it had been three days earlier. Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for 4,000 more temporary beds across New York City, where the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center has already been converted into a hospital.  The struggle to defeat the virus will take “weeks and weeks and weeks,” Cuomo told members of the National Guard working at the Javits Center.  President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act on Friday, ordering General Motors to begin manufacturing ventilators.

"BOSTON (AP) - Two colleges in Boston are marking the end of Women’s History Month with an open event to update and enhance the Wikipedia entries of several female activists. “Digitizing Women’s History: Wikipedia Edit-a-thon” is being hosted by Simmons University and Wentworth Institute of Technology on Tuesday. The event is part of the Digitizing Women’s History series that marks the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which prohibited voter discrimination based on sex. Participants can help make women’s history more visible on the internet by writing and editing Wikipedia entries, particularly those of suffrage and civil rights activists and women of color.  “We know this is a difficult time for many in our community, and we’ve been working hard to transition this event online and make it a fun and educational experience for participants,” said Laura R. Prieto, chair in public humanities at Simmons. The event is open to the public and no experience editing Wikipedia entries is required. Students, faculty, librarians and experts from Simmons, Wentworth and Northeastern University will be available to provide support. “This virtual event will enable students and members of the community to learn about and share stories of powerful activists and other historical figures,” said Allison Lange, an assistant professor at Wentworth. Ideas for articles to write and edit can be found on the Women’s Suffrage and Civil Rights Edit-a-thon dashboard.

"Tom Coburn’s reputation preceded him throughout the Capitol — a cantankerous trouble-maker who was tough to work with, and more interested in blowing things up than getting things done. And that reputation was completely wrong, just about everyone who ended up working with him came to quickly realize. Mr. Coburn, a medical doctor turned politician died Saturday morning at age 72 after a lengthy battle with cancer, according to his family, leaving one of the most substantial legacies in recent congressional history. With a single amendment to a bill in 2010, he saved the government $262 billion, and counting. He made a cottage industry out of spotting ridiculous-sounding spending items, such as the so-called “Bridge to Nowhere” project in Alaska. His investigative work brought down the largest Social Security disability fraud ring in history. And to those who knew him best, the virtuoso legislative abilities were, if anything, exceeded by the decency of the man. “I never met another politician like him. His honesty, devotion to facts and reason, his strength, his intellect, and his genuine warmth will always be with me. His true friendship will be a gift I will treasure forever,” said Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to President Clinton who got to know Mr. Coburn while working on a commission to cut the deficit. “At weekly staff meetings Dr. Coburn shared a word of the day-the one that stands out is ‘impact,’” said Joelle Cannon, a long-time staffer. “Dr. Coburn did not have to wonder if his life had meaning or impact. He was more devoted to the person than he was the policy, and because of that, he changed each of our lives significantly.” Mr. Coburn’s family released a statement announcing his death, and said a memorial service will be announced later. “Because of his strong faith, he rested in the hope found in John chapter 11 verse 25 where Jesus said, ‘I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, will live, even though they die.’ Today he lives in heaven,” the family said. Former colleagues remarked on Mr. Coburn’s religious faith, and his dedication to his priorities. “Dr. Coburn will be remembered by many around the country for his work in Congress, but in Oklahoma, he will be remembered as a physician, a Sunday School teacher, and a mentor. He delivered over 4,000 babies and cared for thousands of moms in Muskogee,” said Sen. James Lankford, who succeeded Mr. Coburn in the Senate. “Tom Coburn was a special, special man,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican. “He was a Christian and a father and a husband, and all of those identities were much more important to him than where he got his paycheck.” Mr. Coburn won election as part of the GOP sweep in 1994, capturing a Democrat-held seat. He served three terms, then left in keeping with his term limit pledge. When he left, the seat was promptly won back by Democrats. Four years later he sought Oklahoma’s open Senate seat. GOP leaders worked against him in the primary but he won, then in the general election beat Rep. Brad Carson, the Democrat who’d taken over his House seat. Alan Frumin, who was parliamentarian in the Senate for most of Coburn’s tenure, said after Coburn was elected but before he took his seat in 2005, people came to his office and warned of the impending storm. He was prickly and tough to work with, the story went. “Suffice to say it, they were wrong,” Mr. Frumin says. “We developed such respect for his way of doing business, and respect morphed into affection, and I say that as somebody who, he certainly put us through our paces,” Mr. Frumin said. “He was dogged, he was thorough, and he was good to his word on everything. he was a force to be reckoned with.” Setting aside the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who literally wrote the book on the history of the Senate, Mr. Coburn was in a class of his own when it came to learning and deploying the chamber’s rules. Few senators bother to pay attention to them, and of those that do, some delegate to their staff, while others learn it all themselves. Mr. Coburn did both. Duplication By his own measure, Mr. Coburn failed in 2010, when the Senate was debating yet another debt limit increase and he came to the floor with an amendment demanding $120 billion in cuts. He figured there was at least enough duplication in government that agencies should be able to sweat that much out. Democrats who controlled the chamber resisted, and so did some Republicans. Mr. Coburn settled for a study, with Congress ordering the Government Accountability Office to produce a report looking at redundancies. Yet that failure may be the single most successful act of budget-cutting decades. That GOA study became known as the Duplication Report, a yearly page-turner of government redundancies that as of last year had saved the government $262 billion — “and counting,” says Gene Dodaro, who as comptroller general is head of the GAO. GAO’s duplication web page has been viewed more than 280,000, while the PDFs of the reports themselves have more than 165,000 views, and has been downloaded nearly 45,000 times. When the next report comes out this spring, the $262 billion figure will be even higher. “The gift that keeps on giving, and it will for a long time,” Mr. Dodaro said. One of Mr. Coburn’s principles drilled into staff was that they shouldn’t be afraid to fight and lose. Sometimes you won the war by losing a few choice battles. But they were also drilled to always treat legislative opponents with respect, to try to find common ground, and to outwork everyone else. His staff figures it wrote more than 1,000 amendments to cut spending during his 10 years in the Senate. Most of them were easily defeated or, more often, never even got a vote. One of those failures was the Bridge to Nowhere, a span that was to be built to reach Gravina Island, with a permanent population of perhaps 50. Alaska’s congressional delegation inserted an “earmark” into a bill directing $223 million in federal money to project, saying the bridge was needed to replace a less reliable ferry service. After Hurricane Katrina slammed the Gulf Coast, Mr. Coburn called on Congress to cut the bridge money and use it to rebuild a bridge in Louisiana. His amendment was crushed, 82-15. But the bridge was never built. He had made it too toxic, and several years later then-Gov. Sarah Palin canceled the project, saying the money would be used elsewhere. Earmarks would also never recover from the bad press, and by 2011 they were eliminated, with the arrival of a new GOP majority in the House. Top wastewatcher Mr. Coburn made “shrimp on a treadmill” famous, when he highlighted a federally funded science research project that involved running shrimp on a specially-built treadmill designed to test how shrimp absorbed oxygen under stress. When a video of the shrimp surfaced, Mr. Coburn pounced, dubbing it a waste of taxpayer money. The Washington Times reached out to the study author, who didn’t respond. Another time Mr. Coburn challenged the Social Security disability of a man who lived as an “adult baby,” sleeping in diapers in an adult-sized crib and collecting government benefits even though he admitted he had some computer and woodworking skills. One time when Democrats called a press conference to complain about him blocking a bill they wanted passed, he showed up and sat in the front row alongside the press.”I’m going to enjoy the festivities,” he told reporters. Mr. Coburn was also the chief sponsor of then-Sen. Barack Obama’s biggest legislative accomplishment, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006. Signed into law by President George W. Bush, at a signing ceremony Mr. Obama attended at the White House, the measure created USASpending.gov, which is still the best way to track government contracts and disbursements. Those who worked with Mr. Coburn said he was never cheap. He gave his best, and expected that of those around him. “I loved working with him. He actually made it easy to do so,” said Mr. Bowles, a former White House chief of staff to President Clinton, who would come to know Mr. Coburn as part of the deficit reduction panel that came to be known as the Bowles-Simpson Commission, after himself and co-chairman former Sen. Alan Simpson. The commission’s goal was grand — to come up with a deal that would set the government’s finances on solid footing. Mr. Coburn was an obvious choice to sit on it, since that had been his own goal since coming to Washington. “From day one he was completely transparent , honest and straight forward with me. But he didn’t just give me his trust, it was something I had to earn over time,” Mr. Bowles said. “But once he did feel confident that Al and I were as committed to real fiscal responsibility and reform as he was, he educated us, directed us and led us to ideas  and solutions we would never have found without his direction, guidance and expertise.” The outsider That’s not to say Mr. Coburn wasn’t willing to mix it up. Most freshman senators are content to lay low and get a feel for things. Some wait months before delivering their maiden speech on the floor. Mr. Coburn didn’t bother with a maiden speech. He just began blocking other senators’ bills. Within a few months of taking office, Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, said he’d put a “hold” on hundreds of pieces of legislation. Don Ritchie, emeritus historian for the Senate, says Mr. Coburn probably holds the all-time record for holds. “There have always been senators who marched to the beat of their own drums: John C. Calhoun, Charles Sumner, Robert La Follette, Huey Long, etc.,” Mr. Ritchie said. “Their obstructionist tactics at times goaded those in the center to take tougher stands. They’ve played important roles, but not much legislation would have passed if there had been many more of them.” Those who knew Mr. Coburn would say he would probably be content with the legislation he did block from passing. Many members of Congress, when they come to Washington, go through a transformation. For the first few years, when they talk about “We,” they usually mean their constituents back home. Eventually, when they say “We” they mean themselves and other members of Congress. Mr. Coburn didn’t succumb to that. He made a three-term pledge when he first ran for the House in 1994, and stuck to it, leaving the chamber after the 2000 election. When he ran for the Senate he imposed a two-term pledge on himself. He would end up staying just 10 years, leaving early because of his health. While in the capital he took pains to keep his ties to home — including continuing to deliver babies in his doctor’s practice. That sparked another of his fights against the D.C. establishment, after the Senate ethics committee ruled he was violating conflict-of-interest rules by holding an outside job. He then stopped taking payment, saying he would do it pro bono — but the committee rejected that plan, saying the hospital he worked at was for-profit, so it was still a conflict of interest. He ignored the committee and continued. A little known fact — Coburn also delivered future “American Idol” winner Carrie Underwood, according to a longtime aide.  ","Former Sen.

"SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Farmers and orchard owners nationwide are breathing a little easier this week as more H-2A workers will be able to cross the Mexican border. The U.S. State Department on Thursday expanded the number of foreign agricultural workers whose visa applications can be processed without an in-person interview, The Capital Press reported.  After suspending “non-essential” visa processing in Mexico because of the coronavirus outbreak, the agency said it would prioritize processing for returning H-2A workers whose visas expired within the last year by giving them an interview waiver. It then broadened those waivers to include new workers and returning workers whose visas had expired in the past 24 months. “We first went from thinking we had zero workers to having some workers,” Allison Crittenden, American Farm Bureau Federation director of congressional relations, said. Now, the bulk of the H-2A workforce should be able to come into the U.S., she said on Friday. “We are grateful we will have broader access to the H-2A work force than the first announcement (of limited waivers) suggested,” Crittenden said. H-2A workers in 2019 totaled 258,000, about 20% of the farm work force, and they are essential, she said, adding the other 80% of the farm work force is primarily documented and undocumented migrant workers.

"President Trump has notified Congress that he’ll exert “supervision” over a new special inspector general that Democrats demanded to monitor the administration’s emergency lending to distressed corporations in the $2 trillion coronavirus package. Shortly after Mr. Trump signed the rescue plan on Friday, the president issued a statement warning Congress that the new law “includes several provisions that raise constitutional concerns.” For example, the president took issue with a provision inserted by Democrats requiring the still-to-be nominated inspector general to report to Congress “without delay” whenever the administration refuses to provide information to the watchdog. “I do not understand, and my administration will not treat, this provision as permitting the [inspector general] to issue reports to the Congress without the presidential supervision required by the Take Care Clause, Article II, section 3,” Mr. Trump said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the president’s move but said it was “no surprise.” “Congress will exercise its oversight,” Mrs. Pelosi said on MSNBC. “And we will have our panel appointed by the House to, in real time, to make sure we know where those funds are going to be expended.” The administration created the $500 billion fund to provide loans to companies, states and localities reeling from the impact of the pandemic. Mr. Trump said he supports aid for airlines, cruise ship companies and probably hotels, in addition to others. Democrats only agreed to the overall package after the administration agreed to create the new inspector general’s office to provide oversight measures over the $500 billion fund.

Ms. Whitmer has criticized the administration for failing to supply the state with enough emergency medical supplies.

"DETROIT (AP) - As confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States led the world - with more than 105,000 infections - cities such as Detroit, Chicago and New Orleans grew as hotspots Saturday, while the virus continued to pummel New York City and also made its way into rural America.  In parts of Africa, meanwhile, virus prevention measures took a violent turn as countries imposed lockdowns and curfews or sealed off major cities, with police in Kenya firing tear gas and officers elsewhere captured on video hitting people with batons. Russia said its borders would be fully closed as of Monday.  The number of worldwide infections surpassed 620,000 with more than 28,000 deaths as new cases also stacked up quickly in Europe, according to a tally by John Hopkins University. While the U.S. now leads the world in reported cases, five countries exceed its roughly 1,700 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France.  New York remained the worst-hit U.S. city. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said defeating the virus will take “weeks and weeks and weeks.”  Cases also have been rising rapidly in cities such as Detroit, where poverty and poor health have been problems for years. The number of infections surged to 1,381, with 31 deaths recorded, as of noon Saturday. “At this time, the trajectory of Detroit is unfortunately even more steep than that of New York,” said Dr. Teena Chopra, the medical director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at the Detroit Medical Center.  “This is off the charts.” Chopra, who has worked in Detroit for more than 15 years, said many patients have ailments like asthma, heart disease, diabetes and hypertension. She also acknowledged that in Detroit, one of the nation’s largest African American cities, there is a distrust among some in the community of the medical system and government due to systemic racism. “In Detroit, we are seeing a lot of patients that are presenting to us with severe disease, rather than minor disease,” said Chopra, who worried it will be hit with a “tsunami” of patients. President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan, providing additional money to address the outbreak. He also has done the same for such states as New York, Louisiana and Illinois. The virus already is straining health systems in Italy, Spain and France. Lockdowns of varying severity have been introduced across Europe, nearly emptying streets in normally bustling cities, including Paris where drone photos showed landmarks eerily deserted. German Chancellor Angela Merkel appealed to her country, which has experienced fewer deaths compared with some neighboring countries, to “be patient.” Her chief of staff said Germany - where authorities closed nonessential shops and banned public gatherings of more than two - won’t relax its restrictions before April 20. Spain, where stay-at-home restrictions have been in place for nearly two weeks, reported 832 more deaths Saturday, its highest daily count yet, bringing its total to 5,690.  Another 8,000 confirmed infections pushed that count above 72,000. But Spain’s director of emergencies, Fernando Simón, saw hope in that the rate of infection is slowing and figures “indicate that the outbreak is stabilizing and may be reaching its peak in some areas.” Doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers in Spain’s worst-hit regions are working nonstop and falling ill at an alarming rate. More than 9,000 health workers in the country have been infected. “We are completely overwhelmed,” said paramedic Pablo Rojo at Barcelona’s Dos de Maig hospital. “Seven or eight (patients transported today) and all with COVID-19. … And the average age is decreasing. They’re not 80 years old anymore, they are now 30 and 40 years old.” Spain has struggled to get coronavirus tests and protective gear for health workers. The government has started flights to transport the supplies directly from China to reduce waiting times.  As the epicenter has shifted westward, the situation has calmed in China, where some restrictions have been lifted. Six subway lines restored limited service in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, after the city had its virus risk evaluation downgraded from high to medium. Five districts of the city of 11 million people had other travel restrictions loosened after their risk factor was reduced to low. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and lead to death. More than 135,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins. The effects of the outbreak have been felt by the powerful and the poor alike. As British Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first leader of a major country to test positive for the virus, another member of his cabinet also developed symptoms, as the number of people in the U.K. who have died for the illness passed the 1,000 mark. Johnson is being accused of failing to follow his own self-distancing rules, though he says he is in self-quarantine now. Countries are still scrambling bring home some citizens stranded abroad by border closures and a near-shutdown of flights. On Saturday, 174 foreign tourists and four Nepali nationals in the foothills of Mount Everest were flown out days after being stranded at the only airstrip serving the world’s highest mountain. In neighboring India, authorities sent buses to the outskirts of the capital to meet an exodus of migrant workers desperately trying to reach their home villages amid the world’s largest lockdown. Thousands had fled their New Delhi homes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown that began Wednesday and effectively put millions out of work. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has ordered his country’s borders fully closed as of Monday, following increasingly stringent restrictions imposed recently. International passenger flights were halted Friday. The order excepts diplomats as well as residents of the Kaliningrad exclave who must cross through another country to enter the rest of Russia. Trump invoked the Defense Production Act on Friday, ordering General Motors to begin manufacturing ventilators.  Trump signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package, after the House approved the sweeping measure by voice vote. It will send checks to millions of Americans, boost unemployment benefits, help businesses and toss a life preserver to an overwhelmed health care system. Dr. John Brooks of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that Americans remained “in the acceleration phase” of the pandemic and that all corners of the country are at risk. “There is no geographic part of the United States that is spared from this,” he said. ___ Irvine reported from Chicago.

"Tom Coburn’s reputation preceded him throughout the Capitol — a cantankerous trouble-maker who was tough to work with, and more interested in blowing things up than getting things done. And that reputation was completely wrong, just about everyone who ended up working with him came to quickly realize. Mr. Coburn, a medical doctor turned politician died Saturday morning at age 72 after a lengthy battle with cancer, according to his family, leaving one of the most substantial legacies in recent congressional history. With a single amendment to a bill in 2010, he saved the government $262 billion, and counting. He made a cottage industry out of spotting ridiculous-sounding spending items, such as the so-called “Bridge to Nowhere” project in Alaska. His investigative work brought down the largest Social Security disability fraud ring in history. And to those who knew him best, the virtuoso legislative abilities were, if anything, exceeded by the decency of the man. “I never met another politician like him. His honesty, devotion to facts and reason, his strength, his intellect, and his genuine warmth will always be with me. His true friendship will be a gift I will treasure forever,” said Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to President Clinton who got to know Mr. Coburn while working on a commission to cut the deficit. “At weekly staff meetings Dr. Coburn shared a word of the day-the one that stands out is ‘impact,’” said Joelle Cannon, a long-time staffer. “Dr. Coburn did not have to wonder if his life had meaning or impact. He was more devoted to the person than he was the policy, and because of that, he changed each of our lives significantly.” Mr. Coburn’s family released a statement announcing his death, and said a memorial service will be announced later. “Because of his strong faith, he rested in the hope found in John chapter 11 verse 25 where Jesus said, ‘I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, will live, even though they die.’ Today he lives in heaven,” the family said. Former colleagues remarked on Mr. Coburn’s religious faith, and his dedication to his priorities. “Dr. Coburn will be remembered by many around the country for his work in Congress, but in Oklahoma, he will be remembered as a physician, a Sunday School teacher, and a mentor. He delivered over 4,000 babies and cared for thousands of moms in Muskogee,” said Sen. James Lankford, who succeeded Mr. Coburn in the Senate. “Tom Coburn was a special, special man,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican. “He was a Christian and a father and a husband, and all of those identities were much more important to him than where he got his paycheck.” Mr. Coburn won election as part of the GOP sweep in 1994, capturing a Democrat-held seat. He served three terms, then left in keeping with his term limit pledge. When he left, the seat was promptly won back by Democrats. Four years later he sought Oklahoma’s open Senate seat. GOP leaders worked against him in the primary but he won, then in the general election beat Rep. Brad Carson, the Democrat who’d taken over his House seat. Alan Frumin, who was parliamentarian in the Senate for most of Coburn’s tenure, said after Coburn was elected but before he took his seat in 2005, people came to his office and warned of the impending storm. He was prickly and tough to work with, the story went. “Suffice to say it, they were wrong,” Mr. Frumin says. “We developed such respect for his way of doing business, and respect morphed into affection, and I say that as somebody who, he certainly put us through our paces,” Mr. Frumin said. “He was dogged, he was thorough, and he was good to his word on everything. he was a force to be reckoned with.” Setting aside the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who literally wrote the book on the history of the Senate, Mr. Coburn was in a class of his own when it came to learning and deploying the chamber’s rules. Few senators bother to pay attention to them, and of those that do, some delegate to their staff, while others learn it all themselves. Mr. Coburn did both. Duplication By his own measure, Mr. Coburn failed in 2010, when the Senate was debating yet another debt limit increase and he came to the floor with an amendment demanding $120 billion in cuts. He figured there was at least enough duplication in government that agencies should be able to sweat that much out. Democrats who controlled the chamber resisted, and so did some Republicans. Mr. Coburn settled for a study, with Congress ordering the Government Accountability Office to produce a report looking at redundancies. Yet that failure may be the single most successful act of budget-cutting decades. That GOA study became known as the Duplication Report, a yearly page-turner of government redundancies that as of last year had saved the government $262 billion — “and counting,” says Gene Dodaro, who as comptroller general is head of the GAO. GAO’s duplication web page has been viewed more than 280,000, while the PDFs of the reports themselves have more than 165,000 views, and has been downloaded nearly 45,000 times. When the next report comes out this spring, the $262 billion figure will be even higher. “The gift that keeps on giving, and it will for a long time,” Mr. Dodaro said. One of Mr. Coburn’s principles drilled into staff was that they shouldn’t be afraid to fight and lose. Sometimes you won the war by losing a few choice battles. But they were also drilled to always treat legislative opponents with respect, to try to find common ground, and to outwork everyone else. His staff figures it wrote more than 1,000 amendments to cut spending during his 10 years in the Senate. Most of them were easily defeated or, more often, never even got a vote. One of those failures was the Bridge to Nowhere, a span that was to be built to reach Gravina Island, with a permanent population of perhaps 50. Alaska’s congressional delegation inserted an “earmark” into a bill directing $223 million in federal money to project, saying the bridge was needed to replace a less reliable ferry service. After Hurricane Katrina slammed the Gulf Coast, Mr. Coburn called on Congress to cut the bridge money and use it to rebuild a bridge in Louisiana. His amendment was crushed, 82-15. But the bridge was never built. He had made it too toxic, and several years later then-Gov. Sarah Palin canceled the project, saying the money would be used elsewhere. Earmarks would also never recover from the bad press, and by 2011 they were eliminated, with the arrival of a new GOP majority in the House. Top wastewatcher Mr. Coburn made “shrimp on a treadmill” famous, when he highlighted a federally funded science research project that involved running shrimp on a specially-built treadmill designed to test how shrimp absorbed oxygen under stress. When a video of the shrimp surfaced, Mr. Coburn pounced, dubbing it a waste of taxpayer money. The Washington Times reached out to the study author, who didn’t respond. Another time Mr. Coburn challenged the Social Security disability of a man who lived as an “adult baby,” sleeping in diapers in an adult-sized crib and collecting government benefits even though he admitted he had some computer and woodworking skills. One time when Democrats called a press conference to complain about him blocking a bill they wanted passed, he showed up and sat in the front row alongside the press.”I’m going to enjoy the festivities,” he told reporters. Mr. Coburn was also the chief sponsor of then-Sen. Barack Obama’s biggest legislative accomplishment, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006. Signed into law by President George W. Bush, at a signing ceremony Mr. Obama attended at the White House, the measure created USASpending.gov, which is still the best way to track government contracts and disbursements. Those who worked with Mr. Coburn said he was never cheap. He gave his best, and expected that of those around him. “I loved working with him. He actually made it easy to do so,” said Mr. Bowles, a former White House chief of staff to President Clinton, who would come to know Mr. Coburn as part of the deficit reduction panel that came to be known as the Bowles-Simpson Commission, after himself and co-chairman former Sen. Alan Simpson. The commission’s goal was grand — to come up with a deal that would set the government’s finances on solid footing. Mr. Coburn was an obvious choice to sit on it, since that had been his own goal since coming to Washington. “From day one he was completely transparent , honest and straight forward with me. But he didn’t just give me his trust, it was something I had to earn over time,” Mr. Bowles said. “But once he did feel confident that Al and I were as committed to real fiscal responsibility and reform as he was, he educated us, directed us and led us to ideas  and solutions we would never have found without his direction, guidance and expertise.” The outsider That’s not to say Mr. Coburn wasn’t willing to mix it up. Most freshman senators are content to lay low and get a feel for things. Some wait months before delivering their maiden speech on the floor. Mr. Coburn didn’t bother with a maiden speech. He just began blocking other senators’ bills. Within a few months of taking office, Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, said he’d put a “hold” on hundreds of pieces of legislation. Don Ritchie, emeritus historian for the Senate, says Mr. Coburn probably holds the all-time record for holds. “There have always been senators who marched to the beat of their own drums: John C. Calhoun, Charles Sumner, Robert La Follette, Huey Long, etc.,” Mr. Ritchie said. “Their obstructionist tactics at times goaded those in the center to take tougher stands. They’ve played important roles, but not much legislation would have passed if there had been many more of them.” Those who knew Mr. Coburn would say he would probably be content with the legislation he did block from passing. Many members of Congress, when they come to Washington, go through a transformation. For the first few years, when they talk about “We,” they usually mean their constituents back home. Eventually, when they say “We” they mean themselves and other members of Congress. Mr. Coburn didn’t succumb to that. He made a three-term pledge when he first ran for the House in 1994, and stuck to it, leaving the chamber after the 2000 election. When he ran for the Senate he imposed a two-term pledge on himself. He would end up staying just 10 years, leaving early because of his health. While in the capital he took pains to keep his ties to home — including continuing to deliver babies in his doctor’s practice. That sparked another of his fights against the D.C. establishment, after the Senate ethics committee ruled he was violating conflict-of-interest rules by holding an outside job. He then stopped taking payment, saying he would do it pro bono — but the committee rejected that plan, saying the hospital he worked at was for-profit, so it was still a conflict of interest. He ignored the committee and continued. A little known fact — Coburn also delivered future “American Idol” winner Carrie Underwood, according to a longtime aide.  ","Former Sen.

"President Trump said Saturday he may announce a mandated quarantine on New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut. The quarantine would restrict people from leaving the Northeast. The news comes after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told the president in a phone call Saturday that people infected with COVID 19 are traveling to his state, refusing to shelter in place. “Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it’s a hotspot — New York, New Jersey maybe one or two other places, certain parts of Connecticut quarantined. I’m thinking about that right now. We might not have to do it but there’s a possibility that sometime today we’ll do a quarantine — short term — two weeks for New York, probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut,” the president told reporters. “I’d rather not do it, but we might need it,” he added. The president clarified the New York subway would not be shutdown. He also said trade would not be impacted. “We’ll be announcing that one way or the other, fairly soon. This does not apply to people, such as truckers, from outside the New York area,” he said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reportedly questioned how the president would legally enforce such an order, according to The New York Times. The president made his comments as he was going to Joint Base Andrews, as he will be seeing the U.S. Navy hospital ship Comfort off as it heads to New York. It is expected to arrive Monday to help alleviate hospitals that are treating a number of patients ill with the coronavirus. Mr. Cuomo said data suggests his state would need 140,000 hospital beds and 30,000 ventilators. He stressed the need for more ventilators, saying they are key when treating patients suffering from COVID-19. “We are planning for that worst-case scenario,” he told reporters. Mr. Cuomo is also asking pharmacies in his state to deliver medications free of charge in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. He also told reporters hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being administered to patients in New York and he will have results on that soon.

"DETROIT (AP) - As the United States led the world with confirmed coronavirus cases, cities such as Detroit, Chicago and New Orleans grew as hotspots Saturday, while the virus continued to pummel New York City and made its way into rural America.  Elsewhere, Russia said its borders would be fully closed as of Monday, while in parts of Africa, pandemic prevention measures took a violent turn, with Kenyan police firing tear gas and officers elsewhere seen on video hitting people with batons. Worldwide infections surpassed 640,000 with nearly 30,000 deaths as new cases also stacked up quickly in Europe, according to a tally by John Hopkins University. The U.S. leads the world in reported cases with more than 112,000, but five countries exceed its roughly 1,700 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France. Italy alone now has 10,023 deaths, the most of any country. New York remained the worst-hit U.S. city. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said defeating the virus will take “weeks and weeks and weeks.” The U.N. donated 250,000 protective face masks to the city and Cuomo delayed state’s presidential primary from April 28 to June 23. But Cuomo said he knew nothing of President Donald Trump’s suggestion of some kind of quarantine for New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, all hit hard by the coronavirus.  The federal government generally does not have the power to impose such restrictions on states. Trump made the comments on his way to Norfolk, Virginia, to see off a U.S. Navy medical ship en route to New York City to help with the response there. Cases also have been rising rapidly in cities such as Detroit, where poverty and poor health have been problems for years. The number of infections surged to 1,381, with 31 deaths recorded, as of noon Saturday. “At this time, the trajectory of Detroit is unfortunately even more steep than that of New York,” said Dr. Teena Chopra, the medical director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at the Detroit Medical Center.  “This is off the charts,” she said. Chopra, who has worked in Detroit for more than 15 years, said many patients have ailments like asthma, heart disease, diabetes and hypertension. She also acknowledged that in Detroit, one of the nation’s largest African American cities, there is a distrust among some in the community of the medical system and government due to systemic racism. “In Detroit, we are seeing a lot of patients that are presenting to us with severe disease, rather than minor disease,” said Chopra, who worried about a “tsunami” of patients. Louisiana has surpassed 2,700 infections, with 119 residents dead from COVID-19 - an increase of 36 fatalities from a day earlier, according to the health department. Gov. John Bel Edwards said Louisiana has the third-highest rate of cases per capita and the second-highest death rate per capita, with the region on track to run out of ventilators by the first week of April. Officials urged residents and businesses to donate protective gear such as masks, gloves and face shields at New Orleans’ fire stations. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis worried that people would flee New Orleans, and he ordered anyone arriving from Louisiana to self-quarantine. He said the Florida Highway Patrol and sheriff’s deputies will set up checkpoints to screen cars from Louisiana. Cases in Chicago and suburban Cook County accounted for about three-quarters of Illinois’ 3,026 total as of Friday. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot closed popular lakeshore parks Thursday after people failed to practice social distancing, despite a statewide shelter-at-home order. Trump approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan, providing money for the outbreak. He also has done the same for New York, Louisiana and Illinois. The governor of Kansas also issued a stay-at-home order to begin Monday, as the virus takes hold in more rural areas, where doctors worry about the lack of ICU beds. The virus is straining health systems in Italy, Spain and France. Lockdowns of varying severity have been introduced across Europe, nearly emptying streets in normally bustling cities. German Chancellor Angela Merkel appealed for patience from citizens. Germany has fewer deaths than some neighboring countries but still closed nonessential shops and banned public gatherings of more than two people, and Merkel’s chief of staff said the restrictions won’t be relaxed before April 20. Spain, where stay-at-home restrictions have been in place for nearly two weeks, reported 832 more deaths Saturday, its highest daily count yet, bringing its total to 5,690.  Another 8,000 confirmed infections pushed that count above 72,000. But Spain’s director of emergencies, Fernando Simón, saw hope in that the rate of infection is slowing and figures “indicate that the outbreak is stabilizing and may be reaching its peak in some areas.” Doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers in Spain’s worst-hit regions are working nonstop and falling ill at an alarming rate. More than 9,000 health workers in the country have been infected. “We are completely overwhelmed,” said paramedic Pablo Rojo at Barcelona’s Dos de Maig hospital. “Seven or eight (patients transported today) and all with COVID-19. … And the average age is decreasing. They’re not 80 years old anymore, they are now 30 and 40 years old.” Spain has struggled to get coronavirus tests and protective gear for health workers and has begun flights to carry the supplies directly from China.  As the epicenter has shifted westward, the situation has calmed in China, where some restrictions have been lifted. Some subway service was restored in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, after the city had its virus risk evaluation reduced from high to medium. Five districts of the city of 11 million people had other travel restrictions loosened after their risk factor was reduced to low. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and lead to death. More than 135,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins. Countries are still trying to bring home citizens stranded abroad. On Saturday, 174 foreign tourists and four Nepali nationals in the foothills of Mount Everest were flown out days after being stranded at the only airstrip serving the world’s highest mountain. Indian authorities sent buses to the outskirts of New Delhi to meet an exodus of migrant workers desperately trying to reach their home villages amid the world’s largest lockdown. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown that began Wednesday and effectively put millions out of work. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has ordered his country’s borders fully closed as of Monday. International passenger flights were halted Friday. The order exempts diplomats as well as residents of the Kaliningrad region who must cross through another country to enter the rest of Russia. Trump invoked the Defense Production Act on Friday, ordering General Motors to begin manufacturing ventilators. He also signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package approved by Congress that will send checks to millions of Americans, boost unemployment benefits, help businesses and toss a life preserver to an overwhelmed health care system. Dr. John Brooks of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that Americans remained “in the acceleration phase” of the pandemic. “There is no geographic part of the United States that is spared from this,” he said. The first death was reported Friday in the rural Michigan town of Cadillac, while numbers grew in Detroit, four hours to the south. Detroit’s homeless populations is especially vulnerable, officials said. “If any of these individuals got infected, it would be very easy to transmit it to other people without knowing,” said Chad Audi, executive director of the Detroit Rescue Mission, adding he has since opened two new facilities to accommodate an increase in clients and implemented new safety precautions. “But in no circumstances will we close our doors because these individuals don’t have any place to go. It’s very important to us.” ___ Irvine reported from Chicago.

"NEW ORLEANS — The coronavirus continued its steady march here Saturday, with a total of 3,315 cases in the state and the mayor trying to blame President Trump for not canceling Mardi Gras. As of noon on March 28, the Louisiana Department of Health reported 569 new cases in the past day and a death toll of 137 attributed to the virus that first infected humans in Wuhan, China, last year. Though the rate of infection increase remained close to 21%, that nevertheless marked a decline from just three days ago when Louisiana cases were jumping at 28% over the 24-hour periods tracked by the LDH. Gov. John Bel Edwards, who issued shelter-in-place orders for the state March 22, has repeatedly stressed that if Louisianan fails to curb the rate of increase the state could find itself short of ventilators and hospital beds in early April. A total of 927 patients were hospitalized statewide with the virus as of Saturday afternoon, with slightly more than one-third of them — 336 — requiring ventilators, the LDH reported. Those figures were increasing at a much faster rate than new infections. The state saw an increase of 14% in hospitalizations between March 26-27, but that increased to a 19% pace from March 27-28, according to the LDH. Similarly, the 24-hour percentage increase in those needing ventilation jumped from 13% of those hospitalized to 24%. Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy picked up on that theme Saturday morning, telling Fox News he believed a U.S. Navy hospital ship like the ones that have been sent to New York and Los Angeles harbors should be docked in the Port of New Orleans. The city remains the hardest hit part of the state, although by Friday there were confirmed coronavirus cases in 56 of Louisiana’s 64 parishes, according to the LDH. Experts have increasingly pointed to New Orleans‘ famous Carnival celebration as a source of virus spread, given the event attracts millions of visitors over a 3-week period before culminating this year in massive Mardi Gras celebrations on Feb. 25. For her part, New Orleans Democratic Mayor Latoya Cantrell went on CNN Friday and implied it was President Trump’s fault for not ordering the city to halt Mardi Gras.

Save lives.” On Friday, the president said he wanted governors to be “appreciative” of the administration’s efforts. “I tell him, ‘Mike, don’t call the governor of Washington, you’re wasting your time with him,’” Mr. Trump said. “Don’t call the woman in Michigan. It doesn’t make any difference in what happens. If they don’t treat you right, I don’t call.”  ",Trump approves coronavirus disaster declaration for Michigan,"Saturday, March 28, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/28/trump-approves-disaster-coronavirus-declaration-mi/,washington_times
"DETROIT (AP) - As the United States led the world with confirmed coronavirus cases, cities such as Detroit, Chicago and New Orleans grew as hotspots Saturday, while the virus continued to pummel New York City and made its way into rural America.  Elsewhere, Russia said its borders would be fully closed as of Monday, while in parts of Africa, pandemic prevention measures took a violent turn, with Kenyan police firing tear gas and officers elsewhere seen on video hitting people with batons. Worldwide infections surpassed 640,000 with nearly 30,000 deaths as new cases also stacked up quickly in Europe, according to a tally by John Hopkins University. The U.S. leads the world in reported cases with more than 112,000, but five countries exceed its roughly 1,700 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France. Italy alone now has 10,023 deaths, the most of any country. New York remained the worst-hit U.S. city. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said defeating the virus will take “weeks and weeks and weeks.” The U.N. donated 250,000 protective face masks to the city and Cuomo delayed state’s presidential primary from April 28 to June 23. But Cuomo said he knew nothing of President Donald Trump’s suggestion of some kind of quarantine for New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, all hit hard by the coronavirus.  The federal government generally does not have the power to impose such restrictions on states. Trump made the comments on his way to Norfolk, Virginia, to see off a U.S. Navy medical ship en route to New York City to help with the response there. Cases also have been rising rapidly in cities such as Detroit, where poverty and poor health have been problems for years. The number of infections surged to 1,381, with 31 deaths recorded, as of noon Saturday. “At this time, the trajectory of Detroit is unfortunately even more steep than that of New York,” said Dr. Teena Chopra, the medical director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at the Detroit Medical Center.  “This is off the charts,” she said. Chopra, who has worked in Detroit for more than 15 years, said many patients have ailments like asthma, heart disease, diabetes and hypertension. She also acknowledged that in Detroit, one of the nation’s largest African American cities, there is a distrust among some in the community of the medical system and government due to systemic racism. “In Detroit, we are seeing a lot of patients that are presenting to us with severe disease, rather than minor disease,” said Chopra, who worried about a “tsunami” of patients. Louisiana has surpassed 2,700 infections, with 119 residents dead from COVID-19 - an increase of 36 fatalities from a day earlier, according to the health department. Gov. John Bel Edwards said Louisiana has the third-highest rate of cases per capita and the second-highest death rate per capita, with the region on track to run out of ventilators by the first week of April. Officials urged residents and businesses to donate protective gear such as masks, gloves and face shields at New Orleans’ fire stations. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis worried that people would flee New Orleans, and he ordered anyone arriving from Louisiana to self-quarantine. He said the Florida Highway Patrol and sheriff’s deputies will set up checkpoints to screen cars from Louisiana. Cases in Chicago and suburban Cook County accounted for about three-quarters of Illinois’ 3,026 total as of Friday. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot closed popular lakeshore parks Thursday after people failed to practice social distancing, despite a statewide shelter-at-home order. Trump approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan, providing money for the outbreak. He also has done the same for New York, Louisiana and Illinois. The governor of Kansas also issued a stay-at-home order to begin Monday, as the virus takes hold in more rural areas, where doctors worry about the lack of ICU beds. The virus is straining health systems in Italy, Spain and France. Lockdowns of varying severity have been introduced across Europe, nearly emptying streets in normally bustling cities. German Chancellor Angela Merkel appealed for patience from citizens. Germany has fewer deaths than some neighboring countries but still closed nonessential shops and banned public gatherings of more than two people, and Merkel’s chief of staff said the restrictions won’t be relaxed before April 20. Spain, where stay-at-home restrictions have been in place for nearly two weeks, reported 832 more deaths Saturday, its highest daily count yet, bringing its total to 5,690.  Another 8,000 confirmed infections pushed that count above 72,000. But Spain’s director of emergencies, Fernando Simón, saw hope in that the rate of infection is slowing and figures “indicate that the outbreak is stabilizing and may be reaching its peak in some areas.” Doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers in Spain’s worst-hit regions are working nonstop and falling ill at an alarming rate. More than 9,000 health workers in the country have been infected. “We are completely overwhelmed,” said paramedic Pablo Rojo at Barcelona’s Dos de Maig hospital. “Seven or eight (patients transported today) and all with COVID-19. … And the average age is decreasing. They’re not 80 years old anymore, they are now 30 and 40 years old.” Spain has struggled to get coronavirus tests and protective gear for health workers and has begun flights to carry the supplies directly from China.  As the epicenter has shifted westward, the situation has calmed in China, where some restrictions have been lifted. Some subway service was restored in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, after the city had its virus risk evaluation reduced from high to medium. Five districts of the city of 11 million people had other travel restrictions loosened after their risk factor was reduced to low. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and lead to death. More than 135,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins. Countries are still trying to bring home citizens stranded abroad. On Saturday, 174 foreign tourists and four Nepali nationals in the foothills of Mount Everest were flown out days after being stranded at the only airstrip serving the world’s highest mountain. Indian authorities sent buses to the outskirts of New Delhi to meet an exodus of migrant workers desperately trying to reach their home villages amid the world’s largest lockdown. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown that began Wednesday and effectively put millions out of work. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has ordered his country’s borders fully closed as of Monday. International passenger flights were halted Friday. The order exempts diplomats as well as residents of the Kaliningrad region who must cross through another country to enter the rest of Russia. Trump invoked the Defense Production Act on Friday, ordering General Motors to begin manufacturing ventilators. He also signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package approved by Congress that will send checks to millions of Americans, boost unemployment benefits, help businesses and toss a life preserver to an overwhelmed health care system. Dr. John Brooks of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that Americans remained “in the acceleration phase” of the pandemic. “There is no geographic part of the United States that is spared from this,” he said. The first death was reported Friday in the rural Michigan town of Cadillac, while numbers grew in Detroit, four hours to the south. Detroit’s homeless populations is especially vulnerable, officials said. “If any of these individuals got infected, it would be very easy to transmit it to other people without knowing,” said Chad Audi, executive director of the Detroit Rescue Mission, adding he has since opened two new facilities to accommodate an increase in clients and implemented new safety precautions. “But in no circumstances will we close our doors because these individuals don’t have any place to go. It’s very important to us.” ___ Irvine reported from Chicago.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - A gun rights group is cheering the Trump administration’s designation of the firearms industry, including retailers, as part of the nation’s critical infrastructure during the coronavirus emergency. The designation by the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is advisory. The agency notes that the designation does not override determinations by individual jurisdictions of what they consider critical infrastructure sectors. The firearms industry was not part of the federal agency’s original list of critical infrastructure issued just over a week ago. The designation in an update released Saturday follows a brewing legal battle between gun rights groups and California officials. The group Gun Owners of America says in a statement Saturday that it is encouraged that the Trump administration is not ignoring what it calls “the ability to protect yourself” during the emergency stemming from the pandemic. Gun rights groups filed suit last Friday after the Los Angeles County sheriff closed gun stores in the wake of California Gov. Gavin Newsom saying that each of the state’s 58 counties could decide for themselves whether to list firearms dealers as nonessential businesses that should be subject to closure while the state seeks to limit the spread of the virus.  The lawsuit claims that the designation violates the Second Amendment, but officials cite a public health issue.

"PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) - U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released two immigration detainees from a facility in Massachusetts following a lawsuit that was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and immigration attorneys. A petition was filed Wednesday for the release of the two detainees with medical conditions that put them at a high risk for serious illness or death in the event of a COVID-19 infection, WCVB-TV reported. The ACLU filed the petition with Massachusetts-based attorneys Susan Church and Kerry Doyle. The ACLU released a statement Friday reporting that the detainees had been released and that the lawsuit was part of nationwide effort. According to the statement, there are similar lawsuits in Pennsylvania, California, Maryland, and Washington state. Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, said that ICE must take “immediate and drastic steps” towards reducing the population of detainees. “Public health experts have predicted that once outbreaks in detention centers begin, they will spread rapidly,” Rose said. “The same experts continue to advise that detention centers - as well as jails and prisons - must dramatically reduce their population for the safety of detained people, staff, and the communities they live in.” The U.S. holds around 37,000 people in immigration detention. Detainees and advocates say many are vulnerable because of age and preexisting medical conditions, and because they are often held in open rooms, beds 3-feet apart, and without adequate supplies of masks or other protections. Civil rights groups also filed a class-action lawsuit to have all immigration detainees released from the Bristol County House of Corrections in Dartmouth. Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson described the suit as “completely frivolous.”  ",ICE releases 2 detainees for health concerns,"Saturday, March 28, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/28/ice-releases-2-detainees-for-health-concerns/,washington_times
"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Gun rights activists filed a lawsuit against a North Carolina sheriff who temporarily halted handgun permits amid a surge of interest during the coronavirus outbreak.  The lawsuit against Wake County Sheriff Gerald Baker was filed Friday in federal court by Grass Roots North Carolina, one of its members, the Second Amendment Foundation and Firearms Policy Coalition.  The lawsuit asks a judge to force Baker to start issuing pistol permits again, arguing that state law requires him to process the permits. Under normal circumstances, a sheriff can deny an individual application for certain reasons, but state law doesn’t give the authority to halt all applications even if there are extenuating circumstances, the lawsuit argues.  Baker said Tuesday he was suspending the issuance of pistol permits until April 30 to prevent the spread of germs at his office and because of a backlog of applications. His office said pistol permit requests have increased dramatically amid the COVID-19 outbreak.  A sheriff’s spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuit.  State health officials reported more than 900 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Saturday and four deaths.  For most, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

"NEW ORLEANS — The coronavirus continued its steady march here Saturday, with a total of 3,315 cases in the state and the mayor trying to blame President Trump for not canceling Mardi Gras. As of noon on March 28, the Louisiana Department of Health reported 569 new cases in the past day and a death toll of 137 attributed to the virus that first infected humans in Wuhan, China, last year. Though the rate of infection increase remained close to 21%, that nevertheless marked a decline from just three days ago when Louisiana cases were jumping at 28% over the 24-hour periods tracked by the LDH. Gov. John Bel Edwards, who issued shelter-in-place orders for the state March 22, has repeatedly stressed that if Louisianan fails to curb the rate of increase the state could find itself short of ventilators and hospital beds in early April. A total of 927 patients were hospitalized statewide with the virus as of Saturday afternoon, with slightly more than one-third of them — 336 — requiring ventilators, the LDH reported. Those figures were increasing at a much faster rate than new infections. The state saw an increase of 14% in hospitalizations between March 26-27, but that increased to a 19% pace from March 27-28, according to the LDH. Similarly, the 24-hour percentage increase in those needing ventilation jumped from 13% of those hospitalized to 24%. Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy picked up on that theme Saturday morning, telling Fox News he believed a U.S. Navy hospital ship like the ones that have been sent to New York and Los Angeles harbors should be docked in the Port of New Orleans. The city remains the hardest hit part of the state, although by Friday there were confirmed coronavirus cases in 56 of Louisiana’s 64 parishes, according to the LDH. Experts have increasingly pointed to New Orleans’ famous Carnival celebration as a source of virus spread, given the event attracts millions of visitors over a 3-week period before culminating this year in massive Mardi Gras celebrations on Feb. 25. For her part, New Orleans Democratic Mayor Latoya Cantrell went on CNN Friday and implied it was President Trump’s fault for not ordering the city to halt Mardi Gras. Local authorities let the party continue unabated this year despite calls from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies that the U.S. should brace for a significant coronavirus outbreak. The state also increased the number of nursing homes and assisted living facilities where a coronavirus cluster has been spotted from 8 to 11. For the first time, the average age of those whose deaths are attributed to coronavirus in Louisiana fell below 70 to 69.3. Only 16 of the 119 dead thus far were age 50 or younger — 13.4% — with one below the age of 36. The LDH also furnished some information on “underlying conditions among COVID-19 related deaths.” Those figures showed that 41% of those killed suffered from diabetes and 31% from chronic kidney disease. Cardiac was listed as an underlying condition for 23% and 28% were classified as obese.

"President Trump said Saturday he may announce a mandated quarantine on New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut. The quarantine would restrict people from leaving the Northeast. The news comes after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told the president in a phone call Saturday that people infected with COVID 19 are traveling to his state, refusing to shelter in place. “Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it’s a hotspot — New York, New Jersey maybe one or two other places, certain parts of Connecticut quarantined. I’m thinking about that right now. We might not have to do it but there’s a possibility that sometime today we’ll do a quarantine — short term — two weeks for New York, probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut,” the president told reporters. “I’d rather not do it, but we might need it,” he added. The president clarified the New York subway would not be shutdown. He also said trade would not be impacted. “We’ll be announcing that one way or the other, fairly soon. This does not apply to people, such as truckers, from outside the New York area,” he said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reportedly questioned how the president would legally enforce such an order, according to The New York Times. The president made his comments as he was going to Joint Base Andrews, as he will be seeing the U.S. Navy hospital ship Comfort off as it heads to New York. It is expected to arrive Monday to help alleviate hospitals that are treating a number of patients ill with the coronavirus. Mr. Cuomo said data suggests his state would need 140,000 hospital beds and 30,000 ventilators. He stressed the need for more ventilators, saying they are key when treating patients suffering from COVID-19. “We are planning for that worst-case scenario,” he told reporters. Mr. Cuomo is also asking pharmacies in his state to deliver medications free of charge in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. He also told reporters hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being administered to patients in New York and he will have results on that soon.

"DETROIT (AP) - The coronavirus continued its unrelenting spread across the United States with fatalities doubling in two days and authorities saying Saturday that an infant who tested positive had died. It pummeled big cities like New York, Detroit, New Orleans and Chicago, and made its way, too, into rural America as hotspots erupted in small Midwestern towns and Rocky Mountain ski havens.  Elsewhere, Russia announced a full border closure while in parts of Africa, pandemic prevention measures took a violent turn, with Kenyan police firing tear gas and officers elsewhere seen on video hitting people with batons. Worldwide infections surpassed the 660,000 mark with more than 30,000 deaths as new cases also stacked up quickly in Europe, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. leads the world in reported cases with more than 120,000. Confirmed deaths surpassed 2,000 on Saturday, twice the number just two days before, highlighting how quickly infections are escalating. Still, five countries have higher death tolls: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France. Italy has more than 10,000 deaths, the most of any country. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Saturday that an infant with COVID-19 died in Chicago and the cause of death is under investigation. Officials didn’t release other information, including whether the child had other health issues.  “If you haven’t been paying attention, maybe this is your wake-up call,” said Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike.  New York remained the worst-hit U.S. city. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said defeating the virus will take “weeks and weeks and weeks.” The U.N. donated 250,000 face masks to the city, and Cuomo delayed the state’s presidential primary from April 28 to June 23. As President Donald Trump made his way to Norfolk, Virginia, to see off a U.S. Navy medical ship sent to New York City to help, he suggested imposing some kind of quarantine for New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, all hit hard by the coronavirus. But he later tweeted that he intended to issue a “strong travel advisory” instead.  It wasn’t entirely clear whether he had the power to impose such a quarantine for the three states, and the idea was met with confusion and anger from their governors. Cuomo said on CNN that it would be illegal, economically catastrophic and unproductive since other areas are already seeing a surge.  Still, some states without known widespread infections began to try to limit exposure from visitors from harder-hit areas.  Rhode Island National Guard troops were instructed to go door to door in coastal communities to find New Yorkers and advise them about a mandatory 14-day quarantine for people from the state.  And in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis has ordered anyone arriving from Louisiana to self-quarantine and said law enforcement officers would set up checkpoints to screen cars from the state.  Louisiana has surpassed 3,300 infections with 137 dead from COVID-19, according to the health department. Gov. John Bel Edwards said the region was on track to run out of ventilators by the first week of April. Cases also have been rising rapidly in Detroit, where poverty and poor health have been problems for years. The number of infections surged to 1,381, with 31 deaths, as of noon Saturday. The city’s homeless population is especially vulnerable, officials said. “At this time, the trajectory of Detroit is unfortunately even more steep than that of New York,” said Dr. Teena Chopra, the medical director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at the Detroit Medical Center.  “This is off the charts,” she said. Chopra said many patients have ailments like asthma, heart disease, diabetes and hypertension. She also acknowledged that in Detroit, one of the nation’s largest African American cities, there is a distrust among some in the community of the medical system and government due to systemic racism. “In Detroit, we are seeing a lot of patients that are presenting to us with severe disease, rather than minor disease,” said Chopra, who worried about a “tsunami” of patients. Trump approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan, providing money for the outbreak. He has done the same for New York, Louisiana and Illinois. Cases in Chicago and suburban Cook County accounted for about three-fourths of Illinois’ 3,026 total as of Friday. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot closed popular lakeshore parks after people failed to practice social distancing, despite a statewide shelter-at-home order. The governor of Kansas also issued a stay-at-home order to begin Monday, as the virus takes hold in more rural areas where doctors worry about the lack of ICU beds. A cluster of three counties in rural Indiana have surging rates of confirmed cases. One of them, Decatur, population 26,000, has 30 cases with one confirmed death and another suspected, said Sean Durbin, the county’s public health emergency preparedness coordinator. Several cases were traced to large gatherings earlier in the month, including a religious retreat and a high school basketball tournament.  The disease threatens to be devastating for close-knit communities where everyone knows everyone, Durbin said, adding that he was a friend of the person believed to have died from the virus as well as others currently in critical condition.  The county health department has already run out of personal protective equipment, Durbin said. The last supply from the federal stockpile arrived more than a week ago and contained just 77 N95 masks and two dozen face shields.  “I wish there was a stronger word for disappointed,” he said. “I’m calling on them to do better.”  Blaine County, Idaho, a scenic ski haven for wealthy tourists, now has around 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the highest rate per capita outside the New York area. Two people have died. The virus continues to strain health systems in Italy, Spain and France. Lockdowns of varying degrees have been introduced across Europe, nearly emptying streets in normally bustling cities.  Germany has fewer deaths than some neighboring countries but has closed nonessential shops and banned public gatherings of more than two people until April 20. It still had its share of grim news: 12 residents of a nursing home in the northern town of Wolfsburg have died since Monday after being infected, news agency dpa reported.  Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte announced he had signed a decree freeing up 400 million euros ($440 million) for coupons and packages of food aid, to be delivered door-to-door if necessary. “People are suffering psychologically. They’re not used to staying in their homes. But they are also suffering economically,” Conte said. Italy has almost completed a three-week lockdown, with no end in sight. In Spain, where stay-at-home restrictions have been in place for nearly two weeks, the death toll rose to 5,812. Another 8,000 confirmed infections pushed that count above 72,000 cases. But Spain’s director of emergencies, Fernando Simón, saw hope in that the rate of infection is slowing and figures “indicate that the outbreak is stabilizing and may be reaching its peak in some areas.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called for a more vigorous response from the European Union. Spain, Italy, France and six other members have asked the union to share the burden of European debt, dubbed “coronabonds” in the media, to help fight the virus. But the idea has met resistance from other members, led by Germany and the Netherlands. “It is the most difficult moment for the EU since its foundation and it has to be ready to rise to the challenge,” Sánchez said. As the epicenter has shifted westward, the situation has calmed in China, where some restrictions have been lifted. Some subway service was restored in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, after the city of 11 million had its virus risk evaluation reduced from high to medium.  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and lead to death. More than 135,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins. Countries are still trying to bring home citizens stranded abroad.

"Alfredo Ortiz, president and CEO of the conservative Job Creators Network, didn’t recognize the number on his ringing cellphone, so he didn’t answer. The voicemail surprised him. It was Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, who was seeking his input as the Trump administration and Congress scrambled last week to assemble a $2 trillion package to fight the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. “I thought it was actually a scam call,” Mr. Ortiz said. “I listened to the voicemail, and it was like, ‘Hey, Alfredo, this is Steven, you know, the Treasury secretary, just trying to get a hold of you. Give me a buzz back when you get a chance.’” Mr. Mnuchin is sometimes viewed warily by conservatives who consider him a Democrat in President Trump’s inner sanctum. But the 57-year-old former Wall Street executive is getting high marks for his round-the-clock efforts to rescue the economy and serve as a liaison between the president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. The president and the speaker haven’t spoken in five months. “He’s even-keeled,” said a Republican familiar with the exhaustive negotiations. “He was spending long hours and really late nights at the Capitol, going between the minority and majority leader’s office.” A Democratic aide said of Mr. Mnuchin, “You can deal with him.” The president said his Treasury secretary “lived over in that beautiful building,” and Mr. Mnuchin agreed that he spent about five days in the LBJ Room, an ornate, frescoed space near the Senate chamber. American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp said of Mr. Mnuchin, “He had a big week, but more importantly, he did his country a lot of good.” Mr. Trump signed the rescue package Friday. Mr. Mnuchin now is working to make sure that direct payments of $1,200 to most Americans and billions of dollars in loans to small businesses are delivered rapidly. “This doesn’t do people any good if it takes a long time,” Mr. Mnuchin said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Mr. Ortiz, whose network represents small businesses, did call back after that missed phone call last week to emphasize to Mr. Mnuchin the need to get government loans to small business owners quickly. He also urged Mr. Mnuchin to extend aid to “gig” workers and independent contractors, who usually don’t qualify for help. In the same week, a record 3.2 million people filed for unemployment benefits. “We talked on multiple occasions, despite the world basically collapsing around him and trying to get the left and the right together on ideas to work with the White House,” Mr. Ortiz said. “He sounded cool, calm and collected. He took the time he needed to listen to our ideas, and not at one moment did I ever feel rushed by him. If anything, I felt like I was taking too much of his time.” A partner at Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 2002, Mr. Mnuchin later established himself in Hollywood for bankrolling several successful and some mediocre movies, including “American Sniper” in 2014 and “The LEGO movie.” He got an acting credit for playing himself in a nonspeaking role as a Wall Street banker with Warren Beatty in “Rules Don’t Apply,” a film that also featured his future wife, Louise Linton. When Mr. Mnuchin became national finance chairman of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign in the spring of 2016, many conservatives didn’t share Mr. Trump’s confidence in him. “He comes from the banking world, and he had a reputation for being a Democrat,” Mr. Schlapp said. “He obviously earned a lot of respect and credibility from all of us with the amazing job he did on finance for the president’s election in 2016, and he’s figured Washington out.” The massive cost of the rescue package, including four months worth of unemployment benefits that will pay many workers 100% or more of what they were earning in their jobs, isn’t sitting well with many conservatives. Mr. Schlapp also pointed to “dandelions” in the package such as $25 million for the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and $75 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds National Public Radio. “This is odious and unfortunately typical of the Democratic Party,” he said. “No conservative likes the price tag.” Mr. Mnuchin said the administration needed buy-in from Democrats at a critical moment for the country. “There’s never a deal until it’s done,” he told Fox News host Sean Hannity. “We were negotiating through the whole period. We took out anything having to do with wind [power] and the environmental issues. The president cut lots and lots of things out of this deal.” He added, “When I do business deals, it’s win and win. But here, we needed bipartisan support. There was a price to pay.” Mr. Schlapp said most conservatives are withholding their criticisms, for now, because they understand that the pandemic created unprecedented economic challenges. “I think most conservatives realize that never before has the government so broadly swiped away American economic rights, and for good reason,” Mr. Schlapp said. “Literally, not allowing people to go to work, not allowing people to operate their businesses — that’s an economic taking, and the government shouldn’t be allowed to do that without a financial settlement from those who had the economic loss. That’s predominantly what we’re seeing here.” One of the stickiest negotiating points with Democrats was a $500 billion fund to provide loans to distressed corporations. Democrats wouldn’t support the package until the White House agreed to a special inspector general to review how the administration allocates the loans. But Mr. Trump notified Congress after signing the aid package that he will insist on presidential “supervision” of the yet-to-be appointed inspector general. The development rankled Democrats, who said it was a retreat on the bargain struck by Mr. Mnuchin. Mrs. Pelosi said Sunday that Democrats won’t allow the president to have unilateral control over the loan process. In an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Mrs. Pelosi also seemed to bristle at Mr. Mnuchin’s focus on the harm inflicted on financial markets during the economic shutdown. She recalled a meeting with Mr. Mnuchin a week ago Sunday in the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican. “I said to them, since this is Sunday and the churches are closed, I want to begin bipartisan meeting with a prayer,” Mrs. Pelosi said. “And I quoted Pope Francis’ word of prayer under this circumstance. And he said, ‘I pray that God would enlighten those who are responsible for the common good, that they would take responsibility for those in their care.’ And Secretary Mnuchin said, ‘Well, since you quoted Pope Francis, I will quote the markets.’ And so that has taken us to another area of values, to me, about this.” The president, who hasn’t spoken to Mrs. Pelosi since a frosty meeting Oct. 16 as the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry picked up steam, summed up Mr. Mnuchin’s value to his administration and to the nation. “He’s a fantastic guy, and he loves our country,” the president said. “And he’s been dealing with both sides — Republican and Democrat.”  ",Mnuchin wins bipartisan praise for ushering rescue bill past steep political hurdles,"Sunday, March 29, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/29/steven-mnuchin-wins-praise-coronavirus-stimulus-bi/,washington_times
"The congressional relief package finalized Friday appears to have moved the needle slightly positively among Americans when asked whether they have lost or would lose wages during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, as nearly half say they are unable to work from home, according to a new survey from an online financial service. MoneyGeek surveyed 1,257 Americans nationwide between March 22 and 25, with 36% of the surveys completed on the day the Senate and White House announced they had agreed on a $2.2 trillion relief package. Before March 25, MoneyGeek that “54% who are currently employed have lost or expect to lose wages due to the coronavirus.” That number dropped to 49% among those surveyed on the 25th, said Doug Milnes, one of the survey’s two creators. The survey saw a less positive move in the employment landscape. On the 25th, 35.6% felt it was “‘very likely’ or ‘completely likely’ that they will lose their employment in the next 12 weeks,” compared to 37.9% who thought so before that date. “I think a good way to put it is there was a small improvement in outlook from the time we started fielding on the survey to the time we finished,” Mr. Milnes said. “When you see so many people worried about missing payments or losing their jobs, it just brings home the impact of all this.” The survey results underscored the deep economic shock the virus and its concomitant business shutdowns have delivered. As of Friday, 22 states had issued “shelter at home” rules, which have largely closed businesses not deemed “essential” by government and politicians. Some businesses, such as restaurants, have managed to continue on a take-out or delivery basis, but that would only let them stay open with a skeletal crew compared to their pre-coronavirus workforce. Other businesses, such as movie theaters, most retail stores and others have been shuttered or reduced to drive-by status in which small numbers of workers hand out preordered, prepaid items. In the survey, 47% said they are unable to perform their job from home, a major contributor to the shaky feelings about employment going forward, said Hillary Adler, who partnered with Mr. Milnes on the project. Despite the grim outlook, 57% of those surveyed said they expected to be able to pay their bills, a number that showed little change on March 25, Mr. Milnes said. The same majority — 57% — predicted the emergency would last 8 weeks or less. In terms of consumer spending, 45% said they had put off making a purchase with an additional 23% saying they expected to start delaying purchases soon. Slightly less than one-third — 33% — said the bug has not had an impact on their spending. The median amount Americans reported spending to stock up on coronavirus supplies was $150, although a handful said they had spent $600 or more. While representatives from all 50 states were included, MoneyGeek said the sample size was too small to draw clear conclusions about different regional patterns. Answers tended to be the same among men and women, Mr. Milnes and Ms. Adler told The Washington Times. Not every part of the country is on the same timeline in terms of coping with the virus, which first infected humans in Wuhan, China, last year before marching across the planet. Washington state, for example, was hard hit by the virus in early March but its experiences have since been eclipsed by more populous states such as New York and California. One finding that surprised both Ms. Adler and Mr. Milnes was that more than four times the percentage of Americans said they would clean as opposed to “working out” during this unanticipated and undesirable downtime — 18.4% to 4.5%. The single biggest way Americans said they are passing the time was predictably watching TV at 37.5%. “The cleaning one, that really surprised me,” Ms. Adler said. It remains to be seen, they noted, if the U.S. may see a surge in birthrates at the end of 2020 similar to what New York City experienced after suffering a blackout in 1977.

"President Trump on Sunday said the U.S. will make three times more ventilators over the next 100 days than it typically produces in a year. Speaking from the White House, Mr. Trump said the pace of production will depend on companies that he is asking — or compelling, through the Defense Production Act — to prioritize federal orders for the life-saving machines. Ventilators are machines that help people breathe. The coronavirus disease, COVID-19, causes respiratory distress, so ventilators are considered the most vital piece of equipment for hospitals battling the pandemic. Governors are pressuring Mr. Trump to use the full weight of his powers to produce medical equipment and protective gear for health workers on the front lines. Nearly 137,000 people had become infected with the coronavirus as of late Sunday, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Over 2,400 have died and 2,600 have recovered. Mr. Trump met Sunday with several supply chain distributors in the Cabinet Room of the White House. Spaced several feet apart, the attendees included executives from FedEx and McKesson, a well-known pharmaceutical distributor, among others. Mr. Trump thanked General Motors for working hard on the ventilator issue, just two days after he used complained about negotiations with the company and ordered them to produce the machines under the production act. He also praised Boeing, Ford, Honeywell and Haines for stepping forward to produce ventilators or other medical equipment.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unloaded Sunday on President Trump for his response to the novel coronavirus pandemic, saying his “denial at the beginning was deadly” and that people are dying as he “fiddles.” “When did this president know about this and what did he know? What did he know and when did he know it?” asked Ms. Pelosi on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “That’s for an after-action review. But as the president fiddles, people are dying, and we just have to take every precaution.” Mr. Trump has discussed relaxing federal COVID-19 guidelines in the coming weeks to boost the economy, hit hard by business closures and layoffs prompted by the pandemic, but Ms. Pelosi said it was too soon. “Now I think the best thing to do would be to prevent more loss of life rather than open things up because we just don’t know,” she said. “We have to have testing, testing, testing, that’s what we said from the start, before we can evaluate what the nature of it is in some of these other regions as well.” She added, “I don’t know what the purpose of that is. I don’t know what the scientists are saying to him.” .@SpeakerPelosi says the President downplaying the severity of #coronavirus is “deadly.”“As the President fiddles, people are dying.

"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has come under criticism for a statewide order cracking down on prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine, a drug touted by President Trump to treat the novel coronavirus. The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs issued an order Wednesday warning physicians against writing prescriptions “without a legitimate medical purpose” and instructing pharmacists to evaluate the “legitimacy” of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine prescriptions. The department cited concerns about stockpiling amid “multiple allegations” of doctors writing prescriptions for family and friends, adding that reports of such conduct “may be further investigated for administrative action” and that other health professionals are required to report “inappropriate prescribing practices.” Michigan isn’t the first state to restrict the use of the drug — Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak issued an emergency order last week over concerns about “bad actors” creating a shortage — but the moves have fueled allegations on the right that Democrats and media outlets are seeking to play politics with the drug. Kathy Hoekstra, who previously worked for Republican businessman Herman Cain, accused Ms. Whitmer of putting patients at risk with her administration’s “knee-jerk scare tactics.” “[I]f you live in Michigan, and you or a loved one is infected with this potentially lethal disease, you’re out of luck,” said Kathy Hoekstra, who has written for conservative, in a Thursday op-ed for the Detroit News. “Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs literally threatened all doctors and pharmacists in the state who prescribe or dispense hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19.” RedState’s Elizabeth Vaughn cited a Facebook post by a Michigan man, Transportation Improvement Association CEO Jim Santilli, who credited hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with saving his life after being hospitalized for COVID-19. “For Gov. Whitmer to deny Michigan residents access to one of the only treatments that has shown promise in helping patients with coronavirus is unfair,” said Ms. Vaughn. “She’s playing with people’s lives. To treat these patients and their physicians as criminals is unconscionable.” Ms. Whitmer’s office did not respond immediately to a request for comment. On March 21st, I didn’t think I’d live to see midnight due to #Covid_19. I felt like I was slowly drowning. The Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin changed that and saved my life! Thank you to @realDonaldTrump and the many others for suggesting this treatment. It works!!! The Michigan agency said that hydroxychloroquine, a drug commonly used for malaria and lupus, has not “scientifically or medically proven” to treat COVID-19, while critics noted that doctors often prescribed drugs off-label, and that studies and clinical trials are still underway for the new virus that triggered a pandemic. “With his state now the nation’s pandemic epicenter, and with the blessing and help of the president and FDA, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo brought in 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine, 10,000 doses of Zithromax and 750,000 doses of chloroquine,” said Ms. Hoekstra. Last week, Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, accused Mr. Sisolak of “trying to score political points against Trump,” while Mr. Sisolak said the restrictions were needed to avert “a shortage of critical drugs for those who need it the most.”  ",Michigan Gov.

"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday he doubts the state will be able to loosen its coronavirus restrictions in the next two weeks, saying the Maryland-D.C.-Virginia area at that point will be “looking a lot more like New York.” “No, we don’t see any way that we’re going to be opening back up in a couple of weeks,” Mr. Hogan said on “Fox News Sunday.” “The Washington metropolitan area … has quadrupled [in the number of cases] in the past week, and we see that continuing to grow exponentially, and we think in two weeks around Easter, we’re going to be looking a lot more like New York.” As of Sunday, the Maryland Department of Health reported 1,239 cases of COVID-19, the D.C. Department of Health recorded 342 cases and the Virginia Department of Health recorded 890. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser also announced Sunday that the District has received a disaster declaration from the Federal Emergency Management Agency because of the coronavirus pandemic. “The declaration will provide assistance to the District’s Emergency Response Services and to residents and businesses that have been severely impacted by COVID-19,” stated the press release. Miss Bowser has already requested emergency assistance through the declaration to address immediate threats to public health and safety, medical care and sheltering, logistics and supplies. In the District, two inmates — a 37-year-old man and a 38-year-old man — at the D.C. Jail tested positive over the weekend, bringing the facility’s total cases to four, according to the Department of Corrections. Officials had moved both men Thursday from the Correctional Treatment Facility to a quarantine unit after the confirmation of the jail’s first coronavirus case, the corrections agency said. In a court filing, the District’s Public Defender Service has asked for the release of all inmates serving sentences for misdemeanors, the Washington City Paper reported. A public defender requesting the release of a client wrote in a motion that the Department of Corrections (DOC) is not following coronavirus protocols issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the court document, the CDC recommends having a stock of medical supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE) and hygiene supplies, but DOC General Counsel Eric Glover was unable to provide a list of materials currently in stock. The CDC also recommends social distancing in corrections facilities at meals, in common areas and at group activities, but the agency has not confirmed it has implemented such measures, and the jail’s population of about 1,700 inmates makes it unlikely it will be able to do so, according to the court document. Before the D.C. Jail confirmed its first COVID-19 case, the U.S. attorney’s office in support of pre-trial detention for a defendant and wrote that the DOC has taken proper precautions to keep inmates and visitors safe. The U.S. attorney wrote that jail officials have suspended all non-attorney visitors and implemented a screening process for those who do enter, and that the DOC conducts daily briefings about how to combat the virus and has ordered more supplies. Meanwhile, Metro officials said Sunday that, beginning Monday, subway riders no longer will be able to board the front or rear subway cars in order to create a buffer between operators and the public. “Despite the fact that rail ridership is down about 93 percent, Metro will continue to operate all 8-car trains — the longest possible length — to allow plenty of room for safe social distancing in the remaining six cars,” officials said in a press release. Metro also will continue its reduced service for essential travel only through April 3.

"National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow said Sunday the economic fallout from the U.S. coronavirus crisis could last weeks or months, warning that he “can’t wave a magic wand” to repair the financial damage. “We still believe it’s going to be a question of weeks and months, hopefully weeks — maybe I should say ‘prayerfully’ weeks, but we think we can get through this period,” said Mr. Kudlow on ABC’s “This Week.” By “weeks,” he said he meant “it could be four weeks, it could be eight weeks. I say that hopefully, and I say that prayerfully. That’s what some of the science experts are telling us. I don’t know if they’ll be right.” He said that individuals would begin to receive direct checks from the $2.2 trillion stimulus package signed by President Trump in the next two weeks, while loans to small businesses would be ready for processing by Friday. “You can’t have a good job unless you have a healthy business,” Mr. Kudlow said. “And what we’ve tried to do is provide tremendous, tremendous assistance to the individual men and women, and therefore on the other side, tremendous assistance to the small businesses for which they work. We’re trying to balance this out.” Unemployment claims surged last week to 3.3 million as businesses, schools and non-essential workplaces shut down in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19 as the total number of U.S. positive tests nears 125,000. Mr. Kudlow called the stimulus package “the largest mainstream financial assistant package in the history of the United States,” covering one-third of Gross Domestic Product, but said he could not guarantee that the economic pain won’t be long-term. “I can’t guarantee it. I can’t wave a magic wand. I wish I could,” he said. “I’ve spent all my career being an optimist and trying to promote economic growth.” .@MarthaRaddatz: “How can you be sure that this economic tragedy won’t be longterm if there’s no guarantee that people will have jobs to return to?”Larry Kudlow: “I can’t guarantee it.

"Tom Coburn’s reputation preceded him throughout the Capitol. He was a cantankerous troublemaker who was tough to work with and more interested in blowing things up than getting things done — and that reputation was completely wrong, just about everyone who worked with him quickly came to realize. While he was willing to stand in the way of spending that he thought unnecessary, he was also a master legislator. With a single amendment to a bill in 2010, he saved the government $262 billion and counting. He made a cottage industry out of spotting ridiculous-sounding spending items, such as the “Bridge to Nowhere” project in Alaska. His work on the Senate’s oversight committee brought down the largest Social Security disability fraud ring in history. Mr. Coburn, a medical doctor turned politician who served six years in the House and a decade in the Senate, died Saturday at age 72 after a lengthy battle with cancer, leaving one of the most substantial legacies in recent congressional history. To those who knew him best, Mr. Coburn’s virtuoso legislative abilities were exceeded by his decency. “I’ve never met another politician like him. His honesty, devotion to facts and reason, his strength, his intellect and his genuine warmth will always be with me. His true friendship will be a gift I will treasure forever,” said Erskine Bowles, who was chief of staff to President Clinton and got to know Mr. Coburn while working on a commission to cut the deficit. Mr. Coburn won election to the U.S. House as part of the Republican sweep in 1994, when he captured a Democrat-held seat. He served three terms and then left to keep his term limit pledge. The seat was promptly won by a Democrat. Four years later, he sought Oklahoma’s open Senate seat. Republican leaders worked against him in the primary, but he won. In the general election, he beat Rep. Brad Carson, the Democrat who had taken over his House seat. Alan Frumin, who was parliamentarian in the Senate during most of Mr. Coburn’s tenure, said people warned him of the impending storm after Mr. Coburn’s election in 2004. He was prickly and tough to work with, the story went. “Suffice to say it, they were wrong,” Mr. Frumin said. “We developed such respect for his way of doing business, and respect morphed into affection, and I say that as somebody who, he certainly put us through our paces,” Mr. Frumin said. “He was dogged, he was thorough and he was good to his word on everything. He was a force to be reckoned with.” Setting aside the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who literally wrote the book on the history of the Senate, Mr. Coburn was in a class of his own when it came to learning and deploying the chamber’s rules. Few senators bother to pay attention to the rules. Of those who do, some delegate to their staff while others learn it all themselves. Mr. Coburn did both. ‘I’m not coming to Washington to make friends’ By his own measure, Mr. Coburn failed in 2010 when the Senate was debating yet another debt limit increase and he came to the floor with an amendment demanding $120 billion in spending cuts. He figured government had at least enough duplication that agencies should be able to sweat out that much. Democrats who controlled the chamber resisted, and so did some Republicans. Mr. Coburn settled for a study, and Congress ordered the Government Accountability Office to produce a report on redundancies. Yet that failure may be the single most successful act of budget-cutting in decades. That Republican study became known as the duplication report, a yearly page-turner of government redundancies that as of last year saved $262 billion — “and counting,” said Gene Dodaro, who, as comptroller general, is head of the GAO. The GAO’s duplication webpage has been viewed more than 280,000 times. The reports have more than 165,000 views on PDF and have been downloaded nearly 45,000 times. When the next report is released this spring, the $262 billion figure will be even higher. “The gift that keeps on giving, and it will for a long time,” Mr. Dodaro said. One of Mr. Coburn’s principles drilled into staff was that they shouldn’t be afraid to fight and lose. Sometimes you won the war by losing a few choice battles. But they were also drilled to always treat legislative opponents with respect, to try to find common ground and to outwork everyone else. “When I met Dr. Coburn in November 1994, he got right up in my face and said, ‘Are you sure you want to work for me? I’m not coming to Washington to make friends,’” recalled Roland Foster, Mr. Coburn’s legislative director. “After being elected to the Senate, a Senate staffer advised me not to work for him because no one was going to work with him. After irritating nearly everyone in Washington for 20 years, he left the Senate at a time of extreme partisanship but with more friends on both sides of the aisle than nearly anyone else left in politics.” Coburn staffers figure they wrote more than 1,000 amendments to cut spending during his 10 years in the Senate. Most of the amendments were easily defeated or, more often, never even got a vote. One of those failures was the Bridge to Nowhere, a span in Alaska that was to be built to reach Gravina Island, with a permanent population of perhaps 50. Alaska’s congressional delegation inserted an “earmark” into a bill directing $223 million to the project. The Alaskans said the bridge was needed to replace a less reliable ferry service. After Hurricane Katrina slammed the Gulf Coast, Mr. Coburn called on Congress to cut the bridge money and use it to rebuild a bridge in Louisiana. His amendment was crushed by a 82-15 vote. But the bridge was never built. Mr. Coburn had made the project too toxic. Several years later, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin canceled the project and said the money would be used elsewhere. Earmarks never recovered from the bad press and were eliminated by 2011. Silly science and other crusades Mr. Coburn made “shrimp on a treadmill” famous when he highlighted a federally funded science research project that involved running shrimp on a specially built treadmill designed to test how shrimp absorbed oxygen under stress. When a video of the shrimp surfaced, Mr. Coburn pounced and dubbed it a waste of taxpayer money. The Washington Times reached out to the study’s author but got no response. Mr. Coburn also challenged the Social Security disability of a man who lived as an “adult baby” who slept in diapers in an adult-size crib and collected government benefits, even though he acknowledged he had some computer and woodworking skills. When Democrats called a press conference to complain that Mr. Coburn was blocking a bill that they wanted Congress to pass, he showed up and sat in the front row alongside the press.”I’m going to enjoy the festivities,” he told reporters. Mr. Coburn was the chief sponsor of Sen. Barack Obama’s biggest legislative accomplishment: the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006. Mr. Obama attended the ceremony at the White House where President George W. Bush signed it into law. The measure created USASpending.gov, which is still the best way to track government contracts and disbursements. Already famous in Washington, Mr. Coburn gained national attention with his annual “Wastebook,” which highlighted silly spending. Late-night comedians ate it up. Those who worked with Mr. Coburn said he was never cheap. He gave his best and expected that of those around him. “I loved working with him. He actually made it easy to do so,” said Mr. Bowles, who worked with Mr. Coburn on a committee to make suggestions for cutting the deficit. “From Day One, he was completely transparent, honest and straightforward with me. But he didn’t just give me his trust; it was something I had to earn over time,” Mr. Bowles said. “But once he did feel confident that Al and I were as committed to real fiscal responsibility and reform as he was, he educated us, directed us and led us to ideas and solutions we would never have found without his direction, guidance and expertise.” The outsider That’s not to say Mr. Coburn wasn’t willing to mix it up. Most freshman senators are content to lie low and get a feel for how the Senate operates. Some wait months before delivering their maiden speeches on the floor. Mr. Coburn didn’t bother with a maiden speech. He just began blocking other senators’ bills. Within a few months of taking office, Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, said Mr. Coburn had put a “hold” on hundreds of pieces of legislation. Don Ritchie, historian emeritus for the Senate, said Mr. Coburn probably holds the all-time record for holds. Some of Mr. Coburn’s friends on Capitol Hill seemed to misunderstand him and labeled him a hard-liner. The reality was far more complex. He was a champion for HIV/AIDS patients, though in his own way, said Scott Evertz, who was Mr. Bush’s director of AIDS policy. “Being concerned about an epidemic or a pandemic, and being fiscally conservative, are not mutually exclusive,” Mr. Evertz said. “I don’t think there was anyone that could quarrel with the fact that he cared about people living with HIV.” Mr. Evertz recalled a meeting of the president’s advisory AIDS council where Mr. Coburn passed out a book, “Sexual Ecology,” written by a gay rights activist. The book was rather graphic and stunned liberal and conservative members. Mr. Evertz said Mr. Coburn found the book scientifically sound and therefore deemed it worthwhile. In 1996, when Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole was refusing a campaign donation from the Log Cabin Republicans, whose members advocate for gay rights, Mr. Coburn spoke at the group’s event, Mr. Foster said. Mr. Foster said Mr. Coburn had skepticism of big business as well as big government. Among the measures he sponsored were bills to prohibit insurance companies from canceling policies for those who sought HIV tests. He also teamed up with Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont independent, on legislation to allow Americans to access prescription drugs sold at lower prices in other countries. “The real reason he was so dangerous is because he was so independent and had his own opinions and solutions on everything,” Mr. Foster said. Those solutions showed up in Mr. Coburn’s oversight reports. One report exposed the massive Social Security scam run by Eric C. Conn, a lawyer in Kentucky who filed thousands of bogus disability applications. Had the fraud not been stopped, it could have accounted for $1 billion in lifetime benefits that shouldn’t have been paid. Conn is now in prison serving a 12-year sentence for the fraud and a 15-year sentence for escaping home confinement. ‘A special, special man’ Many members of Congress, when they come to Washington, go through a transformation. For the first few years, when they talk about “we,” they usually mean their constituents back home. Eventually, when they say “we,” they mean themselves and other members of Congress. Mr. Coburn didn’t succumb to that. He made a three-term pledge when he first ran for the House in 1994 and stuck to it. He left the chamber after the 2000 election. When he ran for the Senate, he imposed a two-term pledge on himself. He ended up staying just 10 years and left early because of poor health. “Tom Coburn was a special, special man,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican. “He was a Christian and a father and a husband, and all of those identities were much more important to him than where he got his paycheck.” Mr. Coburn took pains to keep his ties to his Oklahoma life while in Washington — including delivering babies as part of his doctor’s practice. That sparked another of his fights against the Washington establishment. The Senate ethics committee ruled that Mr. Coburn was violating conflict of interest rules by holding an outside job. Mr. Coburn then stopped taking payment and said he would work pro bono. The committee rejected that plan, saying he was working at a for-profit hospital so it presented a conflict of interest. He ignored the committee and continued his practice. A little-known fact, according to a longtime aide, is that one of the babies Mr. Coburn delivered was future “American Idol” winner Carrie Underwood.

"MoveOn is waging an advertising war against Sen. Richard Burr for reportedly profiting off non-public information before the stock market cratered in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The North Carolina Republican is not up for reelection until 2022, but the liberal group’s ad campaign on Facebook and in the Raleigh News & Observer aims to force Mr. Burr from office immediately. The ads feature a black-and-white photograph of Mr. Burr with a hand shaded in red to show he was “caught red handed.” Mr. Burr, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, reportedly sold about $1.7 million in stock after learning of the coronavirus’ potentially calamitous impact before the information available to him became public knowledge. He also reportedly shared warnings with private donors while publicly espousing America’s preparedness to combat the virus. “In public, Sen. Burr misleadingly reassured voters about America’s novel coronavirus preparedness, parroting the Trump-GOP party line. But behind the scenes, he was selling off up to $1.7 million in personal stock holdings,” the MoveOn ad on Facebook reads. “Sen. Burr was caught red handed using private information for his personal profit, at our expense — it’s time for him to resign.” MoveOn ran its ads to “take over” the homepage of the Raleigh News & Observer website on Thursday, and splashed banner ads across the newspaper’s digital articles as well. MoveOn has spent as much as $2,000 on anti-Burr ads that began running on Facebook on March 21, according to the Facebook Ad Library. Many of Mr. Burr’s conservative allies also have called for his resignation. Fox News personality Tucker Carlson has suggested he resign, and fellow Republican lawmakers have pressured Mr. Burr, including Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida who requested the Senate immediately remove Mr. Burr from leadership of the intelligence committee. Mr. Gaetz also has called on Sen. Thom Tillis, North Carolina Republican, to refer Mr. Burr to the Justice Department for prosecution. Mr. Burr’s office pointed to his statement saying that he relied on news reports to make his stock moves and has requested the Senate Ethics Committee review his actions. Mr. Burr is not the only senator facing accusations of improperly profiting off the stock market tanking amid the coronavirus outbreak. Sens. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat; Kelly Loeffler, Georgia Republican; and Sen. James Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican, all are facing accusations of impropriety. Ms. Feinstein told the Los Angeles Times the transactions in question were made by her husband. She said she did not attend a private Jan. 24 briefing for senators about the coronavirus before the stock moves were made. Mr. Inhofe told The New York Times he canceled the transaction in question after he became aware of it, and he said the transaction was made by a third-party adviser. Ms. Loeffler tweeted on March 20 that she was not involved in the decision-making of the trades in question, nor was she in communication with her third-party financial advisers. Ms. Loeffler’s husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and founder and chairman of the Intercontinental Exchange. MoveOn has run ads focusing on accusations of financial impropriety against Mr. Burr and Ms. Loeffler. The group did not respond to requests for comment about its ads and why it is not targeting Mr. Inhofe or Ms. Feinstein.

Within one week, MoveOn rendered its ads against Ms. Loeffler inactive on Facebook while expanding its ads against Mr. Burr in the Raleigh News & Observer. Ms. Loeffler is running to keep her seat in a special election in November, with a potential runoff election for the seat following in January 2021, and then a regular election for the seat will be held in 2022.

"RICHMOND, Ky. (AP) - Recruits from police agencies across Kentucky have graduated from basic training. The 33 graduates of Class 510 completed 20 weeks of training last week at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training facility in Richmond, the agency said in a statement. The program included 800 hours of instruction, including law offenses and procedures, vehicle operations, firearms, investigations and first aid.  The facility provides basic training for police officers, sheriffs’ deputies, university police, airport police and others.  Four recruits also graduated with associate’s degrees, which are earned online through a partnership with Bluegrass Community and Technical College.

"We already know that a wide variety of major print, broadcast and online news organizations continue to produce coverage meant to undermine President Trump and his administration as the teams do battle against the coronavirus pandemic. The official efforts are an evolving, quick-moving process with promising results, the public updates delivered with considerable candor from those monitoring every facet of the response. In other eras, U.S. presidents and public officials would have received support from the press through helpful, fair and honest coverage meant to keep the public informed and engaged. But not this time around. Here’s some pertinent advice from a Fox News Channel host Greg Gutfeld regarding the coronavirus crisis and the liberal news media’s unending bias and animosity against Mr. Trump and the White House coronavirus task force. “We can hold this country together with or without the media’s help, and believe me they are not helping much, if at all,” Mr. Gutfeld told his audience over the weekend, with a warning about what appears to be the media’s own malaise. “I have no doubt we will exit this dark period stronger and better than before. Jobs will return. The economy will roar back. The truth will come out. And we will have saved many lives. And the only sickness that lingers, the one that seems impervious to drugs, is the media’s own incurable bias. Best to keep your distance permanently,” said Mr. Gutfeld. A HANDY SUMMATION No wonder Democrats are nervous. “Despite the relentless attacks from Democrats and the media, a strong majority of America is behind President Trump’s leadership during the coronavirus pandemic,” advises Steve Guest, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee, who supplies this handy summation of public opinion polls conducted in the last week: “ABC/Washington Post poll: 66% express confidence in the federal government’s ability to handle the outbreak,” Mr. Guests said. A Gallup poll revealed 60% approve of the president’s response to the coronavirus. The Gallup poll also showed an increase in the president’s approval rating among independents and Democrats. Another Hill-Harris poll found that 61% of voters say Mr. Trump is taking strong measures to slow or stop coronavirus spread while an ABC/Ipsos poll: revealed that 55% of the public approve of the president’s management of the crisis. And finally, a CBS News poll found that 53% say Mr. Trump is doing “a good job of handling the outbreak.” GETTING CRANKY “President Trump’s approval Is spiking, and the Left can’t stand it,” writes David Marcus, a columnist for The Federalist. “You would think that most people would view this as good thing, I mean, in the middle of a crisis, having faith in leadership is better than not having faith in leadership, right? For many on the left, though, these numbers are cause for consternation,” Mr. Marcus writes. He cited CNN analyst Ana Navarro-Cardenas who was perplexed by a recent ABC poll with a 51% approval rating for the president. “Who are these 51% of Americans who approve of the way this lying, narcissistic, science-denying, petty, partisan, infantile, intellectual wasteland, lame excuse for a President with the vocabulary of a 4 year-old (apologies to 4 year-olds), is mishandling this crisis? Really,” the analyst wrote in a tweet. Mr. Marcus said that “for Trump supporters, this is all obviously delicious. But that really isn’t the point. The point is that in a time of national crisis, Trump has changed his behavior and risen to the challenge. Our friends on the left either can’t or refuse to see this. But the American people do. And they are the ones who decide the fate of Trump’s reelection chances, not the bobble-headed pundits that people PBS, CNN, and MSNBC.” THE ABORTION IRONY Abortion awareness has taken on a new meaning during the coronavirus pandemic, particularly when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other pro-choice factions insist that funds for the procedure should be considered a vital part of the $2.4 trillion national coronavirus aid response. “You know you live in a healthy society when its ‘elite’ journalists demand even more dead bodies than those being produced by a pandemic. That’s precisely what the New York Times editorial board asked for in their recent piece that called for even ‘more’ abortions during the coronavirus outbreak. Imagine that; even as normal life has been interrupted all around us, lefties need abortion mills to be one of the few constant and sure things still operating,” writes Gabriel Hays, a Media Research Center cultural analyst. He cites a recent op-ed titled “Make Abortion More Available During the Pandemic — Not Less”  in which the Times made the case that abortions were an “essential” component of comprehensive health care. “Ah, yes, killing kids is as essential as the ER doctor saving lives. This is just a dark Orwellian leftist game. The notion that someone wanting an abortion is an equal emergency to someone’s imminent death from coronavirus or a heart attack is not convincing,” writes Mr. Hays. Our old friend “Deep Woods” — a longtime political commentator who indeed lives in the dense woods of the Northeast — agrees with the analyst. “Does anyone else see the irony of spending $2 trillion to save the lives of adults and elders, yet spend another $600 million to kill a million babies a year?” he writes from a “hunker bunker” up north, in a terse note to Inside the Beltway.

"The rash of states postponing or modifying their primary elections because of the coronavirus raises a question: Can President Trump delay or cancel November’s elections and extend his presidency because of the crisis? In a word, no, according to legal experts who say such powers lie outside the scope of presidential authority. “The president has no power on this score,” said Samuel Issacharoff, a constitutional law professor at the NYU School of Law. “It should be the last thing that we do in a democracy to cancel elections.” U.S. law doesn’t have any provisions allowing a president to stay in office after noon on Jan. 20 even in the case of a national emergency, according to a report this month from the Congressional Research Service. If no other avenues for picking a new president have worked, the rules of succession to fill a vacancy would kick in, the report said. If there isn’t a president or vice president to perform the duties of the office, the speaker of the House — a post currently held by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California — would act as president. If the speaker can’t serve, the president pro tempore of the Senate — currently Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa — would step in. The U.S. presidential election is unique in that under the Electoral College system voters who head to the polls in November aren’t technically voting for candidates, but rather “electors” who gather in December to formally pick the president. “The presidential electors are selected in the manner state legislatures shall set, and the Congress and the Senate are elected in such a manner as the Congress shall set,” Mr. Issacharoff said. While the Constitution grants power to the state legislatures to appoint electors, states operate under a system in which their Electoral College votes go to the winner of the popular vote of their state. Maine and Nebraska operate under a modified system in which they use both the statewide popular vote and the vote in each congressional district to distribute their electoral votes. Since 1845, Congress has required states to choose their electors “on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November,” though if states can’t meet that deadline it would fall to their legislatures to work out another date, the Congressional Research Service report said. “Unlike the practice of some states that allow the governor to postpone an election during emergencies, neither the Constitution nor Congress provide any similar power to the president or other federal officials to change this date outside of Congress’s regular legislative process,” the report said. Other legal experts agree that Mr. Trump can’t unilaterally cancel the election. They say he could try to use some of his discretion to set rules on where people can vote depending on how big of a risk the coronavirus is posing to public health in the fall. “People are already talking about Trump canceling the election in November, which is something that he can’t do,” said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. “Although I am concerned that he could issue orders that would close polling places.” Several states have postponed their presidential primaries amid the coronavirus pandemic, with officials saying the public shouldn’t be asked to put their safety at risk. On Friday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed legislation that moves his state’s primary to a largely vote-by-mail election, with limited in-person options on April 28 for people with disabilities or people who don’t have a home mailing address. Mr. DeWine invoked a last-minute public health emergency ahead of his state’s scheduled March 17 primary to delay in-person voting. He had previously advocated moving in-person voting to June 2. Derek Muller, a professor at Pepperdine’s Caruso School of Law, said states approving such delays lucked out in the sense that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden has all but clinched the Democratic nomination, which lessens the practical political effect of the postponements. “That’s not a luxury you get in November,” he said. “So maybe people feel a little bit better about pushing back primaries, but there is really no sort of failsafe in November. “The Constitution says that the terms of members of Congress end Jan. 3 and the term of the president ends Jan. 20th, so you could end up with no House and two-thirds of a Senate and that’s it,” he said. Mr. Biden said Mr. Trump doesn’t have the authority to postpone the election — though he added that the president could start a “drumbeat” saying that it should be postponed. “Democracy and dealing with this crisis have to be able to be done at the same time,” the former vice president said in a recent appearance on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”  ","Trump can't delay general election, legal experts say","Sunday, March 29, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/29/donald-trump-cant-delay-general-election-legal-exp/,washington_times
"President Trump on Sunday said he wants Americans to stay at home until April 30, abandoning his hope of opening up businesses by Easter as modeling suggested the U.S. coronavirus death toll could reach tens of thousands and peak two weeks from now. He said the White House will release a new strategy for states by Tuesday and hopes to have the economy on its way to recovery by June 1. It’s a sudden and somber shift for Mr. Trump, who on March 16 said he wanted Americans to work and learn at home, avoid nonessential travel and use takeout instead of entering restaurants through March 31. Now, faced with the highest case count in the world with more than 137,000 infections and over 2,400 deaths, he said the peak death rate isn’t expected until mid-April, so he extended his mitigation strategy through the end of the coming month. “You’re talking about a potential of up to 2.2 million [deaths], and some people said it could even be higher than that,” he said at a White House briefing. “And so if we can hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — it’s a horrible number, maybe even less, but to 100,000. … We all together have done a very good job.” Members of his coronavirus task force said modeling is based on a variety of issues and “extremes,” so people shouldn’t panic.

"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump says his administration has identified cases of “hoarding” of medical supplies and equipment by hospitals and medical professionals. As his administration looks to meet urgent shortfalls in personal protective equipment and ventilators needed for the coronavirus response, Trump is calling on them to release it to harder-hit areas. Says Trump: “We have some health care workers, some hospitals frankly, individual hospitals and hospital chains we have them hoarding equipment, including ventilators.” Trump is not naming names but says in some cases they’re in areas where they don’t expect the virus to have a major impact. He says: “These are areas that in some cases that probably will not need them and in some cases even if they do, they have too many.” Trump adds: “So they have to release ventilators if they have them, they have to release certain medical supplies and equipment.”  ","Trump accuses some hospitals of 'hoarding' ventilators, other needed supplies ","Sunday, March 29, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/29/trump-accuses-hospitals-hoarding-ventilators-other/,washington_times
"CENTRAL, La. — Hundreds of people flouted Louisiana’s COVID-19 ban on gatherings, coming on buses and in personal vehicles to the first of three Sunday services at their church a day after New Orleans police broke up a funeral gathering of about 100 people. An estimated 500 people of all ages filed inside the mustard-yellow and beige Life Tabernacle church in Central, a city of nearly 29,000 outside Baton Rouge. More than 3,500 Louisiana residents have been diagnosed with the disease caused by a new coronavirus, and more than 150 of them have died, according to state figures released Sunday. Deaths include that of the first federal prison inmate - a man with “serious preexisting conditions” who was being held in Oakdale, Lousiana, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons said Saturday. Assistant ministers and worshippers outside the front doors and in the parking lot at Life Tabernacle told media to leave, saying cameras would not be allowed on the property and worshippers had been told not to talk to reporters. They went inside without further comment. Across the street, neighbors gathered in a driveway, carefully staying at least 6 feet (about two meters) apart. Paul Quinn, a resident of Central who lives near the church, says this is a health hazard. “Other congregations are using the Internet, Skype, and other safe ways to congregate. Why can’t they? What makes them so special?” said Quinn. “I wish state police would come out and do something. This is above our little local police level. The state needs to get involved. If they get out of church and go to the grocery store, it’s a serious health hazard. They don’t know how many people they’re affecting, and they don’t seem to care. That’s a problem.” The virus has killed seven of more than 160 people diagnosed with the disease in East Baton Rouge Parish, according to state figures. In New Orleans, police broke up a “funeral repast” of about 100 people Saturday afternoon, issuing a warrant for a 28-year-old man who refused to shut it down and giving the band leader a summons, a news release said. Several complaints about that event were among more than 300 received in the past week about violations of a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people, Superintendent Shaun Ferguson said in a separate statement. More than 1,300 of the COVID-19 diagnoses and 73 of the deaths have been in New Orleans, and Gov. John Bel Edwards repeated on Sunday’s national news talk shows what he’s been saying for days: the city’s hospitals are likely to run out of ventilators by April 4 and of hospital bed space by April 10. New Orleans tourist economy has also been hit hard, with hotels, restaurants, bars, convention centers and other businesses closed, and food banks running low. Food banks got a boost when the U.S. Department of Agriculture agreed that they could use about 4 million pounds of stockpiled federal emergency supplies. New Orleans leaders had been asking for about a week before USDA granted the waivers Friday night, The Times-Picayune / The New Orleans Advocate reported. “We told them tens of thousands of people have been laid off in the hospitality industry, and they need food now,” City Councilwoman Helena Moreno said. “Then they kind of got it.”  ",Hundreds flout coronavirus gatherings ban at Louisiana church,"Sunday, March 29, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/29/life-tabernacle-louisiana-church-flouts-coronaviru/,washington_times
"It’s not the kind of question you want to field when you’re the prohibitive frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, but there it was. In an interview Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” host Chuck Todd asked former Vice President Joseph R. Biden: “Do you feel a little bit frustrated and powerless right now?” Mr. Biden said he didn’t, pointing out that he has been livestreaming during the coronavirus crisis from his basement in Delaware, drawing 20 million viewers last week. “No, you know, it’s interesting,” Mr. Biden said. “We have a makeshift studio here in my basement. I guess like you’re doing it now as well. But the point is that I was surprised to find out just the events we did this past week, I mean, beginning last Monday, over 20 million people have viewed them and listened.” Meanwhile, President Trump has seen his approval rating soar while pulling huge ratings for his near-daily COVID-19 press briefings, despite criticism from congressional Democrats who accuse him of not responding quickly enough to the pandemic. The president has pointed out that he slapped travel restrictions on China in late January when Congress was focused on the impeachment debate. Do you feel powerless during the pandemic?@joebiden: “No, it’s interesting. We have a makeshift studio in my basement like you’re doing. But … over 20M people have viewed [the events last week]. I guess it’s just a different way of learning how to communicate with people.” Mr. Biden said he would do a few things differently than Mr. Trump has, such as invoking the Defense Production Act not just for ventilators, as the president has done, but also for hospital masks and gowns, as well as push for more funding. “I’d also be talking about what the next stage of the funding we’re going to need,” Mr. Biden said. “We’ve gone through three stages. That’s not going to be enough to get us all the way through this. There’s a number of things I’d be doing, Chuck, that are not being done right now.” Mr. Trump signed last week a $2.2 trillion stimulus package aimed at getting money to businesses, state governments and individuals as they struggle amid mass closures aimed at stopping the spread of the fast-moving virus. Asked if he thought there was “blood on the president’s hands considering the slow response,” Mr. Biden demurred. “I think that’s a little too harsh,” said Mr. Biden, who suggested that the president “should stop thinking out loud and start thinking deeply.”  ",NBC's Chuck Todd to Joe Biden: 'Do you feel a little bit frustrated and powerless'?,"Sunday, March 29, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/29/chuck-todd-asks-joe-biden-do-you-feel-little-bit-f/,washington_times
"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Pennsylvania increased by more than 640 over the past day and four more people died, the state Health Department announced Sunday. The state’s health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine, said in a video news conference that 38 people in all have died in the state after being diagnosed with the coronavirus infection. In all, nearly 3,400 Pennsylvanians have tested positive, and infections have been confirmed in 58 of the 67 counties. Most of the people who have died or required hospitalization in Pennsylvania have been 65 or older. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. A look at coronavirus-related developments in Pennsylvania: ___ NURSING HOME OUTBREAK The medical director at a western Pennsylvania nursing home said 14 residents have become infected with the coronavirus and additional tests are pending.  Dr. Dave Thimons told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that staff are doing what they can to help those affected at the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver.  Levine said there have been 64 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in nursing homes across Pennsylvania, and most of them are in the state’s southeastern region of Philadelphia and its suburbs. Thirty-six of the state’s 695 nursing homes have confirmed cases. As of three days ago, there had been 33 confirmed COVID-19 cases in 17 Pennsylvania nursing homes, the Health Department said. At the Brighton facility, most of the positive tests were received on Saturday, the paper said. At least one patient with more severe symptoms was transferred to a hospital but most remain in the 500-bed nursing home. The facility has set up a COVID-19 unit to address the outbreak. ___ STATE LAYOFFS The Pennsylvania Office of Administration said Sunday that about 2,500 state workers were out of a job as of Friday because of the coronavirus. Agency spokesman Dan Egan said Sunday the job cuts were in response to a decline in state revenues in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. Egan said the workers were either laid off or put into a leave-without-pay status. He described them as generally being temporary or seasonal employees, part-timers and interns. Most will qualify for unemployment benefits. He gave as examples temporary clerical staff and people who work at the Transportation or Revenue departments on a seasonal basis.  “In many cases, these employees were already not working and not being paid, either due to offices being closed or slowing down of seasonal operations,” Egan said in an email.  The layoffs were first reported Sunday by Spotlight PA.  ___ FIRST CASE IN STATE PRISONS The first state prison inmate in Pennsylvania to test positive for COVID-19 is a prisoner at the State Correctional Institution-Phoenix in the Philadelphia suburbs, the Corrections Department announced Sunday.  The inmate is being isolated from others in the prison’s infirmary and their housing unit is under quarantine. The inmate has underlying health conditions.  Officials have traced the infected inmate’s interactions with others and increased cleaning of the prison is continuing, the agency announced. ___ IMMIGRATION DETAINEES Migrant advocates told The Philadelphia Inquirer that immigration detainees began a hunger strike in a central Pennsylvania prison to demand release during the coronavirus pandemic.  Federal immigration authorities told the paper Saturday that some detainees at the York County Prison had recently refused meals, while advocates said it was at least 180 people. Participants in the hunger strike are worried that prison staff could spread COVID-19 and that detainees who get sick may not receive proper medical care, the paper reported. ___ FEDERAL DECLARATION SOUGHT Pennsylvania’s governor says the state’s COVID-19 outbreak response would be helped by a federal major disaster declaration. Gov. Tom Wolf made a formal request for the declaration on Sunday, saying it would provide additional help to governments responding to the crisis. Wolf, a Democrat, signed a disaster emergency proclamation for Pennsylvania on March 6 and it remains in effect.

"PHOENIX — The woman who led Arizona’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has resigned effective immediately. Wendy Smith-Reeve, director of the Arizona Division of Emergency Management, submitted her resignation Saturday and it was accepted by Gov. Doug Ducey’s office. In Smith-Reeve’s resignation letter, she cited concerns that her role is being addressed by other agencies and her “presence and function is duplicative” during the COVID-19 pandemic. The state’s emergency operations will now be directed by Maj. Gen. Michael T. McGuire. Anthony Cox, who has served as deputy director since 2017, now is the acting director. Smith-Reeve, who reported to McGuire, had been the director since May 2013 after joining as a finance specialist for the Public Assistance Program within the recovery section in September 1996. She managed the state’s emergency preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation efforts. “We appreciate Deputy Director Smith-Reeve’s service,” McGuire said in a statement. “As Director of DEMA, I am grateful for Mr. Cox’s willingness to assume the director of the Division of Emergency Management position. I have full confidence and trust that Mr. Cox, along with the deep bench of talented and capable leaders on the DEMA team, will not miss a beat as we drive on to serve the great state and citizens of Arizona.” Gubernatorial spokesman Daniel Scarpinato tweeted that “Arizona is grateful to have the very steady leadership of Major General McGuire leading our emergency operations during this critical time,” adding that the state “won’t miss a beat with him and his team at the helm.” Ducey signed an $11.8 billion budget Saturday that includes $50 million to help the state deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Arizona health officials said Sunday that the state now has tallied at least 912 COVID-19 cases and 16 deaths, up by 139 cases and one death since Saturday. Maricopa County, the state’s most populous county and where the most coronavirus cases have been reported so far in Arizona, now has 546 cases. Pima County has 147. Of Arizona’s 15 counties, only Greenlee County hasn’t reported any coronavirus cases. The Navajo Nation reports 115 cases of which 94 in Arizona on the vast reservation that also includes parts of New Mexico and Utah.

"The State Department is touting a nearly $300 million American aid package for dozens of countries battling coronavirus at a moment when China seeks to portray itself as the global leader in responding to the pandemic. A department fact sheet circulated in recent days asserted outright that the “U.S. Government is leading the world’s humanitarian and health assistance response to the COVID-19 pandemic.” Department officials issued the document Friday after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the freeing up of $274 million in new American humanitarian aid. Mr. Pompeo said the money “will provide resources to 64 of the world’s most at-risk countries to better combat the pandemic and enable the UN High Commissioner on Refugees to assist some of the world’s most vulnerable populations.” The funds include some $50 million allocated to 19 different nations in Africa for a range of initiatives — from bolstering public information campaigns about coronavirus to beefing up funding for health officials tracking its spread. Nigeria, which is by far the continent’s most populous nation with more than 200 million people, will receive some $7 million in health-focused aid, according to the State Department fact sheet. The aid allocation reaches far beyond Africa as well, with roughly $15 million to be spread among 12 Eastern European and Eurasian nations. That includes Ukraine, which will receive more than $1.2 million to “help prepare laboratory systems” aimed at bolstering the country’s ability to identify and track coronavirus patients. The fact sheet noted that U.S. government aid has provided long-term health investments in Ukraine over the past 20 years totaling nearly $362 million — on top of the some $5 billion in security and other U.S. assistance provided to Kiev over the same period. It also outlined aid packages for several nations in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East — more than $15 million is going to Iraq — as well as nearly $90 million to be channeled through the United Nations and toward the World Health Organization. The State Department also cited 22 nations across Asia that will receive millions in aid. The fact sheet did not, however, mention China at a moment when U.S. and Chinese officials are trading barbs over the coronavirus. U.S. officials say Beijing has engaged in a global propaganda campaign to blame America for the pandemic, while attempting to project an image of China as the global leader in helping nations respond to it. China critics at U.S. think tanks say Beijing is pushing false claims about its international aid efforts. “The most remarkable case,” according to Mike Watson, an analyst with the Hudson Institute in Washington, “is in Italy, where China’s ostentatious delivery of supplies and doctors has caused much consternation among Americans who worry that the United States is losing its global leadership role.” “Media accounts often omitted that the supplies were bought and paid for by the Italians, when the most newsworthy element to the story is that China actually kept its commitment to deliver what it sold,” Mr. Watson wrote last week in the National Review. “Overall, China has returned to Europe about as much medical equipment as it received, taking credit for in effect receiving supplies from northern and central Europe and delivering them later to southern Europe — but unlike the European donors, the Chinese aren’t doing it for free,” he wrote. “Chinese Communists are boasting about their magnanimity and are letting Germany and the European Union take the blame for shortages across Europe that are largely due to Chinese hoarding. This is not philanthropy; this is mercantilism.” Beijing has pushed back against such characterizations. An opinion article published Sunday by Global Times — a Beijing tabloid controlled by the Chinese government — claimed China “has offered over 80 countries and international organizations emergency assistance to fight the coronavirus pandemic, sent seven teams of medical experts to five badly-hit countries including Iran and Italy, and held dozens of video conferences with various countries to share experiences.” The article went on to argue that “some in the West are once again politicizing the assistance China provided, making it another weapon to slander China.” At a press conference last week, Mr. Pompeo told reporters that Beijing is engaged in a “disinformation campaign,” that has pushed false narratives about the coronavirus, including conspiracy theories that the virus originated in the U.S. and was spread to China. “This is crazy talk,” the secretary of state said. Teams of international scientists, including several from inside China, have agreed for more than a month that the virus came from a “wet market” in the Chinese city of Wuhan — where fish, poultry and other animals are slaughtered on the premises. Mr. Pompeo did not mention China in a statement on the new U.S. humanitarian aid allocation last week. He did, however, promote the United States as the “the single largest health and humanitarian donor” to nations worldwide. “Since 2009, American taxpayers have generously funded more than $100 billion in health assistance and nearly $70 billion in humanitarian assistance globally,” he said. He went on to describe the newly allocated $274 million as an “initial investment,” noting President Trump’s early-March signing of the “Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which includes $1.3 billion in additional U.S. foreign assistance to help countries around the world respond to this pandemic.”  ",State Department: U.S. 'leading the world' in coronavirus fight while China takes credit,"Sunday, March 29, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/29/state-department-us-leading-world-coronavirus-figh/,washington_times
"For weeks, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio encouraged New Yorkers to “go about your lives” as fears of the novel coronavirus spread, advice that has come back to haunt him as the pandemic takes a deadly toll on the Big Apple. Asked Sunday about whether his message was in part to blame for the virus’s rapid spread, however, Mr. de Blasio told CNN’s Jake Tapper that this was no time for hindsight. “Well, Jake, we should not be focusing in my view on anything looking back on any level of government right now,” Mr. de Blasio said on “State of the Union.” “This is just about how we save lives going forward. We all were working, everybody was working with the information we had, and trying of course to avoid panic.” He added, “I mean, this was a very different world just a short time ago. But the bottom line is, we none of us have time to look backwards. I’m trying to figure out how we get through Sunday, next Sunday, and then what we do the week after that. And that’s the only thing we should be talking about in this country.” In late January, Mr. de Blasio said, “It’s important just to go about your lives, continue living as you have,” a message that he repeated in February with statements such as, “This should not stop you from going about your life, should not stop you from going to Chinatown and going out to eat.” As late as a March 11 press conference, the mayor said that health people should still dine out, noting “the virus does not transmit through food and drink,” and adding, “If you’re not sick, then you should be going about your life.” Such advice has not aged well, especially since Mr. de Blasio has since accused President Trump of being slow to react. On March 18, he accused the president of “taking actions that are far, far behind the curve.” Was the mayor slow to respond? He said Sunday he didn’t think so, citing his previous calls for more COVID-19 testing. “Jake, I in real time said, and this was weeks and weeks ago, as it was happening, that we were not being given the testing we needed,” Mr. de Blasio said. “I think the big historical point here that will be looked back on is, if this country had had the testing when we needed it, this could have been a very different reality.” He continued: “But there’s no time to go back over that. There’s only time to focus on getting through the next week and the week after that.” For weeks, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to “go about their lives.” About his past comments, de Blasio now says “we should not be focusing, in my view, on anything looking back on any level of government right now” #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/7fZZOHoPBS  ",Jake Tapper grills Bill de Blasio as 'go about your lives' calls haunt NYC mayor,"Sunday, March 29, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/29/jake-tapper-grills-bill-de-blasio-go-about-your-li/,washington_times
"TORONTO — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s wife said Saturday that she has recovered from being ill from COVID-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus. “I am feeling so much better,” Sophie Gregoire Trudeau said in a statement on social media. She said she received the clearance from her doctor and Ottawa Public Health. Trudeau’s office announced on March 12 that she had tested positive for the coronavirus after she fell ill upon returning from a trip to London. The prime minister and his family have been in self isolation at home since then. He and their three children didn’t show symptoms. Justin Trudeau has been giving daily news conferences outside his residence. He said earlier Saturday that his wife was in in fine form. “From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to everyone who reached out to me with their well wishes. And to everyone who is suffering right now, I send you all my love,” she said. The prime minister suggested Saturday that he would continue to work from home to set an example for Canadians who are being asked to stay at home. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, meanwhile, said Saturday that it is prohibiting gatherings of five people or more. The order was effective immediately and replaced one that prohibited public events of over 50 people. It does not apply to households with five or more people, and funerals will be permitted with up to 10 people at one time. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said if the virus is to be stopped, extraordinary measures are needed to ensure physical distancing. The province has already closed all nonessential services. Quebec announced police checkpoints in eight regions outside the province’s major cities where the population is deemed more at risk. Quebec Deputy Premier Genevieve Guilbault said that only essential travel will be allowed in those areas and that provincial police have also set up checkpoints near the Canada-U.S. border to intercept snowbirds coming back to Quebec to ensure they understand there is a 14-day quarantine. Canada has more than 5,616 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 61 deaths. About 445 people have recovered.

"The rash of states postponing or modifying their primary elections because of the coronavirus raises a question: Can President Trump delay or cancel November’s elections and extend his presidency because of the crisis? In a word, no, according to legal experts who say such powers lie outside the scope of presidential authority. “The president has no power on this score,” said Samuel Issacharoff, a constitutional law professor at the NYU School of Law. “It should be the last thing that we do in a democracy to cancel elections.” U.S. law doesn’t have any provisions allowing a president to stay in office after noon on Jan. 20 even in the case of a national emergency, according to a report this month from the Congressional Research Service. If no other avenues for picking a new president have worked, the rules of succession to fill a vacancy would kick in, the report said. If there isn’t a president or vice president to perform the duties of the office, the speaker of the House — a post currently held by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California — would act as president. If the speaker can’t serve, the president pro tempore of the Senate — currently Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa — would step in. The U.S. presidential election is unique in that under the Electoral College system voters who head to the polls in November aren’t technically voting for candidates, but rather “electors” who gather in December to formally pick the president. “The presidential electors are selected in the manner state legislatures shall set, and the Congress and the Senate are elected in such a manner as the Congress shall set,” Mr. Issacharoff said. While the Constitution grants power to the state legislatures to appoint electors, states operate under a system in which their Electoral College votes go to the winner of the popular vote of their state. Maine and Nebraska operate under a modified system in which they use both the statewide popular vote and the vote in each congressional district to distribute their electoral votes. Since 1845, Congress has required states to choose their electors “on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November,” though if states can’t meet that deadline it would fall to their legislatures to work out another date, the Congressional Research Service report said. “Unlike the practice of some states that allow the governor to postpone an election during emergencies, neither the Constitution nor Congress provide any similar power to the president or other federal officials to change this date outside of Congress’s regular legislative process,” the report said. Other legal experts agree that Mr. Trump can’t unilaterally cancel the election. They say he could try to use some of his discretion to set rules on where people can vote depending on how big of a risk the coronavirus is posing to public health in the fall. “People are already talking about Trump canceling the election in November, which is something that he can’t do,” said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. “Although I am concerned that he could issue orders that would close polling places.” Several states have postponed their presidential primaries amid the coronavirus pandemic, with officials saying the public shouldn’t be asked to put their safety at risk. On Friday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed legislation that moves his state’s primary to a largely vote-by-mail election, with limited in-person options on April 28 for people with disabilities or people who don’t have a home mailing address. Mr. DeWine invoked a last-minute public health emergency ahead of his state’s scheduled March 17 primary to delay in-person voting. He had previously advocated moving in-person voting to June 2. Derek Muller, a professor at Pepperdine’s Caruso School of Law, said states approving such delays lucked out in the sense that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden has all but clinched the Democratic nomination, which lessens the practical political effect of the postponements. “That’s not a luxury you get in November,” he said. “So maybe people feel a little bit better about pushing back primaries, but there is really no sort of failsafe in November. “The Constitution says that the terms of members of Congress end Jan. 3 and the term of the president ends Jan. 20th, so you could end up with no House and two-thirds of a Senate and that’s it,” he said. Mr. Biden said Mr. Trump doesn’t have the authority to postpone the election — though he added that the president could start a “drumbeat” saying that it should be postponed. “Democracy and dealing with this crisis have to be able to be done at the same time,” the former vice president said in a recent appearance on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”  ","Trump can't delay general election, legal experts say","Sunday, March 29, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/29/donald-trump-cant-delay-general-election-legal-exp/,washington_times
"Alfredo Ortiz, president and CEO of the conservative Job Creators Network, didn’t recognize the number on his ringing cellphone, so he didn’t answer. The voicemail surprised him. It was Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, who was seeking his input as the Trump administration and Congress scrambled last week to assemble a $2 trillion package to fight the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. “I thought it was actually a scam call,” Mr. Ortiz said. “I listened to the voicemail, and it was like, ‘Hey, Alfredo, this is Steven, you know, the Treasury secretary, just trying to get a hold of you. Give me a buzz back when you get a chance.’ “ Mr. Mnuchin is sometimes viewed warily by conservatives who consider him a Democrat in President Trump’s inner sanctum. But the 57-year-old former Wall Street executive is getting high marks for his round-the-clock efforts to rescue the economy and serve as a liaison between the president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. The president and the speaker haven’t spoken in five months. “He’s even-keeled,” said a Republican familiar with the exhaustive negotiations. “He was spending long hours and really late nights at the Capitol, going between the minority and majority leader’s office.” A Democratic aide said of Mr. Mnuchin, “You can deal with him.” The president said his Treasury secretary “lived over in that beautiful building,” and Mr. Mnuchin agreed that he spent about five days in the LBJ Room, an ornate, frescoed space near the Senate chamber. American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp said of Mr. Mnuchin, “He had a big week, but more importantly, he did his country a lot of good.” Mr. Trump signed the rescue package Friday. Mr. Mnuchin now is working to make sure that direct payments of $1,200 to most Americans and billions of dollars in loans to small businesses are delivered rapidly. “This doesn’t do people any good if it takes a long time,” Mr. Mnuchin said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Mr. Ortiz, whose network represents small businesses, did call back after that missed phone call last week to emphasize to Mr. Mnuchin the need to get government loans to small business owners quickly. He also urged Mr. Mnuchin to extend aid to “gig” workers and independent contractors, who usually don’t qualify for help. In the same week, a record 3.2 million people filed for unemployment benefits. “We talked on multiple occasions, despite the world basically collapsing around him and trying to get the left and the right together on ideas to work with the White House,” Mr. Ortiz said. “He sounded cool, calm and collected. He took the time he needed to listen to our ideas, and not at one moment did I ever feel rushed by him. If anything, I felt like I was taking too much of his time.” A partner at Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 2002, Mr. Mnuchin later established himself in Hollywood for bankrolling several successful and some mediocre movies, including “American Sniper” in 2014 and “The LEGO movie.” He got an acting credit for playing himself in a nonspeaking role as a Wall Street banker with Warren Beatty in “Rules Don’t Apply,” a film that also featured his future wife, Louise Linton. When Mr. Mnuchin became national finance chairman of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign in the spring of 2016, many conservatives didn’t share Mr. Trump’s confidence in him. “He comes from the banking world, and he had a reputation for being a Democrat,” Mr. Schlapp said. “He obviously earned a lot of respect and credibility from all of us with the amazing job he did on finance for the president’s election in 2016, and he’s figured Washington out.” The massive cost of the rescue package, including four months worth of unemployment benefits that will pay many workers 100% or more of what they were earning in their jobs, isn’t sitting well with many conservatives. Mr. Schlapp also pointed to “dandelions” in the package such as $25 million for the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and $75 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds National Public Radio. “This is odious and unfortunately typical of the Democratic Party,” he said. “No conservative likes the price tag.” Mr. Mnuchin said the administration needed buy-in from Democrats at a critical moment for the country. “There’s never a deal until it’s done,” he told Fox News host Sean Hannity. “We were negotiating through the whole period. We took out anything having to do with wind [power] and the environmental issues. The president cut lots and lots of things out of this deal.” He added, “When I do business deals, it’s win and win. But here, we needed bipartisan support. There was a price to pay.” Mr. Schlapp said most conservatives are withholding their criticisms, for now, because they understand that the pandemic created unprecedented economic challenges. “I think most conservatives realize that never before has the government so broadly swiped away American economic rights, and for good reason,” Mr. Schlapp said. “Literally, not allowing people to go to work, not allowing people to operate their businesses — that’s an economic taking, and the government shouldn’t be allowed to do that without a financial settlement from those who had the economic loss. That’s predominantly what we’re seeing here.” One of the stickiest negotiating points with Democrats was a $500 billion fund to provide loans to distressed corporations. Democrats wouldn’t support the package until the White House agreed to a special inspector general to review how the administration allocates the loans. But Mr. Trump notified Congress after signing the aid package that he will insist on presidential “supervision” of the yet-to-be appointed inspector general. The development rankled Democrats, who said it was a retreat on the bargain struck by Mr. Mnuchin. Mrs. Pelosi said Sunday that Democrats won’t allow the president to have unilateral control over the loan process. In an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Mrs. Pelosi also seemed to bristle at Mr. Mnuchin’s focus on the harm inflicted on financial markets during the economic shutdown. She recalled a meeting with Mr. Mnuchin a week ago Sunday in the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican. “I said to them, since this is Sunday and the churches are closed, I want to begin bipartisan meeting with a prayer,” Mrs. Pelosi said. “And I quoted Pope Francis’ word of prayer under this circumstance. And he said, ‘I pray that God would enlighten those who are responsible for the common good, that they would take responsibility for those in their care.’ And Secretary Mnuchin said, ‘Well, since you quoted Pope Francis, I will quote the markets.’ And so that has taken us to another area of values, to me, about this.” The president, who hasn’t spoken to Mrs. Pelosi since a frosty meeting Oct. 16 as the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry picked up steam, summed up Mr. Mnuchin’s value to his administration and to the nation. “He’s a fantastic guy, and he loves our country,” the president said. “And he’s been dealing with both sides — Republican and Democrat.”  ",Mnuchin wins bipartisan praise for ushering rescue bill past steep political hurdles,"Sunday, March 29, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/29/steven-mnuchin-wins-praise-coronavirus-stimulus-bi/,washington_times
"President Trump said Monday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s obsession with his impeachment continued into the coronavirus outbreak, hitting back at her accusation that the president “fiddles” while people have been dying. “Don’t forget, she was playing the impeachment game, her game where she ended up looking like a fool,” Mr. Trump said on “Fox & Friends.” “All she did for a long time was impeach, impeach.

"We already know that a wide variety of major print, broadcast and online news organizations continue to produce coverage meant to undermine President Trump and his administration as the teams do battle against the coronavirus pandemic. The official efforts are an evolving, quick-moving process with promising results, the public updates delivered with considerable candor from those monitoring every facet of the response. In other eras, U.S. presidents and public officials would have received support from the press through helpful, fair and honest coverage meant to keep the public informed and engaged. But not this time around. Here’s some pertinent advice from a Fox News Channel host Greg Gutfeld regarding the coronavirus crisis and the liberal news media’s unending bias and animosity against Mr. Trump and the White House coronavirus task force. “We can hold this country together with or without the media’s help, and believe me they are not helping much, if at all,” Mr. Gutfeld told his audience over the weekend, with a warning about what appears to be the media’s own malaise. “I have no doubt we will exit this dark period stronger and better than before. Jobs will return. The economy will roar back. The truth will come out. And we will have saved many lives. And the only sickness that lingers, the one that seems impervious to drugs, is the media’s own incurable bias. Best to keep your distance permanently,” said Mr. Gutfeld. A HANDY SUMMATION No wonder Democrats are nervous. “Despite the relentless attacks from Democrats and the media, a strong majority of America is behind President Trump’s leadership during the coronavirus pandemic,” advises Steve Guest, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee, who supplies this handy summation of public opinion polls conducted in the last week: “ABC/Washington Post poll: 66% express confidence in the federal government’s ability to handle the outbreak,” Mr. Guests said. A Gallup poll revealed 60% approve of the president’s response to the coronavirus. The Gallup poll also showed an increase in the president’s approval rating among independents and Democrats. Another Hill-Harris poll found that 61% of voters say Mr. Trump is taking strong measures to slow or stop coronavirus spread while an ABC/Ipsos poll: revealed that 55% of the public approve of the president’s management of the crisis. And finally, a CBS News poll found that 53% say Mr. Trump is doing “a good job of handling the outbreak.” GETTING CRANKY “President Trump’s approval Is spiking, and the Left can’t stand it,” writes David Marcus, a columnist for The Federalist. “You would think that most people would view this as good thing, I mean, in the middle of a crisis, having faith in leadership is better than not having faith in leadership, right? For many on the left, though, these numbers are cause for consternation,” Mr. Marcus writes. He cited CNN analyst Ana Navarro-Cardenas who was perplexed by a recent ABC poll with a 51% approval rating for the president. “Who are these 51% of Americans who approve of the way this lying, narcissistic, science-denying, petty, partisan, infantile, intellectual wasteland, lame excuse for a President with the vocabulary of a 4 year-old (apologies to 4 year-olds), is mishandling this crisis? Really,” the analyst wrote in a tweet. Mr. Marcus said that “for Trump supporters, this is all obviously delicious. But that really isn’t the point. The point is that in a time of national crisis, Trump has changed his behavior and risen to the challenge. Our friends on the left either can’t or refuse to see this. But the American people do. And they are the ones who decide the fate of Trump’s reelection chances, not the bobble-headed pundits that people PBS, CNN, and MSNBC.” THE ABORTION IRONY Abortion awareness has taken on a new meaning during the coronavirus pandemic, particularly when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other pro-choice factions insist that funds for the procedure should be considered a vital part of the $2.4 trillion national coronavirus aid response. “You know you live in a healthy society when its ‘elite’ journalists demand even more dead bodies than those being produced by a pandemic. That’s precisely what the New York Times editorial board asked for in their recent piece that called for even ‘more’ abortions during the coronavirus outbreak. Imagine that; even as normal life has been interrupted all around us, lefties need abortion mills to be one of the few constant and sure things still operating,” writes Gabriel Hays, a Media Research Center cultural analyst. He cites a recent op-ed titled “Make Abortion More Available During the Pandemic — Not Less”  in which the Times made the case that abortions were an “essential” component of comprehensive health care. “Ah, yes, killing kids is as essential as the ER doctor saving lives. This is just a dark Orwellian leftist game. The notion that someone wanting an abortion is an equal emergency to someone’s imminent death from coronavirus or a heart attack is not convincing,” writes Mr. Hays. Our old friend “Deep Woods” — a longtime political commentator who indeed lives in the dense woods of the Northeast — agrees with the analyst. “Does anyone else see the irony of spending $2 trillion to save the lives of adults and elders, yet spend another $600 million to kill a million babies a year?” he writes from a “hunker bunker” up north, in a terse note to Inside the Beltway.

"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Monday said House Democrats could try to “blackmail” President Trump into signing more rounds of legislation in response to the escalating coronavirus outbreak. “I think it’s very likely that the House, where the radicals are in control, would love to blackmail the country. They tried on this last bill and failed,” Mr. Gingrich said on “Fox & Friends.” “They’re salivating at the idea that they could produce a new bill with everything they’ve ever wanted in life and somehow blackmail the president into signing it,” he said. Congress recently cleared a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package, and Mr. Gingrich said there will likely be at least a technical corrections bill. He said Mr. Trump and the GOP shouldn’t accept “radical policies” to get things done. The former speaker had recently used similar language when Congress was crafting the package, saying Democratic leaders were trying to blackmail the GOP. Democrats said they managed to win additional concessions in the $2.2 trillion package by delaying proceedings in the Senate for a few days, but the GOP said the final bill was very similar to one authored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans. Democrats have already been talking about at least one more round of coronavirus-related legislation. Congress had already cleared bills to boost federal health funding and expand the social safety net in response to the outbreak.

"ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Manolis Glezos, a Greek World War II resistance hero, who remained active in politics into his nineties, has died in Athens. He was 97. Government spokesman Stelios Petsas expressed the government’s condolences minutes after Glezos‘ death was announced Monday. Authorities at a public hospital where Glezos had been treated said he died of heart failure. He is to be given a state funeral, though details were not immediately known. At age 18, Glezos and a friend and fellow university student, Lakis Santas, climbed up the Acropolis in Athens at night and cut down the Nazi flag. It had been raised one month earlier when the country fell under German occupation in the spring of 1941. “It was a large flag and when it fell it covered us. We got it off us, hugged and danced a little, right on the spot,” Glezos told a program for state television decades later. The two students had studied access to the heavily guarded Acropolis from books at a public library. Glezos was repeatedly imprisoned during the war by the occupation authorities as well as after the war when Greece endured a three-year civil war and decades of political upheaval. He worked as a journalist for the official Greek Communist Party newspaper and the left-wing daily Avgi, and remained active in politics throughout his life, returning to the birthplace of his mother, the island of Paros, at age 88, to serve on the municipal council. He re-entered national politics in 2012 as a member of Parliament with the left-wing Syriza party led by former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, before being elected to the European Parliament in 2014. He retired the following year, but continued to lend his public support to protest initiatives, mostly against harsh economic austerity linked to the financial crisis and international bailout. Conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, led tributes to Glezos, describing him as a “lion-hearted man with a kind look.” ‘Greeks are poorer today following the death of Manolis Glezos, but he leaves the country richer for the life that he led and the example he gave: a genuine patriot and true fighter. ” ___ Corrects previous version to note that island of Paros was birthplace of Glezos‘ mother.

He said former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe and the FBI’s Russia investigation set back relations between the two nations. “They would love to be able to do trade with our country,” he said. “It’s been very much hindered by the nonsense that’s been going on Russia Russia Russia, which turned out to be a total hoax, when you look at what happened with [Former FBI Director James B.] Comey and [Deputy Director Andrew] McCabe, and you look at all of the things that happened with the Mueller report, the whole thing turned out to be a hoax. And it really stops us from getting along with other countries. It’s an important country that we should get along with.” The president announced Sunday that he will extend a nationwide voluntary social distancing guidelines through April 30, abandoning his hope of reopening parts of the country by Easter. “I listen to the experts. We picked the end of April … as the day where we can see some real progress,” Mr. Trump said. “Maybe [by] June 1, we think, it’s a terrible thing to say, but we think that death rate will be at a very low number. If we didn’t do anything, 2.2 million people could have died.” Dr. Deborah Birx, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, said Monday there could be 100,000 to 200,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. if people follow the guidelines “almost perfectly.”  ",Trump slams Pelosi for fixating on impeachment after she accuses him of ignoring pandemic," -

"Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin on Monday said Small Business Administration loans in the $2.2 trillion economic rescue package that Congress passed last week should be available starting Friday. That “will be at lightning speed,” Mr. Mnuchin said on Fox Business Network. “We hope later today that we’ll be releasing the documents and the instructions — it’ll be a very simple process.” He said they expect the $350 billion in small-business loans will cover about 50% of the private workforce. The SBA loans are intended to cover eight weeks of payroll and about 25% of overhead for qualifying companies with 500 or fewer employees. If the companies use the money to bring back or pay employees the loan will be forgiven. “If we run out of money and this is a huge success, we will absolutely go back to Congress and ask for more money,” he said. He also said that the direct deposit checks of at least $1,200 would be showing up in Americans’ accounts in three weeks. The checks were another major part of the package Congress passed in response to the escalating coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Mnuchin said the existing package should help sustain the U.S. economy for the next 8-12 weeks. Asked about providing hazard pay for first responders and nurses, Mr. Mnuchin said that’s definitely something they would put in the “next bill” but that he’s not yet organizing a fourth coronavirus-related legislative package. In addition to the $2.2 trillion rescue package President Trump signed last week, Congress had also cleared legislation that increased federal health funding and boosted some social safety net programs.

"President Trump said Monday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s obsession with his impeachment continued into the coronavirus outbreak, hitting back at her accusation that the president “fiddles” while people have been dying. “Don’t forget, she was playing the impeachment game, her game where she ended up looking like a fool,” Mr. Trump said on “Fox & Friends.” “All she did for a long time was impeach, impeach. This went on for years.” He was responding to Mrs. Pelosi blaming the president on Sunday for not preparing for the pandemic, saying, “while the president fiddles, people are dying.” “It’s a sad thing. She’s a sick puppy,” Mr. Trump said. “She’s got a lot of problems, and that’s a terrible thing to say.” The president said he would be speaking by phone on Monday morning with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Moscow’s oil price war with Saudi Arabia, as well as the pandemic and trade issues. He said former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe and the FBI’s Russia investigation set back relations between the two nations. “They would love to be able to do trade with our country,” he said. “It’s been very much hindered by the nonsense that’s been going on Russia Russia Russia, which turned out to be a total hoax, when you look at what happened with [Former FBI Director James B.] Comey and [Deputy Director Andrew] McCabe, and you look at all of the things that happened with the Mueller report, the whole thing turned out to be a hoax. And it really stops us from getting along with other countries. It’s an important country that we should get along with.” The president announced Sunday that he will extend a nationwide voluntary social distancing guidelines through April 30, abandoning his hope of reopening parts of the country by Easter. “I listen to the experts. We picked the end of April … as the day where we can see some real progress,” Mr. Trump said. “Maybe [by] June 1, we think, it’s a terrible thing to say, but we think that death rate will be at a very low number. If we didn’t do anything, 2.2 million people could have died.” Dr. Deborah Birx, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, said Monday there could be 100,000 to 200,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. if people follow the guidelines “almost perfectly.”  ",Trump slams Pelosi for fixating on impeachment after she accuses him of ignoring pandemic,"Monday, March 30, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/30/trump-slams-pelosi-fixating-impeachment-after-she-/,washington_times

"Gov. Andrew Cuomo has emerged as the Democrat of the moment as he leads New York’s response to the coronavirus. The daily press conferences in which he delivers sobering assessments of his state’s worst-in-the-nation crisis have earned him plaudits from many quarters — and given Democrats a national figure rivaling President Trump amid the coronavirus crisis. “He has filled a national void,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a New York-based Democratic consultant who has worked against and for Mr. Cuomo. “He and Trump are in competition for the spotlight, no question, and Trump appears to be in many ways less credible than Cuomo because Cuomo keeps saying it is going to get worse and Trump says this will disappear immediately.” Mr. Cuomo, in his third term as governor, was one of the first to impose a shelter-in-place policy for residents. He’s also battled, cajoled and praised the federal government over its response. Even as New York cases of COVID-19 soar, so does Mr. Cuomo’s popularity. His favorable-unfavorable rating is now 71-23 to the positive among state residents, according to a Siena College poll Monday. That’s up from 44-50 last month. His handling of the coronavirus crisis earns the approval of 87% of state residents in the poll, including 70% of Republicans. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, got positive reviews from just 41% of respondents. The president is tracking Mr. Cuomo’s performance and said Monday he would have made a better presidential nominee for his party than current frontrunner Joseph R. Biden — though Mr. Trump claimed some credit for Mr. Cuomo’s rise. “One of the reasons his numbers are high on handling it is because of the federal government,” Mr. Trump said on “Fox and Friends.” “Because we give him ships, and we give him ventilators and we give him all of the things that we are giving him … We’re giving him four hospitals and four medical centers and all of the things that we have done.” Before the virus, Mr. Cuomo was prepping for a fight over a $6 billion gap in the state budget that he had blamed in large part on a minimum wage increase and increased Medicaid costs. He faced anger even among the Democratic Party’s left wing, which has long questioned his commitment to liberal goals. That’s disappeared amid the virus. “Voters are seeing a side of Cuomo that they rarely if ever have seen, and that is the personal side of Andrew Cuomo,” said Steven Greenberg, a pollster with Siena College. “He is talking about his mom, talking about his daughters, trying to be a comforter.” The pollster said Mr. Cuomo has shown the ability to be reassuring, even as he’s delivering grim news about the virus. It’s very different than the rough and gruff style he displayed for much of his political career, part of a political dynasty — his father also served three terms as governor — while making a name for himself, first as a Cabinet official in the Clinton administration and then as New York’s attorney general. “He knows the state inside out, and he knows politics inside out, and he was basically his father’s Lee Atwater and Karl Rove,” said a New York-based GOP consultant, who has followed Mr. Cuomo’s career. “He is the governor, he is the candidate, he is the campaign manager — all rolled into one.” Speaking Monday in New York, Mr. Cuomo said the number of positive coronavirus cases in the state had risen to 66,000 and the death toll has climbed to 1,218 — up from 965 deaths a day earlier. “That is a lot of loss, that is a lot of pain, that is a lot of tears, that is a lot of grief that people all across this state are feeling,” Mr. Cuomo said. He said his administration is mapping out its response based on the advice of scientists, health care professionals, and data. “There is no crystal ball, but there is science and there is data and there are health professionals who have studied this virus and its progress since China,” he said. Asked about Mr. Trump’s comments, Mr. Cuomo said he takes the president’s comments as a compliment and said his focus is working with the president whenever possible to help protect New York. “If you are doing the right thing by New York, I will say it,” Mr. Cuomo said. “If he is doing the wrong thing for New York, or the rest of the country, I will say it. But I am not going to engage in politics.” Some analysts warn not to read too much into Mr. Cuomo’s popularity spike, pointing out that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and New York Gov. George Pataki saw their support skyrocket following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. They both made runs for the GOP’s presidential nomination — Mr. Giuliani in 2008, and Mr. Pataki in 2016. Both ended badly. “Down the road speculation tends to be destructive,” Mr. Sheinkopf said. “Talk to ‘President’ Rudy Giuliani.”  ",‘He has filled a national void’: Andrew Cuomo emerges as Democrats’ counterweight to Trump,"Monday, March 30, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/30/andrew-cuomo-emerges-donald-trump-counterweight-am/,washington_times
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and some of her top chairmen  outlined the Democratic priorities for a phase four coronavirus package  on Monday, but she said she won’t rush to push the bill through. Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, said she doesn’t expect  the package to be ready until after Easter and Passover. However,  lawmakers are working on the package remotely so it will ready for a  vote when Congress returns. “All three of our bills have been bipartisan and we would  want this one to be so as well,” she said. “So right now we’re  collecting information, taking inventory — what are the actual needs.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said last week he  wanted Congress to hold off on pushing through any more major  coronavirus packages until the first three bills had a chance to have an  effect. Phase one cost $8.3 billion, followed by a nearly $105 billion  phase two package, and then last week’s $2.2 trillion phase three. But Democrats already have a long list of issues they want to tackle.One  of their top priorities is shoring up Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) protections for workers on the front line fighting  the coronavirus or ensuring essential businesses keep running. House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Rep. Bobby  Scott of Virginia will take the lead on that portion of the package. He  said the bill would include a measure to have OSHA issue a temporary  emergency standard within seven days to require employers to craft new  protections for affected employees. Democrats also want to expand the types of workers covered  under emergency OSHA protections, including grocers and Transportation  Security Administration employees. “Legislation is required. It’s been blocked three times.  If we fail to act, it will make the situation more dangerous,” Mrs.  Pelosi said. “Rather than call them our heroes, rather than just thank  them, we have to protect them.” Mrs. Pelosi wants the package to also consider how  Americans and the economy will recover from the virus, with a focus on  infrastructure, specifically broadband access and water resources. “There are infrastructure needs that our country has that  directly relate to how we are proceeding with the coronavirus. Many more  people are teleworking, or tele-educating or really communicating with  family and friends,” Mrs. Pelosi said. Democrats also want to undo a part of the phase three bill  that was signed into law last week that categorized D.C. as a  territory, a move Mrs. Pelosi described as “discriminatory.” “It has always been treated like a state,” she said. “And  in the course of that, they lost several hundred million dollars in  funding because of the way it was treated.” Democrats also want to expand on funds to state and local  governments; paid family and medical leave; direct payments to the  American public; and provide free treatment for coronavirus rather than  just free testing. While lawmakers and their staffs can craft legislation  remotely, members of Congress are still trying to weigh the health risks  of reconvening to vote. The phase three package was passed via voice vote on  Friday, but most House members needed to return to the Capitol at the  last minute to ensure the legislation wasn’t derailed by a procedural  motion. Rep. Thomas Massie, Kentucky Republican, attempted to  force a full roll call vote on the $2.2 trillion package so lawmakers  were on record about the bill. “The problem with the whole scheme they had [was] if you  allow Nancy Pelosi to pass bills with nobody there, the fourth version  of this bill — she said the third one is just a downpayment — the fourth  coronavirus bill will be insane and she’ll get to stick anything she  wants in there,” Mr. Massie said on Fox Business Monday. “So we had to  set a precedent that members are going to be there if they are going to  have the vote.” Mrs. Pelosi said leadership is still looking over new policies, but remote voting is off the table for the foreseeable future. “Let’s not waste time on something that’s not going to happen,” she said. A handful of House members have tested positive for the  coronavirus in recent weeks, and several more have gone into  self-quarantine after experiencing symptoms or being exposed to someone  who tested positive. Most recently, Rep. Nydia Velázquez of New York announced  Monday she was diagnosed with a “presumed coronavirus infection” over  the weekend. She was at Friday’s vote. The House is out of session until at least April 20 to  mitigate the risk of spreading the virus among lawmakers during votes or  travel to Washington.

"Democratic lawmakers are calling out an apparent lack of racial data that they say is needed to monitor and address disparities in the national response to the coronavirus outbreak. In a letter sent Friday to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, both from Massachusetts, said comprehensive demographic data on people who are tested or treated for the virus that causes COVID-19 does not exist. Over the weekend, cities with large black and nonwhite Hispanic populations emerged as new hot spots for the spread of the virus. “Any attempt to contain COVID-19 in the United States will have to address its potential spread in low-income communities of color, first and foremost to protect the lives of people in those communities, but also to slow the spread of the virus in the country as a whole,” the lawmakers wrote to Azar. “This lack of information will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities,” the letter warned. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois also signed the letter. It was shared exclusively with The Associated Press on Monday. The lawmakers urged the HHS secretary to direct the department’s sub-agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, to work with municipalities, states and private labs to ensure that racial and ethnic data are being collected. Spokespeople for HHS and CDC did not immediately respond to the AP’s requests for comment on Monday. “Decades of structural racism have prevented so many Black and Brown families from accessing quality health care, affordable housing, and financial security, and the coronavirus crisis is blowing these disparities wide open,” Warren said in a statement. “We need the government to step up in a big way to ensure that communities of color have equal access to free testing and treatment. Congresswoman Pressley and I aren’t going to let up until we see solid data and real progress.” According to the CDC’s website, the agency had run 4,760 COVID-19 tests, while U.S. public health labs had run 128,684 tests as of Monday. The CDC data doesn’t include tests processed by private labs, which have been ramping up their work. U.S. cities with large black and brown populations such as Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee and New Orleans have emerged as hot spots of the coronavirus outbreak. New York City remained the national epicenter of the outbreak, reporting more than 36,000 confirmed cases and 790 deaths on Monday. The coronavirus has caused a global pandemic that has sickened more than 775,000 and killed more than 36,000 globally. It has crippled economies and forced restrictions on the movement of millions of people in an effort to stop the virus from spreading farther and overwhelming health care systems. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. In the letter, the U.S. lawmakers cited chronic health conditions and health care access disparities between white people and people of color “that experts have identified as risk factors for complications from COVID-19.” According to the CDC, black and nonwhite Hispanic adults are more likely to be obese and are more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than non-Hispanic white adults are. Asthma is more prevalent among nonwhite adults and children, the lawmakers noted. People of color and immigrants are also less likely to be insured, leaving many without access to quality health care providers, the lawmakers said. “Furthermore, a history of discrimination and marginalization has left some people of color distrustful of the medical system, making them less likely to seek out timely care,” they wrote in the letter. On Friday, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported that about half of the state’s deaths and total cases were in Milwaukee, a city of 600,000 residents that is more than a third black. All eight people who have died from the coronavirus in Milwaukee County were black, and seven of them lived in the city. “The severity of this disease in the African American community is a crisis within a crisis,” Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, said Friday.

"House Democrats slammed President Trump’s past remarks dubbing the disease crippling the nation as the “Chinese Coronavirus,” warning its the kind of remark that’s increasingly putting Asian Americans at risk of racial harassment. Leaders from the Congressional Asian Pacific American, Black and Hispanic caucuses said the president has the responsibility to do more to push back on this kind of rhetoric, in light of the comments he walked back last week. “We’ve seen the consequences of his hateful words, cause grave damage and injury to Americans of different types throughout his tenure,” Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries said. “It’s our hope certainly that he will cut it out, that he will recognize that he’s undermining the ability of the American people to successfully fight this pandemic by recklessly using language that stereotypes in an evidence-free fashion.” CAPAC Chair Rep. Judy Chu, California Democrat, recounted several stories she’s heard of Asian Americans facing discrimination ranging from “dirty looks and insults” to physical violence. She said one boy in Los Angeles was sent to the hospital after being accused of having the coronavirus. “The rise of anti-Asian coronavirus xenophobia and discrimination has been alarming and overwhelming,” she said. “In the last month, it’s escalated to spitting yelling and physical attacks against Asian Americans, and this is happening all around the country.” She said that the CAPAC’s harassment reporting sites have been getting about 100 reports of hate crimes per day and have over 1,000 reports across 31 states in the last five weeks. Mr. Trump decided to stop using the phrase last week, though he said he didn’t regret it. “So I think, look, everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn’t make any more of a big deal out of it. I think I’ve made a big deal,” he said at a Fox News townhall. World Health Organization officials warned against using polarizing language regarding the virus because it could lead to racial profiling. Despite their frustration, Democrats are hoping to get GOP support on a resolution, introduced by New York Democrat Rep. Grace Meng, that will denounce all forms of anti-Asian harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak. “I’ve often thought of discriminatory actions and rhetoric as sort of part of our American history — something that was in the past and not something that affected us today, whether we’re talking about Japanese internment camps or the Chinese Exclusion Act,” Ms. Meng said. “But as we’ve seen today at what people were saying and doing against fellow Americans, there is a lot of fear in our communities.” Currently, the measure has more than 100 cosponsors — though they’re only Democrats. There is no timeline yet for a vote on Ms. Meng’s resolution, given that the House is out of session until at least April 20th to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus amongst lawmakers.

"Rep. Nydia Velazquez on Monday confirmed the congressional attending physician diagnosed her with “presumed coronavirus infection” after she came down with symptoms over the weekend. The New York Democrat explained that she had an “abrupt onset” of coronavirus-like symptoms, including loss of smell and taste. The doctor advised her not to take a COVID-19 laboratory test or go in for a physical doctor’s exam. “My symptoms are mild at the present time, and I am taking Tylenol for fever and isolating myself at home,” she said in a statement. “I  encourage everyone to stay at home and continue practicing social distancing.” Ms. Velazquez, 67, was one of the House members that returned to Washington, D.C., at the last minute Friday morning to ensure the $2 trillion phase three coronavirus package passed on a voice vote and made it to President Trump’s desk. The congresswoman attended the bill signing ceremony with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after the package passed on Friday. A small handful of her colleagues have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in recent weeks and several more have gone into self-quarantine either experiencing symptoms, or they were exposed to someone who tested positive.

"CAIRO (AP) - Reza Khandan got the word from friends jailed in Iran’s most feared prison, Evin. A prisoner and a guard in their cell block had been removed because they were suspected of having coronavirus, and two guards in the women’s ward had shown symptoms. It was frightening news. Khandan’s wife, Nasrin Sotoudeh, one of Iran’s most prominent human rights lawyers, is imprisoned in that ward in close quarters with 40 other women. Only days earlier, the 56-year-old Sotoudeh - known for defending activists, opposition politicians and women prosecuted for removing their headscarves - held a five-day hunger strike demanding prisoners be released to protect them from the virus. “The virus has entered the jail, but we don’t know the extent of it,” Khandan, who had until recently been imprisoned in Evin as well, told The Associated Press by phone from Tehran.  “It will be impossible to control,” Khandan warned.  Iran, where thousands have been infected and hundreds died, has not confirmed any coronavirus cases in its prisons. But Khandan’s is one of several reports of cases that have leaked from inside Evin and elsewhere. Tens of thousands of political prisoners are jailed in Iran, Syria and other countries around the Middle East, punished for anything from advocating for greater rights to holding protests or simply criticizing autocratic leaders on Facebook or YouTube.  Alarm is growing that they and other prisoners are in danger: If one guard, visitor or new inmate introduces the infection, the coronavirus could race rampant through a captive population unable to protect itself.  Prisons across the region are notorious for overcrowding, with inmates packed sometimes by the dozens in each filthy cell. Torture, poor nutrition and other abuses leave prisoners weaker and more vulnerable.  The vast majority of those infected by the new coronavirus recover, but for many, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. “The consequences of neglecting (prisoners) are potentially catastrophic,” warned the U.N. high commissioner on human rights, Michelle Bachelet. The International Committee of the Red Cross is working with authorities in several places around the Middle East to boost prevention measures in detention facilities, said Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC’s Near and Middle East regional director.  It has requested permission from Syria to do the same in its facilities, he said. Syria is the darkest black hole. In the long civil war, tens of thousands of activists, protesters and others have been swallowed up with hardly a trace into prisons run by the government of President Bashar Assad.  Conditions inside are perhaps the most terrifying across the region. Rights groups and former detainees describe Syria’s prisons as slaughterhouses where detainees undergo torture, including beatings, electric shocks, mutilations and rapes.  As many as 50 people are locked in each 4-by-6-meter cell for weeks, month and years - sleeping on top of each other, almost never allowed to bathe. Amnesty International estimated 17,723 people were killed in custody across Syria between 2011 and 2015, with the actual number likely higher. Thousands more certainly died since.  Syria has confirmed nine cases of coronavirus and one death, none of them in prisons.  Dr. Amani Ballour, who previously ran a hospital in a rebel-held enclave in Syria, said she doubted the outside world would find out if coronavirus were spreading behind prison walls.  “If there is (an outbreak), they won’t declare it because they’re killing detainees anyway - or trying to,” said Ballour who has searched in vain for her brother and brother-in-law in Syrian prisons for nine years. “I don’t imagine anyone surviving the regime prisons.” The U.S. State Department has warned that an outbreak in Syria’s prisons would be devastating and demanded Damascus free all arbitrarily detained civilians - including Americans.  One of those Americans is Majd Kamalmaz, who vanished a day after entering Syria in February 2017 to visit family for first time in six years. The 62-year-old clinical psychologist from Virginia was not involved in politics and was engaged in international humanitarian work.  “To this day we don’t know why they detained him,” his daughter Maryam said, speaking from her home outside Dallas, Texas, where she and her family have been isolating themselves amid the pandemic.  She fears her father is deeply vulnerable. He is diabetic and had a stroke and a heart attack.  “We know that the Syrian regime doesn’t care much about human life and the idea of them saying oh yes he might have passed with the coronavirus and not really caring much is very worrisome to us,” she said. In Iran, authorities say they have temporarily freed some 100,000 inmates to ease overcrowding - around half the prison population - a sign of their alarm amid the biggest coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East. Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American businessman who was not among those released, has reported “multiple cases (of the virus) on his hallway” in Evin Prison, his Washington-based lawyer, Jared Genser, has said. In Egypt, families are desperate for information on loved ones in prisons that rights groups say are plagued by overcrowding, abuses and poor hygiene. Tens of thousands have been jailed in crackdowns against government opponents since 2013. Security forces briefly detained four women - including the mother, sister and aunt of prominent activist Alaa Abdel Fattah - for staging a protest calling for his and other prisoners’ release for fear of coronavirus. Authorities released only a handful of detainees recently. Iyad Dawoud said he was deeply worried over his brother, Khaled Dawoud, a prominent journalist and former opposition leader detained in September and held at Cairo’s Torah Prison.  “Torah complex has thousands of prisoners,” Iyad Dawoud said. “God forbid, one infected person among thousands means the end.” ___ El Deeb reported from Beirut.

Alarm is growing over the danger the coronavirus pandemic poses to prisoners: if one guard, visitor or new inmate introduces the infection, the virus could race rampant through a captive population unable to protect itself. Conditions are prime for the disease to spread rapidly. Inmates are often packed by the dozens into dirty cells with no access to hygiene or medical care. Torture, poor nutrition and other abuses leave prisoners weaker and more vulnerable.  So far, Iran, which faces the Mideast’s biggest outbreak with thousands infected and hundreds dead, has not confirmed any coronavirus cases in its prisons. But Khandan’s is one of several reports of cases that have emerged from Iranian facilities. Egypt and Syria, which have large numbers of political detainees, also have not reported any cases within prisons.                 The concern over prisons is worldwide. Multiple countries - including Iran - have released some inmates to reduce crowding. Others say they are sterilizing cells, halting family visits or increasing monitoring of guards and staff. Riots have broken out in prisons in several countries among inmates fearful not enough is being done. In authoritarian nations, ensuring protections for detainees is even more difficult. Activists, rights organizations and aid groups have grown bolder in pressing governments in the area to take action. Amnesty International called on Iran to free more prisoners, particularly rights defenders and peaceful protesters.  “They should not be in detention in the first place,” it said. Egypt last week briefly detained four women - including three relatives of a prominent jailed activist - who called for prisoner releases. Mohsen Bahnasi, an Egyptian lawyer who also called for prisoner releases, was arrested from his home, though it was not clear why, according to the Arab Network for Human Rights Information. The International Committee of the Red Cross - one of the few organizations that sometimes gets access to prisons in the region - is stepping up efforts to help.  “We must act now to try to prevent it from entering places of detention. Trying to contain it after the fact will be almost impossible,” said Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC’s Near and Middle East regional director. He said the ICRC has already begun distributing soap, disinfectant and protective equipment at prisons in several places in the Mideast. It has requested permission from Syria to do the same in its facilities and is hopeful it will get access, he said. Syria is the darkest black hole in the region. In the long civil war, tens of thousands of activists, protesters and others have been swallowed with hardly a trace into prisons run by President Bashar Assad’s government. Syria has confirmed nine cases of coronavirus and one death, none of them in its prisons.  If coronavirus were spreading within prison walls, it’s doubtful the outside world would find out, said Dr. Amani Ballour, who previously ran a hospital in a rebel-held enclave near the Syrian capital, Damascus.  “The regime doesn’t care,” she said. “If there is (an outbreak), they won’t declare it because they’re killing detainees anyway - or trying to.” Ballour has searched in vain for her brother and brother-in-law in Syrian prisons for nine years. “I don’t imagine anyone surviving the regime prisons,” she said. Conditions inside are perhaps the most terrifying in the region. Rights groups and former detainees describe Syria’s detention facilities as slaughterhouses where detainees undergo constant torture, including beatings, burnings, electric shocks, mutilations and rapes. Authorities almost never confirm arrests, and detainees are kept incommunicado out of the regular prison system.  As many as 50 people are locked in a 4-by-6-meter cell for weeks, month and years - sleeping on top of each other, almost never allowed to bathe, given meager and rotten food and dirty water. Amnesty International estimated 17,723 people were killed in custody across Syria between 2011 and 2015, with the actual number likely higher. There’s no reason to believe conditions have changed since, said Amnesty’s Lynn Maalouf.  There is a “deliberate policy of letting people die of illness,” said Mohammad al-Abdallah, head of the Washington-based Syria Justice and Accountability Center. The overcrowded, dirty cells are “exactly the formula a disease like corona needs to grow,” he said. The U.S. State Department last week warned that an outbreak in the Syria’s prison would “have devastating impact” and demanded Damascus free all arbitrarily detained civilians - including Americans.  Among the detained Americans is Majd Kamalmaz, who vanished a day after entering Syria in February 2017 to visit family for the first time in six years. A 62-year-old clinical psychologist from Virginia, he was not involved in politics and was engaged in international humanitarian work.  “To this day we don’t know why they detained him,” his daughter Maryam said. At her home outside Dallas, Texas, Maryam’s family are taking all precautions against the pandemic: she and her children haven’t left the house for days and her husband goes out only to get groceries. She worries about her mother, alone in an apartment nearby. Majd’s disappearance “truly affected her health and she gets sick very easily now,” Maryam said.  “We are very, very concerned” that her father could contract coronavirus, she said. He is diabetic and had a stroke and a heart attack.  In January, a contact in Syria told the family that Kamalmaz had been moved from his prison, but they have no idea why or where to. He may have been put under closer observation amid pressure by American and European officials for his release. “We know that the Syrian regime doesn’t care much about human life and the idea of them saying oh yes he might have passed with the coronavirus and not really caring much is very worrisome to us,” Maryam said. In Iran, authorities say they have temporarily freed some 100,000 inmates - around half the prison population, in a sign of their alarm at the outbreak. But hundreds of prisoners of conscience and other dissidents remain imprisoned, Amnesty said. It said there have been multiple reports of coronavirus cases within Iran’s prisons, including two deaths, though the government has not confirmed any.  Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American businessman who was not among those released, has reported “multiple cases on his hallway” in Evin Prison, his Washington-based lawyer, Jared Genser, has said. One furloughed prisoner, Babak Safari, said in an online video that immediately after leaving prison he began having fevers, chills and difficulty breathing and had to be hospitalized. He said he was certain he contracted coronavirus in prison. “All the political prisoners being held in Tehran prison are in great danger. Save them,” Safari said. In some places, prisoners appear to be lashing out in fear of the virus. Italy, Colombia and Jordan have all seen riots by inmates complaining of insufficient protections, and a string of prison riots has broken out in Iran. Palestinians in Israeli prisons have threatened hunger strikes after one guard tested positive. In eastern Syria, Islamic State group militants rioted in a prison run by U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters. A spokesman for Kurdish-led forces, Mustafa Bali, said there did not appear to be a connection to coronavirus fears. But overcrowding has plagued the more than two dozen facilities where the Kurds are holding some 10,000 IS militants, including 2,000 foreigners whose home countries have refused to repatriate them.  Afghanistan’s largest prison, Pul-e-Charkhi, was built in the 1970s to house 5,000 prisoners but now holds 10,500.  Keeping a safe distance is impossible “with two persons sleeping together in a one-meter space,” said Naiz Mohammad, one of around 3,000 Taliban in the prison, speaking by telephone from his cell. He said promises of extra soap and disinfectant had not materialized.  “Everyone here is worried. If you see inside the cells, the bars, the locks, everything is all dirty,” he said. In Egypt, families are desperate for information on loved ones in prisons, where rights groups say overcrowding, abuses and poor hygiene are rampant.  Tens of thousands have been jailed in crackdowns since 2013 that expanded from Islamists to secular democracy advocates and critics of the government. Over that time, the government has built more than a dozen new prisons and it repeatedly has said conditions are humane. In recent weeks, a handful of activists and other prisoners have been released. But former prisoners have said cells are still often packed tightly. One meme circulating online showed a photo of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi sitting 2.5 meters from his ministers - and noted that in the prisons, that space might be filled by 10 detainees. Former president Mohammed Morsi, deposed by el-Sissi in 2013, collapsed in court and subsequently died last year, and his family and lawyers blamed poor conditions and lack of medical care. Celine Lebrun Shaath said her husband, Palestinian-Egyptian activist Ramy Shaath, is kept in a 25 square meter cell with 18 others, and any illness or scabies passes easily among them. Ramy Shaath, the son of a former Palestinian foreign minister, was detained last summer but has not been charged, and his wife, a French citizen, was deported. She noted that while visits and deliveries of food or other supplies to prisoners is forbidden, guards and other staff move in and out to their homes and neighborhoods, taking crowded public transportation.  “The doors are open for them. We are worried about the entire system.”  ___ El Deeb reported from Beirut.

"LOS ANGELES (AP) - Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva, who was sued by gun-rights groups after trying to shut down firearms dealers in the wake of coronavirus concerns, said Monday that he is abandoning the effort. The sheriff said he’s heeding a federal Department of Homeland Security advisory issued on Saturday that listed gun and ammunition dealers as “essential critical infrastructure workers.”  Villanueva called the non-binding memo “persuasive” and announced that his department won’t order or recommend closing businesses that sell or repair firearms or sell ammunition in the nation’s most populous county. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has said that each of the state’s 58 counties can decide for themselves whether to list firearms dealers as nonessential businesses that should be subject to closure while the state seeks to limit the spread of COVID-19.  The disease causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  Villanueva ordered a shutdown of gun shops last week, saying panic-buying that produced long lines at the shops was worrisome from a public safety standpoint. Days later, he issued a second order closing them to the public, despite a county legal counsel’s finding that the stores are essential businesses that should remain open. However, Villanueva’s second order said the stores may still supply security guard companies, and anyone who already has purchased a gun and possesses a valid safety certificate can pick up their firearms. On Friday, four groups, including the National Rifle Association of America, filed a federal lawsuit, contending that the sheriff’s actions violate the constitutionally guaranteed right to bear arms.  ",LA County sheriff abandons effort to close gun stores,"Tuesday, March 31, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/31/la-county-sheriff-abandons-effort-to-close-gun-sto/,washington_times
"The Trump administration’s move to designate firearm dealers as essential services to be kept open during the coronavirus crisis ignited outrage among gun control advocates and set the stage for new court battles. “It simply doesn’t make any sense,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun laws. “There is no reason why gun dealers should be deemed as essential as police officers or first responders or hospital workers — people who are risking everything every day to save lives.” A memo released Saturday by the Department of Homeland Security declared gun retailers as “essential critical infrastructure workforce” to remain open while non-essential businesses are shuttered to blunt the spread of the deadly COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The guidance, which is an advisory and not binding, attempted to resolve the debate over whether gun stores should be deemed essential. As of Monday, 28 states have kept gun stores open, while seven have shuttered them. Some governors have added to the confusion by initially closing gun stores and then reversing course and ordering them open. Mr. Feinblatt and other gun-control advocates slammed the guidance as “irresponsible” and “deeply unfair.” Mr. Feinblatt urged governors across the country to ignore the federal guidance and sent a letter to DHS demanding it reverse the decision. “Governors should feel empowered to make whatever decisions are best for their state without pressure from the federal government and without pressure from the gun lobby,” he said. Tim Schmidt, president of the U.S. Concealed Carry Association, said the memo served as a stark reminder that Americans’ constitutional rights don’t disappear during a pandemic. “We need all levels of government and policymakers to follow the administration’s guidance to support and protect Second Amendment rights as essential,” he said. “We should not have politicians trying to undermine Americans’ right to self-protection at a time when it’s more important than ever.” The debate heated up as gun sales have soared in response to the deadly and fast-spreading virus, including first-time gun owners arming themselves out of fear the coronavirus will lead to social upheaval and chaos. Those who follow the gun rights debate don’t expect the Trump administration to issue more stringent guidance but they do anticipate a legal showdown that could head to the Supreme Court. “To say that a gun store is non-essential is the first step towards martial law where you put the constitution on hold,” Mr. Schmidt said. “It would be just as bad if they shut the Second Amendment down for two days, but these closures are indefinite.” Lawsuits against states that have deemed gun retailers non-essential have been racking up, but only one state court has weighed in. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court last week dismissed a lawsuit filed by a gun shop challenging Gov. Tom Wolf’s authority to shutter businesses determined to be “non-life-sustaining.” The majority of justices issued the ruling without comment, but three justices authored a dissenting statement concluding the order was “in clear tension with the Second Amendment” and the state constitution. Although the court held up Mr. Wolf’s order, the governor, a Democrat, later changed his mind and deemed gun shops essential. Mr. Wolf’s change of heart highlights some of the confusion across the country. Some liberal governors such as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, have said firearm retailers must remain open “for purposes of safety and security.” Meanwhile, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, closed the gun shops in his state. “I was impressed with Pritzker, but some governors are making just the opposite call,” Mr. Schmidt said. “We are seeing some people who are historically strong on the Second Amendment make just the opposite call.” Mr. Feinblatt called on governors to keep stores shuttered, saying they don’t provide a public health benefit. “While there is much we don’t know about COVID-19, this much we know, guns don’t make you safer from it,” he said. It is not clear when federal courts will get a chance to resolve the issue, which will largely center around the government’s authority to suspend certain constitutional rights during an emergency. A lawsuit filed by a coalition of gun rights activists last week against New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy for closing gun stores was settled Monday when he backed away from his previous order. “We’re delighted that Gov. Murphy has reversed course on this matter, even if it took a lawsuit to get him to do it,” said Alan M. Gottlieb, founder and executive vice president of the Second Amendment Foundation, one of the lawsuit’s plaintiffs. “Our lawsuit cut right to the heart of what the Second Amendment is all about, which is personal protection during emergency situations like the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that has gripped the nation,” he said.

"SALT LAKE CITY — A Utah medical association has rescinded a recommendation it made last week on behalf of state health officials for doctors to treat coronavirus patients using malaria drugs that medical professionals across the country have cautioned against using until more testing is done. The about-face by the Utah Medical Association came after a group of infectious disease doctors pushed back over the weekend against the Friday guidance. The association said in the first email sent Friday that chloroquine and a similar drug, hydroxychloroquine, had shown “promising data for affecting the course of COVID-19” and that their recommended use was being made at the suggestion of the Utah Department of Health. The association also recommended combining them with zinc. The association reversed positions in a follow-up email Sunday in which it said the Utah Department of Health had withdrawn the previous guidance after “much collaborative discussion” and based on “a lack of convincing evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of off-label use of hydroxycholorquine.” Michelle McOmber, CEO of the Utah Medical Association, declined to answer any questions about what led to the change and instead sent only a statement Monday. “Things are rapidly changing on an hourly, daily and weekly basis. We are doing all that we can to help share the latest information and recommendations to help providers do their jobs and take care of patients,” McOmber said. “We are working to get information out as quickly as possible to help in this crisis and will continue to update and give information that we receive as soon as practicable to help providers on the front lines.” Utah Department of Health spokesman Tom Hudachko said the state didn’t intend to recommend use of the drugs, but rather dosage amounts if a medical provider and patient decides to use them. He said the department reached out to the Utah Medical Association after the email to clarify the state’s position. Utah takes a neutral stance on the drugs, allowing doctors and patients to decide, Hudachko said. More than 50 infectious disease doctors and pharmacists reached out to state health officials and the Utah Medical Association about the potential risks of using the drugs for coronavirus patients, Dr. Andrew Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at University of Utah Health, told The Salt Lake Tribune. “Even if they prove helpful, people should understand they are not miracle drugs. Like all medicines, they have real side effects that can even be life threatening,” Pavia said in an email. “Too often drugs that have seemed helpful based on stories and anecdotes have been widely adopted, only to find when properly studied that they were useless or even harmful.” Utah isn’t the only state grappling with how to deal with drugs that have been touted by President Donald Trump as a possible treatment. He fueled excitement when he tweeted that hydroxychloroquine plus an antibiotic could be “one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine” and should “be put in use immediately.” He cited a French study that gave the combo to six patients. But the drugs have major side effects, which is one reason scientists don’t want to give them without evidence of their value, even in this emergency. Scientists say major studies are needed to prove the drugs are safe and effective against coronavirus. One such study recently started in New York and another is set to begin in Utah soon. No drugs have been approved as a treatment, cure, preventive medicine or vaccine for the disease, and public health officials say not to expect anything imminently. Another concern with using the drugs is a run on them could also prevent access for people who need them for rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak signed an emergency order last week barring the use of anti-malaria drugs. The Wyoming Board of Medicine warned physicians against hoarding and misusing the drugs touted as potential treatments for the coronavirus.

"He’s got a big decision to make. Democratic presidential hopeful Joseph R. Biden is struggling to keep his political message percolating now that the coronavirus pandemic remains center stage, worldwide. The former vice president had made the most of a temporary broadcast studio in his home, and continues to offer interviews and commentary to most everyone, often with tepid results. Should Mr. Biden supercharge his efforts by revealing his running mate? Mr. Biden vows his choice will be a female; Possible candidates include former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama and a number of lawmakers. Then there is chatter — found in Inside the Beltway and elsewhere — that Mr. Biden could join forces with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, 62, and currently getting rave reviews for his response to the pandemic in his state. The team would look like this: BIDEN/CUOMO 2020. A veteran New York political analyst says this particular pairing won’t happen. “Reaction from the party’s identitarian activists would be explosive,” predicts New York Post columnist Bob McManus, who suggests some Democrats also would say Mr. Cuomo would be ‘line-jumping” ahead of other potential running mates. “Party poobahs” like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer would not be happy with Mr. Cuomo for many reasons, including the governor’s support for charter schools or his upstate economic development projects. Still, Mr. Cuomo has made an emphatic national debut. “There is the continuing Cuomo star turn — impressive at the outset for its steadying presence in a moment of grave crisis. The enthusiastic response to it speaks to a nation hungry for responsible, articulate, adult leadership. But inspirational rhetoric has a short shelf life. Once the rules governing life in a pandemic are absorbed, the shutdown effected and the new expectations established, all that’s left is talk,” writes Mr. McManus. “Cuomo has performed magnificently to this point, but those who have followed his oratory over the years — the anger-tinged, over-the-top campaign speeches and official addresses — are aware of his limits, too. Rhetoric must remain restrained if it is to be effective over time, and restraint isn’t Cuomo’s superpower,” the columnist continued. “Biden and company must know this, and so there they have another reason to keep the governor at arm’s length. This, no doubt, they will do,” writes Mr. McManus. CONFESSIONS ARE FEW IN TOILET PAPER CRISIS Yes, the toilet paper shortage in the U.S. continues to unroll for mysterious reasons, confounding the millions of Americans who are staring down empty supermarket aisles once stacked with tissue of every persuasion. Who’s to blame? Few will admit they have contributed to the TP crisis by overbuying. “Most Americans report a toilet paper shortage where they live thanks to the coronavirus but say they personally are not to blame. Just 16% of American say they are buying more toilet paper than normal — while 82% say they are not,” notes the survey of 1,000 U.S. adults conducted March 25-26. ELECTION? WHAT ELECTION? It was not so long ago that the 2020 presidential election was the epicenter of media coverage and ruling the op-ed pages. No more. A close, scientific investigation of this phenomenon reveals just how much the coronavirus pandemic has supplanted the election. “Coronavirus bulldozes the 2020 race out of the media spotlight,” writes says Kalev Leetaru, an analyst for RealClear Politics who cites a three-month study of coverage on CNN, MSNBC and Fox News conducted by the GDELT Project, a complex database which monitors print, broadcast and online media in over 100 languages. “Mentions of the race collapsed tenfold from March 11 to March 12 and again from March 18 to March 19 and have not recovered since,”  From a peak of almost 4,000 mentions on March 4, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden today accounts for just a few dozen mentions a day,” Leetaru notes. “In the race’s place, explicit mentions of the coronavirus by name have grown to account for at least 20% of the daily airtime on the three television channels, with CNN covering it the most from late February through March 12 and Fox News taking the lead since then, with MSNBC paying the least attention to the virus the last three months,” advises Mr. Leetaru, a senior fellow at the George Washington University Center for Cyber & Homeland Security. FOX NEWS, THE ‘UPLIFTING’ EDITION Fox News has long been known for hard news reporting and commentary that has ensured the network has remained the nation’s most-watched cable news outlet for 18 consecutive years. Fox News has adopted a new mission to provide “uplifting” content for viewers as the coronavirus crisis grips the world — launching “America Together,” a new project which provides news stories that underscore well-being and positivity. “The feature will highlight daily inspiring stories to provide Fox News Media’s audiences with a realm of uplifting content throughout the global coronavirus pandemic. America Together will include stories of volunteerism, charitable efforts and everyday heroism in the face of all the challenges,” the network said in a statement. The network is also reaching out to viewers in a personal way, with major network personalities encouraging viewers and families at home. Fox News is also streaming religious services from the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City.

"President Trump conceded Monday that the $2.2 trillion economic rescue package he approved includes wasteful spending by both parties, while battle lines formed in Congress over the size of a looming fourth government aid plan as troubles with the economy mounted. The president said the emergency aid plan for workers and businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic includes “crazy” spending unrelated to the pandemic, which he attributed mostly to Democrats but said he had no choice but to go along with it. “This is the Democrats, that’s the way they play,” Mr. Trump said on “Fox & Friends.” “We need their votes. They have the House. We had to take care of people.” The package includes $75 million for the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, $25 million for the Kennedy Center (which, nevertheless, announced it is laying off 100 musicians), and $37 million for the Forest Service (including $3 million for “forest and rangeland research”). There’s also big chunks for federal agencies, such as $60 million for NASA, under the vague guidance to prepare for the pandemic. There are also add-ons unrelated to the pandemic that appear to have come from Republicans, such as a $500,000 water project in Utah and a provision to speed up FDA review of sunscreen products. The latter issue had previously passed the Senate on a 91-2 vote. Sen. John Kennedy, Louisiana Republican, called the extraneous items “spending porn.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is signaling that Democrats want more spending in a fourth bill to address the health care and economic needs created by the pandemic. She said states need far more than the $150 billion in the current rescue package, as well as more money for personal protective equipment, a further expansion of family leave, more coverage for doctors’ office visits, and more money for hospitals, despite Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer calling the current $130 billion in aid for hospitals a new “Marshall Plan.” “This bill was just a down payment,” she said. Mrs. Pelosi also said Monday that tougher OSHA protections for workers will be a top priority for the next bill. “Legislation is required. It’s been blocked three times,” she told reporters. “If we fail to act, it will make the situation more dangerous.” And she called for an “infrastructure component” including broadband and clean water projects in the next bill, and more direct payments such as the $1,200 checks going out to most Americans in less than three weeks. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, has been downplaying talk of a fourth rescue bill, saying Congress should first allow the current package to have an impact. But the president has said he is open to more aid if needed. And more bad economic developments were mounting by the day. Macy’s said Monday it would furlough the majority of its 130,000 employees because it had lost “the majority” of its sales following store closures. The company, which also operates Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, said the store closures that began March 18 would persist until the retailer had a “clear line of sight on when it is safe to reopen.” It said most of its employees will be furloughed this week, and it will maintain the “absolute minimum work force needed to maintain basic operations,” according to a statement. Digital business at call centers and distribution centers won’t be as hard hit. The coronavirus pandemic has hit retailers across the country, as authorities close stores and other operations considered non-essential. “At least through May, furloughed colleagues who are enrolled in health benefits will continue to receive coverage with the company covering 100% of the premium,” Macy’s said in a statement. “We expect to bring colleagues back on a staggered basis as business resumes.” But stocks rose again Monday after the White House extended social distancing guidelines through the end of April in an effort to control the pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 690 points, or 3.1%, to close at 22,327. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq each rose more than 3%. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said loans for small businesses under the rescue package will be available at most banks and Small Business Administration lenders starting on Friday, a timetable that he called “lightning speed.” “This is a very popular program with Republicans and Democrats, and the president likes it a lot,” Mr. Mnuchin said on Fox Business. “So if we run out of money, and this is a huge success, we will absolutely go back to Congress and ask for more money.” He said the program “makes economic sense because every person we put through this program, we don’t have to pay unemployment insurance.” The president said the health and safety of Americans must take precedence over the economy. “It’s so bad for the economy, but the economy is No. 2 on my list. First, I want to save a lot of lives,” Mr. Trump said. χ Gabriella Muñoz and David Sherfinski contributed to this article.

"MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell surprised President Trump — and most of the Rose Garden audience — during a White House coronavirus task force briefing on Monday by calling on Americans to read the Bible during their isolation from the outbreak. The president had invited his friend, whom he has also tapped to chair Mr. Trump’s reelection campaign in Minnesota, to give an update on his company’s effort to produce 50,000 face masks daily at a converted pillow factory. But Mr. Lindell concluded with what he called some “off the cuff” remarks. “God gave us grace on Nov. 8, 2016 to change the course we were on,” Mr. Lindell said, referring to Mr. Trump’s election. “God had been taken out of our schools and lives, a nation had turned its back on God.” He told Americans on live TV, “I encourage you to use this time at home to get back in the word, read our Bible and spend time with our families.” “Our president gave us so much hope just a few short months ago we had the best economy, the lowest unemployment, and wages going up,” Mr. Lindell said. “It was amazing. With our great president, vice president, and this administration and all the great people in the country praying daily, we will get through this and back to a place that’s stronger and safer than ever.” Mr. Trump sounded surprised as he thanked Mr. Lindell. “I did not know he was going to do that,” the president said. “He’s a friend of mine and I appreciate that.”  ","At White House, 'My Pillow' CEO urges Americans to read Bible during quarantine","Monday, March 30, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/30/mike-lindell-my-pillow-ceo-read-bible-during-coron/,washington_times
"Black voters in South Carolina helped propel former Vice President Joseph R. Biden to the top of the crowded 2020 Democratic field and they continue to fuel his drive to the nomination, but whether that translates into the crucial high turnout he needs in November remains an open question. In several states with large black populations, Mr. Biden didn’t receive as much support from them as did former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries when she squared off against Sen. Bernard Sanders — who is also Mr. Biden’s key competitor this time around. For example, in South Carolina and Virginia, Mrs. Clinton respectively captured 86% and 84% of the black vote. By comparison, Barack Obama in the 2008 primaries garnered 78% and 89% in those key states. Mr. Biden’s share of the black vote remained in the 60s. He received 61% from black voters in South Carolina and 66% in Virginia. “There is certainly, as a whole, an energy problem for him,” said Ryan Rhodes, a Republican strategist and presidential campaign veteran. “Right now, they were just trying to stop Bernie. They don’t want to acknowledge the numbers are real.” Exit polls from Michigan and Missouri on Super Tuesday, when more than a dozen states cast their ballot for a Democratic nominee, revealed less than half of all Democratic voters were enthusiastic about Mr. Biden. The lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Biden could be concerns over his age and health, said Towson University professor Richard E. Vatz, a scholar of political rhetoric and campaigning. “In addition, the economic improvement of the African American electorate, pre-coronavirus, lessens support and strength of support for even a historically beloved candidate such as Biden,” he added, referencing a February unemployment rate that was below 6%, before the economic downturn from the spread of COVID-19. The rate had fallen about 2 percentage points since President Trump took office. In the 2016 general election, the turnout for black voters declined for the first time in 20 years, dropping to 59.6% after peaking at 66.6% in 2012, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. The dramatic decline in turnout, coupled with a spike in white voter turnout, hurt Mrs. Clinton, especially in the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin that sealed Mr. Trump’s surprise win in 2016. Still, Mr. Biden has competed in a more crowded field than Mrs. Clinton did in places such as South Carolina, which could contribute to his smaller share of the black vote. Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist who is black and has worked on several presidential primaries in South Carolina, dismissed talks about a lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Biden. “It’s a different race,” he said, forecasting large turnout in November from minority communities that want to push Mr. Trump out of the White House. “Certain communities have more to lose than others,” said Mr. Seawright. Fernand Amandi, a managing partner of the public opinion research and consulting firm Bendixen & Amandi, said the coronavirus crisis makes predicting voter behavior next to impossible. “The coronavirus disrupter which will ultimately be what matters most in determining how people vote and how they hold candidates accountable in November,” Mr. Amandi said. Illinois, which went to the polls March 17 amid social distancing policies to combat COVID-19, recorded significant black voter support for Mr. Biden. He garnered 73% of the black vote, surpassing the 70% Mrs. Clinton enjoyed during the 2016 primary. Mr. Obama, though, enjoyed 93% support from the key demographic in his home state in the 2008 primary.

"Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia announced new “stay at home” orders Monday that imposed severe restrictions on residents, joining a growing number of states that have passed near-total lockdowns in response to the escalating coronavirus outbreak. The forced isolation came as the tally of COVID-19 cases and deaths mount while disrupting the lives of millions of Americans. At the White House, President Trump said the public should steel for at least another 30 days of essentially putting their lives on hold, saying the peak death rate isn’t expected to come for another two weeks. Instead of relaxing recently issued federal “social distancing” guidelines, he said they’ll be “very much as they are, maybe toughened up a bit.” “Really, we have no other choice,” Mr. Trump said. “This is a very vital 30 days. We’re sort of putting it all on the line.” The president said that down the road, he could potentially envision an America where everyone wears a protective mask in public. “It’s certainly something we could discuss,” Mr. Trump said. “We’ll take a look at it — for a period of time. Not forever.” Residents in Maryland, Virginia and D.C. were ordered to stay home except in extremely limited circumstances, with exceptions allowed to obtain goods like groceries, seek medical care, or engage in outdoor activities like jogging or hiking as long as people adhere to proper social distancing guidelines. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan called the COVID-19 a “deadly public health crisis.” “We are no longer asking or suggesting that Marylanders stay home. We are directing them to do so,” said Mr. Hogan, a Republican. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, issued a similar directive. “We need everyone to take this seriously and act responsibly,” he said. “Our message to Virginians is clear: stay home.” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said residents who willfully violate the city’s new stay-at-home order could be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of up to $5,000 and/or imprisonment of up to three months. In Maryland, violators could face a fine of up to $5,000 and/or up to a year in jail. In Virginia, the punishment could be a fine of up to $2,500 and/or up to a year in jail. At the Rose Garden press briefing, Mr. Trump was asked specifically about Mr. Northam’s June 10 time frame for his order, which extends far beyond the latest end date for the new federal guidance. “We’re letting the governors do pretty much what they want with our supervision,” Mr. Trump said. “Some go further than others.” There are more than 775,000 positive coronavirus cases worldwide and more than 37,000 deaths, according to a tracker from Johns Hopkins University. In the U.S., there are more than 160,000 cases and more than 2,900 deaths. Mr. Trump on March 16 asked the American people to work and learn at home, to avoid crowds and nonessential travel, and to use carryout instead of dining inside restaurants. He hoped to loosen those rules by the end of March and get things up and running by Easter. But on Sunday, he announced he was extending that guidance until April 30 after seeing models that said up to 2 million people could die if the virus was left unchecked. Dr. Deborah Birx, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, said that collectively, states are moving in the same general direction. “These recommendations are recommendations that the globe is using,” Dr. Birx said. “And so we really do recommend that every governor, every mayor looks very carefully and ensures that their communities are utilizing these [guidelines].” In addition to the 8,100 ventilators already being shipped to states from the national stockpile, Mr. Trump said more than 1,000 additional ventilators are set to be shipped in the next 48 hours to states around the country that have been pleading for help. He said there are about 10,000 ventilators in reserve and predicted there will be enough to go around in the coming weeks, despite forecasts from governors across the country that they remain well short of their expected needs. The president spoke by phone with governors Monday to get an update on the supplies they need for their respective states. He also touted several private companies that have stepped up to produce ventilators, which are crucial for treating patients who have tested positive for COVID-19, and that shipments would soon be going to Italy, France, and Spain. “The fact that we’re doing so many so quickly is a tribute to our great companies,” he said. The positive spin came amid grim projections about the expected death toll in the U.S. Earlier in the day, Dr. Birx had said the U.S. could see hundreds of thousands of deaths from the virus even if Americans almost uniformly stuck to the guidelines and actively worked to stop the spread. “If we do things together well, almost perfectly, we could get in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 fatalities. We don’t even want to see that,” Dr. Birx said on NBC’s “Today” program. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It killed thousands in China before the epicenter shifted to South Korea and then Europe and the Americas. Italy has seen the worst death toll, with more than 11,500, followed by Spain at more than 7,300. New York, the hardest-hit U.S. state in the coronavirus outbreak, got some support on Monday with the arrival of the USNS Comfort, a “floating hospital” ship, in Manhattan. The Comfort has capacity for 1,000 beds, which are expected to help free up space in the city’s hospitals for COVID-19 patients. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said the arrival of the ship was welcome news, though he estimated that New York City needs to triple its hospital capacity by May. He said they started the month with about 20,000 working hospital beds in New York City. “It is a daunting task, but we got a big, big boost … this is like adding a whole [other] hospital to New York City,” Mr. de Blasio said. The mayor said entire hospitals will have to effectively transform into all-intensive care units to get through the coming weeks. “That’s how dire, that’s how tough this situation is,” he said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said there are now more than 1,200 coronavirus-related deaths in the state and at least 66,497 positive cases. Both numbers are far and away the most of any state in the country. Mr. Cuomo pleaded with out-of-state health-care workers to come to New York to help out if they were in a position to do so. “As governor of New York, I am asking health care professionals across the country: If you don’t have a health care crisis in your community, please come help us in New York now,” he said. “We’ll return the favor.” Mr. Cuomo had already put the state on near-total lockdown, ordering non-essential employees to work from home and shuttering bars and restaurants, except for carry-out orders. The governor has suggested recently that some of the social distancing rules he imposed on New York could be working, pointing to a declining rate of hospitalizations. But he said Monday there is still too much “density” in New York City, saying the city has been unsuccessfully trying to reduce density in playgrounds. “If that continues, we’ll take a mandatory action to close down playgrounds, as harsh as that sounds,” Mr. Cuomo said. “But it can actually save people’s lives.” In a grim reminder of the toll the coronavirus is taking on New York, a makeshift emergency hospital site popped up in Central Park in recent days. As the virus wreaks havoc on the U.S. economy, Mr. Trump last week signed into law a $2.2 trillion financial rescue package that includes $350 billion to help small businesses make payroll, among other provisions. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Monday that the money for the small business loans should be available by the end of the week. That “will be at lightning speed,” Mr. Mnuchin said on Fox Business Network. He said they expect the $350 billion in small business loans will cover about 50% of the private workforce. The Small Business Administration loans are intended to cover eight weeks of payroll and about 25% of overhead for qualifying companies with 500 or fewer employees. If the companies use the money to bring back or pay employees the loan will be forgiven. “If we run out of money and this is a huge success, we will absolutely go back to Congress and ask for more money,” he said. He also said that the direct deposit checks of at least $1,200 would be showing up in Americans’ accounts in three weeks. The checks were another major part of the package Congress passed in response to the escalating coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Mnuchin said the existing package should help sustain the U.S. economy for the next 8-12 weeks.

"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) - Soldiers patrol the streets with their fingers on machine gun triggers. The army guards an exhibition center-turned-makeshift-hospital crowded with rows of metal beds for those infected with the coronavirus. And Serbia’s president warns residents that Belgrade’s graveyards won’t be big enough to bury the dead if people ignore his government’s lockdown orders. Since President Aleksandar Vucic announced an open-ended state of emergency on March 15, parliament has been sidelined, borders shut, a 12-hour police-enforced curfew imposed and people over 65 banned from leaving their homes - some of Europe’s strictest measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Serbian leader, who makes dramatic daily appearances issuing new decrees, has assumed full power, prompting an outcry from opponents who say he has seized control of the state in an unconstitutional manner. Rodoljub Sabic, a former state commissioner for personal data protection, says by proclaiming a state of emergency, Vucic has assumed “full supremacy” over decision-making during the crisis, although his constitutional role is only ceremonial.  “He issues orders which are automatically accepted by the government,” Sabic said. “No checks and balances.” In ex-communist Eastern Europe and elsewhere, populist leaders are introducing harsh measures including uncontrolled cellphone surveillance of their citizens and lengthy jail sentences for those who flout lockdown decrees. The human rights chief of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said while she understands the need to act swiftly to protect populations from the COVID-19 pandemic, the newly declared states of emergency must include a time limit and parliamentary oversight. “A state of emergency - wherever it is declared and for whatever reason - must be proportionate to its aim, and only remain in place for as long as absolutely necessary,” said the OSCE rights chief, Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir. In times of national emergency, countries often take steps that rights activists see as curtailing civil liberties, such as increased surveillance, curfews and restrictions on travel, or limiting freedom of expression. China locked down whole cities earlier this year to stop the spread of the virus as India did with the whole nation. Amnesty International researcher Massimo Moratti said states of emergency are allowed under international human rights law but warned that the restrictive measures should not become a “new normal.” “Such states need to last only until the danger lasts,” he told The Associated Press. In European Union-member Hungary, parliament on Monday passed a law giving Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government the right to rule by decree for as long as a state of emergency declared March 11 is in effect. The law also sets prison terms of up to five years for those convicted of spreading false information about the pandemic and up to eight years for those interfering with efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, like a curfew or quarantine.  Rights groups and officials say the law creates the possibility of an indefinite state of emergency and gives Orbán and his government carte blanche to restrict human rights and crack down on freedom of the press.  “Orban is dismantling democracy in front of our eyes,”said Tanja Fajon, a member of the European Parliament, “This is a shame for Europe, its fundamental values and democracy. He (Orban) abused coronavirus as an excuse to kill democracy and media freedom.” “This is not the way to address the very real crisis that has been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said David Vig, Amnesty International’s Hungary director. Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga said criticism of Hungary’s bill were “political attacks based on the wrong interpretation or intentional distortion” of its contents. Other governments have also adopted extreme measures. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu’s caretaker government passed a series of emergency executive measures to try to quell the spread of the new virus. These include authorizing unprecedented electronic surveillance of Israeli citizens and a slowdown of court activity that forced the postponement of Netanyahu’s own pending corruption trial.  In Russia, authorities have turned up the pressure on media outlets and social media users to control the narrative amid the country’s growing coronavirus outbreak. Moscow went on lockdown Monday and many other regions quickly followed suit. Under the guise of weeding out coronavirus-related “fake news,” law enforcement has cracked down on people sharing opinions on social media, and on media that criticize the government’s response to the outbreak. In Poland, people are worried about a new government smartphone application introduced for people in home quarantine.  Panoptykon Foundation, a human rights group that opposes surveillance, says some users who support government efforts to fight the pandemic worry that by using the app they could be giving too much private data to the conservative government.  While nearly 800 coronavirus cases and 16 deaths have been recorded in Serbia, according to Johns Hopkins University, testing has been extremely limited and experts believe the figures greatly under-represent the real number of victims. Most people suffer mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, from the virus but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, more severe illness can occur, including pneumonia and death.  Images of the transformation of a huge communist-era exhibition hall in Belgrade into a makeshift hospital for infected patients has triggered widespread public fear of the detention camp-looking facility that is filled with row-upon-row of 3,000 metal beds.  The Serbian president said he was glad that people got scared, adding he would have chosen even a worse-looking spot if that would stop Serbs from flouting his stay-at-home orders. “Someone has to spend 14 to 28 days there,” Vucic said. “If it’s not comfortable, I don’t care. We are fighting for people’s lives.” “Do not Drown Belgrade,” a group of civic activists, has launched an online petition against what they call Vucic’s abuse of power and curtailing of basic human rights. It says his frequent public appearances are creating panic in an already worried society. “We do not need Vucic’s daily dramatization, but the truth: Concrete data and instructions from experts,” the petition says.  ___ Associated Press writers Jovana Gec, Pablo Gorondi in Budapest, Hungary, and Vanessa Gera in Warsaw contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak  and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  ",Dismantling democracy?

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The FBI has reached out to Sen. Richard Burr about his sale of stocks before the coronavirus caused markets to plummet, a person familiar with the matter said Monday. The outreach suggests federal law enforcement officials may be looking to determine whether the North Carolina Republican exploited advance information when he dumped as much as $1.7 million in stocks in the days before the coronavirus wreaked havoc on the economy.  Burr has denied wrongdoing but has also requested an ethics review of the stock sales. The Justice Department’s action, first reported by CNN, was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss it and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Justice Department declined to comment. In a statement, Alice Fisher, an attorney for Burr, said, “The law is clear that any American -– including a Senator -– may participate in the stock market based on public information, as Senator Burr did.  “When this issue arose, Senator Burr immediately asked the Senate Ethics Committee to conduct a complete review, and he will cooperate with that review as well as any other appropriate inquiry. Senator Burr welcomes a thorough review of the facts in this matter, which will establish that his actions were appropriate,” the statement said. Burr, whose stock sales were first reported by ProPublica and The Center for Responsive Politics, is one of several senators whose financial dealings have generated scrutiny in recent weeks. Senate records show that Burr and his wife sold between roughly $600,000 and $1.7 million in more than 30 transactions in late January and mid-February, just before the market began to nosedive and government health officials began to sound alarms about the virus. Several of the stocks were in companies that own hotels. Burr has acknowledged selling the stocks because of the coronavirus but said he relied “solely on public news reports,” specifically CNBC’s daily health and science reporting out of Asia, to make the financial decisions.  There is no indication that Burr, whose six-year term ends in 2023 and who does not plan to run for reelection, was acting on inside information. The intelligence panel he leads did not have any briefings on the pandemic the week when most of the stocks were sold, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential committee activity.  ___ Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Michael Balsamo in Washington contributed to this report.

"For President Trump, the coronavirus statistics have become personal. “You see the numbers like I see the numbers,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. “I have some friends who are unbelievably sick. We thought they were going in for a mild [hospital] stay, and in one case he’s unconscious in a coma. You say, ‘How did that happen?’” Earlier, Mr. Trump sounded shocked at the rapid deterioration of one of his friends. “He’s a tough person, and [he] went to the hospital and a day later he’s in a coma,” the president said. The revelations came within a day of Mr. Trump’s decision, in coordination with his top health advisers, to extend social distancing guidelines until the end of April.

"President Trump pleaded with Americans Monday to put their lives on hold for another 30 days, saying their behavior over the next month will make or break the country’s fight against the coronavirus. “Our future is in our own hands,” he said from the White House Rose Garden. “The choices and sacrifices we make will determine the fate of this virus and really the fate of our victory.” Mr. Trump on March 16 asked the American people to work and learn at home, avoid crowds and nonessential travel and use carryout instead of dining inside restaurants.

Ralph Northam’s decision to largely shut things down through early June. “We’re letting the governors do pretty much what they want with our supervision,” Mr. Trump said. “Some go further than others.” The president said the U.S. is in “good shape” even as the case count reached nearly 160,000. Nearly 6,000 have recovered, yet the death toll neared 3,000. He pointed to the arrival of the USNS Comfort in New York City, the epicenter of the outbreak, to free up hospital space, and said he believes there will be enough ventilators to help patients in the coming days. Mr. Trump says the U.S. will produce so much medical equipment it can send a surplus to hard-hit countries like Italy and Spain. Mr. Trump again suggested that masks are somehow being siphoned out of the supply at one busy New York City hospital and that reporters should look into the spike in usage. “How come now you have 300,000 masks, despite the virus and all?” he said. “How do you go from 10- to 300,000?”  ",Trump says next 30 days 'vital' in coronavirus fight: 'Our future is in our own hands',"Monday, March 30, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/30/trump-says-next-30-days-will-be-pivotal-coronaviru/,washington_times
"BOISE, Idaho — A northern Idaho lawmaker led a church service on Sunday despite a statewide stay-at-home order by Gov. Brad Little to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Republican Rep. Tim Remington, the pastor of The Altar Church in Coeur d’Alene, held the service, but it’s not clear how many attended. Remington, in a YouTube video of the service posted online by the church called it a skeleton crew. Remington didn’t immediately return a call from The Associated Press on Monday. On Sunday, he told worshipers that the stay-at-home order violated their rights. “They have just showed everybody in this nation how because of a flu, OK, they can completely take away all of your First Amendment rights - the right to assemble and everything that belongs to that - they just annihilated,” he said. Idaho has 325 confirmed cases of the virus and six deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally on Monday morning. Remington was appointed to the House of Representatives by the Republican governor in late January after another lawmaker was expelled after being convicted of defrauding the U.S. government. Elsewhere, Idaho officials are considering delaying the May primary due to the coronavirus. On Friday, Secretary of State Lawerence Denney sent a letter to Little requesting the governor issue an order delaying the May 19 primary to no earlier than June 16 and to close the more than 900 polling places. Denney said the delay will give voters time to request an absentee ballot. “In consultation with Idaho’s 44 County Clerks and in consideration of the extreme state of emergency that we now find ourselves in, I have serious concerns regarding the administration of the May 19, 2020 Primary Election,” Denney wrote. He said many of the facilities used as polling places have told county clerks the facilities won’t be or may not be available for the May election. Denney also said polling place workers have concerns for their health and the health of voters. The governor’s office on Monday didn’t have an immediate comment about Denney’s request. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in several weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

"The Trump administration has ruled that gun shops are considered “essential” businesses that should remain open as other businesses are closed to try to stop the spread of coronavirus. Gun control groups are balking, calling it a policy that puts profits over public health after intense lobbying by the firearms industry. In the past several weeks, various states and municipalities have offered different interpretations of whether gun stores should be allowed to remain open as Americans stay at home to avoid spreading the virus. In Los Angeles, for example, County Sheriff Alex Villanueva has twice ordered gun shops in his territory to close, leading to legal challenges from gun rights advocates. After days of lobbying by the National Rifle Association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation and other gun groups, the Department of Homeland Security this past weekend issued an advisory declaring that firearms dealers should be considered essential services - just like grocery stores, pharmacies and hospitals - and allowed to remain open. The agency said its ruling was not a mandate but merely guidance for cities, towns and states as they weigh how to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Still, gun control groups called it a move to put profits over public health. The Brady group on Monday filed a Freedom of Information request with DHS seeking emails and documents that explain how the agency reached its decision to issue the advisory and to determine if it consulted with any public health experts. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.  “The gun lobby is not willing to stand for a few days or a few weeks of less profit in order to protect public health, and it’s outrageous and definitely not required by the Second Amendment,” said Jonathan Lowy, chief counsel for Brady. He added later: “It’s a public health issue, not a Second Amendment issue. The fact is that guns, the nature of guns, require that they be sold with a lot of close interaction. They can’t be sold from vending machines, can’t be sold with curbside pickup.” The gun lobby has been pushing back vigorously against places where some authorities have deemed federally licensed gun dealers are not essential and should close as part of stay-at-home directives. The gun lobby has said it’s critical these shops remain open so Americans, who are buying firearms in record numbers, have the ability to exercise their constitutional rights.  In recent weeks, firearm sales have skyrocketed. Background checks - the key barometer of gun sales - already were at record numbers in January and February, likely fueled by a presidential election year. Since the coronavirus outbreak, gun shops have reported long lines and runs on firearms and ammunition. Background checks were up 300% on March 16, compared with the same date a year ago, according to federal data shared with the NSSF, which represents gunmakers. Since Feb. 23, each day has seen roughly double the volume over 2019, according to Mark Oliva, spokesman for the group. In Texas, the attorney general there issued a legal opinion saying that emergency orders shuttering gun shops are unconstitutional. That stands in contrast to some municipalities, such as New Orleans, where the mayor has issued an emergency proclamation that declares the authority to restrict sales of firearms and ammunition. NSSF and other gun lobbying groups hailed the ruling as a victory for gun owners, especially first-time buyers of a firearm who are concerned that upheaval and turmoil over the virus could affect personal safety. “We have seen over the past week hundreds of thousands, even millions, of Americans choosing to exercise their right to keep and bear arms to ensure their safety and the safety of loved ones during these uncertain times,” said Lawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for NSSF. “Americans must not be denied the ability to exercise that right to lawfully purchase and acquire firearms during times of emergency.”  Brady’s Lowy said it shouldn’t be considered a violation of Second Amendment rights since it’s temporary and in the midst of a pandemic. He likened it to constitutional rights to peaceably assemble, a right that is being curtailed at the moment as Americans practice social distancing.  “If you have a gun in the home, you are exercising your Second Amendment rights. No court has held that you have a Second Amendment right to a stockpile of guns,” he said. The vast majority of states are allowing gun shops to remain open. However, some states that have been the hardest hit by the coronavirus have ruled that gun shops are not essential and should close. In the absence of a mandate from federal authorities, gun groups have been filing lawsuits challenging state and local authorities who are ordering gun shops and ranges to close. The NRA thanked President Donald Trump for the DHS ruling. The NRA has been an unflinching backer of Trump, pumping about $30 million toward his 2016 campaign.

"Black voters in South Carolina helped propel former Vice President Joseph R. Biden to the top of the crowded 2020 Democratic field and they continue to fuel his drive to the nomination, but whether that translates into the crucial high turnout he needs in November remains an open question. In several states with large black populations, Mr. Biden didn’t receive as much support from them as did former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries when she squared off against Vermont Sen. Bernard Sanders — who is also Mr. Biden’s key competitor this time around. For example, in South Carolina and Virginia, Mrs. Clinton respectively captured 86% and 84% of the black vote. By comparison, Barack Obama in the 2008 primaries garnered 78% and 89% in those key states. Mr. Biden’s share of the black vote remained in the 60s. He received 61% from black voters in South Carolina and 66% in Virginia. “There is certainly, as a whole, an energy problem for him,” said Ryan Rhodes, a Republican strategist and presidential campaign veteran. “Right now, they were just trying to stop Bernie. They don’t want to acknowledge the numbers are real.” Exit polls from Michigan and Missouri on Super Tuesday, when more than a dozen states cast their ballot for a Democratic nominee, revealed less than half of all Democratic voters were enthusiastic about Mr. Biden. The lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Biden could be concerns over his age and health, said Towson University professor Richard E. Vatz, a scholar of political rhetoric and campaigning. “In addition, the economic improvement of the African American electorate, pre-coronavirus, lessens support and strength of support for even a historically beloved candidate such as Biden,” he added, referencing a February unemployment rate that was below 6%, before the economic downturn from the spread of COVID-19. The rate had fallen about 2 percentage points since President Trump took office. In the 2016 general election, the turnout for black voters declined for the first time in 20 years, dropping to 59.6% after peaking at 66.6% in 2012, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. The dramatic decline in turnout, coupled with a spike in white voter turnout, hurt Mrs. Clinton, especially in the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin that sealed Mr. Trump’s surprise win in 2016. Still, Mr. Biden has competed in a more crowded field than Mrs. Clinton did in places such as South Carolina, which could contribute to his smaller share of the black vote. Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist who is black and has worked on several presidential primaries in South Carolina, dismissed talks about a lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Biden. “It’s a different race,” he said, forecasting large turnout in November from minority communities that want to push Mr. Trump out of the White House. “Certain communities have more to lose than others,” said Mr. Seawright.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and some of her top chairmen  outlined the Democratic priorities for a phase four coronavirus package  on Monday, but she said she won’t rush to push the bill through. Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, said she doesn’t expect  the package to be ready until after Easter and Passover. However,  lawmakers are working on the package remotely so it will ready for a  vote when Congress returns. “All three of our bills have been bipartisan and we would  want this one to be so as well,” she said. “So right now we’re  collecting information, taking inventory — what are the actual needs.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said last week he  wanted Congress to hold off on pushing through any more major  coronavirus packages until the first three bills had a chance to have an  effect. Phase one cost $8.3 billion, followed by a nearly $105 billion  phase two package, and then last week’s $2.2 trillion phase three. But Democrats already have a long list of issues they want to tackle.One  of their top priorities is shoring up Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) protections for workers on the front line fighting  the coronavirus or ensuring essential businesses keep running. House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Rep. Bobby  Scott of Virginia will take the lead on that portion of the package. He  said the bill would include a measure to have OSHA issue a temporary  emergency standard within seven days to require employers to craft new  protections for affected employees. Democrats also want to expand the types of workers covered  under emergency OSHA protections, including grocers and Transportation  Security Administration employees. “Legislation is required. It’s been blocked three times.  If we fail to act, it will make the situation more dangerous,” Mrs.  Pelosi said. “Rather than call them our heroes, rather than just thank  them, we have to protect them.” Mrs. Pelosi wants the package to also consider how  Americans and the economy will recover from the virus, with a focus on  infrastructure, specifically broadband access and water resources. “There are infrastructure needs that our country has that  directly relate to how we are proceeding with the coronavirus. Many more  people are teleworking, or tele-educating or really communicating with  family and friends,” Mrs. Pelosi said. Democrats also want to undo a part of the phase three bill  that was signed into law last week that categorized D.C. as a  territory, a move Mrs. Pelosi described as “discriminatory.” “It has always been treated like a state,” she said. “And  in the course of that, they lost several hundred million dollars in  funding because of the way it was treated.” Democrats also want to expand on funds to state and local  governments; paid family and medical leave; direct payments to the  American public; and provide free treatment for coronavirus rather than  just free testing. While lawmakers and their staffs can craft legislation  remotely, members of Congress are still trying to weigh the health risks  of reconvening to vote. The phase three package was passed via voice vote on  Friday, but most House members needed to return to the Capitol at the  last minute to ensure the legislation wasn’t derailed by a procedural  motion. Rep. Thomas Massie, Kentucky Republican, attempted to  force a full roll call vote on the $2.2 trillion package so lawmakers  were on record about the bill. “The problem with the whole scheme they had [was] if you  allow Nancy Pelosi to pass bills with nobody there, the fourth version  of this bill — she said the third one is just a downpayment — the fourth  coronavirus bill will be insane and she’ll get to stick anything she  wants in there,” Mr. Massie said on Fox Business Monday. “So we had to  set a precedent that members are going to be there if they are going to  have the vote.” Mrs. Pelosi said leadership is still looking over new policies, but remote voting is off the table for the foreseeable future. “Let’s not waste time on something that’s not going to happen,” she said. A handful of House members have tested positive for the  coronavirus in recent weeks, and several more have gone into  self-quarantine after experiencing symptoms or being exposed to someone  who tested positive. Most recently, Rep. Nydia Velázquez of New York announced  Monday she was diagnosed with a “presumed coronavirus infection” over  the weekend. She was at Friday’s vote. The House is out of session until at least April 20 to  mitigate the risk of spreading the virus among lawmakers during votes or  travel to Washington.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is poised to roll back ambitious Obama-era vehicle mileage standards and raise the ceiling on damaging fossil fuel emissions for years to come, gutting one of the United States’ biggest efforts against climate change. The Trump administration is expected to release a final rule Tuesday on mileage standards through 2026. The change - making good on the rollback after two years of Trump threatening and fighting states and a faction of automakers that opposed the move - waters down a tough Obama mileage standard that would have encouraged automakers to ramp up production of electric vehicles and more fuel-efficient gas and diesel vehicles.  “When finalized, the rule will benefit our economy, will improve the U.S. fleet’s fuel economy, will make vehicles more affordable, and will save lives by increasing the safety of new vehicles,” Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer said Monday, ahead of the expected release. Opponents contend the change - gutting his predecessor’s legacy effort against climate-changing fossil fuel emissions - appears driven by Trump’s push to undo regulatory initiatives of former President Barack Obama and say even the administration has had difficulty pointing to the kind of specific, demonstrable benefits to drivers, public health and safety or the economy that normally accompany standards changes. The Trump administration says the looser mileage standards will allow consumers to keep buying the less fuel-efficient SUVs that U.S. drivers have favored for years. Opponents say it will kill several hundred more Americans a year through dirtier air, compared to the Obama standards. Even “given the catastrophe they’re in with the coronavirus, they’re pursuing a policy that’s going to hurt public health and kill people,” said Chet France, a former 39-year veteran of the EPA, where he served as a senior official over emissions and mileage standards. “This is first time that an administration has pursued a policy that will net negative benefit for society and reduce fuel savings,” France said. Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the senior Democrat on the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, called it “the height of irresponsibility for this administration to finalize a rollback that will lead to dirtier air while our country is working around the clock to respond to a respiratory pandemic whose effects may be exacerbated by air pollution.  “We should be enacting forward-looking environmental policy, not tying our country’s future to the dirty vehicles of the past,” Carper said. In Phoenix, meanwhile, resident Columba Sainz expressed disappointment at the prospect of losing the Obama-era rule, which she had hoped would allow her preschool age children to break away from TV indoors and play outside more. Sainz reluctantly limited her daughter to a half-hour at the park daily, after the girl developed asthma, at age 3, at their home a few minutes from a freeway. “I cried so many times,” Sainz said. “How do you tell your daughter she can’t be outside because of air pollution?” Trump’s Cabinet heads have continued a push to roll back public health and environment regulations despite the coronavirus outbreak riveting the world’s attention. The administration - like others before it - is facing procedural rules that will make changes adopted before the last six months of Trump’s current term tougher to throw out, even if the White House changes occupants. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has been the main agency drawing up the new rules, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. The standards have split the auto industry with Ford, BMW, Honda and Volkswagen siding with California and agreeing to higher standards. Most other automakers contend the Obama-era standards were enacted hastily and will be impossible to meet because consumers have shifted dramatically away from efficient cars to SUVs and trucks. California and about a dozen other states say they will continue resisting the Trump mileage standards in court. Last year, 72% of the new vehicles purchased by U.S. consumers were trucks or SUVS. It was 51% when the current standards went into effect in 2012. The Obama administration mandated 5% annual increases in fuel economy. Leaked versions of the Trump administration’s latest proposal show a 1.5% annual increase, backing off from its initial proposal simply to stop mandating increases in fuel efficiency after 2020. The transportation sector is the nation’s largest source of climate-changing emissions. John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing automakers, said the industry still wants middle ground between the two standards, and it supports year-over-year mileage increases. But he says the Obama-era standards are outdated due to the drastic shift to trucks and SUVs. The Trump administration standards are likely to cause havoc in the auto industry because, with legal challenges expected, automakers won’t know which standards they will have to obey. “It will be extraordinarily disruptive,” said Richard J. Pierce Jr., a law professor at the George Washington University who specializes in government regulations.  States and environmental groups will challenge the Trump rules, and a U.S. District Court likely will issue a temporary order shelving them until it decides whether they are legal. The temporary order likely will be challenged with the Supreme Court, which in recent cases has voted 5-4 that a District judge can’t issue such a nationwide order, Pierce said. But the nation’s highest court could also keep the order in effect if it determines the groups challenging the Trump standards are likely to win. “We’re talking quite a long time, one to three years anyway, before we can expect to get a final decision on the merits,” Pierce said.  — Krisher reported from Detroit.

"Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia announced new “stay at home” orders Monday that imposed severe restrictions on residents, joining a growing number of states that have passed near-total lockdowns in response to the escalating coronavirus outbreak. The forced isolation came as the tally of COVID-19 cases and deaths mount while disrupting the lives of millions of Americans. At the White House, President Trump said the public should steel for at least another 30 days of essentially putting their lives on hold, saying the peak death rate isn’t expected to come for another two weeks. Instead of relaxing recently issued federal “social distancing” guidelines, he said they’ll be “very much as they are, maybe toughened up a bit.” “Really, we have no other choice,” Mr. Trump said. “This is a very vital 30 days. We’re sort of putting it all on the line.” The president said that down the road, he could potentially envision an America where everyone wears a protective mask in public. “It’s certainly something we could discuss,” Mr. Trump said. “We’ll take a look at it — for a period of time. Not forever.” Residents in Maryland, Virginia and D.C. were ordered to stay home except in extremely limited circumstances, with exceptions allowed to obtain goods like groceries, seek medical care, or engage in outdoor activities like jogging or hiking as long as people adhere to proper social distancing guidelines. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan called the COVID-19 a “deadly public health crisis.” “We are no longer asking or suggesting that Marylanders stay home. We are directing them to do so,” said Mr. Hogan, a Republican. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, issued a similar directive. “We need everyone to take this seriously and act responsibly,” he said. “Our message to Virginians is clear: Stay home.” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said residents who willfully violate the city’s new stay-at-home order could be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of up to $5,000 and/or imprisonment of up to three months. In Maryland, violators could face a fine of up to $5,000 and/or up to a year in jail. In Virginia, the punishment could be a fine of up to $2,500 and/or up to a year in jail. At the Rose Garden press briefing, Mr. Trump was asked specifically about Mr. Northam’s June 10 time frame for his order, which extends far beyond the latest end date for the new federal guidance. “We’re letting the governors do pretty much what they want with our supervision,” Mr. Trump said. “Some go further than others.” There are more than 775,000 positive coronavirus cases worldwide and more than 37,000 deaths, according to a tracker from Johns Hopkins University. In the U.S., there are more than 160,000 cases and more than 2,900 deaths. Mr. Trump on March 16 asked the American people to work and learn at home, to avoid crowds and nonessential travel, and to use carryout instead of dining inside restaurants. He hoped to loosen those rules by the end of March and get things up and running by Easter. But on Sunday, he announced he was extending that guidance until April 30 after seeing models that said up to 2 million people could die if the virus was left unchecked. Dr. Deborah Birx, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, said that collectively, states are moving in the same general direction. “These recommendations are recommendations that the globe is using,” Dr. Birx said. “And so we really do recommend that every governor, every mayor looks very carefully and ensures that their communities are utilizing these [guidelines].” In addition to the 8,100 ventilators already being shipped to states from the national stockpile, Mr. Trump said more than 1,000 additional ventilators are set to be shipped in the next 48 hours to states around the country that have been pleading for help. He said there are about 10,000 ventilators in reserve and predicted there will be enough to go around in the coming weeks, despite forecasts from governors across the country that they remain well short of their expected needs. The president spoke by phone with governors Monday to get an update on the supplies they need for their respective states. He also touted several private companies that have stepped up to produce ventilators, which are crucial for treating patients who have tested positive for COVID-19, and that shipments would soon be going to Italy, France, and Spain. “The fact that we’re doing so many so quickly is a tribute to our great companies,” he said. The positive spin came amid grim projections about the expected death toll in the U.S. Earlier in the day, Dr. Birx had said the U.S. could see hundreds of thousands of deaths from the virus even if Americans almost uniformly stuck to the guidelines and actively worked to stop the spread. “If we do things together well, almost perfectly, we could get in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 fatalities. We don’t even want to see that,” Dr. Birx said on NBC’s “Today” program. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It killed thousands in China before the epicenter shifted to South Korea and then Europe and the Americas. Italy has seen the worst death toll, with more than 11,500, followed by Spain at more than 7,300. New York, the hardest-hit U.S. state in the coronavirus outbreak, got some support on Monday with the arrival of the USNS Comfort, a “floating hospital” ship, in Manhattan. The Comfort has capacity for 1,000 beds, which are expected to help free up space in the city’s hospitals for COVID-19 patients. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said the arrival of the ship was welcome news, though he estimated that New York City needs to triple its hospital capacity by May. He said they started the month with about 20,000 working hospital beds in New York City. “It is a daunting task, but we got a big, big boost … this is like adding a whole [other] hospital to New York City,” Mr. de Blasio said. The mayor said entire hospitals will have to effectively transform into all-intensive care units to get through the coming weeks. “That’s how dire, that’s how tough this situation is,” he said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said there are now more than 1,200 coronavirus-related deaths in the state and at least 66,497 positive cases. Both numbers are far and away the most of any state in the country. Mr. Cuomo pleaded with out-of-state health-care workers to come to New York to help out if they were in a position to do so. “As governor of New York, I am asking health care professionals across the country: If you don’t have a health care crisis in your community, please come help us in New York now,” he said. “We’ll return the favor.” Mr. Cuomo had already put the state on near-total lockdown, ordering non-essential employees to work from home and shuttering bars and restaurants, except for carry-out orders. The governor has suggested recently that some of the social distancing rules he imposed on New York could be working, pointing to a declining rate of hospitalizations. But he said Monday there is still too much “density” in New York City, saying the city has been unsuccessfully trying to reduce density in playgrounds. “If that continues, we’ll take a mandatory action to close down playgrounds, as harsh as that sounds,” Mr. Cuomo said. “But it can actually save people’s lives.” In a grim reminder of the toll the coronavirus is taking on New York, a makeshift emergency hospital site popped up in Central Park in recent days. As the virus wreaks havoc on the U.S. economy, Mr. Trump last week signed into law a $2.2 trillion financial rescue package that includes $350 billion to help small businesses make payroll, among other provisions. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Monday that the money for the small business loans should be available by the end of the week. That “will be at lightning speed,” Mr. Mnuchin said on Fox Business Network. He said they expect the $350 billion in small business loans will cover about 50% of the private workforce. The Small Business Administration loans are intended to cover eight weeks of payroll and about 25% of overhead for qualifying companies with 500 or fewer employees. If the companies use the money to bring back or pay employees the loan will be forgiven. “If we run out of money and this is a huge success, we will absolutely go back to Congress and ask for more money,” he said. He also said that the direct deposit checks of at least $1,200 would be showing up in Americans’ accounts in three weeks. The checks were another major part of the package Congress passed in response to the escalating coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Mnuchin said the existing package should help sustain the U.S. economy for the next 8-12 weeks.

"Gov. Andrew Cuomo has emerged as the Democrat of the moment as he leads New York’s response to the coronavirus. The daily press conferences in which he delivers sobering assessments of his state’s worst-in-the-nation crisis have earned him plaudits from many quarters — and given Democrats a national figure rivaling President Trump amid the coronavirus crisis. “He has filled a national void,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a New York-based Democratic consultant who has worked against and for Mr. Cuomo. “He and Trump are in competition for the spotlight, no question, and Trump appears to be in many ways less credible than Cuomo because Cuomo keeps saying it is going to get worse and Trump says this will disappear immediately.” Mr. Cuomo, in his third term as governor, was one of the first to impose a shelter-in-place policy for residents. He’s also battled, cajoled and praised the federal government over its response. Even as New York cases of COVID-19 soar, so does Mr. Cuomo’s popularity. His favorable-unfavorable rating is now 71-23 to the positive among state residents, according to a Siena College poll Monday. That’s up from 44-50 last month. His handling of the coronavirus crisis earns the approval of 87% of state residents in the poll, including 70% of Republicans. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, got positive reviews from just 41% of respondents. The president is tracking Mr. Cuomo’s performance and said Monday he would have made a better presidential nominee for his party than current front-runner Joseph R. Biden — though Mr. Trump claimed some credit for Mr. Cuomo’s rise. “One of the reasons his numbers are high on handling it is because of the federal government,” Mr. Trump said on “Fox & Friends.” “Because we give him ships, and we give him ventilators and we give him all of the things that we are giving him. … We’re giving him four hospitals and four medical centers and all of the things that we have done.” Before the virus, Mr. Cuomo was prepping for a fight over a $6 billion gap in the state budget that he had blamed in large part on a minimum wage increase and increased Medicaid costs. He faced anger even among the Democratic Party’s left wing, which has long questioned his commitment to liberal goals. That’s disappeared amid the virus. “Voters are seeing a side of Cuomo that they rarely if ever have seen, and that is the personal side of Andrew Cuomo,” said Steven Greenberg, a pollster with Siena College. “He is talking about his mom, talking about his daughters, trying to be a comforter.” The pollster said Mr. Cuomo has shown the ability to be reassuring, even as he’s delivering grim news about the virus. It’s very different than the rough and gruff style he displayed for much of his political career, part of a political dynasty — his father also served three terms as governor — while making a name for himself, first as a Cabinet official in the Clinton administration and then as New York’s attorney general. “He knows the state inside out, and he knows politics inside out, and he was basically his father’s Lee Atwater and Karl Rove,” said a New York-based GOP consultant, who has followed Mr. Cuomo’s career. “He is the governor, he is the candidate, he is the campaign manager — all rolled into one.” Speaking Monday in New York, Mr. Cuomo said the number of positive coronavirus cases in the state had risen to 66,000 and the death toll has climbed to 1,218 — up from 965 deaths a day earlier. “That is a lot of loss, that is a lot of pain, that is a lot of tears, that is a lot of grief that people all across this state are feeling,” Mr. Cuomo said. He said his administration is mapping out its response based on the advice of scientists, health care professionals, and data. “There is no crystal ball, but there is science and there is data and there are health professionals who have studied this virus and its progress since China,” he said. Asked about Mr. Trump’s comments, Mr. Cuomo said he takes the president’s comments as a compliment and said his focus is working with the president whenever possible to help protect New York. “If you are doing the right thing by New York, I will say it,” Mr. Cuomo said. “If he is doing the wrong thing for New York, or the rest of the country, I will say it. But I am not going to engage in politics.” Some analysts warn not to read too much into Mr. Cuomo’s popularity spike, pointing out that former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and New York Gov. George Pataki saw their support skyrocket following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. They both made runs for the GOP’s presidential nomination — Mr. Giuliani in 2008, and Mr. Pataki in 2016. Both ended badly. “Down the road speculation tends to be destructive,” Mr. Sheinkopf said. “Talk to ‘President’ Rudy Giuliani.”  ",‘He has filled a national void’: Andrew Cuomo emerges as Democrats’ counterweight to Trump,"Monday, March 30, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/30/andrew-cuomo-emerges-donald-trump-counterweight-am/,washington_times

"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Soldiers patrol the streets with their  fingers on machine gun triggers. The army guards an exhibition  center-turned-makeshift-hospital crowded with rows of metal beds for  those infected with the coronavirus. And Serbia’s president warns  residents that Belgrade’s graveyards won’t be big enough to bury the  dead if people ignore his government’s lockdown orders. Since President Aleksandar Vucic announced an open-ended state of  emergency on March 15, parliament has been sidelined, borders shut, a  12-hour police-enforced curfew imposed and people over 65 banned from  leaving their homes - some of Europe’s strictest measures to combat the  COVID-19 pandemic. The Serbian leader, who makes dramatic daily appearances issuing new  decrees, has assumed full power, prompting an outcry from opponents who  say he has seized control of the state in an unconstitutional manner. Rodoljub Sabic, a former state commissioner for personal data  protection, says by proclaiming a state of emergency, Vucic has assumed  “full supremacy” over decision-making during the crisis, although his  constitutional role is only ceremonial. “He issues orders which are automatically accepted by the government,” Sabic said. “No checks and balances.” In ex-communist Eastern Europe and elsewhere, populist leaders are  introducing harsh measures including uncontrolled cellphone surveillance  of their citizens and lengthy jail sentences for those who flout  lockdown decrees. The human rights chief of the Organization for Security and  Cooperation in Europe said while she understands the need to act swiftly  to protect populations from the COVID-19 pandemic, the newly declared  states of emergency must include a time limit and parliamentary  oversight. “A state of emergency - wherever it is declared and for whatever  reason - must be proportionate to its aim, and only remain in place for  as long as absolutely necessary,” said the OSCE rights chief, Ingibjörg  Sólrún Gísladóttir. In times of national emergency, countries often take steps that  rights activists see as curtailing civil liberties, such as increased  surveillance, curfews and restrictions on travel, or limiting freedom of  expression. China locked down whole cities earlier this year to stop  the spread of the virus as India did with the whole nation. Amnesty International researcher Massimo Moratti said states of  emergency are allowed under international human rights law but warned  that the restrictive measures should not become a “new normal.” “Such states need to last only until the danger lasts,” he told The Associated Press. In European Union-member Hungary, parliament on Monday passed a law  giving Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government the right to rule by  decree for as long as a state of emergency declared March 11 is in  effect. The law also sets prison terms of up to five years for those  convicted of spreading false information about the pandemic and up to  eight years for those interfering with efforts to contain the spread of  the coronavirus, like a curfew or quarantine. Rights groups and officials say the law creates the possibility of an  indefinite state of emergency and gives Orbán and his government carte  blanche to restrict human rights and crack down on freedom of the press. “Orban is dismantling democracy in front of our eyes,”said Tanja  Fajon, a member of the European Parliament, “This is a shame for Europe,  its fundamental values and democracy. He (Orban) abused coronavirus as  an excuse to kill democracy and media freedom.” “This is not the way to address the very real crisis that has been  caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said David Vig, Amnesty  International’s Hungary director. Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga said criticism of Hungary’s  bill were “political attacks based on the wrong interpretation or  intentional distortion” of its contents. Other governments have also adopted extreme measures. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu’s caretaker government passed a series  of emergency executive measures to try to quell the spread of the new  virus. These include authorizing unprecedented electronic surveillance  of Israeli citizens and a slowdown of court activity that forced the  postponement of Netanyahu’s own pending corruption trial. In Russia, authorities have turned up the pressure on media outlets  and social media users to control the narrative amid the country’s  growing coronavirus outbreak. Moscow went on lockdown Monday and many  other regions quickly followed suit. Under the guise of weeding out coronavirus-related “fake news,” law  enforcement has cracked down on people sharing opinions on social media,  and on media that criticize the government’s response to the outbreak. In Poland, people are worried about a new government smartphone application introduced for people in home quarantine. Panoptykon Foundation, a human rights group that opposes  surveillance, says some users who support government efforts to fight  the pandemic worry that by using the app they could be giving too much  private data to the conservative government. While nearly 800 coronavirus cases and 16 deaths have been recorded  in Serbia, according to Johns Hopkins University, testing has been  extremely limited and experts believe the figures greatly  under-represent the real number of victims. Most people suffer mild or  moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, from the virus but for some,  especially older adults and people with existing health problems, more  severe illness can occur, including pneumonia and death. Images of the transformation of a huge communist-era exhibition hall  in Belgrade into a makeshift hospital for infected patients has  triggered widespread public fear of the detention camp-looking facility  that is filled with row-upon-row of 3,000 metal beds. The Serbian president said he was glad that people got scared,  adding he would have chosen even a worse-looking spot if that would stop  Serbs from flouting his stay-at-home orders. “Someone has to spend 14 to 28 days there,” Vucic said. “If it’s not  comfortable, I don’t care. We are fighting for people’s lives.” “Do not Drown Belgrade,” a group of civic activists, has launched an  online petition against what they call Vucic’s abuse of power and  curtailing of basic human rights. It says his frequent public  appearances are creating panic in an already worried society. “We do not need Vucic’s daily dramatization, but the truth: Concrete data and instructions from experts,” the petition says. ___ Associated Press writers Jovana Gec, Pablo Gorondi in Budapest, Hungary, and Vanessa Gera in Warsaw contributed to this report.

"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Gov. Ron DeSantis doesn’t want the people on a cruise ship where four people died and others are sick to be treated in Florida, saying the state does not have the capacity to treat outsiders as the coronavirus outbreak spreads. DeSantis also told a news conference he expects South Florida’s four counties - Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Monroe - will be on near-lockdown until mid-May. DeSantis said it would be “a mistake” to bring the passengers from Holland America’s Zandaam onshore for treatment because South Florida already has a high number of new coronavirus infections and that rate is growing. He said the area’s hospital beds need to be saved for residents and not “foreign nationals.” “We would like to have medical personnel dispatched to the ship,” DeSantis said as he visited a test site at the Miami Dolphins stadium in Miami Gardens. He wants the cruise line to arrange that. The Zandaam left Argentina on March 7 and has not been allowed to dock for more than two weeks. A sister ship, the Rotterdam, took on passengers who didn’t appear to be infected. They were allowed through the Panama Canal on Sunday night and are about three days from Florida. The Zaandam had four doctors and four nurses to treat 1,243 passengers and 586 crew members. About 130 onboard have symptoms, officials said. It is unknown how many passengers and crew have been placed on the Rotterdam. Holland America said the Zaandam currently has 138 U.S. citizens on board, while another 166 U.S. citizens were transferred to the Rotterdam. DeSantis he has been in contact with the Coast Guard and the White House about diverting the ship. Broward County officials will meet Tuesday to decide whether to let the ship dock at its Port Everglades cruise ship terminal, where workers who greet passengers were among Florida’s first confirmed coronavirus cases. Orlando technical writer Laura Gabaroni, 48, and her husband were transferred from the Zaandam to the Rotterdam on Saturday. In a phone interview Monday with The Associated Press, Gabaroni said she wrote a letter to DeSantis pleading that the two ships be allowed to dock in Florida. “Florida continues to receive flights from New York and it allowed spring break gatherings to go on as planned. Why turn their backs on us?” said Gabaroni, who works for a defense contractor. “We hope our elected officials will do the right thing: let the Americans disembark and safely quarantine.” Port Everglades officials said Holland American must submit a plan before arrival that addresses a long list of requirements for entry into the port. “Clearly what must be done is that we save the people of Florida,” Broward Mayor Dale Holness said Monday. The number of confirmed cases in Florida neared 5,500 on Monday with 62 deaths. About 60% of the diagnosed cases are in the four South Florida counties. DeSantis said he would issue an executive order Monday unifying the lockdown order between the counties. They already have ordered the closures of non-essential retail businesses, beaches and parks. DeSantis said the high rate of infection is why he expects the area to be locked down for at least six more weeks. He said he thinks the disease was likely circulating in the area when Miami hosted tens of thousands of guests for the Super Bowl in early February, but any illnesses were thought to be the flu at that point. Despite criticism from Democrats and others, DeSantis has refused to issue a statewide lockdown like many other states have imposed, saying it wouldn’t be fair to counties with few or no reported cases. Most of those are small, rural counties along the state’s northern border. Counties in the Tampa Bay area and central Florida have issued their own lockdown orders. In Tampa, Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister issued an arrest warrant Monday for Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne for defying the county’s order by holding services that attracted hundreds on Sunday. The pastor turned himself in to authorities later Monday. The church has said it sanitized the building, and the pastor said on Twitter that the church is an essential business. He also attacked the media for “religious bigotry and hate.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, even death. The vast majority of people recover, but a surge of cases needing hospital support could overwhelm the health care system’s capacity. • Spencer reported from Fort Lauderdale.

"Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, on Tuesday called for China to shutter its “gross” wet markets, threatening to leverage U.S. trade unless the communist government moves to prevent the spread of deadly viruses originating in such venues. “What can China do to help the world? Shut those markets down,” Mr. Graham said on “Fox & Friends.” Mr. Graham said he planned to write letters to the World Health Organization and the Chinese ambassador demanding action after the [U.K.] Daily Mail reported Saturday that the markets were “still selling bats and slaughtering rabbits on blood-soaked floors as Beijing celebrates its ‘victory’ over coronavirus.” “I’m going to write a letter to the World Health Organization and to the Chinese ambassador asking them to close the Chinese wet markets,” Mr. Graham. “These are open-air markets where they sell monkey, they sell bat. We think this whole thing started from the transmission from a bat to a human.” Mr. Graham referred to the novel coronavirus, which is believed to have originated at a wildlife market in Wuhan, China. Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market located near the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “the national center for China’s bat-virus research,” as reported Monday by Bill Gertz of the Washington Times.

He said that previous viruses have also originated in China through the wet markets, “where you intermingle all kinds of exotic animals — it’s just really a gross display of how you prepare food.” China closed the Wuhan market in January and banned the buying, selling and transportation of wild animals last month in response to COVID-19, which has so far sickened more than 800,000 people and resulted in 39,000 deaths worldwide.

"Nancy Pelosi: Everything we’re doing is specific to the coronavirus challenge House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday said the next round of coronavirus legislation must be “specific” to helping combat and recover from the escalating epidemic, after Democrats had packed one of their last antes with measures tied to issues like collective bargaining and carbon emissions. “This … fourth bill will be about recovery — again, always addressing the emergency and mitigation aspects of it, but to talk about how we go forward and in a way that is specific to the coronavirus,” Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “I want to be very specific — I hear people saying, ‘They’re doing this wish list’ — that isn’t so,” she said. “We have agreed in our negotiations that everything that we’re doing is specific to the coronavirus challenge, and that would be infrastructure for water systems [that are] so essential, broadband because so many people are relying on telecommunication and social media and the rest,” she said. President Trump last week signed into law a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package that will provide billions of dollars for small businesses and cut direct checks of at least $1,200 to millions of Americans, among other items. That followed previous legislation that shored up funding for federal health programs and added money for some social safety net programs. Mrs. Pelosi also told The New York Times that in the next round of coronavirus legislation, Democrats could push to retroactively restore the state and local tax deduction. The GOP’s 2017 tax-cut law put a $10,000 cap on the benefit. The deduction, known as SALT in tax-speak, has continued to be a major point of contention. The benefit disproportionately falls on the wealthy, but Democrats have complained that Republicans intentionally targeted the deduction in their tax package to hurt largely blue, high-tax states like New York and California. A spokesperson for Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican, quickly poured cold water on Mrs. Pelosi’s trial balloon, calling it a nonstarter. “Millionaires don’t need a new tax break as the federal government spends trillions of dollars to fight a pandemic,” the spokesperson said. A spokesman for Mrs. Pelosi said any change would be tailored toward the middle class.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday said she speaks to U.S. presidents on an “as-needed” basis amid reports that she and President Trump haven’t spoken extensively in months. “I’ve always spoken to presidents on an as-needed basis,” Mrs. Pelosi said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “It’s an historic occasion when the speaker and the president speak - it’s history.” Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland were the main point people for the administration in the negotiating over the $2.2 trillion economic rescue package Mr. Trump signed last week. Mrs. Pelosi said she respects such an arrangement. She also pointed out that she attended Mr. Trump’s State of the Union address, after which she ripped up a copy of his speech. “If it’s necessary, I’m sure we will speak,” she said. “I don’t know what I would learn in a conversation with the president. We speak to each other right now, and that’s what he really hears, what people say publicly much more than what you might say in a call.” “I think that those should be public anyway so everybody knows what actually happened in the conversation,” she said. Mr. Trump confirmed that he was watching Mrs. Pelosi’s TV appearance. “I watched a portion of low rated (very) Morning Psycho (Joe) this Morning in order to see what Nancy Pelosi had to say, & what moves she was planning to further hurt our Country,” the president said on Twitter. “Actually, other than her usual complaining that I’m a terrible person, she wasn’t bad. Still praying!” Mr. Trump has questioned the sincerity of Mrs. Pelosi’s oft-used line that she’s praying for him and for the country.

"President Trump and his allies are increasingly blaming Democrats’ impeachment drive for distracting Washington’s attention from the coronavirus outbreak last winter. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said Tuesday that impeachment was a needless preoccupation while the pandemic was unfolding. “It came up while we were tied down on the impeachment trial,” Mr. McConnell told radio host Hugh Hewitt. “And I think it diverted the attention of the government, because everything every day was all about impeachment.” He said the Senate nevertheless “pivoted from the most partisan thing you could possibly be involved in, the impeachment of a president, to a unanimous vote on a $2 trillion package all within a couple of months.” Mr. McConnell credited Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, for raising the alarm with the administration and in Congress. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 entering the U.S. was a person who came from Wuhan, China, on Jan. 15 — the same day Mr. Trump was signing a trade deal with Chinese officials at the White House. The president banned most travel from China on Jan. 31, the same day that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency. On Monday, the president said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s obsession with his impeachment distracted her from the coronavirus outbreak. “Don’t forget, she was playing the impeachment game, her game where she ended up looking like a fool,” Mr. Trump said on “Fox & Friends.” “All she did was focus on impeachment. She didn’t focus on anything having to do with pandemics, she focused on impeachment and she lost. And she looked like a fool.” His comments were in reaction to Mrs. Pelosi blaming him for COVID-19 deaths due to inaction. “As the president fiddles, people are dying,” she said Sunday. Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, also blamed Mrs. Pelosi for focusing attention on Mr. Trump’s impeachment in December and January, when the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in China. He reminded the Senate that Mrs. Pelosi delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate for four weeks. “As we were dealing with this impeachment garbage, China was on fire,” Mr. Graham said last week on the Senate floor. “You’ll hear more about that later in the year.”  ","GOP, Trump blaming impeachment for distractions during virus outbreak","Tuesday, March 31, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/31/gop-trump-blaming-impeachment-distractions-during-/,washington_times
"BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Idaho Gov. Brad Little has signed into law legislation banning affirmative action for state agencies, state contracting and public education. The Republican governor on Monday signed the measure that adds a new section to laws that opponents said negates another section prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or age.  The bill originated in the House and was amended in the Senate to avoid losing federal funding. Backers said the measure is needed so that everybody will be treated equally. Opponents said Idaho has a history of discriminatory behavior against marginalized groups that persists, and the measure allows that behavior to continue.

"Democratic presidential longshot Sen. Bernard Sanders told late-night host Seth Meyers that he still sees a path to defeating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden in the Democratic primary. On Monday night’s episode of “Late Night with Seth Meyers,”  which was shot via satellite due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Vermont senator said that while he can still win the nomination, he’s mainly staying in the race to continue to push his leftist ideals. “We’re about 300 delegates behind — Biden has 1,200 and we have 900,” Mr. Sanders said. “There is a path. It is admittedly a narrow path. “But I would  tell you, Seth, that there are a lot of people who are supporting me,” he continued. “We  have a strong grassroots movement who believe that we have got to stay  in, in order to continue the fight, to make the world know that  we need ‘Medicare for All,’ that we need to raise the minimum wage to a  living wage, that we need paid family and medical leave. One of the  crises that we’re dealing with right now that we must address, climate  change and education, all the issues that we have been talking about. “Campaigns are an important way to maintain that fight and raise public  consciousness on those issues,” he added. Mr. Sanders reiterated he wants to debate Mr. Biden one more time for his chance to sway voters, even though the former vice president said last week it’s not necessary and that voters were ready to move on. Mr. Sanders said Monday, “What a good debate is about is giving the candidates the time they  need to go after each other [and] discuss their differences  in an amount of time that allows for serious discussion. That has not  taken place up to now. The last debate I think gave us a little bit more  time. I would loosen up the structure of it a little bit to allow for  more interchange.” Regardless, the senator again promised to support Mr. Biden if he wins the nomination. “It is absolutely imperative that we defeat Donald Trump, who in my view is the most dangerous president  in the modern history of this country,” Mr. Sanders said. “And we’re seeing just how  dangerous he is with all of the misinformation that he is providing  during this coronavirus pandemic.” “If I am not the nominee, I will do  everything I can to see that Joe Biden is elected president,” he added.

"LOS ANGELES (AP) - Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva, who was sued by gun-rights groups after trying to shut down firearms dealers in the wake of coronavirus concerns, is abandoning the effort. The sheriff said Monday he’s heeding a federal Department of Homeland Security advisory issued on Saturday that listed gun and ammunition dealers as “essential critical infrastructure workers.”  Villanueva called the non-binding memo “persuasive” and announced that his department won’t order or recommend closing businesses that sell or repair firearms or sell ammunition in the nation’s most populous county. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has said that each of the state’s 58 counties can decide for themselves whether to list firearms dealers as nonessential businesses that should be subject to closure while the state seeks to limit the spread of COVID-19.  The disease causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  Villanueva ordered a shutdown of gun shops last week, saying panic-buying that produced long lines at the shops was worrisome from a public safety standpoint. Days later, he issued a second order closing them to the public, despite a county legal counsel’s finding that the stores are essential businesses that should remain open. However, Villanueva’s second order said the stores could still supply security guard companies, and anyone who already purchased a gun and possesses a valid safety certificate could pick up their firearms. On Friday, four groups, including the National Rifle Association of America, filed a federal lawsuit, contending that the sheriff’s actions violate the constitutionally guaranteed right to bear arms. One of the groups, the Firearms Policy Coalition, said Tuesday it planned to continue seeking a judgement and permanent injunction in court so Villanueva and subsequent sheriffs would not be able to do anything similar in the future.

"SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) - A Maryland man linked by the FBI to a white supremacist group and arrested ahead of a gun rights rally in Virginia must remain in federal custody while he awaits trial, a judge ruled Tuesday. U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Boardman refused to set bond for Brian Mark Lemley Jr., who was indicted on gun-related charges. A different magistrate judge previously refused to set bond for two other men who were arrested in January on related charges. Federal authorities have said the three men were members of a white supremacist organization called The Base. A Justice Department prosecutor has said the group’s goal was to accelerate the overthrow of the U.S. government and replace it with a white supremacist regime. Lemley, 34, and fellow Base member Patrik Mathews, 27, discussed “the planning of violence” at a gun rights rally in Richmond, Virginia, in January, prosecutors said in a court filing. A closed-circuit television camera and microphone installed by investigators in a Delaware home captured Lemley talking about using a thermal imaging scope affixed to his rifle to ambush unsuspecting civilians and police officers, prosecutors said. “I need to claim my first victim,” Lemley said on Dec. 23, according to prosecutors. Boardman said prosecutors had presented “very troubling evidence” about Lemley’s actions and words that show he would be a danger to the community if he was released. “The weight of the evidence appears to be very strong,” she said during a hearing conducted by video conference because of coronavirus concerns. Lemley, of Elkton, Maryland, had waived his right to an immediate detention hearing after making his initial court appearance Jan. 16. He and former Canadian Armed Forces reservist Patrik Mathews, 27, separately pleaded not guilty to charges including transporting a firearm and ammunition with the intent to commit a felony.                 William Garfield Bilbrough IV, 19, of Denton, Maryland, pleaded not guilty to charges that he helped transport and harbor Mathews, who is accused of illegally entering the U.S. from Canada. Lemley was a member of a different white nationalist, neo-Confederate organization before he joined The Base last year, according to a filing from prosecutors. In encrypted online chats, Base members discussed what would happen if law enforcement tried to disrupt their activities, the filing says. “For example, in September 2019, in a discussion with other Base members, Lemley wrote, ‘Hey mr fed’ and ‘I spent about 35% of my day daydreaming about killing you today.’ Lemley went on to write, ‘I day dream about killing so much that I frequently walk in the wront (sic) directions for extended periods of time at work,’” prosecutors wrote. FBI agents arrested Mathews, Lemley and Bilbrough as part of a broader investigation of The Base. Authorities in Georgia and Wisconsin also arrested four other men linked to the group.

"Four days after he signed a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package, President Trump called on Congress Tuesday to approve another $2 trillion “phase four” plan, this time to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure. “With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO, this is the time to do our decades long awaited Infrastructure Bill,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “It should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4” The president’s tweet appeared to put him at odds with top congressional Republicans such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, who have been cautioning to wait and see how the biggest rescue package in history helps workers and businesses recover before addressing more legislation. But Mr. Trump’s call put him on the same side as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been pushing a fourth coronavirus bill as a near certainty. She, too, wants infrastructure to be a major component. “This… fourth bill will be about recovery — again, always addressing the emergency and mitigation aspects of it, but to talk about how we go forward and in a way that is specific to the coronavirus,” Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” • David Sherfinski contributed to this report.

"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Almost half of the foreign-born who moved to the U.S. in the past decade were college-educated, a level of education greatly exceeding immigrants from previous decades, as the arrival of highly skilled workers supplanted workers in fields like construction that shrunk after the Great Recession. New figures released this week by the U.S. Census Bureau show that 47% of the foreign-born population who arrived in the U.S. from 2010 to 2019 had a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to 36% of native-born Americans and 31% of the foreign-born population who entered the country in or before 2009. A number of “push and pull” factors, some decades in the making, were responsible. What resulted were drops in immigration from Latin America and increases in Asian immigrants who tended to be better educated, experts said. The changes in immigration had nothing to do with policies from the administration of President Donald Trump, which has attempted to discourage migration across the southern border and often portrayed immigrants as burdens on the U.S. health, safety and welfare systems, demographers said. “These data do not comport with statements by the Trump administration, which have never been based on facts, but on an apparent desire to scapegoat immigrants as the cause of America’s woes,” said Cynthia Feliciano, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis. “Even if we were considering the period prior to 2009, when the educational profile of immigrants was not skewed so highly, the notion that immigrants are a drain on the U.S. economy is just not supported by the evidence.” Immigration from Latin American has been declining for more than a decade, and in the past several years it has even reversed itself with regard to Mexicans, who up until a dozen years ago were the greatest source of new immigrants in the U.S. In the past several years, more Mexicans living in the U.S. went back than came north across the border. Plummeting fertility rates in Mexico starting two decades ago shrunk the number of young job-seekers who would have headed north to the U.S., and the Great Recession a dozen years ago and its aftermath caused the disappearance of jobs in some industries like construction that were attractive to workers with little formal education, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a political science professor at the University of California, Riverside. “The big thing you see, up through 2008, Mexico was the largest-sending country to the U.S., followed by China and India,” Ramakrishnan said. “What you see is a crossover around 2007 to 2009. You see this crossover, where you have China and India as the largest source countries.”  He added, “It’s as much a story about the massive decline in migration from Mexico and central America, as it is a story about increased Asian migration.” Drawing the Asian workers to the U.S. was a demand for highly-educated employees in tech fields that could not be filled with U.S. workers since there was a shortage of U.S. workers with those skills. At the same time in the past decade, many highly-educated workers from Asia who had been in the U.S. for some time were bringing over family members, who also tended to be highly-educated, said Manuel Pastor, director of the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration at the University of Southern California. Trump has long criticized “chain migration,” a pejorative term used by anti-immigrant activists to describe a policy that allows legal U.S. residents to sponsor family members to immigrate to the U.S. It’s the most common form of legal immigration. “The administration’s push was, ‘We need to favor skilled immigrants,’” Pastor said. “We are getting skilled immigrants if we stick to family policy. We have highly educated folks from family policy.” It’s a “snowball effect,” said Richard Wright, a professor in the Department of Geography at Dartmouth. “We have 50-plus years of arrivals from Asia,” Wright said. “A lot of them are arriving with formal skills and they are able to sponsor family members who are also educated.” ___ Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial distracted the federal government from the novel coronavirus as it reached the United States in January, despite warnings at the time from public health experts and members of Congress about the spread of the virus. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday that the deadly virus “came up while we were tied down on the impeachment trial. And I think it diverted the attention of the government, because everything every day was all about impeachment.” The Trump administration has been severely criticized for its slow response to the spreading pandemic, especially for the shortage of coronavirus testing kits  when the infection first spread to the U.S. from China. Trump initially downplayed the crisis, comparing it to the seasonal flu and declaring it may go away on its own. The administration also has been criticized for not supplying needed protective medical gear for health care workers tackling the crisis.  McConnell said Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas was among the first in Congress to raise an alarm about the virus. Cotton, an outspoken critic of China’s communist government, has said he does not trust China to act truthfully about the virus. “He was first, and I think Tom was right on the mark,” McConnell said. ”Tom figured this out early, and he was absolutely right.” Cotton said earlier this month he was looking into holding China “accountable” for the coronavirus pandemic, which he referred to as the “Wuhan coronavirus.” The virus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. “I am not a doctor. I am not a scientist. I am not an epidemiologist. But I could tell from the very beginning that the Chinese Communist Party was lying about everything related to this virus, and that we had to be prepared for the worst,” Cotton said March 16 on the Senate floor. The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus has climbed past 3,500, eclipsing China’s official count. The Trump administration briefed the Senate on Jan. 24 - during the impeachment trial - but the threat posed by the virus was not widely understood. Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate health and foreign relations committees issued a joint statement after the briefing, declaring, “We are monitoring the outbreak of a novel coronavirus closely and are in close communication with United States government agencies on actions and precautions needed to prevent further spread of this virus.” The statement said China “has taken steps to share information with international health experts” and thanked administration officials for providing an update.  Two days later, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called on the Department of Health and Human Services to declare coronavirus a public health emergency, freeing up $85 million for federal agencies. “Should the outbreak get worse they’re going to need immediate access to critical federal funds that at present they can’t access,” Schumer said. The Trump administration declared a public health emergency for the entire U.S. on Jan. 31. “While this virus poses a serious public health threat, the risk to the American public remains low at this time, and we are working to keep this risk low,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at the time. Despite that declaration, the administration - and Trump himself - downplayed the virus for weeks before taking more drastic steps this month. Trump speculated last week that the country could be “opened up”’ by Easter, April 12, but has since said ”social distancing” guidelines should remain in place through April 30 at least.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. The vast majority of people recover. The virus has caused a global pandemic that has sickened about 800,000 people and killed tens of thousands, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

"Idaho Gov. Brad Little has vetoed legislation that would have set up a process to compensate people convicted of crimes they didn’t commit, but suggested he would approve future legislation that didn’t put the state in court as a first step. The Republican governor on Monday said the measure’s objective is admirable, but its process is flawed. “The bill immediately forces the state into an adversarial legal proceeding in court with the claimant,” Little wrote in his veto message. He said that process could be long and costly. He suggested instead using an existing board or commission to review cases, such as the Commission on Pardons and Parole or the Board of Examiners. He said that process would be faster, and claims that get denied could then go to the courts. Little said his office will work with lawmakers to create an acceptable process. The legislation would have paid $60,000 a year for wrongful incarceration and $75,000 per year to someone exonerated on death row. The bill’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Doug Ricks, said six former inmates could have benefited from the measure. He has said the state needs to take responsibility when an innocent person is incarcerated. Idaho is one of 15 states that doesn’t compensate people sent to prison for crimes they didn’t commit. Idaho has several notable cases, including that of Christopher Tapp and Charles Fain. Both testified before lawmakers earlier this year about the pain of being sent to prison for crimes they didn’t commit. Tapp was convicted of rape and murder following the 1996 death of Angie Dodge. He was released in 2017, and DNA evidence cleared him in 2019. Brian Leigh Dripps was arrested on DNA evidence last year and is charged with rape and murder in Dodge’s death. Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder in 1983 following the death of 9-year-old Daralyn Johnson. In 1984 he was sentenced to death. But DNA evidence not available at the time of the conviction later cleared him, and he was released in 2001. Johnson’s killer hasn’t been identified.

"President Trump and his allies are increasingly blaming the Democrats’ failed impeachment drive for distracting Washington’s attention from the coronavirus outbreak this winter. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that impeachment was a needless preoccupation while the pandemic was unfolding. “It came up while we were tied down on the impeachment trial,” the Kentucky Republican told radio host Hugh Hewitt. “And I think it diverted the attention of the government because everything every day was all about impeachment.” He said the Senate nevertheless “pivoted from the most partisan thing you could possibly be involved in, the impeachment of a president, to a unanimous vote on a $2 trillion package all within a couple of months.” Asked Tuesday whether impeachment diverted his attention or his team’s attention from the coronavirus, the president agreed that it had. “I don’t like to think I did. I think I handled it very well, but I guess it probably did,” Mr. Trump said at the daily press conference of his coronavirus task force. “I mean, I got impeached. I certainly devoted a little time to thinking about it. I don’t think I would have acted any differently [on the virus], or I don’t think I would have acted any faster.” Mr. McConnell credited Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, with sounding the alarm to the administration and Congress. COVID-19 entered the U.S. on Jan. 15 when an infected person traveled to Seattle from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated. It was the same day Mr. Trump was signing a trade deal with Chinese officials at the White House. Six days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alerted the public to the first confirmed case of COVID-19 and said it had deployed a team to Washington state to help investigate. The agency said investigators could trace close contacts to determine whether anyone else had become ill. “This is a rapidly evolving situation. CDC will continue to update the public as circumstances warrant,” the agency said. On Jan. 29, the president formed the White House Coronavirus Task Force and appointed Vice President Mike Pence to lead it. The president banned most travel from China on Jan. 31 as the administration declared a public health emergency. The U.S. death toll climbed Tuesday to more than 3,800, with more than 186,000 confirmed cases of infection, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Hospitals and some governors have complained about a lack of medical supplies, and Mr. Trump has been criticized for leading a slow response. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, on Sunday accused Mr. Trump of fiddling while people were dying. Ron Klain, who served as the Obama administration’s Ebola response coordinator and now is advising the presidential campaign of Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden, tweeted that Mr. Trump “found time to do a trade deal with China during impeachment and to praise [Chinese President] Xi for his handling of coronavirus — but not enough time to get us ready.” Mr. Obama weighed in Tuesday by criticizing the Trump administration for its response to the pandemic and for easing fuel economy standards. “We’ve seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic,” Mr. Obama tweeted. “We can’t afford any more consequences of climate denial. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall.” Mr. Trump has forcefully defended his administration’s response and said Mrs. Pelosi’s obsession with his impeachment distracted her from the coronavirus outbreak. “Don’t forget, she was playing the impeachment game, her game where she ended up looking like a fool,” Mr. Trump said Monday on “Fox & Friends.” “All she did was focus on impeachment. She didn’t focus on anything having to do with pandemics. She focused on impeachment, and she lost. And she looked like a fool.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, also blamed Mrs. Pelosi for focusing attention on Mr. Trump’s impeachment in December and January while the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in China. He reminded the Senate that Mrs. Pelosi delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the upper chamber for four weeks. “As we were dealing with this impeachment garbage, China was on fire,” Mr. Graham said last week on the Senate floor. “You’ll hear more about that later in the year.” Mr. Trump initially downplayed the outbreak. On Jan. 22, the day his impeachment trial opened in the Senate, he said “we have it totally under control.” “It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control,” he said. “It’s going to be just fine.” Even as late as Feb. 26, Mr. Trump was saying the U.S. had only 15 cases and the number would soon be “down to close to zero.” Administration officials held a briefing on the coronavirus for the Senate on Jan. 24 at the request of Sen. Lamar Alexander, Tennessee Republican. Politico reported that the classified session was sparsely attended. Mr. Alexander and three colleagues said later that they were “monitoring the outbreak of a novel coronavirus closely and are in close communication with United States government agencies on actions and precautions needed to prevent further spread of this virus.” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, called on the Department of Health and Human Services on Jan. 26 to declare a public health emergency. Secretary Alex Azar declared an emergency five days later. On Feb. 5, lawmakers attended another administration briefing on the virus. Sen. Christopher Murphy, Connecticut Democrat and a frequent Trump critic, said afterward that the administration wasn’t “taking this seriously enough.” “Notably, no request for ANY emergency funding, which is a big mistake,” he tweeted at the time. “Local health systems need supplies, training, screening staff etc. And they need it now.” It was the same day that the Senate acquitted Mr. Trump of both charges in his impeachment trial. Mrs. Pelosi held a weekly news conference Feb. 6 but never mentioned the coronavirus. The House adjourned Feb. 13 and didn’t return to Capitol Hill until Feb. 25. On that day, Mr. Trump asked Congress for $2.5 billion to fight the spread of the coronavirus. Congress approved $8.3 billion. That legislation was followed by a roughly $100 billion measure to pay for free testing and medical leave from work. That was followed last week by the $2.2 trillion disaster relief bill — the biggest in U.S. history — for workers and businesses. A close friend of Mr. Trump, Newsmax Media CEO Christopher Ruddy, said Tuesday that the attacks on the president over his handling of the COVID-19 outbreak “are akin to a ‘blood libel’ and demonstrate a degree of political depravity unseen in our politics.” Writing for his outlet, Mr. Ruddy said neither Mrs. Pelosi nor Trump media detractors such as NBC’s Chuck Todd “were sounding any virus alarm” in January or February. He also noted that Mr. Biden first criticized Mr. Trump for closing most travel from China and said the president had a history of “hysteria and xenophobia.” Many liberal lawmakers and media outlets took a similar tack at the time about the travel bans. Mr. Biden said Tuesday that Mr. Trump isn’t responsible for the COVID-19 coronavirus but is responsible for using all of the powers at his disposal to deal with it. “He’s been very slow to act, for whatever the reason has been,” Mr. Biden said on CNN. “He still hasn’t fully invoked the Defense Production Act. “What about the masks?” Mr. Biden said. “What about the gowns those doctors and nurses need?” ⦁ Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this report.

"The top Republican on a key congressional subcommittee Tuesday demanded answers on how New York City plans to keep the public safe as it releases more than 1,000 prisoners in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Rep. Jody Hice, of Georgia, sent a letter to New York City Department of Corrections Commissioner Cynthia Brann asking how the city intends to deal with inmates who may have been infected with the virus and could spread it to others. Mr. Hice also requested details on the impact a mass prisoner release could have on public safety. About 15 percent of New York’s police force have called out sick with coronavirus-related issues, according to media reports. “Increasing the number of convicted criminals out on the streets — some of whom may even be carriers of the virus — while there is a significant reduction in law enforcement capacity is likely a recipe for disaster,” wrote Mr. Hice, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee’s subcommittee on Government Operations. “This is not the time to make things more difficult and dangerous for the heroic law enforcement officers on the front lines of this fight,” Mr. Hice continued. “If Mayor de Blasio intends to release hundreds of inmates, the public deserves to know what steps his administration is taking — if any — to keep them safe in return.” Prisons are seen as at risk of a massive coronavirus outbreak given their lack of health equipment and and cramped quarters. States and counties across the country are releasing hundreds of non-violent offenders to prevent the spread of the coronavirus behind bars. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he could release as many as 1,000 inmates to reduce the prison population. Mr. Hice asked Ms. Brann to release information about inmates that have already been released or plan to be sprung soon, including their original criminal charges, results of a coronavirus test, and how much time they left to serve.

"Huawei ran a new influence campaign using Facebook ads with disguised political messages, Twitter broadcasts by a leading American law firm, and the Chinese state television’s American division. The effort is designed to make the Chinese tech giant look like the solution to all the world’s problems just as the West’s economies have come to a screeching halt. Huawei ran ads in March on Facebook that predicted a global cyber crisis that could become just as severe or “maybe even worse” than the financial crisis of 2008. The ad encouraged people to “#TrustInTech #HuaweiNow.” Facebook removed the ad because it did not include a disclaimer that it was related to U.S. politics and because Huawei paid for the ad with a foreign currency. “After this ad started running, we determined that it was related to U.S. politics and issues of national importance,” reads a statement posted in the Facebook Ad Library. “We require these types of ads to be paid for in U.S. dollars. This ad was paid for in foreign currency, so we took it down.” Before the ad stopped running on March 9, it received 60,000 to 70,000 impressions from Facebook users primarily in Western Europe, Canada and the United States. When the ad ran, western nations were debating whether and how to allow Huawei to contribute to 5G network technology development in their countries. The U.S. government has not been open to working with Huawei. The Department of Justice indicted the tech giant on racketeering charges in February and President Trump’s administration has announced a coming ban on Huawei doing business in the U.S. None of that stopped Huawei from pushing ahead with its American influence efforts. The company recorded videos with Michael Carvin, partner at the law firm Jones Day, featuring the Capitol dome over his shoulder as he argues that Huawei poses no risk to America. Huawei has shared videos of Mr. Carvin throughout March, and it also paid for ads on Twitter to say its actions are motivated by “human responsibility” and to #ConnectNotDivide. Huawei also looked to capitalize on positive publicity associated with sending medical supplies to New York when the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. The Chinese internet and technology company reportedly delivered 10,000 masks, 20,000 isolation gowns, 50,000 goggles and 10,000 gloves. Chinese state television sought to capitalize on the aid and promoted it as an example of Huawei’s benevolence. CGTN America, a registered foreign agent acting on behalf of China, made a 60-second video documenting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo thanking Huawei online. Huawei posted its annual financial report Tuesday arguing that it is a victim of an “unprecedented smear campaign by the U.S. government.” Company officials did not respond to requests for comment. “Nonstop pressure from the U.S. government, in a deliberate attempt to spread disinformation, has put our company under the spotlight,” the Huawei financial report said. “In response, we have made a concerted effort to enhance transparency and communicate more proactively with the world. We remain committed to the facts and open information sharing.” While millions of Americans have lost their jobs and thousands get sick and die, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told the South China Morning Post that the coronavirus has not affected his workforce and 90% of the company’s production and development efforts were working last week. Mr. Zhengfei said the company planned to increase its research and development budget to more than $20 billion in the coming year, up from about $15 billion. Former Rep. Mike Rogers said Huawei’s expansion of its R&D budget is evidence of the company’s intent to “take advantage of” the rest of the world hunkering down. Mr. Rogers, who now leads the advocacy group 5G Action Now, pointed to the Chinese government subsidizing Huawei an estimated $75 billion and said the company also categorizes activity not always considered R&D to take advantage of the government aid. “If you look at how the Chinese influence their region — where they find ethnic Chinese and Chinese speakers living around the world, they target them — now they’ve got the notion of ‘Hey, you know what? We don’t have to have big diplomatic efforts,’” Mr. Rogers said. “All you have to do is communicate with people to where they’re on their laptops and we can win this fight and they’ve got plenty of money to do it.” Huawei’s combative relationship with the U.S. looks unlikely to thaw any time soon, and Mr. Rogers said the larger fight between the U.S. and China has the smell of a new Cold War. “This is a new dynamic and so I don’t think the old Cold War standard counts but when you look at what’s coming next, data is the next battleground for national security,” Mr. Rogers said. “Why? Because you don’t have to launch a missile, you can fight this thing remotely. You can do things by proxy in ways you never could do before. So I’m not sure I’d call it a Cold War but it certainly is chilly in the tech space and data dominance.”  ",Huawei runs campaign to look like solution to global problems,"Tuesday, March 31, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/31/huawei-runs-campaign-look-solution-global-problems/,washington_times
"Immigration activists stepped up their campaign to force ICE to release migrants amid the coronavirus crisis, taking to the streets in California in a drive-by protest Tuesday demanding the governor issue an emergency shutdown order for federal detention facilities in the state. In Washington, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus said it wants to see “thousands” of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally being held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement be released — and said for good measure migrants being processed at the border should be immediately released as well. While there may be some exceptions for the most dangerous illegal immigrants, most of the tens of thousands currently being held should be freed, the caucus’s leaders said. “Ideally you would get everybody out of those confined spaces where they’re sitting ducks for this virus,” said Rep. Joaquin Castro, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the caucus. In California, activists from a number of Jewish groups teamed up with immigrant rights advocates to urge state leaders to force ICE’s hand. They called for Gov. Gavin Newsom and local authorities to claim emergency powers to impose a release. “We know that Anne Frank didn’t die in the gas chambers, but rather she died of a communicable disease in the crowded and dirty conditions of a detention center,” says Sam Tunick with Never Again Action Bay Area. “We don’t want to see history repeated — we are doing what we wish bystanders during the Holocaust had done for our ancestors.” The groups staged their protest Tuesday by driving cars by ICE facilities in Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as the state Capitol in Sacramento. They said they were defying Mr. Newsom’s shelter-in-place orders by staging the protest, which included cars decked out with anti-Trump and anti-ICE posters, and chants of “Hey hey, ho ho, racist ICE has got to go.” ICE has released a small number of migrant detainees amid the pandemic, some of them on its own and some under court orders. A Pennsylvania judge ordered a new round of releases Tuesday, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. That follows releases in New York and California last week. But the Hispanic Caucus lawmakers said that’s not nearly enough. They point to some infectious disease experts who say the communal nature of prisons, jails and detention facilities makes them particularly dangerous, since social distancing generally isn’t possible. Once one inmate or detainee is infected, the coronavirus would quickly spread, they predicted. ICE said it couldn’t comment on the pending court cases, but said it makes custody determinations every day based on individual circumstances, including whether the law requires detention, the person’s level of criminality and dangers of flight or risk to the community. ICE said in a statement it can use post-release monitoring “for a variety of reasons.” In court papers, the Trump administration has argued the requests for mass releases are not well thought out, and have insisted ICE is taking steps consistent with guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hispanic Caucus members said most immigrants living illegally in the U.S. have family members already here, and they could be released to those families on promises they’ll return for their court dates and deportations, if so ordered. Naureen Shah with the ACLU, said the organization has seven lawsuits pending demanding migrants’ release. She said each of those ups the pressure on ICE field directors. “You may be thinking twice about whether or not you really should be keeping all those people there,” she said. Some federal judges who have ruled on requests for release have scolded ICE, with one saying the agency showed “callous disregard” for migrants’ safety. “This is an unprecedented time in our nation’s history, filled with uncertainty, fear, and anxiety. But in the time of a crisis, our response to those at particularly high risk must be with compassion and not apathy,” wrote Judge Terry Hatter Jr., in the Central District of California. Amnesty International USA and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service are taking another approach, calling for people to send letters, poems and artwork to migrants being held in detention to boost their spirits. “If this crisis has made anything clear, it is that we are all dependent upon each other to ensure the health and well-being of our neighbors and ourselves,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of LIRS. “We may have to self-isolate for the time being, but we know that hope can’t be quarantined.”  ","Immigration activists take to streets, demand ICE release migrants being held in custody","Tuesday, March 31, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/31/immigration-activists-take-streets-demand-ice-rele/,washington_times
"The federal government is considering changes to current guidance that says healthy members of the general public don’t need to wear protective masks amid the escalating COVID-19 outbreak. Health officials have hotly debated whether there are preventive benefits to shielding your face if you aren’t sick. Members of the White House coronavirus task force say they’re carefully eyeing a potential change. “My feeling is that [if] people want to do it, there’s certainly no harm to it. I would say do it,” President Trump said Tuesday at his daily White House coronavirus task-force press conference. Mr. Trump suggested that people could use scarves to protect their faces, saying they want masks to go to hospitals right now. “It’s not a bad idea — at least for a period of time,” he said. Dr. Anthony Fauci on Tuesday said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is looking at the issue. “If we do not have the problem of taking away masks from the health care workers who need them, I would lean towards it,” Dr. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN’s Sanjay Gupta. “What harm can it do if you have enough masks?” The CDC has said people who are sick should wear face masks, but that others don’t need to do so unless they’re caring for someone who is sick. The agency counsels that critical supplies should be saved for caregivers. The World Health Organization has likewise advised that healthy people only need to wear a mask if they’re taking care of a person with a suspected COVID-19 infection. U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams cited the official CDC and WHO guidance in making the case Tuesday that the general public shouldn’t start wearing masks as a protective measure. For one, wearing a mask improperly can increase someone’s risk of getting a disease because people might touch their faces more, he said. Second, he added, it can give a false sense of security, and finally, there are still personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages across the country. “So we want to make sure we are reserving PPE for the people who most need it,” Dr. Adams said. “That’s how you’re going to get the largest effect because if health care workers get sick, they can’t take care of you when you get sick.” Still, there are active discussions at the CDC about the guidelines. “If you have a mask and it makes you feel better, then, by all means, wear it. But know that the more you touch your face, the more you put yourself at risk,” Dr. Adams said on Fox News. Questions persist about whether there are potential health benefits to wearing a mask amid the outbreak. The surgeon general shot down the idea of mass producing for public use the N95 masks that health care workers are wearing. COVID-19 is a viral respiratory disease, and it’s unclear how long and under what conditions the virus can survive in the air or on other surfaces. Dr. Michael Ryan with the WHO downplayed the notion that wearing masks has any potential benefit for the general population. “Right now the people most at risk from this virus are frontline health workers who are exposed to the virus every second of every day,” Dr. Ryan said this week. “The thought of them not having masks is horrific.” But Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner under President Trump, is among those making the case that the federal government should be encouraging the public to wear masks as part of the coronavirus response. The nonmedical fabric face masks can slow the spread of the virus if they’re widely used because they could prevent asymptomatic people from transferring it unknowingly, Dr. Gottlieb and others wrote in a coronavirus “Roadmap to Reopening” published this month by the American Enterprise Institute. Dr. Gottlieb said this week that self-made cotton protective masks could be key when the country tries to open back up amid various state lockdown orders. “Telling people well, you don’t have to stay at home any more, but if you go out you have to wear a mask — that could be an interim step that you take as you transition away from these very restrictive measures,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”  ",CDC reconsidering advice against public wearing of masks to stem coronavirus spread,"Tuesday, March 31, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/31/cdc-mask-recommendarions-coronavirus-being-reconsi/,washington_times
"A Florida pastor has been arrested for holding church services, a New Jersey man was ticketed after holding a house party, and Rhode Island’s governor ordered police to hunt down and fine New Yorkers who aren’t quarantining themselves. If those government responses to the coronavirus strike you as out of bounds in the land of the free, you’ll have to grin and bear it, legal scholars say. Government crackdown on citizens’ most basic freedoms usually pass constitutional muster during a time of crisis, said Ilya Shapiro, director of the Cato Institute’s Robert A. Levy Center for Constitutional Studies. “There is a general police power that states have and courts are deferential to that kind of authority in an emergency,” he said. “A pandemic certainly qualifies.” A New Hampshire judge already batted down a challenge to Gov. Chris Sununu’s order banning gatherings of 50 people or more. The legal action was brought by a group of residents who said the order prohibited them from attending religious gatherings and political meetings in violation of their constitutional rights. In Pennsylvania, a group of business owners objected to Gov. Tom Wolf’s order closing all businesses that are not defined as essential. The case is pending at the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Most recently, the religious-liberty law firm Liberty Counsel took up the fight of a Florida pastor, Rodney Howard-Browne, who was arrested after holding church services Sunday in a county where events with more than 10 people have been banned. Mat Staver, the founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, said the county’s order has too many holes in it, permitting some activities so long as the six-feet social distancing is observed but banning all religious events even if the six-feet requirement is honored. Mr. Howard-Browne says he honored the social distancing requirements and had hand sanitizer available for everyone entering the church. “Neither the Constitution nor Florida law protecting churches and the free exercise of religion disappear. This order from Hillsborough County is not narrowly tailored to achieve its underlying objective,” Mr. Staver said. State officials generally have laws on the books giving them police powers in times of emergency to protect the well-being of society. “States and cities can expect courts to be highly deferential on pandemic measures. Under the Constitution, the primary authority over public health and police powers rests with the states,” said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at the George Washington University. To successfully challenge the mandates, individuals would need to show the state officials are allowing yoga classes, for example, but not church gatherings. The onus falls on the citizen to show there is no basis for what the governors are doing or that the restrictions are arbitrarily applied, the scholars said. Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law, said the leading Supreme Court precedent upholding state action is a ruling permitting states to require smallpox vaccinations. He noted several state court rulings also upheld quarantines and limiting an individual’s mobility. Mr. Blackman said it would not be problematic for President Trump to issue such a quarantine around New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut, which the president had suggested over the weekend to keep the virus from spreading to other states as people travel south. “The federal government would have the powers to enforce that domestic travel ban. In theory, the courts should be deferential to that quarantine measure,” he said.

"Presidential adviser Ivanka Trump said Tuesday she’s mostly working from home during the coronavirus outbreak while also caring for her three children, learning to play guitar and studying Greek mythology. “I have been working from home when I can, coming in [to the White House] only when I need to,” Ms. Trump said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “I’m doing as much telephonically as possible. I’ve got three young kids who are growing more restless by the day.” She and her husband, presidential adviser Jared Kushner, have three children, ages 8, 6 and 4. Ms. Trump, the president’s eldest daughter, said she’s dealing with an experience that “pretty much every parent around the country is going through.” “It’s a unique time, but I’m trying to reframe all of it through through the lens of the joy of having this family connectivity even if it’s sometimes toxic, and you know, on weekends and now in the evenings where normally we would have had a work-related commitment or something else, a school function,” she said. Ms. Trump said she also has been using the time “to expand my own mind and explore things I normally wouldn’t have prioritized.” That includes free online courses in Greek and Roman mythology, and learning to play guitar. “I’m re-reading ‘The Odyssey,’ and started to learn to play the guitar and now I’m really working on it, as I sit with my kids and when they’re asleep or napping. That’s what I’m doing,” Ms. Trump said. She promoted the recently approved $2.2 trillion economic rescue package signed by her father, saying it will help small businesses and families through a tough period, including with paid family leave. “We’ve created a mechanism whereby employers that offer paid leave — if their companies have under 500 employees, which means the vast majority of those who are not currently offering it — if they offer it, we will give them a full reimbursement of that in the form of a tax credit,” she said.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday said the next round of coronavirus legislation must be “specific” to helping combat and recover from the escalating epidemic, after Democrats had packed one of their last antes with measures tied to issues like collective bargaining and carbon emissions. “This … fourth bill will be about recovery — again, always addressing the emergency and mitigation aspects of it, but to talk about how we go forward and in a way that is specific to the coronavirus,” Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “I want to be very specific — I hear people saying, ‘They’re doing this wish list’ — that isn’t so,” she said. “We have agreed in our negotiations that everything that we’re doing is specific to the coronavirus challenge, and that would be infrastructure for water systems [that are] so essential, broadband because so many people are relying on telecommunication and social media and the rest,” she said. President Trump last week signed into law a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package that will provide billions of dollars for small businesses and cut direct checks of at least $1,200 to millions of Americans, among other items. That followed previous legislation that shored up funding for federal health programs and added money for some social safety net programs. Mrs. Pelosi also told The New York Times that in the next round of coronavirus legislation, Democrats could push to retroactively restore the state and local tax deduction. The GOP’s 2017 tax-cut law put a $10,000 cap on the benefit. The deduction, known as SALT in tax-speak, has continued to be a major point of contention. The benefit disproportionately falls on the wealthy, but Democrats have complained that Republicans intentionally targeted the deduction in their tax package to hurt largely blue, high-tax states like New York and California. A spokesperson for Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican, quickly poured cold water on Mrs. Pelosi’s trial balloon, calling it a nonstarter. “Millionaires don’t need a new tax break as the federal government spends trillions of dollars to fight a pandemic,” the spokesperson said. A spokesman for Mrs. Pelosi said any change would be tailored toward the middle class.

"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Citing the unprecedented challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic, city officials across California are asking Gov. Gavin Newsom to suspend or delay numerous state laws, saying they can’t comply with everything from environmental regulations to public records laws that give people a window into how the government is spending public money.  Noting that “city resources and personnel are stretched thin” responding to the pandemic, the executive director of the League of California Cities asked Newsom last week to “take immediate action to pause certain statutory requirements.” The league that represents nearly 500 cities is seeking to delay the state’s constitutionally mandated California Public Records Act, which requires transparency in government decision-making and spending. The law requires public agencies to respond to requests for information within 10 days, though many routinely drag their feet with legally allowed extensions. Spokeswoman Kayla Woods said the group is not seeking to suspend all public records requests, but wants “flexibility to cities if their ability to respond to certain PRA requests is limited due to decreased staffing or closure of city facilities.” She said the delay would be limited to records requests “other than those created during, and relating to, the COVID-19 crisis.” “Cities have varying levels of staffing and resources, and are focusing nearly all of their efforts on responding to this public health crisis,” Woods said in an email.  The danger with suspending such laws, even partially or temporarily, “is that the public won’t know and won’t have ability to oversee financial improprieties, public employee wrongdoing, fraud - myriad important aspects of the government will not be able to be seen by the public if the public doesn’t have access to public records,” said Duffy Carolan, a San Francisco attorney who represents media outlets.  The league’s request comes as governments worldwide are spending billions of dollars, often through contracts with private companies, to build emergency hospitals, acquire hotel rooms and buy much-needed personal protective equipment. In California alone, the state Legislature approved $1 billion in emergency spending that will filter out to local governments. Newsom has already waived regulations on everything from hospital staffing to school funding in sweeping executive orders. He temporarily suspended parts of the state’s open meeting laws, allowing boards and commissions to meet and vote by teleconference and exempting rules that people be allowed to speak in person. The governor’s office did not respond to a request Tuesday from The Associated Press Tuesday asking whether he is considering any more such suspensions.  Across the U.S., governors, lawmakers, mayors and county officials have already opted to keep the public away from public meetings for the sake of health. Federal agencies have cited the crisis in refusing to respond to records requests. In California, the mayor of San Francisco suspended the city’s stringent Sunshine Law and Fresno’s city council voted to suspend the entire California Public Records Act.  In response, 132 good government and media companies have urged governments to redouble transparency during the crisis, saying credibility is more critical than ever.  “As people are asked to make increasing sacrifices in their daily lives for the greater good of public health, the legitimacy of government decision-making requires a renewed commitment to transparency,” the groups wrote.  In response to his request for emails related to Sonoma County’s coronavirus response, county officials told Santa Rosa Press-Democrat reporter Tyler Silvy that “the public’s interest is not served by diverting staff resources away from essential emergency response work to immediately respond to records requests.” In subsequent correspondence, a county attorney told Silvy the county would process such requests when normal business resumes.  Aaron Field, a San Francisco attorney who specializes in media law and is co-chair of the Northern California Society of Professional Journalists’ freedom of information committee, noted that the California Supreme Court has said open government “is essential to the functioning of society,” so the bar for suspending such a rule - even temporarily - should be high. “In the midst of a crisis in which the government is more involved in our daily lives than it has ever been in my memory, it’s more important than ever for public access to be preserved,” he said.  The League of California Cities requested a host of delays in its six-page letter. Woods, the league’s spokeswoman, said many city employees who would normally work on fulfilling statutory requirements “have been pulled from their regular assignments to work on these vital emergency response efforts.” The League is requesting delays to numerous waivers and deadlines, including for construction project approvals, housing reviews and annual staff salary information. It also seeks to: - Suspend a California law requiring public officials to file statements of economic interest that can show conflicts of interest and weighing fees for late submissions, which California’s Fair Political Practices Commission approved. Woods said the suspension ensures that local leaders can focus on responding to the crisis.  - Delay some parts of California’s environmental law by four months, including the need to hold timely meetings and a rule requiring California Environmental Quality Act reviews to be completed within a year. - Cut by 25% the locally required spending on some transportation projects, which governments have previously sought to waive; and extend the deadline to approve some construction projects.

"YUMA, Ariz. (AP) - Border Patrol agents in Yuma are being credited with rescuing three immigrants from a canal adjacent to the Colorado River.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials said the three immigrants from India were found to be in distress and struggling to stay afloat Monday in the Salinity Canal. Agents deployed a water rescue bag and pulled the three immigrants to safety.  Border Patrol officials say the three were in good health and refused additional medical treatment.

"NEW DELHI (AP) - They were hungry. Some had not eaten for days. Others survived on water and biscuits. But they walked anyway for hundreds of miles, in groups of families that included men and women, young and old - all trudging along deserted highways. Some had nothing but flip-flops on their feet, and others lugged bags on their heads. Young parents balanced children on their shoulders. Over the past week, India’s migrant workers - the mainstay of the country’s labor force - spilled out of big cities that have been shuttered due to the coronavirus and returned to their villages, sparking fears that the virus could spread to the countryside. It was an exodus unlike anything seen in India since the 1947 Partition, when British colonial rule ended and the subcontinent was split between Hindu-majority India and mostly Muslim Pakistan.  India’s 21-day lockdown has effectively kept 1.3 billion people at home for all but essential trips to places like markets or pharmacies. But the world’s largest lockdown has turned into a humanitarian crisis for India’s improvised workforce.  They mostly live in squalid housing in congested urban ghettos. But with no daily earnings, no savings, and thus no way to buy food, they must head to their home villages to survive. Train services are suspended, taxis are unaffordable and the hundreds of buses brought to the outskirts of New Delhi to ferry people home lacked enough seats. That leaves walking. The government told India’s top court on Tuesday that 500,000 to 600,000 migrants have walked to their villages from cities. As the crisis worsened, authorities scrambled to arrange transport, shelter and food for them. But it was too late. Some people died under the physical strain of the relentless walking, while others were killed in road accidents. Some were beaten at state borders by police, who said they were just trying to manage the crowds of people. Shiv Kumari, 50, said she was thrown out of her rented accommodation in the northern state of Haryana by her landlord. She and her 28-year-old son packed their bags and set off on an arduous journey of 900 kilometers (550 miles) to their home. On Monday afternoon, the mother-son duo, visibly exhausted, crossed a bridge over the Yamuna River, which is considered sacred by Hindus. But they were still 110 kilometers (68 miles) short of their destination. “We have been walking for last five days,” Shiv Kumari said.

"UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The U.N. Security Council didn’t issue a statement after discussing North Korea’s latest missile tests but six European nations on the council are condemning Pyongyang’ repeated launches, saying they illustrate its ongoing efforts to develop its ballistic missile programs and expand its arsenal. Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom said in a statement after a closed council discussion Tuesday that they are deeply concerned by North Korea’s continued testing of missiles, using ballistic missile technology.  The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the country’s official name, has conducted 17 sets of missile launches since May 2019 including four this month, the latest on March 29. “We condemn such provocative actions,” the Europeans said. “They undermine regional security and stability, as well as international peace and security, and are in clear violation of unanimously adopted UN Security Council resolutions.” Germany’s deputy U.N. ambassador Juergen Schulz told the council it was sad that North Korea is giving priority to its illegal weapons programs instead of making global solidarity and cooperation a top priority and working with the World Health Organization and the U.N. on “the unprecedented global threat faced by the COVID-19 pandemic.” “Unfortunately, there seems to be a lack of transparency in DPRK’s cooperation with the U.N. over COVID-19 which we find dangerous and cynical,” he said. The Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea which Germany heads has granted “all COVID-19 related humanitarian exemption requests with unprecedented speed and urgency,” Schulz said. “The sanctions are therefore no impediment to effectively combating COVID-19 in the DPRK.”  Talks to rein in North Korea’s nuclear program have stalemated since the collapse of the second summit between the North’s leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in early 2019, where the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.  Following the breakdown in talks, the North ended a 17-month pause in ballistic activity and resumed weapons launches while pressuring Washington and Seoul for concessions. The weapons launches included a developmental mid-range missile that could be launched from submarines, a “super large” multiple rocket launcher, and a new mobile, solid-fuel missile system. The joint statement again urged North Korea “to engage in good faith in meaningful negotiations with the United States aimed at denuclearization, to take concrete steps to abandoning all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and to refrain from further provocations.” “There is no other way to achieve security and stability on the Korean peninsula,” the Europeans said. “Continued provocations risk undermining the prospect for successful negotiations.” They called on the Security Council and all countries to implement sanctions against North Korea.  China and Russia have called for the easing of sanctions against North Korea to spur a resumption of talks between Pyongyang and Washington. But their joint resolution proposing some easing has languished in the Security Council because the U.S., its Western allies and other members want to see North Korean actions toward denuclearization before any measures are lifted.

"President Trump continues to be a steady public presence in the midst of coronavirus, appearing alongside medical experts, the nation’s leading manufacturers, law enforcement personnel and others. As is mentioned time and again, the news media has not been kind to Mr. Trump and his administration over these many weeks, using his daily responses to the challenge as a vehicle for criticism, mockery — or to suggest that the president is alarming the public. Frightening them? Uh, no. This is not the case. “Trump’s not scaring people about the coronavirus. The media are,” writes Eddie Scarry, a columnist for The Washington Examiner. “I understand critical reporting, but if anyone is guilty of scaring the public, it’s the national media. They have reported on this pandemic and the administration’s response to it as though it were something out of the Book of Revelations. Every single death is characterized as an avoidable tragedy — something that we should have been able to stop if not for an inept president,” Mr. Scarry said. “We can take for granted that the spread of a deadly new virus is a bad thing. But it’s kind of useless to ask the president if he “frightened” people or if he’s giving the public a “false sense of hope” in being too optimistic or pessimistic about certain medicines or quarantine measures,” he continues. “Reporters can keep people in a panic as long as they want. But their worthless nagging about the administration’s response to a health scare nobody yet completely understands is just that — worthless,” Mr. Scarry concludes. TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN HIGH GEAR Some things continue despite coronavirus. President Trump’s reelection campaign is attracting a diverse pool of voters who are dedicated fans. SO far, the campaign has formed a dozen separate interest coalitions for women, Hispanics, blacks, pro-life advocates, military vets, evangelicals, workers, Irish-Americans, Greek Americans, “cops” and even disgruntled Democrats. The campaign now has added a 12th interest group: “American Sheriffs for Trump”. “Co-chaired by Sheriff Bunny Welsh of Pennsylvania and Sheriff Thomas Hodgson of Massachusetts, this coalition will aim to unite and mobilize sheriffs and all law enforcement officers across the country to help re-elect President Trump,” the campaign said. “President Trump understands how crucial our law enforcement officers are to the safety and wellbeing of this country and has made it a priority to honor, cherish, and support our men and women in blue,” says Ms. Welsh. “Unlike those on the radical left who blatantly attack, accuse and demonize law enforcement officials, President Trump has and will always work to ensure these heroes are supported and honored for their selfless service.” THE PARTIES GET BUSY As the Trump campaign forges ahead, so too does the Republican National Committee. It is now wooing multiple demographics via a half dozen interest groups bearing these titles: GOP Hispanics, Black Republican Activists, Asian Pacific Americans, GOP Faith, Young Leaders and Veterans & Military Families. Ever mindful of the competition, the Democratic Party has organized 16 separate demographic groups dedicated to similar callings — including “Democrats abroad,” disabled voters, union members, the LGBTQ community, American Indians, rural Americans and students, among others. FAITH GETS MUSCULAR The majority of Americans are now praying for an end to the spread of the coronavirus, even those who have overlooked their faith. “The virus has impacted Americans’ religious behaviors. More than half of all U.S. adults (55%) say they have prayed for an end to the spread of coronavirus. Large majorities of Americans who pray daily (86%) and of U.S. Christians (73%) have taken to prayer during the outbreak — but so have some who say they seldom or never pray and people who say they do not belong to any religion (15% and 24%, respectively),” reported the Pew Research Center in a wide-ranging survey released Tuesday. A majority of Democrats — 51% — say their personal life has changed in a major way, compared with 38% of Republicans. “Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say they are comfortable continuing with regular activities. Republicans are significantly more likely than Democrats to say they are comfortable going to a grocery store and visiting friends and are far more likely than Democrats to say they are comfortable eating in a restaurant,” the pollster noted. “Roughly seven-in-10 Republicans (69%) say they are comfortable visiting with a close friend or family member at their home, while 31% say they would be uncomfortable. Democrats are more divided: 55% say they would be comfortable doing this while 45% say they would not.” The Pew Research Center survey of 11,537 U.S. adults was conducted March 19-24. FOXIFIED Fox News completed the first quarter of 2020 with the largest audience in network history throughout the day and primetime hours, according to Nielsen Media Research. As it has done for over 18 years, Fox News has bested its news rivals during that three-month period with an average 3.4 million viewers during primetime, compared to 1.9 million for MSNBC and 1.4 million for CNN. Primetime host Sean Hannity remains the ratings king, drawing 4.2 million viewers. Non-news rivals were also trounced. Fox News was also the most-watched network in the entire cable realm during the day and prime time, now marking 15 consecutive quarters — that’s 45 months — in the top spot, also marking 49% growth in total day and 45% in prime time in the last year — the biggest gain of any cable news network. POLL DU JOUR 77% of U.S. investors remain optimistic about the long-term economic outlook. 70% are concerned about the coronavirus pandemic. 59% are pessimistic about the short-term economic outlook. 58% don’t plan to adjust their portfolios. 42% plan to wait until stocks fall another 5% to 20% to buy. 34% believe “now” is a good time to buy stocks.

"President Trump, speaking in unusually somber tones, told Americans on Tuesday to brace for a “very, very painful two weeks” and begged them to stay at home as much as possible through April 30, saying 100,000 to 200,000 people could die from COVID-19 despite his team’s best efforts to fight the coronavirus and that they want to depress that number. Mr. Trump wanted to get the nation “raring to go” by Easter, but sobering models forced him to reverse course and plead with people to work and learn at home, avoid nonessential travel and stay out of restaurants for additional weeks. “I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. The president called for sacrifices as his coronavirus task force said the virus could kill far more Americans than car crashes or influenza do each year. “As sobering a number as it is, we should be prepared for it,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Administration officials said the models are guided by epidemiology but aren’t gospel. Actual outcomes will be guided by human behavior. Social distancing, a term that has become part of the lexicon, “is going to be the answer to our problems,” Dr. Fauci said. Mr. Trump said social distancing is working, noting up to 2 million people might have died had the nation “done nothing.” “A hundred thousand is, according to modeling, a very low number,” Mr. Trump said. “I think we’re doing better than that.” Still, the estimates are sobering — the notion of 100,000 to 200,000 fatalities is double, triple or multitudes more than the number of deaths the U.S. would typically see from influenza and pneumonia in a given year. Mr. Trump is contending with the fallout in a year in which he hoped to ride economic optimism to reelection in November. “It’s a matter of life and death, frankly, it’s a matter of life and death,” the president said. “We had the greatest economy in the world. We had the best unemployment and employment numbers by far.” The sober tone is a turnabout for Mr. Trump, who one week ago pressed to open up businesses, noting the nation doesn’t shut down for other drivers of death. “We lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn’t call up the automobile companies and say, stop making cars. We don’t want any cars any more,” he told a Fox News virtual town hall on March 24. Influenza kills from 12,000 to 61,000 people in the U.S. per year, while car crashes kill roughly 35,000 to 40,000, according to federal data. Estimated COVID-19 deaths don’t come close to the annual U.S. death toll from heart disease or cancer, each of which kills roughly 600,000 to 650,000 per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Still, the daunting COVID-19 estimate exceeds annual suicides, at 47,000, or deaths from diabetes, at more than 80,000. The pandemic has hit Americans unevenly, with some unable to make mortgage and rent payments and tapping food banks while others are revving up Netflix and waiting to see whether they take a hit. The president said everyone needs to do their part, as health care workers brave the worst. “It’s like military people going into battle, going into war,” Mr. Trump said. “The bravery is incredible. You have lots of things flying around in the air. You don’t know what you’re touching, is it safe. Things are happening that we’ve never seen before in this country.” The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It killed thousands in East Asia before the epicenter shifted to Europe and the Americas. The U.S. has recorded the most infections in the world, with more than 185,000 — and its death toll of over 3,800 exceeds that of China’s, although many doubt the official numbers from Beijing. Recoveries in the U.S. total more than 6,900, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Everyday life has been turned on its head. Parents are juggling telework with home-school duties, churches are streaming their services on YouTube, and restaurants and department stores are furloughing workers en masse, as governors tell retailers to close their doors unless they offer necessities such as food, gasoline or medicine. Dr. Deborah Birx, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, told Americans to stay the course, noting that Washington state appeared to flatten the increase in cases by keeping people far apart. Washington saw the worst of the pandemic early on, though the U.S. epicenter is in New York. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said his state now has more than 75,000 coronavirus cases and 1,550 coronavirus-related deaths — easily the most of any state in the country. Mr. Cuomo acknowledged that everyone wants the crisis to be over, but that nobody knows when that will be. “It is not going to be soon,” he said. New York City has been hit the hardest, with more than 40,000 cases. The governor said public and private hospitals in New York need to start coordinating more closely amid reports of facilities that are nearing or at capacity and that are suffering from stressed, overworked employees. He said private hospitals in the state have to help the public ones. “When they get up near capacity — transfer patients. Elmhurst got up to capacity, you had other public hospitals that had open beds,” he said at his daily briefing on the outbreak. Elmhurst Hospital in Queens has become symbolic of the strained system. Mr. Trump recently described seeing haunting images of body bags being hauled out of the facility, which is near his native home. The crisis is hitting close to home for the New York governor. His brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo, said Tuesday he tested positive for the virus but said he will do his show from the basement of his family home. New Jersey has the second-worst death toll, at nearly 270, while Michigan has emerged as a worry spot, with nearly 6,500 cases and almost 200 deaths. Elsewhere, Louisiana reported 1,200 new cases in a single day — raising its total to more than 5,000 — while the D.C. mayor and governors in Maryland and Virginia issued stay-at-home orders this week, citing fears their hospitals will be overwhelmed. ⦁ Dave Boyer and James Varney contributed to this report.

"PHILADELPHIA (AP) - An asylum seeker from Ghana who said he was attacked by a mob led by his father because of his sexuality has shown a valid fear of persecution, a U.S. appeals case said in a case argued by two law students.  The petitioner, a gay man in his late 20s from Accra, said he had a secret relationship with a friend from his Muslim school days when his father found out in 2016 and flew into a rage. He said he was beaten, doused with kerosene and threatened with being beheaded before escaping, naked and bleeding. He later made his way to the U.S., where immigration judges rejected his case, in part because it involved only a single attack. The initial judge suggested he could avoid further prosecution back home if he kept his sexuality a secret, according to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruling. Same-sex male relationships are misdemeanors in Ghana and can bring up to three years in prison, the ruling said. The Associated Press is not naming the petitioner at the request of his lawyer, Adrian Roe of Pittsburgh, who fears for his client’s safety if he is deported and hopes to have his name redacted from court records. “(He) was threatened with death by fire or decapitation while being assaulted, doused with fuel and exposed to a cutlass. All that was left for the mob to do was to cut off his head or set him on fire,” U.S. Circuit Judge L. Felipe Restrepo wrote in directing the immigration court to reconsider the claim.  The case was argued last year by then-students Paige Beddow and Scott A. Cain of the Immigration Law Clinic at West Virginia University College of Law. Justice Department lawyers in Washington, who opposed the asylum bid, did not immediately return a message left Tuesday with the press office. “The government was arguing that one (attack) does not create a significant incident, or does not constitute past persecution. And the court said that one incident can be enough,” Roe said.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The bipartisan partnership that propelled a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package through Congress just days ago is already showing signs of strain, raising questions about how quickly calls for massive followup legislation may bear fruit. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and fellow Democrats are collecting ideas for the next stab at stabilizing an economy knocked into free fall by the coronavirus  outbreak. Their proposals include money for extended unemployment benefits, state and local governments, hospitals and a job-creating infrastructure program, plus expanded job protections and benefits for workers. “It’s a wonderful opportunity,” Pelosi told reporters this week, “because I think our country is united in wanting to not only address the immediate needs of the emergency and mitigation for the assault on our lives and livelihood, but also how we recover in a very positive way.” Congress‘ top Republicans say not so fast. They want lawmakers to gauge how well the huge, newly minted bailout programs are working and how the economy is behaving. And they’re accusing Pelosi of planning to use the next bill to win Democratic priorities like environmental requirements and moving the country toward ballot by mail elections.  “Let’s see how things are going and respond accordingly,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday on Hugh Hewitt’s talk radio show. He said that could take weeks and added, “I would think any kind of bill coming out of the House I would look at like Reagan suggested we look at the Russians - trust, but verify.” “I’m not sure we need a fourth package,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.”  Throwing another wild card into the mix, President Donald Trump on Tuesday blindsided congressional Republicans and embraced using the next round for a massive infrastructure package. Many in both parties have supported such a program before, but some Republicans have opposed it as too costly and there have long been crippling disagreements over how to pay for it. “It should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4,” Trump tweeted. Trump later told reporters that the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark interest rate earlier in March made it an ideal time to pursue an infrastructure deal. “Our interest payments would be almost zero, and we can borrow long term,” Trump said. “People want to be in the United States, they want to be invested in the United States.” There seems little doubt that if the economy remains near its current morbid state, the major question facing lawmakers will be what the next bill should look like, not whether to have one. Growing numbers of business close by the day, consumer spending is plummeting and millions are losing jobs as much of the country shelters at home, a devil’s brew that could be lethal for politicians to ignore before November’s presidential and congressional elections. “I think there’s a deal to be had this time” on infrastructure, said Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Still, he said reaching agreement on another expensive package could be harder after last week’s enormous $2.2 trillion bill. “We’ve already broken apart our grandkids’ piggy bank. We’re now getting into the great-grandkids’ piggy banks, so let’s be thoughtful on this,” he said.  Stephen Moore, a former Trump senior adviser now with the conservative pro-business Committee to Unleash Prosperity, said he envisioned major problems for Congress in reaching an agreement. He said while the economy will likely need another large cash infusion to recover, Democrats pushing more spending will clash with Republicans eager to use tax cuts instead, such as suspending employers’ payroll tax like Trump has proposed. “This will be World War 4,” he said. Clearly the size, contents and timing of the next bill are in play. And the Trump administration, lawmakers, lobbying and ideological groups are all pushing ideas. Discussions within the White House have been limited. Trump has publicly suggested he’d support extra money for state and local governments and for some type of hazard pay for front-line medical workers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s likely Democratic presidential opponent, has said he wants additional direct payments to people beyond the one-time $1,200 amounts many adults will get. He also wants increased Social Security benefits and some student loan forgiveness.  Pelosi’s proposals include easing limits on federal deductions for state and local taxes, a curb the GOP-controlled Congress enacted in 2017 that’s hit high-income, Democratic-leaning states the hardest. Her suggestion has run into opposition from both parties.  House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, D-N.J., said he’d like to create a federal office for overseeing national supply chains disrupted by the crisis. Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., who chairs the Education and Labor Committee, said he’d like to expand safety regulations to cover airborne pathogens like the coronavirus and to cover essential workers like grocery store employees.  Others suggesting ideas include Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who said she’d like to address the strains the virus and the resulting confinement of people at home are putting on mental health. “We see domestic violence. We see substance abuse,” she told reporters. “We see levels of addiction that we wish were not present with us. And so it’s something that I don’t think we have fully factored yet.”  Kevin Kuhlman, chief lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, the nation’s largest small business trade group, said his group is monitoring how the new bill’s $350 billion in small business loans is being administered. For the next measure, he said his group is watching whether additional money is needed and if changes are needed in how the money is distributed. Michael Strain, director of economic studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the next bill could be used to revisit the $2.2 trillion measure if some programs have problems. He said there could be a need for spending another $500 billion or more, or for significantly less support.  “There are all kinds of questions about what the world will look like in June,” Strain said.  ___ Associated Press writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report.

"The IRS and the Treasury Department say Americans will start receiving their economic impact checks in the next three weeks. The payments are part of the $2.2 trillion rescue package signed into law last week by President Donald Trump aimed at combating the economic ravages of the coronavirus outbreak. Most people don’t need to do anything to get the money. But some - including senior citizens and low-income people who might not traditionally file tax returns - do need to take action. People behind on filing their taxes might also want to get caught up. The IRS and Treasury have provided more details on how to ensure you get paid. Here are the basics: ___ WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PAYMENTS? Anyone earning up to $75,000 in adjusted gross income and who has a Social Security number will receive a $1,200 payment. That means married couples filing joint returns will receive the full payment - $2,400 - if their adjusted gross income, which what you report on your taxes, is under $150,000. The payment steadily declines for those who make more. Those earning more than $99,000, or $198,000 for joint filers, are not eligible. The thresholds are slightly different for those who file as a head of household. Parents will also receive $500 for each qualifying child. ___ WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET THE CHECK? For most people, nothing. The money will be directly deposited in your bank account if the government has that information from your tax return. If you haven’t filed your 2019 taxes, the government will use information from your 2018 taxes to calculate your payment and determine where to send it. It can use your Social Security benefit statement as well. ___ I DON’T USUALLY HAVE TO FILE TAXES. DO I STILL GET A PAYMENT? Yes. People who are not required to file a tax return - such as low-income tax payers, some senior citizens, Social Security recipients, some veterans and people with disabilities - will need to file a very simplified tax return to receive the economic impact payment. It provides the government basic details including a person’s filing status, number of dependents and direct-deposit bank information. ___ I HAVEN’T FILED MY 2018 OR 2019 TAXES. WILL I STILL GET A PAYMENT? Yes, but the IRS urges anyone required to file a tax return and has not yet done so for those years to file as soon as possible in order to receive an economic impact payment. Taxpayers should include their direct-deposit banking information on the return if they want it deposited in their account. ___ I DIDN’T USE DIRECT DEPOSIT ON MY TAXES, WHAT CAN I DO? The government will default to sending you the check by mail if you did not use direct deposit. However, IRS and Treasury say that they will develop an online portal in the coming weeks for individuals to provide their banking information so that they can receive the payments immediately instead of in the mail. It has not yet set a deadline for updating that information. ___ WHERE DO I DO THIS? The IRS and Treasury say the website irs.gov/coronavirus will soon provide information about the check, including how people can file a simple 2019 tax return. ___ I NEED MORE TIME TO FILE MY TAX RETURNS. HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO GET THE PAYMENT? The IRS says people concerned about visiting a tax professional or local community organization in person to get help with a tax return should not worry. The economic impact payments will be available throughout the rest of 2020.

"The Trump campaign released internal polling Tuesday showing that 84% of Americans are watching his daily televised coronavirus briefings, and 63% support the way he is handling the crisis. The internal voter survey also found that 89% support the president’s extension of social distancing guidelines through April, announced Sunday. Overall, 50% of those surveyed said they support Mr. Trump’s performance as president; 32% disapprove of the way he is handling the specific crisis. “Americans want their president out front and leading the nation in a crisis and that’s exactly what President Trump is doing,” said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. “He has taken early, decisive actions, is guided by medical professionals, and has mobilized all of America against the virus. Voters are responding strongly to the president’s leadership.” The survey also found that 51% credit Mr. Trump and Republicans for coronavirus relief legislation, while 31% credit Democrats. The president on Friday signed a $2.2 trillion rescue package to help workers and businesses harmed by the outbreak shutting down major parts of the economy.

"MIAMI — Passengers from an ill-fated South American cruise are eager to disembark once they reach Florida, but Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state’s health care resources are already stretched too thin to take on another ship’s coronavirus caseload. The U.S. Coast Guard said Tuesday that the decision would be punted to Washington if authorities can’t agree. With the Zaandam and Rotterdam ships arriving as early as Wednesday and at least two people on board needing emergency attention, a “unified command” of state, local and federal officials will be asked to approve a detailed docking plan requiring the cruise line, Holland America, to handle all medical issues without impacting South Florida’s already-stressed hospitals. “There are no great choices left. These are all tough outcomes,” Coast Guard Captain Jo-Ann Burdian told Broward County commissioners at an emergency meeting Tuesday. Two of the four deaths on board the Zaandam have been blamed on COVID-19 and the cruise company says nine people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Holland America said the Rotterdam took on nearly 1,400 people who appear to be healthy from its sister ship, leaving 450 guests and 602 crew members on the Zaandam, including more than 190 who said they are sick. More than 300 U.S. citizens are on both ships combined. The governor said he had been in contact with the White House about diverting them. “We cannot afford to have people who are not even Floridians dumped into South Florida using up those valuable resources,” DeSantis told Fox News on Monday. Holland America President Orlando Ashford penned an opinion column in the South Florida Sun Sentinel to plead with officials and residents to let the passengers disembark. Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony called the situation a “humanitarian crisis” and asked commissioners at the Tuesday meeting not to decide based on emotion. Allowing the ship to dock would burden the local health care system and put residents at risk of additional exposure, he warned. “This ship has been turned away from several countries already,” Tony said. “We are in some very, very critical circumstances where we as a county are going to have to determine are we willing to take on this responsibility.” William Burke, chief maritime officer for Carnival, which owns Holland America, told commissioners “we are coming to the place of last resort,” and that his staff had worked through the night on a docking plan. Four people on board have already died. Burke said he hopes two others who are severely ill “will survive the transit.” Despite the pleas for help, commissioners appeared frustrated with the company when they learned that another Carnival-owned ship with people presenting flu-like symptoms was sailing toward Fort Lauderdale and scheduled to arrive in April. One of the commissioners then interrupted the meeting to ask Burke whether a sick patient had been taken from a Princess ship earlier Tuesday and suggested it had not notified local officials. A Broward County Sheriff’s fire rescue official said the agency had responded to a 911 call to take a patient with a very high fever and pneumonia to a hospital. Chief Harris Henbest said deputies were told several crew members were also sick and had been ordered into isolation, but it wasn’t clear whether they were infected with the COVID-19 virus. “I have a lot of concern when a company would bring sick people into the port and not alert the county,” said commissioner Mark Bogen. Most of the commissioners were sympathetic and felt badly that the passengers have been rejected by other ports. Broward County Commissioner Nan Rich urged officials to quickly hammer out a plan, “do the best we can and get these people to their homes.” “These people have been turned away from so many countries, one after the other. We are their last hope. What are we going to do? Let this ship go back out to sea and float around and let people die? I don’t think so,” Rich said. The Zaandam and other ships became pariahs as countries sealed borders in response to the pandemic. Zaandam passengers said they were asked to keep their rooms dark and leave their drapes closed as they passed through the Panama Canal. While many have reported feeling ill, most of the passengers and crew on both ships appear to be in good health. Laura Gabaroni and her husband Juan Huergo, who work for a defense contractor in Orlando, saw their dream vacation turn harrowing as countries shunned them and people fell ill. Fever-free and without symptoms, she and her husband were transferred to the Rotterdam. She wrote DeSantis imploring her governor to let them off. “Florida continues to receive flights from New York, and it allowed spring break gatherings to go on as planned. Why turn their backs on us?” Gabaroni said. The Zaandam originally departed from Buenos Aires on March 7 - a day before the U.S. State Department advised to avoid cruise travel and before any substantial restrictions were in place in Florida. The ship had been scheduled to stop in San Antonio, Chile, and then depart on another 20-day cruise to Fort Lauderdale in early April. But beginning March 15, the Zaandam was denied entry by port after port. Passenger Emily Spindler Brazell, of Tappahannock, Virginia, said they’ve been treated to unlimited phone calls, wine and nice meals including lamb chops and salmon. But they have had to isolate in their rooms with a warning. “The captain said something like, ‘This is not a trip anymore. This is not a cruise. This is a humanitarian mission,’” she said.

"BATON ROUGE, La. — A Louisiana pastor charged with six misdemeanors for holding church services in violation of a ban put in place to control the coronavirus said Tuesday that he would continue to ignore the ban because God told him to. Pastor Tony Spell was issued a summons Tuesday for holding services at the Life Tabernacle church in the city of Central in violation of an order from Gov. John Bel Edwards prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people, said East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Hillar Moore. Each violation carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $500 fine, Moore said. “The whole situation just puts everyone at risk,” Moore said. “We ask everyone to abide by the governor’s order.” Spell, reached by telephone Tuesday, confirmed he was read his rights and fingerprinted - but the summons wasn’t deterring him. Another service was scheduled Tuesday night that he said was expected to draw hundreds. “We’re still here and still assembling and having church,” Spell said. Asked why he was defying the governor’s orders, he said, “Because the Lord told us to.” Asked whether he was concerned about the pandemic, Spell said: “I’m no more concerned than I would be going to Walmart or Home Depot.” Moore said additional charges could be issued if Spell continued to disobey Edwards‘ ban on gatherings. He said the pastor wasn’t booked into jail because parish officials are trying to lessen the jail population amid the risks of the highly contagious virus. Central Assistant Police Chief Darren Sibley said officers would not try to stop Tuesday night’s prayer service but would “document everything and forward everything to the district attorney.” “He is doing this for publicity,” Sibley said of Spell. “He is putting the citizens of the community at risk. And he is putting the people in his congregation at risk.” Edwards has issued a “stay at home” order that he said he will extend through the end of April to combat the spread of the COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus, which is threatening to overwhelm hospitals with patients. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia and be fatal. More than 5,200 people in Louisiana have confirmed virus infections, and 239 state residents have died, according to the Louisiana health department. Edwards has urged church leaders to continue their services online or in smaller groups to lessen the risks. “Even if your leader is not being a leader, please abide by the governor’s clear warning,” Moore urged congregants. “This is not about religion and the rights of church and assembly. All the other churches in Louisiana have shown that there are other ways to handle this.” ___ Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.

"President Trump and his allies are increasingly blaming the Democrats’ failed impeachment drive for distracting Washington’s attention from the coronavirus outbreak this winter. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that impeachment was a needless preoccupation while the pandemic was unfolding. “It came up while we were tied down on the impeachment trial,” the Kentucky Republican told radio host Hugh Hewitt. “And I think it diverted the attention of the government because everything every day was all about impeachment.” He said the Senate nevertheless “pivoted from the most partisan thing you could possibly be involved in, the impeachment of a president, to a unanimous vote on a $2 trillion package all within a couple of months.” Asked Tuesday whether impeachment diverted his attention or his team’s attention from the coronavirus, the president agreed that it had. “I don’t like to think I did. I think I handled it very well, but I guess it probably did,” Mr. Trump said at the daily press conference of his coronavirus task force. “I mean, I got impeached. I certainly devoted a little time to thinking about it. I don’t think I would have acted any differently [on the virus], or I don’t think I would have acted any faster.” Mr. McConnell credited Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, with sounding the alarm to the administration and Congress. COVID-19 entered the U.S. on Jan. 15 when an infected person traveled to Seattle from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated. It was the same day Mr. Trump was signing a trade deal with Chinese officials at the White House. Six days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alerted the public to the first confirmed case of COVID-19 and said it had deployed a team to Washington state to help investigate. The agency said investigators could trace close contacts to determine whether anyone else had become ill. “This is a rapidly evolving situation. CDC will continue to update the public as circumstances warrant,” the agency said. On Jan. 29, the president formed the White House Coronavirus Task Force and appointed Vice President Mike Pence to lead it. The president banned most travel from China on Jan. 31 as the administration declared a public health emergency. The U.S. death toll climbed Tuesday to more than 3,800, with more than 186,000 confirmed cases of infection, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Hospitals and some governors have complained about a lack of medical supplies, and Mr. Trump has been criticized for leading a slow response. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, on Sunday accused Mr. Trump of fiddling while people were dying. Ron Klain, who served as the Obama administration’s Ebola response coordinator and now is advising the presidential campaign of Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden, tweeted that Mr. Trump “found time to do a trade deal with China during impeachment and to praise [Chinese President] Xi for his handling of coronavirus — but not enough time to get us ready.” Former President Barack Obama weighed in Tuesday by criticizing the Trump administration for its response to the pandemic and for easing fuel economy standards. “We’ve seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic,” Mr. Obama tweeted. “We can’t afford any more consequences of climate denial. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall.” Mr. Trump has forcefully defended his administration’s response and said Mrs. Pelosi’s obsession with his impeachment distracted her from the coronavirus outbreak. “Don’t forget, she was playing the impeachment game, her game where she ended up looking like a fool,” Mr. Trump said Monday on “Fox & Friends.” “All she did was focus on impeachment. She didn’t focus on anything having to do with pandemics. She focused on impeachment, and she lost. And she looked like a fool.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, also blamed Mrs. Pelosi for focusing attention on Mr. Trump’s impeachment in December and January while the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in China. He reminded the Senate that Mrs. Pelosi delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the upper chamber for four weeks. “As we were dealing with this impeachment garbage, China was on fire,” Mr. Graham said last week on the Senate floor. “You’ll hear more about that later in the year.” Mr. Trump initially downplayed the outbreak. On Jan. 22, the day his impeachment trial opened in the Senate, he said “we have it totally under control.” “It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control,” he said. “It’s going to be just fine.” Even as late as Feb. 26, Mr. Trump was saying the U.S. had only 15 cases and the number would soon be “down to close to zero.” Administration officials held a briefing on the coronavirus for the Senate on Jan. 24 at the request of Sen. Lamar Alexander, Tennessee Republican. Politico reported that the classified session was sparsely attended. Mr. Alexander and three colleagues said later that they were “monitoring the outbreak of a novel coronavirus closely and are in close communication with United States government agencies on actions and precautions needed to prevent further spread of this virus.” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, called on the Department of Health and Human Services on Jan. 26 to declare a public health emergency. Secretary Alex Azar declared an emergency five days later. On Feb. 5, lawmakers attended another administration briefing on the virus. Sen. Christopher Murphy, Connecticut Democrat and a frequent Trump critic, said afterward that the administration wasn’t “taking this seriously enough.” “Notably, no request for ANY emergency funding, which is a big mistake,” he tweeted at the time. “Local health systems need supplies, training, screening staff etc. And they need it now.” It was the same day that the Senate acquitted Mr. Trump of both charges in his impeachment trial. Mrs. Pelosi held a weekly news conference Feb. 6 but never mentioned the coronavirus. The House adjourned Feb. 13 and didn’t return to Capitol Hill until Feb. 25. On that day, Mr. Trump asked Congress for $2.5 billion to fight the spread of the coronavirus. Congress approved $8.3 billion. That legislation was followed by a roughly $100 billion measure to pay for free testing and medical leave from work. That was followed last week by the $2.2 trillion disaster relief bill — the biggest in U.S. history — for workers and businesses. A close friend of Mr. Trump, Newsmax Media CEO Christopher Ruddy, said Tuesday that the attacks on the president over his handling of the COVID-19 outbreak “are akin to a ‘blood libel’ and demonstrate a degree of political depravity unseen in our politics.” Writing for his outlet, Mr. Ruddy said neither Mrs. Pelosi nor Trump media detractors such as NBC’s Chuck Todd “were sounding any virus alarm” in January or February. He also noted that Mr. Biden first criticized Mr. Trump for closing most travel from China and said the president had a history of “hysteria and xenophobia.” Many liberal lawmakers and media outlets took a similar tack at the time about the travel bans. Mr. Biden said Tuesday that Mr. Trump isn’t responsible for the COVID-19 coronavirus but is responsible for using all of the powers at his disposal to deal with it. “He’s been very slow to act, for whatever the reason has been,” Mr. Biden said on CNN. “He still hasn’t fully invoked the Defense Production Act. “What about the masks?” Mr. Biden said. “What about the gowns those doctors and nurses need?” ⦁ Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this report.

"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Two South Carolina sheriffs who faced recent troubles have filed for reelection in their respective counties. Suspended Chester County Sheriff Alex Underwood filed Monday for a third term, The Herald of Rock Hill reported.  Underwood was indicted last year on federal charges, including civil rights violations. Prosecutors said he filed a false police report and lied to authorities to justify jailing a man who refused to stop videotaping following a police chase, prosecutors said. He also faces state charges that he took money meant to pay overtime for his deputies and had officers convert his barn into a flashy man cave while they were on the clock, according to prosecutors. Underwood has pleaded not guilty in both cases. He was allowed to file because only candidates who have been convicted of a felony cannot run for office, South Carolina Election Commission spokesman Chris Whitmire told The Herald. Meanwhile, after saying in February that he would not seek a fourth term, Union County Sheriff David Taylor announced this week in a statement received by news outlets that he’s running for reelection. Taylor had requested a South Carolina Law Enforcement Division investigation into accounting irregularities discovered within the sheriff’s office in February 2018. The investigation found that there were “several flaws” in how Taylor managed the department, but criminal charges were not recommended. He had been accused of making sexually inappropriate comments and requesting that employees buy him alcohol while on duty. Taylor said some community members and his deputies asked him to reconsider another run for sheriff, according to news outlets. He also said that amid the COVID-19 pandemic, “it is NOT the time for Union County to elect a Sheriff to get on the job training,” according to his statement.

"President Trump, speaking in unusually somber tones, told Americans on Tuesday to brace for a “very, very painful two weeks” and begged them to stay at home as much as possible through April 30, saying 100,000 to 200,000 people could die from COVID-19 despite his team’s best efforts to fight the coronavirus and that they want to depress that number. Mr. Trump wanted to get the nation “raring to go” by Easter, but sobering models forced him to reverse course and plead with people to work and learn at home, avoid nonessential travel and stay out of restaurants for additional weeks. “I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. The president called for sacrifices as his coronavirus task force said the virus could kill far more Americans than car crashes or influenza do each year. “As sobering a number as it is, we should be prepared for it,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Administration officials said the models are guided by epidemiology but aren’t gospel. Actual outcomes will be guided by human behavior. Social distancing, a term that has become part of the lexicon, “is going to be the answer to our problems,” Dr. Fauci said. Mr. Trump said social distancing is working, noting up to 2 million people might have died had the nation “done nothing.” “A hundred thousand is, according to modeling, a very low number,” Mr. Trump said. “I think we’re doing better than that.” Still, the estimates are sobering — the notion of 100,000 to 200,000 fatalities is double, triple or multitudes more than the number of deaths the U.S. would typically see from influenza and pneumonia in a given year. Mr. Trump is contending with the fallout in a year in which he hoped to ride economic optimism to reelection in November. “It’s a matter of life and death, frankly, it’s a matter of life and death,” the president said. “We had the greatest economy in the world. We had the best unemployment and employment numbers by far.” The sober tone is a turnabout for Mr. Trump, who one week ago pressed to open up businesses, noting the nation doesn’t shut down for other drivers of death. “We lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn’t call up the automobile companies and say, stop making cars. We don’t want any cars any more,” he told a Fox News virtual town hall on March 24. Influenza kills from 12,000 to 61,000 people in the U.S. per year, while car crashes kill roughly 35,000 to 40,000, according to federal data. Estimated COVID-19 deaths don’t come close to the annual U.S. death toll from heart disease or cancer, each of which kills roughly 600,000 to 650,000 per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Still, the daunting COVID-19 estimate exceeds annual suicides, at 47,000, or deaths from diabetes, at more than 80,000. The pandemic has hit Americans unevenly, with some unable to make mortgage and rent payments and tapping food banks while others are revving up Netflix and waiting to see whether they take a hit. The president said everyone needs to do their part, as health care workers brave the worst. “It’s like military people going into battle, going into war,” Mr. Trump said. “The bravery is incredible. You have lots of things flying around in the air. You don’t know what you’re touching, is it safe. Things are happening that we’ve never seen before in this country.” The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. It killed thousands in East Asia before the epicenter shifted to Europe and the Americas. The U.S. has recorded the most infections in the world, with more than 185,000 — and its death toll of over 3,800 exceeds that of China’s, although many doubt the official numbers from Beijing. Recoveries in the U.S. total more than 6,900, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Everyday life has been turned on its head. Parents are juggling telework with home-school duties, churches are streaming their services on YouTube, and restaurants and department stores are furloughing workers en masse, as governors tell retailers to close their doors unless they offer necessities such as food, gasoline or medicine. Dr. Deborah Birx, the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, told Americans to stay the course, noting that Washington state appeared to flatten the increase in cases by keeping people far apart. Washington saw the worst of the pandemic early on, though the U.S. epicenter is in New York. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said his state now has more than 75,000 coronavirus cases and 1,550 coronavirus-related deaths — easily the most of any state in the country. Mr. Cuomo acknowledged that everyone wants the crisis to be over, but that nobody knows when that will be. “It is not going to be soon,” he said. The governor said public and private hospitals in New York need to start coordinating more closely amid reports of facilities that are nearing or at capacity and that are suffering from stressed, overworked employees. He said private hospitals in the state have to help the public ones. “When they get up near capacity — transfer patients. Elmhurst got up to capacity, you had other public hospitals that had open beds,” Mr. Cuomo said at his daily briefing on the outbreak. Elmhurst Hospital in Queens has become symbolic of the strained system. Mr. Trump recently described seeing haunting images of body bags being hauled out of the facility, which is near his native home. The crisis is hitting close to home for the New York governor. His brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo, said Tuesday he tested positive for the virus but said he will do his show from the basement of his family home. New Jersey has the second-worst death toll, at nearly 270, while Michigan has emerged as a worry spot, with nearly 6,500 cases and almost 200 deaths. Elsewhere, Louisiana reported 1,200 new cases in a single day — raising its total to more than 5,000 — while the D.C. mayor and governors in Maryland and Virginia issued stay-at-home orders this week, citing fears their hospitals will be overwhelmed. • Dave Boyer and James Varney contributed to this report.

"The IRS and the Treasury Department say Americans will start receiving their economic impact checks in the next three weeks. The payments are part of the $2.2 trillion rescue package signed into law last week by President Donald Trump aimed at combating the economic ravages of the coronavirus outbreak. Most people don’t need to do anything to get the money. But some - including senior citizens and low-income people who might not traditionally file tax returns - do need to take action. People behind on filing their taxes might also want to get caught up. The IRS and Treasury have provided more details on how to ensure you get paid. Here are the basics: ___ WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PAYMENTS? Anyone earning up to $75,000 in adjusted gross income and who has a Social Security number will receive a $1,200 payment. That means married couples filing joint returns will receive the full payment — $2,400 — if their adjusted gross income, which what you report on your taxes, is under $150,000. The payment steadily declines for those who make more. Those earning more than $99,000, or $198,000 for joint filers, are not eligible. The thresholds are slightly different for those who file as a head of household. Parents will also receive $500 for each qualifying child. ___ WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET THE CHECK? For most people, nothing. The money will be directly deposited in your bank account if the government has that information from your tax return. If you haven’t filed your 2019 taxes, the government will use information from your 2018 taxes to calculate your payment and determine where to send it. It can use your Social Security benefit statement as well. ___ I DON’T USUALLY HAVE TO FILE TAXES. DO I STILL GET A PAYMENT? Yes. People who are not required to file a tax return — such as low-income tax payers, some senior citizens, Social Security recipients, some veterans and people with disabilities — will need to file a very simplified tax return to receive the economic impact payment. It provides the government basic details including a person’s filing status, number of dependents and direct-deposit bank information. ___ I HAVEN’T FILED MY 2018 OR 2019 TAXES. WILL I STILL GET A PAYMENT? Yes, but the IRS urges anyone required to file a tax return and has not yet done so for those years to file as soon as possible in order to receive an economic impact payment. Taxpayers should include their direct-deposit banking information on the return if they want it deposited in their account. ___ I DIDN’T USE DIRECT DEPOSIT ON MY TAXES, WHAT CAN I DO? The government will default to sending you the check by mail if you did not use direct deposit. However, IRS and Treasury say that they will develop an online portal in the coming weeks for individuals to provide their banking information so that they can receive the payments immediately instead of in the mail. It has not yet set a deadline for updating that information. ___ WHERE DO I DO THIS? The IRS and Treasury say the website irs.gov/coronavirus will soon provide information about the check, including how people can file a simple 2019 tax return. ___ I NEED MORE TIME TO FILE MY TAX RETURNS. HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO GET THE PAYMENT? The IRS says people concerned about visiting a tax professional or local community organization in person to get help with a tax return should not worry. The economic impact payments will be available throughout the rest of 2020.

"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden on Tuesday raised the prospect that the Democratic National Convention scheduled for mid-July would have to be postponed or modified because of the expanding coronavirus epidemic. Appearing on MSNBC, Mr. Biden was asked if he could really envision “every prominent Democrat in this country from all 50 states inside a hot arena 104 days from now.” “It’s hard to envision that,” said Mr. Biden, who appears destined to be the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. “Again, we should listen to the scientists,” he said. Mr. Biden pointed out that one of the reasons the Democrats’ convention was scheduled for July was so it wouldn’t conflict with the 2020 Olympic Games. The Olympics have now been postponed until 2021. “There is more time now,” he said. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place July 13-16 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mr. Biden said there should be party conventions, primaries and elections at the same time that public safety is maintained. “It may mean that you have a circumstance where you have drive-in voting. Literally, you pull up and you vote,” he said. “There’s a lot of ways to do it, but we should be talking about it now.” Though many states have moved to postpone their presidential primaries, Wisconsin’s April 7 primary is on for now, leaving officials in the state scrambling to make accommodations. President Trump said last week there was “no way” he was going to cancel the Republican National Convention, which is scheduled for Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte, North Carolina.

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s campaign team on Wednesday released a new ad touting his leading role in shepherding the $2.2 trillion economic rescue package that’s designed to boost families and businesses suffering from the coronavirus outbreak. “Mitch McConnell led the passage of the biggest economic rescue package in history,” a narrator says in the 30-second spot. The ad says the package provides “urgent help” for people who need it most like families and small businesses, while touting an extension in unemployment benefits and more help for hospitals and “our health care heroes.” “One leader brought our divided country together in a unanimous, bipartisan vote - Mitch McConnell,” the ad says. Democrats insisted they won concessions by delaying proceedings in the Senate, though Republicans said the final package mirrored an initial offer laid out by Mr. McConnell and Senate Republicans. “Senator McConnell was Kentucky’s voice at the table when Democratic leaders tried to use this much-needed economic relief to push through their radical, left-wing agenda, and he stopped them in their tracks,” said McConnell campaign manager Kevin Golden. The Democratic-controlled House passed the package via voice vote, though Rep. Thomas Massie, Kentucky Republican, had tried to force a roll call vote. Amy McGrath, a retired fighter pilot, is the leading Democratic contender seeking to unseat Mr. McConnell this year.

"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden on Tuesday raised the prospect that the Democratic National Convention scheduled for mid-July would have to be postponed or modified because of the expanding coronavirus epidemic. Appearing on MSNBC, Mr. Biden was asked if he could really envision “every prominent Democrat in this country from all 50 states inside a hot arena 104 days from now.” “It’s hard to envision that,” said Mr. Biden, who appears destined to be the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. “Again, we should listen to the scientists,” he said. Mr. Biden pointed out that one of the reasons the Democrats’ convention was scheduled for July was so it wouldn’t conflict with the 2020 Olympic Games. The Olympics have now been postponed until 2021. “There is more time now,” he said. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place July 13-16 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mr. Biden said there should be party conventions, primaries and elections at the same time that public safety is maintained. “It may mean that you have a circumstance where you have drive-in voting. Literally, you pull up and you vote,” he said. “There’s a lot of ways to do it, but we should be talking about it now.” Though many states have moved to postpone their presidential primaries, Wisconsin’s April 7 primary is on for now, leaving officials in the state scrambling to make accommodations. President Trump said last week there was “no way” he was going to cancel the Republican National Convention, which is scheduled for Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte, North Carolina.

"Sen. John Kennedy, Louisiana Republican, on Wednesday said he’s not interested in seeing any more “spending porn” from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or anyone else on Capitol Hill. “I’m not interested in any more of Speaker’s Pelosi’s spending porn — or any other member of Congress for that matter,” Mr. Kennedy said on “Fox & Friends.” He said the $2.2 trillion rescue package Congress passed in response to the coronavirus outbreak should be allowed to work, saying that with additional leverage the price tag is even higher. “Unless you were throwing the Frisbee in the quad during Econ 101, deficits matter,” he said. House Democrats had offered their own $2.5 trillion ante during the debate that included provisions tied to collective bargaining power and carbon emissions. Louisiana has emerged as a major hot spot in the escalating coronavirus outbreak. Officials on Tuesday reported a 30% increase in new infections over 24 hours. Mr. Kennedy said he doesn’t want to lob criticisms during the crisis, saying government officials at all levels are doing the best they can. “Ideally, it would be the preferred route to have one purchaser of the ventilators — the federal government. But I understand when governors [want] to be proactive, want to go out on their own,” he said. Various governors have reported bidding wars, including against the federal government, in the hunt for much-needed ventilators, which are crucial for treating COVID-19 patients. “We’re using about 30% of our ventilators right now — it’s not like we’re out,” Mr. Kennedy said. “But we worry, like everyone else does, about running out.” “I think we’ll beat this thing if everybody will respect what the scientists tell us,” he said.

"Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas on Wednesday raised the prospect that the coronavirus pandemic might have originated from a lab in China with the virus being let loose accidentally. Mr. Cruz had shared an article in The Washington Times on social media about research on viruses being conducted just miles from an open “wet market” in Wuhan believed to be the origin point of the COVID-19 outbreak. “We know that at that facility, they were researching highly, highly infectious diseases including coronaviruses - including coronaviruses that [derive] from bats,” Mr. Cruz said on Fox Business Network. “And so they’re researching the exact same type of disease that became this pandemic.” “There is a very natural question to ask of well, did somebody make a mistake? Were they studying this virus and did it escape accidentally, and is that part of why the communist government in China tried so hard to cover this up?” Mr. Cruz said. He said what seems “plausible, if not likely” is that the virus was being studied at the lab. “The natural inference, if there’s [an] outbreak right next to where they’re studying this virus is well somehow it escaped, presumably accidentally,” he said. “We don’t know that, but China doesn’t want that question answered for the world to know.” Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, among others, has floated a similar theory. China, meanwhile, has raised the theory that the U.S. military might have been the one to bring the virus overseas. “What a ridiculous, propagandist lie,” Mr. Cruz said. China now has more than 82,300 positive coronavirus cases - the fourth-most in the world behind the United States, Italy, and Spain - and more than 3,300 coronavirus-related deaths, according to a tracker from Johns Hopkins University, though many doubt the figures being reported publicly by the Chinese government.

"House Democrats want a green infrastructure plan at the forefront of the phase four coronavirus package they are working on while Congress is out of session, despite the backlash they received over their phase three proposals. Rep. Peter DeFazio, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, acknowledged Republicans will likely push back on a greener approach to infrastructure. “There are going to be objections to this,” he said. “Mitch McConnell made fun of my provisions — that the airlines agreed to — to reduce their carbon pollution dramatically and quickly.” “But in rebuilding our infrastructure, we have a unique opportunity. No one disagrees it needs to be rebuilt. Rebuild it in a way that looks to the future, the 21st century, and also deals with climate change and carbon pollution at the same time. It’s a no-brainer from my perspective,” he added. Democrats want to use more climate-friendly materials to reduce carbon emissions, like a new kind of asphalt, and include incentives to help states transition toward being more energy-efficient. The plan would also include funds for basic renewal of the highway system, while also introducing ways to lean toward more electric and high-speed transit options. The infrastructure portion is based on the five-year, $760 billion plan Democrats unveiled in January. The package proposed $329 billion for roads and bridges, $55 billion for passenger rail, $30 billion for airport renovations, $50.5 billion for wastewater projects, $86 billion for expanding broadband to rural areas and urban deserts, and $12 billion for an updated 911 system. Additionally, Democrats want to invest $10 billion for community health centers, as the health care system is being overly strained during the coronavirus outbreak. During an interview on CNN, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wants this next phase to be negotiated through a “four corner” approach, meaning input from all the major party leaders on Capitol Hill and the White House. While Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are skeptical of moving ahead with a phase four package, Democrats are optimistic they’ll be swayed, at least on infrastructure, with the president’s blessing. “I could provide legislative language in very, very short order for this package. It’s the funding that’s been holding us up and if the president insists on funding, then I believe that Senator McConnell and Leader McCarthy will move on this issue, so that makes a huge, huge difference,” Mr. DeFazio said. President Trump called for Congress to move ahead with a “big and bold” $2 trillion infrastructure plan on Tuesday. “I was pleased to see the president has come back to where we started almost a year ago now, which is, he wants a big package on investment and infrastructure to recover the economy,” Mr. DeFazio said. That tentative 2019 deal rapidly fell apart after tensions between House Democrats and the White House spiked as calls for an impeachment inquiry ramped up on Capitol Hill. Unlike its predecessors, though, this potential fourth package is not being rushed through Capitol Hill. “I think we come back April 20, God willing and coronavirus willing. But shortly thereafter we should be able to move forward,” Mrs. Pelosi said. While infrastructure is at the forefront of conversations right now, Democrats have also set their sights on a number of other issues to address in the fourth package. The list includes stronger OSHA protections for essential workers, more funds for state and local officials and shoring up election security ahead of the 2020 elections. Specifically regarding elections, Mrs. Pelosi estimated lawmakers would need $2 billion to $4 billion to “democratize our whole system.” “We ought to make it as easy as we can make it to cast their vote, to participate in this democracy,” Mr. Clyburn said. “I think we would be negligent if we did not do what was necessary to allow people to participate freely.” While infrastructure and the previous three coronavirus funding packages have typically had strong bipartisan support, a wide range of items from Democrats is likely to draw some pushback from across the aisle. “Republicans stand ready to work across the aisle to support the individuals and institutions that will need more help in the fight against the virus,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a statement. “But the American people cannot afford the distraction of continued attempts to force partisan objectives into our response.” “Offsetting the carbon footprint of airplanes, remaking our energy grid, or changing election laws, as Democrats have suggested, have nothing to do with our war against the disease,” he added. In their phase three proposals, House Democrats were accused of pursuing a partisan wish list over core bipartisan solutions targeting the problem. They wanted to provide $4 billion in grants for states to continue with the scheduled 2020 election, while requiring that they expand early and absentee voting opportunities with a 15-day window — including providing self-sealing envelops and prepaid postage for mail-in ballots. The voting regulations also required states to allow same-day voter registration and no longer request the last four digits of social security numbers. Aid for the airlines set aside $1 billion to eliminate high-polluting aircraft and $100 million in research for green fuel. It also required all air carriers that receive assistance to offset their carbon emissions by 2025 — and reduce their emissions by 50% by 2050.

"The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday demanded the panel hold a hearing with Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz after his latest missive finding the FBI bungled scores of warrant applications to surveil Americans. Rep. Jim Jordan sent a letter to Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat, saying lawmakers need to hear from Mr. Horowitz as the debate rages in Washington about whether to limit the FBI’s surveillance powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). “The committee must not allow the FBI’s extraordinary power to electronically surveil Americans to be so haphazardly rubber-stamped with incorrect, unsubstantiated or erroneous supporting information,” wrote Mr. Jordan, Ohio Republican. On Tuesday, Mr. Horowitz released the preliminary results of his team’s review of 29 FISA applications the FBI had submitted to obtain surveillance warrants on U.S. citizens. Every one of the 29 applications reviewed did not include supporting materials to back up the FBI’s allegations against their surveillance targets. And in some cases, the FBI couldn’t find the backup files at all or was unsure if they ever existed. In all 25 cases in which the files were available for review, Mr.Horowitz found “apparent errors or inadequately supported facts.” Mr. Jordan said the latest findings highlight the need to question the inspector general. “Because of the pervasiveness and seriousness of the FISA application deficiencies — and the pending reauthorization of FISA — we renew our request that you invite Inspector General Michael Horowitz to testify at a public hearing promptly when the House returns to session,” he wrote. House Republicans have been calling for a hearing with Mr. Horowitz since last December when he released a scathing report about the FBI’s bungling of a surveillance warrant to spy on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. So far, Mr. Nadler has resisted calls to hear from the inspector general. Mr. Horowitz has testified before two Senate committees about the Page report. Congress is set to debate the reauthorization of several surveillance tools authorized under FISA. Last month, the House and Senate agreed to reauthorize the tools for 45 days to give lawmakers the time to hammer out a deal and focus on the coronavirus pandemic.

"The White House Correspondents Association on Wednesday night removed a news organization, the conservative One America News Network, from its seat at President Trump’s coronavirus briefings after its reporter disregarded the group’s social-distancing guidelines in the press room. The WHCA board of directors said it voted “to remove a news outlet from the rotation for a seat in the briefing room.” “We did this because a reporter for this outlet twice attended press briefings in contravention of this policy,” the board said. “We do not take this action lightly. This is a matter of public safety.” The notice didn’t identify the news outlet, but OANN reporter Chanel Rion attended Wednesday night’s briefing by standing in the back of the press room, where President Trump called on her. She didn’t have an assigned seat for that particular briefing. Mr. Trump has complimented her previously for asking questions that he likes, and he has spoken favorably about her network’s coverage of him. Since the coronavirus outbreak, at least one White House journalist has tested positive for COVID-19. The association has twice reduced seating in the press room, cutting more than half of the room’s capacity to comply with guidelines on social distancing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The group has offered news organizations the opportunity to have an assigned seat occasionally on a rotating basis to prevent crowding. But it has asked reporters to abandon the once-common practice of standing in the aisles if they don’t have a seat. “Under this policy, we have asked reporters who don’t have a seat not to attend press briefings,” the group said. “We appreciate all your cooperation as we do our part to ensure the safety of the White House press corps and White House staff during this difficult time.”  ",Trump-friendly news network has seat privileges at White House briefings revoked,"Wednesday, April 1, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/1/one-america-news-network-loses-seat-trump-coronavi/,washington_times
"Journalists have symptoms of cabin fever these days as many work from home, steeped in cable news. Yes, critical coverage of President Trump continues, along with increased scrutiny of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, now on national radar for his daily reports on the coronavirus pandemic. This factor has created some noteworthy political subplots. CNN, for example, recently chose to air Mr. Cuomo’s reports on the crisis rather than those offered by Democratic presidential hopeful Joseph R. Biden. There also has been chatter that Mr. Cuomo could surface as Mr. Biden’s vice presidential running mate or even run for president himself. Now there is talk that women have a crush on Mr. Cuomo, He is 62, single and has received enthusiastic praise from New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd and MSNBC primetime host Rachel Maddow, according to Bloomberg News, which has tracked the phenomenon. The Cuomo coverage is getting creative. “Like a velveteen gravity blanket for my soul, the second I see this man’s perfectly weathered face and tousled curls, the moment his Pacino-like accent fills my living room with its mafia-like authority, my blood pressure drops. A tingly feeling of optimism washes over my imprisoned body as I think to myself — I think we’re gonna be okay. Also: I think I’m in love with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo,” writes comedian and Sirius XM talk radio host Michelle Collins in an essay for Marie Claire, a woman’s magazine. “Help, I think I’m in love with Andrew Cuomo,” echoed Rebecca Fishbein, a writer for Jezebel who received a phone call from the governor himself after her recent confession was published. Pandemics inspire all sorts of reactions, a matter to explore in the future. Meanwhile, media reports grow more serious when the press bandies about the idea that Mr. Biden should step aside and let Mr. Cuomo become the Democratic presidential candidate, which could only happen if Mr. Biden can’t get the support of enough delegates to win the nomination. “If it wasn’t for the insane nature of politics right now, floating Cuomo for president, and replacing Joe Biden would be an April Fools’ joke. However, in the year 2020, where chaos continues to reign amid a global pandemic, Cuomo might have to get in line behind the other outlandish ideas floating around right now,” writes Nate Ashworth, editor of Election Central. “The idea of handing Andrew Cuomo the Democratic nomination is probably due to reporters being stuck at home, under quarantine, with too much time on their hands,” Mr. Ashworth says. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY The guessing game continues over Democratic presidential frontrunner Joseph R. Biden’s choice for a running mate. He originally promised that his potential vice president would be a woman, a narrative that got upset after news organization speculated Mr. Biden might choose the aforementioned Gov. Andrew Cuomo for the job. Mr. Biden, however, tells MSNBC anchor Brian Williams that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been under consideration for the last two months. She has other plans though. “The governor is flattered that Brian Williams would ask and that the vice president would mention her, but right now she is focused 100% on doing everything she can to slow the spread of the coronavirus and protect the people of Michigan,” her spokeswoman Tiffany Brown said in the aftermath of the broadcast. NOW THERE’S A THOUGHT “COVID-19 is not the only pathogen Americans need to worry about these days. Another is the pursuit of unwarranted power by unprincipled politicians,” writes Terence P. Jeffrey, editor in chief of CNSNews.com — who cites in particular New York City mayor Bill DeBlasio, The former Democratic presidential hopeful has threatened to send “enforcement agents” to shut down religious services which violate local shutdown orders and social distancing. POMPEO HAS A REMINDER On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reminded reporters that the U.S. had made $274 million available for at-risk nations battling coronavirus, and that in the last decade, the U.S. provided $170 billion in health and humanitarian assistance to nations in need worldwide. “The United States remains by far the largest contributor to the World Health Organization. Our contribution exceeded $400 million last year, 10 times that of China. The U.S. contributed nearly $1.7 billion to the U.N. Refugee Agency, helping those least able to mitigate their exposure to the virus. This compares to $1.9 million from China. In 2019, the U.S. supported UNICEF with more than $700 million. China gave just a mere fraction of that,” Mr. Pompeo noted. “It isn’t just our government helping around the world. American businesses and private charities have given $1.5 billion to the world to fight the coronavirus pandemic. This is truly American exceptionalism at its finest,” he noted, THE FAN BASE GROWS On Thursday, President Trump will launch “Catholics for Trump,” a new voter outreach group. “As President Trump leads our nation during this major crisis of combating COVID-19, Catholics are coming together in prayer. President Trump is a steadfast supporter of the Catholic community and has delivered on his promises,” says senior advisor Mercedes Schlapp. The campaign already boasts over a dozen voter coalitions devoted to women, Hispanics, blacks, U.S. sheriffs, pro-life advocates, military veterans, workers, Irish-Americans, Greek-Americans, “cops” and even disgruntled Democrats.

"Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam did not announce any scheduling changes to upcoming elections in May and June but instead encouraged residents to vote by mail during the coronavirus pandemic. On Monday, Mr. Northam announced a stay-in-home order lasting through June 10. There are local and special elections scheduled in towns and counties throughout the state on May 5, and a Republican primary for U.S. Senate on June 9. “I consider elections to be a fundamental democratic event and voting to be an essential right,” Mr. Northam said. “We are continuing to work through the best options for how to hold these elections in this time of social distancing and public health concerns.” Mr. Northam said those who wish to vote by mail but live alone could “ask a neighbor to witness you signing it at a safe distance.” “Elections are vitally important, and we will ensure that they are held,” the governor added.

"HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) - The California Supreme Court on Wedesday has refused to hear a challenge to a state law that limits police collaboration with federal immigration agents. The court denied a request by the city of Huntington Beach to review an appellate court opinion in January that found that the issue was a matter of statewide concern and that gave the law precedence over the police authority of charter cities. That reversed a 2018 ruling. “This is tragic for the rule of law and for local control efforts,” Huntington Beach City Attorney Michael E. Gates said in an email. “Now the lower court ruling stands, which opens the floodgates for the state to legislate and control every aspect of local governance.”  The Orange County city of 200,000 people sued claiming that California’s so-called immigrant sanctuary law, the 2017 California Values Act, interfered with its authority to enforce local laws and regulations. The law prohibits state and local police from asking arrestees - except for those charged with serious crimes - about their immigration status or notifying federal agents when an immigrant is being released from jail.  California enacted the law following President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration. It was hailed as a victory by immigrant advocates seeking to encourage immigrants to trust in local police officers and report crime.  But critics decried the law, saying it makes it harder to deport immigrants who commit crimes and leads law enforcement to release them back into communities. In California, 121 cities have their own charters and others follow the state’s general law. Huntington Beach argued that cities that create their own charters to have a greater say over local affairs shouldn’t be subject to the law since it relates to local policing.

"The Treasury Department announced late Wednesday that it was reversing course and allowing Social Security beneficiaries who typically do not file a tax return to receive $1,200 direct payments automatically from the coronavirus aid package. “Social Security recipients who are not typically required to file a tax return need to take no action, and will receive their payment directly to their bank account,” said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. The Internal Revenue Service had said earlier this week that everyone would be required to file a tax return in order to qualify for the payments.

"The infectious-disease expert who has become the face of the nation’s coronavirus response is reportedly having his personal security boosted. Dr. Anthony Fauci has received enough threats to concern federal officials, the Washington Post reported Wednesday evening. Citing “people with knowledge of deliberations inside the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice,” the Post reported that, in addition to hostile threats, Dr. Fauci is also receiving unwelcome attention from admirers — stalkers, more or less. Alongside Deborah Birx, coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, Dr. Fauci has encouraged President Trump to strengthen social-isolation and lockdown guidelines and has warned of a death toll in the hundreds of thousands. The Post report had no specific details about the nature of the threats against Dr. Fauci, longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, though it did speculate about some pro-Trump groups. But the Post sources said HHS Secretary Alex Azar has become concerned about Dr. Fauci’s safety and requested that the U.S. Marshals Service deputize agents with the office of the HHS inspector general to protect Dr. Fauci. The Justice Department signed the paperwork Tuesday, the Post reported. Dr. Fauci deflected questions about his personal security. Asked by reporters whether he had security protection, Dr. Fauci declined to comment Wednesday and said “I would have to refer you to HHS.” President Trump then joined the conversation, saying Dr. Fauci “doesn’t need security. Everybody loves him.”  ","Report: Dr. Anthony Fauci gets security amid threats, stalkers","Wednesday, April 1, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/1/anthony-fauci-gets-security-amid-threats-stalkers-/,washington_times
"President Trump said on Wednesday night that he’d love to hear from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden about fighting the coronavirus. No, really. “Sure. Oh absolutely, I’d love to speak to him,” Mr. Trump said at the White House coronavirus briefing. “If he’d like to call, I’d absolutely take his call.” Mr. Biden’s campaign said earlier in the day that the Democratic frontrunner, who has roundly criticized the administration’s response to the pandemic, was willing to speak with the president. “Vice President Biden has been extending his advice for months, and he did so again on the air last night,” said deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfied. “As he has said repeatedly, Donald Trump is not accountable for coronavirus itself — but he is accountable for the federal government’s slow and chaotic response to this outbreak.” Mr. Trump said again that he inherited a “broken” system to respond to widespread infectious disease outbreaks. But he said he’d be happy to speak with Mr. Biden, whom he regularly ridicules as “Sleepy Joe.” “I always found him to be a nice guy; I don’t know him very well, frankly,” he said. “But I think he’s probably a nice guy.” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway had criticized Mr. Biden earlier Wednesday for not calling the president to offer advice. “I think it’s really disappointing to have President Obama’s number two, who apparently doesn’t talk much to him, out there criticizing instead of saying, hey, here’s what we did that we thought was effective,” she said on “Fox & Friends.” “Why doesn’t Vice President Biden call the White House today and offer some support? He’s in his bunker in Wilmington, and I have to tell you we’re not talking about politics here at the White House at all. We’re talking about ventilators and vaccines, not Biden and Bernie.”  ",Trump says he'd take Biden's call on coronavirus: 'I'd love to speak to him',"Wednesday, April 1, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/1/donald-trump-says-hed-take-joe-bidens-call-coronav/,washington_times
"A 65-year-old drug used mainly for treating malaria has suddenly become the world’s most hotly debated pharmaceutical, thanks to the novel coronavirus and President Trump. Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared chloroquine and its next-generation derivative, hydroxychloroquine, for treating COVID-19, social media has been ablaze with warnings about the drug’s potentially deadly side effects. “Human beings are not guinea pigs. We took a solemn oath to ‘first, do no harm,’” tweeted Dr. Eugene Gu, a prominent Trump critic. “That means not testing drugs that have deadly side effects without any proven benefit against the coronavirus with no evidence from clinical trials. This is the most basic rule of ethics in medicine.” Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine come with a risk of sudden drug-induced cardiac arrest for those with prolonged QTc, a lengthier-than-normal interval between heartbeats as shown on an electrocardiogram [ECG], said Dr. Michael J. Ackerman, a genetic cardiologist and director of Mayo Clinic’s Windland Smith Rice Sudden Death Genomics Laboratory. “The patient’s QTc value reflects the health of the heart’s electrical recharging system,” said Dr. Ackerman. “If the QTc is prolonged, it indicates that the system is inefficient or pokey, and in that setting, if QT-prolonging medications like hydroxychloroquine are added to the mix, that can be a dangerous and even deadly combination.” He said the good news is that the danger of such reactions is “really rare” and can be mitigated. How rare? “About 90% of us would be absolutely fine being exposed to these medications,” said Dr. Ackerman. “Five to 10% of us would be at increased risk where I would want my physician to make some adjustments … and 1% of us are at significantly increased risk for this tragic side effect.” Taking azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, as some U.S. medical centers are now recommending to treat COVID-19, can exacerbate the situation. The solution begins with awareness. Even before the FDA took action, Mayo Clinic Proceedings published an “urgent guidance” for health-care providers recommending that they identify at-risk patients and determine their “baseline QTc status,” either by using an ECG or a mobile device, such as AliveCor’s KardioMobile 6L, which recently received FDA emergency clearance. Instead of being unaware or resigned to the side effects — or too “QT paranoid” to prescribe hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 — Dr. Ackerman recommended that medical professionals be aware of the issue and navigate it. “Even if you are in that 1%, that doesn’t mean that sudden cardiac death is around the corner,” Dr. Ackerman said. “It just means that your risk has increased enough that there had better be a tremendous amount of respect and awareness given to this QTc issue.” A COVID-19 vaccine is at least 12 to 18 months away, but there is hope that hydroxychloroquine “may have life-saving therapeutic efficacy against COVID-19,” said the Mayo Clinic guidance. “And if it does, we hope that this simple QTc surveillance strategy, enabled by innovation and FDA’s emergency approval, will help prevent altogether or at least significantly reduce the number of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac deaths,” said the guidance. After Mr. Trump touted hydroxychloroquine two weeks ago as a potential “game changer,” reaction has ranged from fans celebrating the drug as a savior to critics blasting the president for pushing “snake oil,” as a USA Today editorial put it. At least two states with Democratic governors — Michigan and Nevada — have issued restrictions on the antimalarial drugs, citing concerns about hoarding as well as the lack of clinical evidence on their efficacy in treating the novel coronavirus. After the FDA authorization, however, the Michigan Health and Human Services Department changed course. “Based on the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization to allow the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) for certain patients with COVID-19, we are pursuing a request for hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine from SNS,” said Lynn Sutfin, Michigan HHS spokesperson, in an email. Last week, the state Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs warned doctors against prescribing the drugs, citing lack of evidence about their efficacy against COVID-19 and reports of stockpiling, adding that reports of such conduct “may be further investigated for administrative action.” Pharmacists were also instructed not to fill prescriptions if they believed they could be used for reasons “other than legitimate medical purposes” or “cause harm to a patient,” adding that medical providers had an obligation to report “inappropriate prescribing practices.” The Trump administration said it had received 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated by Sandoz and one million doses of chloroquine phosphate donated by Bayer Pharmaceuticals for the national stockpile of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. At a Monday press conference, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said her administration needed to be “nimble in this crisis,” adding that “we are continually updating and adjusting as we need to.” “We want to ensure that doctors have the ability to prescribe these medicines,” Ms. Whitmer said. “We also want to make sure that people who have prescriptions that predated COVID-19 have access to the medication that they need. And so all of the work that we’ve done is trying to strike that balance.” Most of the evidence behind using hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 is anecdotal, although small studies out of France and China have found the drug to be beneficial. A study published Wednesday in medRXiv by Chinese researchers found that in a trial of 62 COVID-19 patients, the duration of coughing and fever were “significantly shortened” in the hydroxychloroquine treatment group, although two suffered “mild adverse reactions.” The research was conducted Feb. 4-28 at Renmin Hospital at Wuhan University.

"Background checks required to buy firearms have spiked to record numbers in the past month, fueled by a run on guns from Americans worried about their safety during the coronavirus crisis.  According to figures from the FBI, 3.7 million background checks were done in March - the most for a single month since the system began in 1998. It eclipsed the previous record, set in December 2015, when 3.3 million checks were conducted. Background checks are the key barometer of gun sales, but the FBI’s monthly figures also incorporate checks for firearm permits that are required in some states. Each background check also could be for the sale of more than one gun. The rush has inflamed tensions between Second Amendment advocates and gun control supporters. Pro-gun groups say the long lines seen at gun stores affirm a widespread belief about the right to bear arms. Opponents contend that adding firearms into stressed-out households filled with people cooped up during lockdown orders will lead to increased levels of domestic violence and suicides. “This is overwhelming evidence that Americans value their ability to take responsibility for their own safety in times of uncertainty,” said Mark Oliva, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gunmakers. “The figures are simply eye-popping.” The FBI numbers show that March had five of the top 10 days ever for background checks, including the day with the most, March 20, when more than 210,000 checks were conducted. The day before, California ordered all nonessential businesses to close. Four of the top 10 weeks ever for checks have occurred since mid-February, including the week with the most, March 16-22, when nearly 1.2 million checks were done.  In comparison, 2.64 million checks were conducted in March 2019, more than a million fewer than last month. The spikes followed key moments in the U.S. trajectory of the pandemic, starting with the nation’s first recorded death on Feb. 29 and ramping up as a flurry of states closed schools and businesses. Then in mid-March, President Donald Trump urged Americans to practice social distancing and warned of a potential recession. Of the 3.7 million background checks done last month, about 2.5 million represented firearm sales, an increase of about 85 percent over March 2019, according to estimates from Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting, which analyzes data on the firearms industry. Handgun sales increased by about 91 percent, while sales of long guns were up nearly 74 percent, it said in a news release. Gun retailers reported that the overwhelming majority of buyers over the past month have been first-time gun owners, the National Shooting Sports Foundation said. That worries gun-control advocates, who fear first-time buyers will not be able to get the training to safely handle and store their new weapons.  “We need to prepare for the increased risk of more firearms in untrained hands,” said David Chipman, a retired agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who’s now senior policy adviser with the Giffords gun control group. “If you didn’t think you needed a gun prior to March of this year, you certainly don’t need to rush out and get one now.” Last year already proved to be busy for the background check system, with a record 28.4 million conducted in 2019. That trend continued in January and February, with experts saying the numbers have been fueled by a typical concern among gun-rights supporters during a presidential election year - that a potential Democratic president would institute to greater restrictions. The soaring numbers come amid debate in cities and states about whether gun shops should be considered essential businesses that can remain open during stay-at-home orders meant to reduce the spread of the virus. Over the weekend, the Trump administration issued an advisory classifying firearms dealers as essential but did not mandate that states keep them open. The gun lobby has pushed back vigorously in places that determined federally licensed gun dealers are not essential during the outbreak and should close. The industry says the shops are critical to allowing Americans to exercise their constitutional rights. The Texas attorney general issued a legal opinion saying emergency orders shuttering gun shops are unconstitutional. That’s in contrast to some cities, such as New Orleans, where the mayor has issued an emergency proclamation declaring the authority to restrict sales of firearms and ammunition.  In Los Angeles, Sheriff Alex Villanueva has twice ordered gun shops in the nation’s most populous county to close, leading to legal challenges from gun lobbying groups, including the National Rifle Association, National Shooting Sports Foundation, Second Amendment Foundation and Gun Owners of America. ___ Pane reported from Boise, Idaho.

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The husband of Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler recently acquired as much as $415,000 in stock in DuPont de Nemours, a chemical company that manufactures protective equipment in exceedingly high demand because of the coronavirus pandemic. The transaction, detailed in a mandatory disclosure the Republican filed late Tuesday, comes as senators in both parties have faced questions about the stock transactions they made in the weeks before the coronavirus upended the U.S. economy, wiping out jobs and personal wealth. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., whose sales of as much as $1.7 million in stocks have come under the most scrutiny, requested an ethics review of his actions in the days before markets dropped in February. The FBI has also contacted him about the sale. He has denied trading on inside information. Like Burr, Loeffler came under fire last month after she and her husband dumped substantial portions of their portfolio. The transactions came after a series of private congressional briefings on the then-burgeoning pandemic. The new purchases disclosed by Loeffler include the purchase of DuPont stock, a company that could see profits soar from the sale of protective equipment as hospitals search for desperately needed supply. Loeffler says she had no involvement in the trades. “Her stock portfolio is managed independently by third-party advisors,” said spokeswoman Kerry Rom. “Sen. Loeffler continues to operate with integrity and transparency –- following both the spirit and the letter of the law.” Their latest financial moves are likely to give more ammunition to critics of the newly appointed senator, who is on the ballot this year. Her top Republican primary rival, Rep. Doug Collins, previously accused her of “profiting” while “people are losing their jobs, their businesses, their retirements.” The mandatory disclosures senators must make do not detail specific amounts of stock sales or purchases. Instead, they give a range in dollars of the value of each transaction. Tuesday’s filing shows Loeffler’s husband purchased anywhere between about $166,000 and $415,000 in DuPont, spread across four transactions in late February and early March. The company’s website says “thousands of DuPont employees are working around the clock in all parts of the world to increase capacity of protective garments during this time of high demand.” The purchase represented just a portion of their recent financial activity. They also bought as much as $250,000 in Chevron, as much as $50,000 in Amazon and as much as $350,000 in CME Group, the new disclosure shows.  At the same time, they sold between about $100,000 and $250,000 in DocuSign stock, sold as much as $150,000 in Facebook stock and unloaded holdings in retail stores like Ross, TJ Maxx and Lululemon.  Loeffler’s husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. A separate disclosure made Tuesday reveals he recently sold between about $6 million and $30 million of stock in its parent company, Intercontinental Exchange. Loeffler, who also worked for Intercontinental Exchange, sold between $5 million and $25 million in stock from the company while exercising an option that gave her as much as $25 million more. Stock options are one of the primary ways the couple is paid by the company.  The couple’s new investment in DuPont drew notice from government watchdog groups, particularly because they also recently invested in a tech company that offers telecommuting software that could also benefit from the pandemic. “I think it deserves an extra amount of scrutiny because when she did the first round of sales after she got nonpublic information, she also bought a stock in a telecommuting company,” said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which filed a Senate ethics complaint against Loeffler and Burr last month.  “This would follow that pattern, which is why it does raise an eyebrow, and it’s one of those things that even if it doesn’t go to the level of breaking the law or any rules, it looks bad.”   ",Georgia Sen.

"After states hit hard by coronavirus moved to help homeowners by suspending mortgage payments and halting foreclosures and evictions, renters across the country began asking if they could forego paying their April rent — an idea that has landlords warning they have bills to pay, too. It is part of the cascading effect of the economic shutdown to combat the virus. Governors are urging landlords not to evict renters during the crisis — some even going as far as officially prohibiting evictions, as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo did in March. He suspended evictions for both residential and commercial property for 90 days in New York, which has emerged as the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. “On that basis, my daughters have stopped paying me rent,” Mr. Cuomo quipped. “I’m not even sure that their finances have dropped significantly, but I think they’re just taking advantage of the non-eviction order that I myself posted. And I resent it, but there’s nothing I can do about it legally.” Delaware Gov. John Carney halted evictions in his declaration of a state of emergency, citing the public health threat and the need for people to shelter in their homes. That doesn’t help landlords who still have mortgage payments to make and rely on rent payments. It creates a domino effect. Still, landlords contacted by The Washington Times said they remained hopeful they would get by with aid in the $2 trillion coronavirus economic rescue bill signed by President Trump last week, which included government checks and unemployment benefits that could help tenants pay rent for next few months. Local governments also are stepping up to give guidance to cash-strapped tenants and worried landlords. The San Diego Housing Commission created a website that gives tenants information on how to qualify for rent relief and what proof they must provide their landlords. The rent is not entirely forgiven. Tenants get six months to catch up on their payments. San Diego’s moratorium on evictions expires May 31. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis has been pressured to issue a moratorium on evictions but has not formally done so. Sen. Rick Scott, Florida Republican, said the coronavirus relief package that Congress has passed does not go far enough. The legislation put into place a nation-wide moratorium on evictions, but Mr. Scott wants a 30-day halt on taxes, utility payments, credit card payments, mortgages, and financial payments including rent. “Today is April 1, and so many across our nation are struggling to pay their rent, mortgage and other financial obligations,” he said in a press release. “I thank the many governors that have taken action to prevent evictions and foreclosures in their states. But we have to go even further to provide much-needed relief for Americans – and we have to do it today,” he added. Where lawmakers, though, fail to meet all needs, big companies are hoping to fill in the gaps. One of Florida’s major grocery store chains, Publix, announced last month it would pay the rent in shopping centers it owns where the other businesses have been forced to close because of social distancing orders. “As a company that started as a small business 90 years ago, Publix wants to help businesses renting from us survive the economic impact of these unexpected closures,” said Maria Brous, communications director for Publix. Publix operates more than 1,200 stores in seven states, according to WSFA, an NBC-affiliate station in Alabama. • David Sherfinski contributed to this report.

"BALTIMORE (AP) - A Baltimore board on Wednesday approved a six-month pilot program which will allow surveillance planes to patrol the city, a decision that drew opposition from civil liberties groups. Three privately funded surveillance planes were cleared to begin patrols after the Board of Estimates approved the contract on a 3-2 vote which opened the way for a six-month pilot program, The Baltimore Sun reported. It allows the planes to collect images of the city to help investigate murders, nonfatal shootings, armed robberies and carjackings. The planes, their pilots, analysts and hangar space will be funded by Texas philanthropists Laura and John Arnold through their organization, Arnold Ventures. The technology is capable of capturing images of 32 square miles of the city for a minimum of 40 hours a week. With the deal, the Arnolds will also pay for grants to enable independent researchers to study whether the program has an impact on Baltimore’s violent crime rate. The city has recorded more than 300 homicides yearly for the last five years. David Rocah, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, said it was “absurd” for the board to consider the plan during the COVID-19 outbreak. Baltimore, like the rest of Maryland, has been under a stay-at-home order since Monday in response to the virus. The board meeting was conducted via conference call.  Rocah also argued the surveillance planes would “supercharge” the effectiveness of city’s existing camera network which is not “distributed in Baltimore in a racially neutral way.” “They are overwhelmingly located in Baltimore’s black and brown neighborhoods,” he said. “The racial impact of this technology is significant.” Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the pilot is needed to determine whether the technology could help reduce the city’s crime rate.  “I fully appreciate that the opponents of this program … have fundamental and philosophical beliefs against this kind of technology,” Harrison said. “These differing viewpoints are not solely isolated to this claim and extend to many other tools BPD uses every day.” Harrison also argued Rocah’s argument lacked context. “The cameras were placed strategically based on incidents of violent crime over time,” he said. “While that may coincidentally be in some black and brown neighborhoods, it’s the crime over time that determines where the cameras are placed.” Democratic City Council President Brandon Scott, one of two board members to vote against the plan, questioned whether the technology was useful in solving homicides or robberies during an earlier trial in 2016 without the input of Baltimore City Council members or the mayor. Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young, one of the three votes in favor of the surveillance plan, spoke only once during the debate saying, “I stand behind my commissioner.”  ",Baltimore board OKs surveillance planes amid opposition ,"Wednesday, April 1, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/1/baltimore-board-oks-surveillance-planes-amid-oppos/,washington_times
"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad: ___ March 31 The Japan News on countries working together to combat the new coronavirus pandemic: There are limits to what any one country can do when it comes to responses to the new coronavirus. Unless the spread of infections can be contained worldwide, there will be no hope for putting an end to the pandemic, or for restoring the economy. International cooperation is more urgently needed than ever before. More than 700,000 people have been infected with the virus globally. The U.S. caseload surged to the largest in the world, passing China with far over 100,000 cases. Infections have also been spreading in emerging and developing countries, including South Africa, Brazil and Thailand. It is important to avoid a situation in which outbreaks of the virus swing back and forth between developed and developing countries. Areas in developing countries hit by poverty or conflict suffer poor hygienic environments. In places that lack water supply infrastructure, residents cannot even wash their hands well, which is a basic way of avoiding infections. The United Nations has called on countries to offer resources worth 220 billion, for such purposes as providing medical supplies and developing facilities for hand washing. Developed countries have to focus on supporting developing countries while at the same time bringing under control the spread of infections in their own countries. It is essential to establish a framework to share information on the virus and treatment methods. Humans have fought against infectious diseases such as the plague and smallpox in the past. However, social environments have drastically changed since then. The latest crisis poses a threat that humans have never experienced before, at a time when the world has become more globalized, developed transportation networks and entered into a digital age in which people are connected through social networking services. The virus can drastically spread at great speed, reaching much wider areas as more and more people travel. Also, it has become easier for people to be exposed to false information through social media. A major question is how to respond to the virus in a way that suits the realities of today’s world. Many countries have banned arrivals from certain other countries and imposed lockdowns. Halting people’s movements as an emergency measure in a bid to prevent an explosive increase in the number of infections is an inevitable step. However, in today’s global economy, every country is facing an immeasurable impact that lockdowns are having on the economy and people’s lives. Anxiety and fear also trigger discriminatory feelings. If countermeasures against infections are thoroughly implemented, it could undermine the stability and vitality of society. This is surely a common dilemma that all countries face. It has become more important than ever for the governments and international organizations to promptly disclose information and implement scientific measures in a calm manner. As a superpower, the United States has a responsibility to show leadership. If President Donald Trump describes the current fight against the outbreak as “war,” it is not the time for him to concentrate on attacking China and critics of his administration. Since 2016, when Trump was elected for U.S. president and Britain voted to leave the European Union, divisions in the world have become deeper. Political confusion in the United States and Europe, which are normally expected to support the international order, have hampered countries from working together on global issues, as has the spread of unilateralism. How can countries contain the harmful effects of lockdowns and “open” their cities at an appropriate time? Through a long fight against the virus, the world must regain its solidarity and build the groundwork for a joint response to the crisis. Online: https://the-japan-news.com/ ___ March 30 The Boston Globe on President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic: “Things fall apart; the center cannot hold,” wrote W.B. Yeats in 1919. A century later, it’s clear: The epicenter cannot hold. Catastrophic decisions in the White House have doomed the world’s richest country to a season of untold suffering. The United States, long a beacon of scientific progress and medical innovation with its world-class research institutions and hospitals, is now the hub of a global pandemic that has infected at least 745,000 people and already claimed more than 35,000 lives worldwide. Now that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States - more than 140,000 - has surpassed that of any other nation, Americans are consigned for the coming weeks to watching the illness fell family members and friends, and to fearing for their own fate as they watch death tolls rise. While the spread of the novel coronavirus has been aggressive around the world, much of the profound impact it will have here in the United States was preventable. As the American public braces itself for the worst of this crisis, it’s worth remembering that the reach of the virus here is not attributable to an act of God or a foreign invasion, but a colossal failure of leadership. The outbreak that began in China demanded a White House that could act swiftly and competently to protect public health, informed by science and guided by compassion and public service. It required an administration that could quickly deploy reliable tests around the nation to isolate cases and trace and contain the virus’s spread, as South Korea effectively did, as well as to manufacture and distribute scarce medical supplies around the country. It begged for a president of the United States to deliver clear, consistent, scientifically sound messages on the state of the epidemic and its solutions, to reassure the public amid their fear, and to provide steady guidance to cities and states. And it demanded a leader who would put the country’s well-being first, above near-term stock market returns and his own reelection prospects, and who would work with other nations to stem the tide of COVID-19 cases around the world. What we have instead is a president epically outmatched by a global pandemic. A president who in late January, when the first confirmed coronavirus case was announced in the United States, downplayed the risk and insisted all was under control. A president who, rather than aggressively test all those exposed to the virus, said he’d prefer not to bring ashore passengers on a contaminated cruise ship so as to keep national case numbers (artificially) low. A president who, consistent with his mistrust and undermining of scientific fact, has misled the public about unproven cures for COVID-19, and who baited-and-switched last week about whether the country ought to end social distancing to open up by Easter, and then, on Saturday, about whether he’d impose a quarantine on New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut …  Timing is everything in pandemic response: It can make the difference between a contained local outbreak that endures a few weeks and an uncontrollable contagion that afflicts millions. The Trump administration has made critical errors over the past two months, choosing early on to develop its own diagnostic test, which failed, instead of adopting the World Health Organization’s test - a move that kneecapped the US coronavirus response and, by most public health experts’ estimation, will cost thousands if not hundreds of thousands of American lives. Rather than making the expected federal effort to mobilize rapidly to distribute needed gowns, masks, and ventilators to ill-equipped hospitals and to the doctors and nurses around the country who are left unprotected treating a burgeoning number of patients, the administration has instead been caught outbidding individual states (including Massachusetts) trying to purchase medical supplies. It has dragged its heels on invoking the Defense Production Act to get scarce, sorely needed ventilators and masks into production so that they can be distributed to hospitals nationwide as they hit their peaks in the cycle of the epidemic. It has left governors and mayors in the lurch, begging for help. ….  It’s not too much for Americans to ask of their leaders that they be competent and informed when responding to a crisis of historic proportions. Instead, they have a White House marred by corruption and incompetence, whose mixed messages roil the markets and rock their sense of security. Instead of compassion and clarity, the president, in his near-daily addresses to the nation, embodies callousness, self-concern, and a lack of compass. Dangling unverified cures and possible quarantines in front of the public like reality TV cliffhangers, he unsettles rather than reassures. The pandemic reveals that the worst features of this presidency are not merely late-night comedy fodder; they come at the cost of lives, livelihoods, and our collective psyche. Many pivotal decision points in this crisis are past us, but more are still to come. For our own sake, every American should be hoping for a miraculous turnaround - and that the too-little, too-late strategy of the White House task force will henceforth at least prevent contagion and economic ruin of the grandest scale. But come November, there must be a reckoning for the lives lost, and for the vast, avoidable suffering about to ensue under the president’s watch. Online: https://www.bostonglobe.com/ ___ March 30 The Wall Street Journal on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s comments on President’s Trump handling of the coronavirus pandemic:  Nancy Pelosi wasted no time getting to her point in her interview Sunday on CNN. After some wishes about good health, host Jake Tapper asked the House Speaker if she agreed with President Trump’s musings that the national lockdown could end by Easter. Mrs. Pelosi might have disagreed on policy grounds-and later Sunday Mr. Trump extended the social distancing for another month-but instead she tore into Mr. Trump … “What the President-his denial at the beginning was deadly. His delaying of getting equipment to where-it continues-his delay in getting equipment to where it’s needed is deadly,” she said. “And now I think the best thing would be to do is to prevent more loss of life, rather than open things up,” referring to the possibility of easing social distancing. “I don’t know what the purpose of that is. I don’t know what the scientists are saying to him. I don’t know what the scientists said to him. When did this President know about this and what did he know? What did he know and when did he know it?” the Speaker added, repeating the most famous line from the impeachment probe of Richard Nixon. “That’s for an after-action review. But as the President fiddles, people are dying. And we have to-we just have to take every precaution.” First Nixon, then Nero. Mr. Tapper wanted to make sure he heard that right: “But are you saying that his downplaying ultimately cost American lives?” Mrs. Pelosi: “Yes, I am.” The Speaker is a political professional who doesn’t pop off by accident. She clearly went into the interview with a plan to attack Mr. Trump at the start of a week when she knows that the infection and death tolls will mount. Why go there? The cynical interpretation is that Mrs. Pelosi and her allies have seen the polls that show a majority of the public approves of Mr. Trump’s handling of the pandemic. Perhaps she wants to undermine that perception. She may also be sending a message to her left-wing that even if Mr. Trump wins re-election, she will be happy to investigate and impeach him again for his virus response. Whatever the reason, this was an ugly note when the public wants signs of cooperation across the government-and when Mr. Trump had been praising Democrats in Congress for helping to pass the $2.2 trillion relief bill. He also refrained last week from attacking Mrs. Pelosi for delaying the relief bill to add non-virus earmarks like her $25 million for Washington’s Kennedy Center. But Mr. Trump can never not respond to an attack and on Monday, after Mrs. Pelosi’s Sunday comments, he hit back in a tweet. That doesn’t help matters at this moment. But remember who cast the first coronavirus stone. Online: https://www.wsj.com/ ___ March 27 The New York Times on internet access: America came face to face with the festering problem of digital inequality when most of the country responded to the coronavirus pandemic by shutting elementary and high schools that serve more than 50 million children. Even before the shutdown, an estimated 12 million children were having difficulty completing routine homework assignments - not to mention writing research papers - because they lacked the home internet access their better-off classmates take for granted. The so-called Homework Gap has taken on crippling dimensions now that closed school districts have been trying to maintain a semblance of instruction by putting teachers or course materials online. Internet-savvy school systems that serve connected populations appear to be moving ahead relatively smoothly with the new order of business. At the same time, some districts that lack infrastructure and serve heavily poor populations have given up altogether on remote learning. Still others are hesitant to pursue online instruction out of fear they might be hauled into court for offering course materials to which broadband-deprived families cannot gain access. New York City, which has an estimated 300,000 students who lack internet-connected devices, is one of several districts rushing to acquire such devices. Still, the country needs a more systematic approach to this problem. Jessica Rosenworcel, a Federal Communications Commission member who has been proselytizing on this issue for several years, has rightly called on the F.C.C. to use funds earmarked for connecting schools and libraries to the internet to provide schools with internet hot spots that could be lent to students. Beyond that, some members of the Senate are urging the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to set aside dedicated funding that would help to narrow the digital divide. These suggestions address the exigencies of the moment. But the time has long passed for the country to open the door to the information age for communities that are locked out. The daunting challenge of trying to get distance learning up and running comes as school districts are already struggling to feed students who rely on school breakfasts and lunches to stave off hunger. An analysis of policy statements by 46 districts that was released last Friday by the nonpartisan Center on Reinventing Public Education found considerable confusion among districts about how to deal with issues of technology and internet access. Only about a third of the districts said they were working to deliver laptops or tablets to students. Only five said they were delivering mobile phones or wireless hot spots to students, while more were encouraging parents to sign up for internet service. Few districts had comprehensive learning plans, and most were sharing links to “optional assignments on publicly available websites.” No district examined by the center had “a clear solution for ensuring that 100 percent of students have a … device and reliable, long-term access to the internet.” This scramble is taking place in an atmosphere of uncertainty over how long the shutdown will last. Districts will need more money - and new expertise - if it turns out that a comprehensive online infrastructure is needed for the long haul. The pandemic-driven changes undertaken by KIPP, the nation’s largest public charter school network, give a sense of how schools have had to adapt and how obstacles vary by region. The network is using its buses to deliver food to communities that need it. Where internet connectivity is poor, the network’s buses also drop off work packets that are later picked up for grading. The lack of internet access in poor and rural communities comes up again and again as educators talk about the pandemic … closing the digital divide - and bringing all Americans into the information age - will require a momentous effort on the scale of the federal project that brought electricity to darkened regions of the country during the New Deal. And it will be similarly worth the effort. Online: https://www.nytimes.com/ ___ March 27 The Los Angles Times on halting abortions during the coronavirus pandemic: As attempts to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic go, here’s a reprehensible one: the effort by some conservative states to halt abortions by arguing that they are “nonessential” medical procedures. Sounds ridiculous, but that’s the way officials in Ohio and Texas have interpreted emergency health orders intended to conserve medical equipment and gear needed for hospitals during the crisis. It should be obvious that an abortion can’t be “postponed” until the pandemic clears up like a facelift or cataract surgery or routine dental work. If a woman doesn’t get get an abortion in a timely fashion, she can’t get it at all. And that is, undoubtedly, what Texas and Ohio are hoping for. This is a chance for abortion opponents and state officials who are hostile to reproductive rights to advance their goal of making abortions difficult to access under the ruse of protecting coronavirus patients. (Mississippi’s governor said his state might follow suit.) That’s shameless. And it’s medically negligent. Besides, the vast majority of abortions are not even performed in hospitals; they’re done in clinics. And providers there say they have reduced the use of protective equipment where possible. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists along with several other medical societies issued a statement warning that a delay of even several days in getting an abortion could make it inaccessible and could “profoundly impact a person’s life, health, and well-being.” Neither the Texas nor the Ohio emergency order restricts doctors to providing care only in a life-or-death situation. The Ohio Department of Health order says doctors may perform procedures to save someone from having a dysfunctional limb, for example. But Ohio Atty. Gen. Dave Yost, in a letter to two abortion providers, told them to stop performing surgical abortions in cases where the mother’s life is not at risk. The Texas order from Gov. Greg Abbott instructs providers to postpone procedures not necessary to help someone at risk for “serious adverse medical consequences or death.” But Texas Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton, in a news release on his website, specified that unnecessary procedures included routine dermatological, ophthalmological and dental procedures - as well as any type of abortion that isn’t life-saving. If a woman can’t get an abortion, there is, indeed, a serious adverse medical consequence: She has a baby she did not intend or desire to have. In Texas, where some providers are already turning away patients, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Lawyering Project filed suit this week asking for a temporary restraining order against using the health order to stop abortion procedures. According to the suit, Texas’ interpretation of the health order is unconstitutional, singles out abortion providers from other medical services and causes patients irreparable harm. Both Ohio and Texas have a history of passing baseless restrictions on abortion. That they would now use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to deny women their constitutional right to an abortion is perhaps not surprising, but it is certainly appalling. Online: https://www.latimes.com/ ___ March 27 The Chicago Tribune on weight gain during “stay-at-home” orders: If you’re reading this at 11 a.m. and you already maxed out your recommended calories for the day, we feel you. Stay-home orders from state and local governments should come with refrigerator padlocks. For the privileged employees who can work from home, those not working and for those still heading out the door for work, routines have been shredded. Schools, gyms and restaurants are closed. Hospitals and nursing homes forbid visitors. Vacations have been postponed. Weddings and funerals are on hold. Let’s face it. It’s a stressful time. We’re spending more time indoors, and the only thing getting a serious workout is the microwave. We’re eating peanut butter by the spoonful, popcorn by the handful, ice cream by the bowlful. We’re eating over the kitchen sink, standing at the counter and yes, in bed. There are toast crumbs prickling flannel sheets across America right now as testament to dutifully obeying government restrictions. We’re trying to cook healthier during this time of uncertainty. But can roasted chicken and vegetables be considered diet food if you eat four servings at a time? Isn’t it an act of patriotism to order takeout burgers and fries to keep local businesses afloat? Is it wrong in the privacy of your own home to enjoy a splash of wine at noon? We see you, Chicago.  Of course, the advice for controlling weight gain is to use common sense. Try to eat on your normal schedule. Plan your snacks and put them in containers. Move your work station around the house or apartment to avoid boredom. And set up shop away from your favorite cupboard …  That’s not to say everyone dealing with stay-home mandates is finding their inner Homer Simpson. Plenty of people are using the time wisely by cleaning out drawers and painting bedrooms. Some people are sticking with those New Year’s resolutions and demonstrating discipline with food and exercise. If you’re not one of them, it’s OK. Alex Light, who writes a column for Hello! Magazine, reminds us weight gain is not a sign of failure.  “It’s never an indicator of failing, but especially not during these current circumstances,” she wrote earlier this week. “Weight fluctuations are an entirely normal response to our lives being very different right now.” Kimberly Hershenson, a New York City therapist and eating disorder specialist, told the New York Post she’s seeing clients return to emotional eating habits due to stress. “People binge because they feel everything is going wrong in their life, so who cares if they gain weight too?” she said. If you’re one of them, cut yourself some slack. Post-pandemic, we’ll see the return of running clubs and crowded gyms. There will be plenty of time to shrink muffin tops and get back to sensible eating. In the meantime, if the scale in the bathroom is adding to your emotional blues, apply at least some of the advice nutritionists are offering. Get out and walk. Drink more water …  And know that no matter what, summer is coming soon to Chicago. Morning sun soon will stream through your windows. Cafes and bike paths will reopen … It’s coming. Have hope.

"MEXICO CITY (AP) - A Guatemalan migrant died during a riot at an immigration detention center in Mexico, where detainees burned mattresses to protest conditions they say could expose them to the new coronavirus, officials said Wednesday. Twenty-seven migrants escaped from the facility in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco during the disturbance, Mexico’s National Immigration Institute said Wednesday. The institute said the disturbance largely involved Honduran men, but that one Guatemalan man, 42, died of smoke inhalation.  According to a local migrant shelter in the Tabasco city of Tenosique, the riot broke out Tuesday because migrants were tired of long periods of detention and also feared that overcrowding and poor sanitary conditions could expose them to the coronavirus.  The “72” migrant shelter said 14 other migrants were injured, some seriously. The institute said 11 of those injured were treated and released, while three remained under observation. In the Tenosique protest, and an earlier demonstration at a detention center in the city of Tapachula, migrants expressed anger that they were not released or returned to their countries.  The Institute says deportation programs have been delayed by travel restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic. It said Mexico was in talks with Central American governments about how to resume deportations. The United Nations human rights and migration offices in Mexico said the dead man had sought refugee status in Mexico. It said 13 other people were injured, and said rights workers are working to transfer 42 asylum seekers from the Tenosique facility to a shelter. The institute said remaining detainees had been moved to other facilities. Mexico now has 1,378 confirmed new coronavirus cases, with 37 deaths.

"FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) - A federal appeals court has upheld the conviction of the former president of a private Christian college in northwestern Arkansas who pleaded guilty in a kickback scheme involving state legislators. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit on Tuesday upheld the three-year prison sentence of former Ecclesia College President Oren Paris III, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. Paris, convicted on one count of conspiracy, was granted the right to appeal after pleading guilty in April 2018. Paris and consultant Randell Shelton were accused of funneling cash bribes in 2013-2014 to then-Sen. Jon Woods and former Rep. Micah Neal. In exchange, Woods directed over $715,000 in state grants to the college. The kickbacks were routed through Shelton’s consulting business, formerly based in Springdale. Neal pleaded guilty in Jan. 2017 to one count of conspiracy and cooperated with investigators extensively prior to the plea. Neal subsequently received one year of home confinement.  Paris resigned as president of Ecclesia and pleaded guilty just prior to the start of his trial with Shelton and Woods, who were convicted of multiple corruption charges. Woods is serving an 18-year sentence. Shelton is serving six years.. Paris, Woods and Shelton subsequently appealed their convictions, largely on the basis of FBI agent Robert Cessario wiping the hard drive of a laptop used to collect and send electronic files to defense attorneys in the case. He also had them professionally erased before turning it over to investigators after defense lawyers found he had not transferred all the files. Cessario’s conduct was revealed in pretrial hearings in the case. Paris decided to plead guilty after the trial judge ruled against the defendants’ motions to dismiss the charges over Cessario’s actions. Paris’ defense lawyer, Travis Story of Fayetteville, had argued to the appeal court that the solution of allowing a trial while prohibiting Cessario testimony for the prosecution is unjust. But the appeals court ruled that it does not appear any of the now-destroyed evidence would have changed the outcome in Paris’ case, adding that his arguments saying it would have made a difference is simply “speculation built upon speculation.” Appeals for Woods and Shelton are still pending.

"SAN FRANCISCO — Citing unprecedented challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic, city officials across California are asking Gov. Gavin Newsom to suspend or delay numerous state laws, saying they’re unable to comply with everything from environmental regulations to public records laws that give people a window into how the government is spending public money. Noting that city resources and personnel are stretched thin responding to the pandemic, the executive director of the League of California Cities asked Newsom last week to “take immediate action to pause certain statutory requirements.” The league that represents nearly 500 cities is seeking to delay the state’s constitutionally mandated California Public Records Act, which requires transparency in government decision-making and spending. The law requires public agencies to respond to requests for information within 10 days, though many routinely take advantage of legally allowed extensions. Spokeswoman Kayla Woods said the group is not seeking to suspend all public records requests, but wants “flexibility to cities if their ability to respond to certain PRA requests is limited due to decreased staffing or closure of city facilities.” She said the delay would be limited to records requests “other than those created during, and relating to, the COVID-19 crisis.” “Cities have varying levels of staffing and resources, and are focusing nearly all of their efforts on responding to this public health crisis,” Woods said in an email to The Associated Press. The danger with suspending such laws, even partially or temporarily, “is that the public won’t know and won’t have ability to oversee financial improprieties, public employee wrongdoing, fraud - myriad important aspects of the government will not be able to be seen by the public if the public doesn’t have access to public records,” said Duffy Carolan, a San Francisco attorney who represents media outlets. The league’s request comes as governments worldwide are spending billions, often through contracts with private companies, to build emergency hospitals, acquire hotel rooms and buy much-needed personal protective equipment. In California alone, the Legislature approved $1 billion in emergency spending that will filter out to local governments. Newsom has already waived regulations on everything from hospital staffing to school funding in sweeping executive orders. He temporarily suspended parts of the state’s open meeting laws, allowing boards and commissions to meet and vote by teleconference and exempting rules that people be allowed to speak in person. The governor’s office did not respond to a request Tuesday from the AP asking whether he is considering any more such suspensions. Across the U.S., governors, lawmakers, mayors and county officials have already opted to keep the public away from public meetings for the sake of health. Federal agencies have cited the crisis in refusing to respond to records requests. In California, San Francisco’s mayor suspended the city’s stringent Sunshine Law, and Fresno’s city council voted to suspend the entire California Public Records Act. In response, 132 good government and media companies have urged governments to redouble transparency during the crisis, saying credibility is more critical than ever. “As people are asked to make increasing sacrifices in their daily lives for the greater good of public health, the legitimacy of government decision-making requires a renewed commitment to transparency,” the groups wrote. In response to his request for emails related to Sonoma County’s coronavirus response, county officials told Santa Rosa Press-Democrat reporter Tyler Silvy that the public’s interest “is not served by diverting staff resources away from essential emergency response work to immediately respond to records requests.” In subsequent correspondence, a county attorney told Silvy the county would process such requests when normal business resumes. Aaron Field, a San Francisco attorney who specializes in media law and is co-chair of the Northern California Society of Professional Journalists’ freedom of information committee, noted that the California Supreme Court has said open government “is essential to the functioning of society,” so the bar for suspending such a rule - even temporarily - should be high. “In the midst of a crisis in which the government is more involved in our daily lives than it has ever been in my memory, it’s more important than ever for public access to be preserved,” he said. The League of California Cities requested a host of delays in its six-page letter. Woods, the league’s spokeswoman, said many city employees who would normally work on fulfilling statutory requirements “have been pulled from their regular assignments to work on these vital emergency response efforts.” The league is requesting delays to numerous waivers and deadlines, including for construction project approvals, housing reviews and annual staff salary information. It also seeks to: - Suspend a California law requiring public officials to file statements of economic interest that can show conflicts of interest and weighing fees for late submissions, which California’s Fair Political Practices Commission is expected to formally approve Thursday. Woods said the filing delay ensures local leaders can focus on responding to the crisis. - Delay some parts of California’s environmental law by four months, including the need to hold timely meetings and a rule requiring California Environmental Quality Act reviews to be completed within a year. - Cut by 25% the locally required spending on some transportation projects, which governments have previously sought to waive; and extend the deadline to approve some construction projects.

"Recent editorials of statewide and national interest from New York’s newspapers: Coronavirus Doesn’t Care Where You Come From. Trump Still Does. The New York Times March 31 Three weeks ago, with much of the United States already gearing up to limit the spread of the coronavirus, the Trump administration’s chief immigration judge sent out a stern order to immigration courts nationwide to take down all public health posters, printed in English and Spanish, on how to deal with the pandemic. “Per our leadership,” the order said, immigration judges did not have the authority to post fliers. “If you see one (attached), please remove it.” Soon after the order was revealed by The Miami Herald, the Department of Justice, which oversees the immigration courts, reversed course and told the paper that “the signs shouldn’t have been removed.” A bureaucratic blunder? More like a case in point of how the administration’s obsession with immigrants, undocumented, legal or aspiring, has infected its efforts to control the spread of a pandemic, exacerbating the crisis. Tough times call for tough measures, to be sure, and the administration’s anticipated order to turn back all asylum seekers and other foreigners trying to cross the southwestern border illegally makes sense in the context of measures already taken to severely restrict movement across other American borders, land and sea. The immigration system along the southern border is overtaxed, and detention centers across the United States are already bursting with nearly 40,000 people, at enormous risk of contagion. The coronavirus doesn’t discriminate between carriers who are held behind bars and those whose job it is to guard them. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has continued to make arrests and has shown no intention of releasing nonviolent detainees, though judges in some states have ordered some released out of health concerns. Rounding up undocumented immigrants and shutting down the border is something President Trump has yearned to do since long before the coronavirus began its fateful spread. And his animosity toward undocumented immigrants is affecting the efforts to contain the coronavirus far beyond the border. As Miriam Jordan of The Times reported, the virus has spread more fear among immigrants, legal and undocumented - the fear that seeking medical or financial help will put them in the cross-hairs of the administration’s repressive immigration policies. At the beginning of March, more than 700 public health and legal experts addressed a petition to Vice President Mike Pence and other federal, state and local leaders asking, among other things, that medical facilities be declared enforcement-free zones (ICE currently classifies them as “sensitive locations,” where enforcement is avoided but not precluded). The Citizenship and Immigration Service subsequently appeared to signal that it was suspending enforcement of a new “public charge” rule, which makes it harder for immigrants to obtain the green card of a permanent resident if they tap federal benefits, but the suspension has not been publicized. Those who are not documented are afraid that going to a public health facility will expose them to ICE agents. Immigrants in the country legally and hoping to obtain a green card fear that seeking help will ruin their chances under the public charge rule, which went into effect in February after injunctions blocking it were lifted by the Supreme Court. These immigrants are particularly at the mercy of the pandemic. They often live in crowded conditions, have little money and no paid sick leave, and so lack the ability to self-quarantine. And according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 23 percent of noncitizens lawfully in the country and 45 percent of those who are undocumented lack health insurance. Most immigration courts, meanwhile, were still working at full steam long after state and federal courts across the country sharply scaled back their activities. On Monday, several groups representing lawyers who work with immigrant clients sued the administration to stop in-person immigration hearings during the pandemic. It was only last week that the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the Justice Department agency that oversees immigration courts, closed down some courts and suspended hearings for immigrants not in custody. The coronavirus does not care which passport its human hosts may carry or tongue they speak. Nor does it serve global public health for only American citizens to wash their hands and practice social distancing. Those are best practices that should transcend borders and walls and help us acknowledge our common plight, and humanity. Online: https://nyti.ms/3bM8PqD ___ NY’s April presidential primary should be postponed Newsday March 27 The coming weeks are going to be an all-out battle to get the coronavirus under control and save lives in New York. Holding the state’s April 28 presidential primary would be a dangerous distraction. It should be postponed. COVID-19 is just the latest threat to our elections. Last week’s federal stimulus bill includes $400 million for states to ensure the virus doesn’t upend November’s election. That concern comes atop the fear of more cyberattacks in poorly secured state systems that were discovered in the wake of 2016 Russian meddling. Pennsylvania and Alaska are moving their presidential primaries for health reasons. In the meantime, New York must make the smart choice for April. Some 2 million people voted statewide in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary (there is no Republican primary in New York this cycle). Those kinds of numbers should not be gathering in the state’s schools and public places, so soon. That doesn’t mean cancellation. The two remaining candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, have enough Empire State support to clear the 15 percent threshold to earn delegates. They’re viable candidates, even if Biden is the frontrunner. Unless that changes, the vote has to happen. Moving the vote to June 23, when state and federal primaries are already scheduled, is the safe and cost-effective choice. The change can be made either by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo or the State Legislature, according to the Board of Elections. Legislative action is best, to show agreement among a wide swathe of elected representatives instead of setting a precedent of allowing the executive to make such declarations. A June 23 primary wouldn’t leave much time before the state party would confirm the slate of delegates to the July Democratic convention, itself in flux, but safety in this time of fear is the better course. And an April vote may not even be feasible. Preparations for the primary are being thrown into disarray because of the crisis. The organization that represents New York elections personnel called last week for a postponement, noting that local elections boards should be gearing up already. They will “find it almost impossible to meet mission critical deadlines for testing machines and preparing ballots because of staff shortages due to the ongoing stay-at-home order,” the group explained. Legislative proposals to help expand the use of absentee ballots so more people can vote from home are smart now - and in general. But that may not be enough for the COVID-19 threat. Even a June primary will require serious public health preparations, which we must start now. A recent Brennan Center for Justice report smartly suggested hand sanitizer for polling places and disposable pens to mark paper ballots - for the general election in November, half a year away. Online: https://nwsdy.li/348MWiv ___ Main Street needs a hand from Albany Utica Observer-Dispatch April 1 But along with worrying about keeping themselves and their families healthy, thousands of small business owners across New York state are losing sleep over how to keep this virus from killing the businesses they have worked so hard to build. At the same time, lawmakers in Albany are trying to craft a budget in the face of plunging revenues. Sales taxes - much of them generated by small business - brought in a whopping $73.6 billion last year. Our schools, as well as other vital government services, rely on these funds. When a business fails - and too many are on the precipice of failure right now - that sales tax revenue goes, too. We believe a simple proposal could help restart local business and bolster sales tax revenues, but swift action is required by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state Legislature. Small businesses are the backbone of our communities. Everyone wants a thriving downtown where they can shop, eat or go to a movie. The good news is that small businesses have always been engines of innovation and entrepreneurship, and we are seeing that again today as they adapt to the new reality. Local gyms are streaming personal training sessions. Restaurants offer free delivery and online happy hours. Medical practices are expanding their telemedicine capabilities. Car mechanics are making house calls that require no personal contact at all. Of course, it’s vital that these businesses let potential customers know about their services. That’s the role of advertising in all its myriad forms. But advertising costs money, and the sad truth is that advertising is one of the first things small businesses cut when times are tough. Put yourself in the shoes of a local restaurateur with a stack of bills and very little money coming in. By the time she finishes paying the most urgent bills - rent, food suppliers, payroll - there’s not much left for advertising. Whatever stimulus money she gets from Washington or Albany will most likely be needed to keep the door open and the lights on. Yet studies show that how well businesses survive a downturn is in large part determined by whether they continue to market and advertise during the hard times. Fortunately, there is a way for Albany to prime the sales-tax pump to keep revenue flowing to both small businesses and state coffers. Let businesses use some of the money they would have sent to Albany, as sales taxes, to market their new offerings. The formula would be simple: Every dollar a small business spends on advertising (up to some reasonable limit) would be a dollar saved off that business’s sales tax bill. It would be a win-win-win. Local businesses would be healthier because the increased advertising would jump-start sales. The state would get more sales tax revenue because local businesses would be selling more. And media companies (like ours) would benefit from the additional ad revenue. We’d like to think that we, too, are vital to the character and strength of our communities, not to mention our democracy. Think for a moment of the critical role that journalists have played in getting vital local information out to your community during this unprecedented crisis. The Legislature has a lot on its plate right now, and the temptation will be to bury this idea, or to take the shortsighted view that we can’t afford to do it right now. But right now is when it’s needed. We’ve been impressed with Gov. Cuomo’s levelheaded leadership in this crisis, and we call on him to back this innovative yet simple policy. Online: https://bit.ly/2wSuNsY ___ Virus is a ‘bullet train’ heading our way Post Star March 24 We take the rare step of publishing this editorial on the front page of this newspaper as our strongest way of emphasizing the peril we believe local communities face in the weeks ahead. The World Health Organization warned Tuesday that the United States is about to become the next epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, and New York City is the epicenter in the United States. If you haven’t paid attention to the politicians in recent days, we urge you to take their warnings seriously. Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio have sounded the strongest possible warnings over the past four days, but none as strong as Tuesday. By early Tuesday, there were more than 25,000 cases of coronavirus in New York with 15,000 in the city. The death toll has reached 183, with two-thirds coming from New York City. While we may be as different culturally as two peoples can be, the indisputable fact is that we in upstate New York are linked incontrovertibly with New York City. As New York City goes, so goes upstate. We all should find that frightening. We fear our communities are still not taking this seriously enough, and that we have not taken enough steps locally to prepare for the crisis coming up the Northway. We found it especially reprehensible that the president of the United States – who has a strong following in our community-suggested that the country could open up for business in two weeks, putting thousands of American lives at risk. We do not want to instill panic, but few medical professionals share the president’s optimistic approach. If the virus projections come to pass, we need to be prepared. As New York City goes, so goes upstate. On Sunday, Mayor de Blasio said the city would run out of medical supplies in 10 days. By Tuesday, Gov. Cuomo warned that the coronavirus was spreading faster and will be more dangerous than originally anticipated. Just a week ago, Gov. Cuomo said the peak of the virus was 45 days out. He now says it will peak in two weeks. Gov. Cuomo says the rate of infection is doubling every three days. “We’re not looking at a freight train, we’re looking at a bullet train,” Cuomo said during his daily news conference. Cuomo initially figured that the state would need 110,000 hospital beds at the peak of the crisis; he now believes he will need up to 140,000. That’s double the current capacity. The ventilator shortage is so dire that hospitals are experimenting with a technique for two patients to share a ventilator. And while the federal government responded by sending 400 ventilators to New York, Mayor de Blasio anticipates New York City will need 15,000. Knowing what this community can do when it sets its mind to it, we urge local governments and organizations to put in place emergency plans that will fill the gaps if the state or federal government fails us. We all must quarantine ourselves. We wonder if essential businesses like supermarkets need to be limited to online orders and drive-up pickups to eliminate all human contact. We urge local communities to mobilize now with plans for rudimentary health centers where those sickened can be taken if the hospitals are no longer an option. Local plans should be put in motion to prepare places like the Forum in Lake George, the Cool Insuring Arena and convention space at Great Escape if it is needed. Community leaders should immediately create an inventory of other available space. They should begin compiling a list of volunteers with any type of medical experience or education to volunteer their services during a community-wide emergency. We will need brave volunteers to take care of the sick. This could be an important moment for the youth of the region. We do not want to spread unnecessary fear, but consider these words from Gov. Cuomo: “What are we going to do with 400 ventilators when we need 30,000? You pick the people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators,” Cuomo said. One reader reminded us on Tuesday that this community once had a thriving textile industry. He wondered if it could be revived to make hospital gowns and masks for medical professionals. Are there other companies that could make ventilators? Or hospital protection gear? We need to act now. It is clear to us we cannot count on the federal government and its Pollyannaish approach to this crisis. If it won’t act to protect us, we will have to do it ourselves. Online: https://bit.ly/341oQWU ___ Nursing homes need extra protection Adirondack Daily Enterprise April 1 Elderly people with underlying medical conditions are the most at risk of dying from COVID-19. They also are the men and women most likely to be residents of nursing homes. Experience during the past couple of weeks has demonstrated that outbreaks in nursing homes can serve as beach heads for the coronavirus to spread throughout communities. In King County, Washington, the COVID-19 death toll stood at 144 as of Tuesday. King County became a bulls-eye for COVID-19 after an outbreak at the Life Care Center nursing home in Kirkland. At last report, 35 residents and staff members there had succumbed to the virus. Similar nursing home outbreaks have occurred in other states. That makes it clear that, both for the sake of those who live in such facilities and to forestall community-wide outbreaks, special attention needs to be given to nursing homes and assisted care centers. Availability of testing kits to determine whether people have contracted COVID-19 remains a concern - including here in the Adirondacks. There simply are not enough to serve basic public health needs. An investigation of what happened at the Life Care Center indicates that nursing homes and assisted care facilities should be among the top priorities for test kits. Here in the Adirondacks, testing kits are so scarce that testing is restricted only to those sick enough for hospitals to admit them as inpatients. In general around the U.S., testing has been limited to people who display symptoms of COVID-19. Those symptoms include shortness of breath, respiratory problems, fever and fatigue. But we know that many people are carrying and transmitting the virus without showing any symptoms. That could include elder-care facility staff members. A report on the Washington nursing home indicates that once even a single case of COVID-19 surfaces, all those at an elder-care facility should assume a significant rate of infection exists. Special precautions are indicated, such as isolating some patients and use of protective gear by staff. To that we add this: If at all possible, nursing homes and assisted care facilities everywhere should be closed to the public - such as they already are here in the Tri-Lakes area - and everyone who is allowed to enter one should be tested for COVID-19. Lives were lost at the Life Care Center because drastic measures were not taken soon enough. Treating every elder-care facility as a COVID-19 hot zone could save lives. But we also know that with that comes great hardship for the residents, especially those with dementia who cannot understand why they cannot see the people they love. Staff and families must do whatever they can to foster safe remote connections and stave off loneliness - and the rest of us may just need to pray this all ends as safely and quickly as possible.

"Recent editorials from North Carolina newspapers: March 31 The Fayetteville Observer on how families can stay entertained while following social distancing guidelines: These days, you will not hear the satisfied squeals of children as they clamor up various jungle gyms at the county’s playgrounds. Fayetteville-Cumberland parks officials decided to close the facilities last week to protect against COVID-19. They preceded by several days Gov. Roy Cooper’s statewide, stay-at-home order, which went into effect at 5 p.m. on March 30. That order left the decision on parks up to local officials. Here in Cumberland County, our leaders did the wise thing. Social distancing to try to maintain 6 feet between one another is not something easily maintained at a playground, most especially by children, who are less susceptible to the virus’ worst effects but, according to some experts, can likely spread it. Playgrounds in one sense are purpose-designed for children and families to experience together with other families, in close proximity. How many parents that later become friends met at their children’s playground? The county recreation centers are also closed, but the parks and trails are open. We consider this a reasonable compromise, considering social distancing is much easier to make happen out in nature. Parks and the role they could play in potentially spreading the deadly coronavirus has caused some concern in our community. Making the rounds of Facebook and NextDoor last weekend was a picture of large group of youths playing sports at the ball fields at Lake Rim Park. When Parks officials closed the playgrounds, they posted signs at highly visible locations to alert people. The Lake Rim gathering was another reminder that social distancing requires a commitment from all of us. Closings and executive orders will only go so far. Meanwhile, the playgrounds being closed does place another burden on parents looking to occupy young children. Many parents have already been pressed into the secondary role of home-school teacher, as school buildings remain closed at least until May 15. Parks officials seem conscious of their challenges and have encouraged people to go to a website that links to different children’s activities that can be done at home. (From the home page, look for “Educational resources for students & citizens.”) For young children, there are printable PDF coloring sheets of city vehicles, including police cars and sanitation trucks. For older children, there is a long list of things to do at home with the kids. There are links to many virtual activities, ranging from field trips to museum visits, to visits to the zoo and a “classroom” for noted documentary filmmaker Ken Burns. And this is to say nothing of a stroll, or a bike-ride that families can make through their own neighborhoods, which is very much allowed by the governor’s stay-at-home order. Hopefully by summer, when we have this coronavirus monster contained, the playgrounds will be filled again with the squeals of children - in plenty of time to enjoy the splash pads. Online: https://www.fayobserver.com ___ March 29 The Winston-Salem Journal on a sheriff’s decision to temporarily suspend new gun permit applications: The Wake County sheriff, Gerald Baker, has enough real problems to deal with right now, as do law enforcement officials everywhere. People who want to rush out and buy guns, and people who worry about gun rights more than, apparently, public health and safety, need to give him a break. Overwhelmed with a huge surge in requests for permits for pistols and concealed carry, Baker suspended new applications until the end of April. Requests for those permits and for renewals surged last week to an average of 290 a day - more than triple the number before the coronavirus became a reality in Wake County. Baker’s problem is obvious. By the time he called a halt, he already had 11 staff members in self-isolation for fear either they or their spouse might have the coronavirus. It’s only a matter of time before the virus affects more of the staff. In the meantime, the Wake County Sheriff’s Office has new demands to deal with, including helping to enforce that county’s shelter-in-place rules. Wake is one of the top three counties in North Carolina in reported coronavirus cases. Then there’s the way people were lining up out the door of the public safety center in Raleigh, risking spreading the virus to one another and to the staff. Odds are people wouldn’t be getting their permits any time soon anyway. By the time he called a suspension, Baker’s office had a backlog of 755 pending applications. It would be different if Baker were keeping people from getting something essential - say food or medication. But more guns are not what people need, especially now. People are afraid. Their lives are disrupted. Often, tempers fray. Panic buying is already causing problems. Panic buying of guns will only make things worse. People who work with victims of domestic violence warn of a likely spike in violence as the pandemic lockdown means people spend more time together in stressful circumstances. The sheriff’s office staff that processes gun permits will need to be more careful than ever, and certainly should not rush through an avalanche of applications. Predictably, some gun rights groups rushed to complain about what they consider a violation of the Second Amendment. But Baker isn’t trying to take anyone’s guns away or even to keep people who have permits from buying guns. He’s simply saying that under the circumstances, the flood of applications is endangering the public health and interfering in his offices’s more essential work. That makes so much sense that you’d think other public officials would be supporting Baker. But no, Republican state Sens. Warren Daniel of Burke County and Danny Britt of Robeson County called the suspension illegal and demanded that Baker rescind it. State Rep. Tim Moore, the speaker of the N.C. House, joined the chorus. The lawmakers are saying that people are already frightened, on edge and subject to paranoia and that buying guns will somehow help the situation - an argument that’s highly questionable, to say the least. Crowding into a line to get a gun permit or buy a gun will put people at more risk than not having a gun. People need to calm down. We must be sensible and work together to weather this health emergency and its unavoidable economic and social consequences. Getting more guns is not going to help. Online: https://www.journalnow.com ___ March 27 The News & Observer and The Charlotte Observer on the data available about North Carolina’s coronavirus cases: At least once each day, North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services updates its data on coronavirus cases in our state. To get those DHHS numbers, simply go to the department’s coronavirus page, where you can find the current official NC case count, number of COVID-19 deaths, and the number of completed public and commercial tests. You also can find the number of cases and deaths in each county on a map below. It’s helpful information, and DHHS has served North Carolina well with the availability of secretary Mandy Cohen, who has directly and thoughtfully answered questions in news conferences during the crisis. But residents of other states are getting information about the coronavirus that North Carolinians aren’t. In neighboring Virginia, the Department of Public Health has provided a online demographic breakdown of the virus, including hospitalizations, with positive cases sorted by age groups, gender and race. On March 27, NCDHHS began adding demographic information about age and gender, but not race. In Florida, the department of health goes even further, providing an elaborate county-by-county dashboard that includes hospitalization data. Florida also provides a detailed daily summary of persons being monitored and persons under investigation. Several other states provide residents with similar details, but the model for state-level COVID-19 data might be Oklahoma. There, health officials have provided an additional update that includes data on available ventilators and hospital occupancy, as well as the number of available beds in ICUs, operating rooms and pediatric units. North Carolina has access to at least some of this data. Last week, the News & Observer asked DHHS for demographic information - age or age range, gender, race and zip code - of COVID-19 patients across North Carolina. Other than age and gender numbers released for the first time on March 27, DHHS has not responded. Why is such information important? It can help improve understanding of the virus and its spread among North Carolinians, and it can accentuate issues and dispel myths that contribute to that spread. For example, Mecklenburg County released demographic information earlier this month that showed nearly 50% of cases were in people under the age of 40 - a number that might have surprised younger people who thought they were less vulnerable. Similarly, the statewide numbers released on March 27 showed that people under 50 make up 61 percent of positive tests. Does the data give us a full picture of COVID-19? No, and as N.C. epidemiologist John Wallace cautions, demographic data is a snapshot that only reflects known cases. They don’t say where infected individuals may have gone and how they became infected. “They shouldn’t be used to determine who is at risk and where,” Wallace told the News & Observer. Still, such information provides a more detailed landscape of the coronavirus and, in turn, why doubters should take it more seriously. Detailed numbers might also prompt questions or reveal information about patterns and needs, and while officials say they don’t want to release information that might reveal the identity of an individual with coronavirus, that’s a bit of a red herring. State-level data - or even county-level demographics - do not bring risk to individual privacy. To be clear, we appreciate the critical information DHHS provides, as well as the transparency officials have shown in public briefings. We don’t believe officials are trying to hide data from the public. But as other states and counties have demonstrated, such information is available. It’s useful and potentially valuable. North Carolina should provide it to people who want to better understand the crisis around them.

"The Trump campaign is asking supporters to sign a petition to demand that news networks continue airing President Trump’s daily press briefings on the coronavirus crisis, countering a liberal effort to take him off the air. “Stand with your president!” the campaign said in an email. “The left wants to keep President Trump’s daily press conferences off the air because, unlike the fake news, he’s actually telling the American people the truth.” It asks supporters to sign the petition “to demand the fake news continue airing President Trump’s daily press conferences!” There’s also a link for campaign donations. “President Trump needs to know he can count on you right now while he’s fighting for America, it’s up to us to fight for him,” the campaign said. Nearly 200,000 people have signed a petition published on MoveOn.org calling on CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, NPR and Fox News to stop airing live coverage of the White House’s briefings on the coronavirus outbreak. The liberal group said Mr. Trump is using the briefings as a “live campaign rally.” “President Trump is blatantly using the news organizations’ extensive, live coverage to freely campaign for a second term,” the MoveOn petition states. “It is wrong and dangerous to provide so much unfettered airtime to someone who is happily, shamelessly spreading terrible, damaging misinformation that is already costing fellow Americans their lives.” The Trump campaign said 84% of people who responded to its recent survey are watching the president’s press briefings in late afternoon. Mr. Trump holds the briefings with a rotation of key members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, including Vice President Mike Pence; Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; and Dr. Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator. Due to the outbreak, the president hasn’t held a campaign rally since Feb. 28 in South Carolina.

"The infectious-disease expert who has become the face of the nation’s coronavirus response is reportedly having his personal security boosted. Dr. Anthony Fauci has received enough threats to concern federal officials, The Washington Post reported Wednesday evening. Citing “people with knowledge of deliberations inside the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice,” The Post reported that, in addition to hostile threats, Dr. Fauci is also receiving unwelcome attention from admirers — stalkers, more or less. Alongside Deborah Birx, coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, Dr. Fauci has encouraged President Trump to strengthen social-isolation and lockdown guidelines and has warned of a death toll in the hundreds of thousands. The Post report had no specific details about the nature of the threats against Dr. Fauci, longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, though it did speculate about some pro-Trump groups. But The Post sources said HHS Secretary Alex Azar has become concerned about Dr. Fauci’s safety and requested that the U.S. Marshals Service deputize agents with the office of the HHS inspector general to protect Dr. Fauci. The Justice Department signed the paperwork Tuesday, The Post reported. Dr. Fauci deflected questions about his personal security. Asked by reporters whether he had security protection, Dr. Fauci declined to comment Wednesday and said, “I would have to refer you to HHS.” Mr. Trump then joined the conversation, saying Dr. Fauci “doesn’t need security.

"Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden on Wednesday said he thinks the Democratic National Convention will have to be postponed at least several weeks after he had raised doubts about the event proceeding as scheduled in mid-July. “I think it’s going to have to move into August,” Mr. Biden said on NBC’s “The Tonight Show.” “We just have to be prepared for the alternative.” Most Americans are now living under some kind of stay-at-home order, and people have been encouraged to stay at least 6 feet away from others amid the coronavirus outbreak. The Democratic National Convention Committee has acknowledged it’s looking at contingencies, and officials say they’re going to put a priority on public health. The Democrats’ convention is currently scheduled for July 13-16 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Republican National Convention is scheduled for Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte, North Carolina.

"BALTIMORE (AP) - Baltimore officials determined to reduce violent crime have approved an eyes-in-the-sky program that uses surveillance planes to create a visual record of everything that can be seen in the streets below. Despite opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union and concerns that such pervasive monitoring could violate people’s rights, the city’s Board of Estimates voted 3-2 to on Wednesday to approve the privately-funded contract with Ohio-based Persistent Surveillance Systems, The Baltimore Sun reported.  The six-month pilot program will use three planes to collect images of the city to help investigate murders, nonfatal shootings, armed robberies and carjackings. The planes, their pilots, analysts and hangar space will be funded by Texas philanthropists Laura and John Arnold through their organization, Arnold Ventures. The technology is capable of capturing images of 32 square miles of the city for a minimum of 40 hours a week. The deal also pays for grants to enable independent researchers to study whether the program has an impact on Baltimore’s violent crime rate. The city has recorded more than 300 homicides yearly for the last five years. David Rocah, an attorney for the ACLU of Maryland, said it was “absurd” for the board to consider the plan during the COVID-19 outbreak. Maryland has been under a stay-at-home order since Monday in response to the virus. The board meeting was conducted via conference call.  Rocah also argued the surveillance planes would “supercharge” the impact of the city’s existing camera network, which is not “distributed in Baltimore in a racially neutral way.” “They are overwhelmingly located in Baltimore’s black and brown neighborhoods,” he said. “The racial impact of this technology is significant.” Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the existing network was put in place where crime rates are highest. The airborne surveillance technology is different, and a pilot is needed to determine whether it can help reduce the city’s crime rate.  “I fully appreciate that the opponents of this program … have fundamental and philosophical beliefs against this kind of technology,” Harrison said. “These differing viewpoints are not solely isolated to this claim and extend to many other tools BPD uses every day.” Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young, voting in favor, spoke only once during the debate, saying, “I stand behind my commissioner.” The Board of Estimates is comprised of the city’s mayor, council president, comptroller, solicitor and public works director.  Council President Brandon Scott, who voted against the plan, questioned whether the technology was useful in solving homicides or robberies during an earlier trial in 2016 without the input of Baltimore City Council members or the mayor.

"Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on Thursday said he hopes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will “see the light” on pushing for a fourth legislative package in Congress in response to the escalating coronavirus outbreak. “I think we have to do it, and I hope that Leader McConnell will see the light,” Mr. Schumer, New York Democrat, said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” He said Mr. McConnell objected to provisions in the recent $2.2 trillion economic rescue package to boost unemployment benefits, provide additional oversight of a new loan fund for corporations, and provide more money to state and local governments. “But you know, we pushed. We didn’t let him have his way when we voted no and then it passed 96-0,” Mr. Schumer said, referring to Senate Democrats’ procedural delay tactics. A Republican aide has disputed Mr. Schumer’s version of events, saying the “concessions” he has claimed credit for were largely bipartisan ideas or ones that faced little more than token opposition. Republicans have said the final package President Trump signed last week closely mirrored an earlier version offered by Mr. McConnell and Senate Republicans. Mr. McConnell told The Washington Post this week that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s comments about a fourth round of coronavirus legislation were premature. “She needs to stand down on the notion that we’re going to go along with taking advantage of the crisis to do things that are unrelated to the crisis,” the Kentucky Republican said. Before the $2.2 trillion package, Congress had already cleared legislation to boost federal health funding and expand certain social safety net programs. Mr. Schumer was speaking as the Labor Department reported a record 6.65 million initial unemployment claims in the week ending March 28, doubling the previous week’s record of about 3.3 million and vastly exceeding analyst expectations. “Think of that in human terms,” Mr. Schumer said. “Most of them have worked hard and long at their companies — they have pride in their work, and they’re gone through no fault of their own.” “At least our unemployment on steroids — which we passed, we forced the Republicans to do it — says you’re going to get your full pay or close to it from the federal government for four months,” he said.

"Sen. Susan Collins’s chances of winning reelection are a “toss-up,” according to an analysis from the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics that shows the battle for control of the Senate is getting more competitive. The last Senate Republican from New England, Ms. Collins is running for a fifth term in Maine and is likely to face off against state House Speaker Sara Gideon. “We’ve resisted this change for a while, but it’s become apparent to us that Collins is in for a very close race, even if she may retain a lead at this precise moment,” Kyle Kondik and J. Miles Coleman write in their breakdown of the 2020 election. With Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama expected to lose re-election, Democrats need to flip four seats to reach a split in the Senate, which would make the vice president the tie-breaking vote. Democrats are now favored to win the special election in Arizona, where Sen. Martha McSallly is running against likely Democratic nominee Mark Kelly, and Democrats are favored to flip Sen. Cory Gardner’s seat in Colorado. Ms. McSally was appointed to the seat by Gov. Doug Ducey after Sen. John McCain died. “We came away from 2018 a bit skeptical of McSally as a candidate: She lost to now-Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) by about 2.5 points and McSally was not quite able to translate her impressive background as an accomplished Air Force pilot into an appealing persona as a candidate,” they said. They said she has had trouble consolidating the right-wing of the party and trails Mr. Kelly in fundraising.  ",Maine Sen.

"The Progressive Turnout Project is reconfiguring its 2020 campaign plans because of the coronavirus outbreak and plans to make 12 million phone calls in support of President Trump’s opponents. The anti-Trump progressive group made plans in December to knock on 7.1 million doors with an emphasis on voters in the South and the Rust Belt. As states impose social distancing guidelines nationwide, PTP said it is investing $2.9 million in “Turnout 2020,” its phone-banking initiative.  “Phone banking has been proven to increase turnout by 2-3%,” said Alex Morgan, PTP executive director, in a statement. “While that may sound small, that’s all Democrats need to flip Wisconsin, Michigan and other key battlegrounds. That’s why it’s critical to offer opportunities to activists who want to make an impact and turn out voters, but don’t live in swing areas or who can’t go door-to-door.” PTP is focused on four states for the coming presidential election, including Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the progressives have honed in on Senate races in seven states, namely Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan and North Carolina. The progressive group’s plans to target 8.5 million voters nationwide will also rely upon the support of a network of other anti-Trump groups. The Women’s March, Democracy for America, Daily Kos, Newtown Action Alliance, Progressive Democrats of America, VoteRiders, the Democratic Coalition,and Indivisible Chicago have all joined PTP’s cause. “With the most important election of our lifetimes on the horizon, person-to-person connections are essential to ensuring that the new American majority of Black, brown and white progressive voters make their voice heard in November,” said Charles Chamberlain, Democracy for America chair, in a statement. “The virtual phone banking that Democracy for America is committed to doing with our allies at the Progressive Turnout Project this cycle will ensure that nothing, including the social distancing required to save lives, stands in the way of our fight for progressive values, priorities and leadership in 2020.”  ",Progressive group launches multimillion-dollar phone campaign to defeat Trump,"Thursday, April 2, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/2/progressive-group-launches-multimillion-dollar-pho/,washington_times
"The political landscape is getting more competitive for President Trump in North Carolina. Mr. Trump carried the state by a 3-point margin over Hillary Clinton in 2016, but now faces 50-50 odds of beating his Democratic rival, according to the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, which has switched the state’s rating from “Leans Republican” to “Toss-up.” They rate Mr. Trump’s chances of winning reelection this fall as a “Toss-up.” Democrats have won North Carolina twice in the last 44 years — Jimmy Carter did it in 1976 and Barack Obama emerged victorious there in 2008. It is worth 15 electoral votes. “Joe Biden has consistently led Donald Trump in North Carolina polling, albeit only by a few points. Trump won it by about 3.5 points in 2016, about the same as Arizona, another historically Republican presidential state we rate as a Toss-up,” says the forecast from Kyle Kondik and J. Miles Coleman. We think the Democrats have room to keep growing in the big metro areas, and perhaps also in the African-American vote if Democrats can generate better turnout from this group of voters,” they said. “Then again, Trump may have room to grow in outstate areas as well.” Their running tally has Democrats winning 248 electoral college votes, and Republicans winning 233. That leaves 57 electorate votes up for grabs in Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. “While the Democrats are nominally ahead now, these ratings reflect a presidential race that we would still characterize as a Toss-up overall,” they said. “Based on our ratings, both sides are still multiple states away from an Electoral College majority.”  ","Trump given 50-50 odds of winning North Carolina, reelection in 2020: Univ. of Va.","Thursday, April 2, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/2/donald-trump-given-50-50-odds-winning-north-caroli/,washington_times
"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut officials are struggling to handle an overwhelming number of unemployment claims stemming from the coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday.  The governor said during an MSNBC interview that hundreds of retired state employees have been brought in to handle the surge. He said earlier this week that there have been 100,000 claims for unemployment compensation filed in recent weeks in Connecticut, creating a five-week lag in money getting to applicants. “It spiked up a factor of ten, fifteenfold compared to anything we were ready for, certainly anything our 40-year-old … unemployment processing system was ready for,” said Lamont, a Democrat. “We’re doing everything we can to catch up, but we’re not catching up yet.” Lamont also urged federal officials to consider Connecticut part of the escalating COVID-19 outbreak in bordering New York in terms of providing medical supplies, including personal protective equipment. “We’re part of that New York City pandemic, and southern Connecticut has just about the same infection rate,” he said. And what is good for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo “is good for me and Connecticut, because he can’t put out the fire in New York if I can’t put it out in lower Connecticut.” As of Wednesday, more than 3,500 state residents have tested positive for the virus, and 85 have died. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. In other developments related to the outbreak: ___ NURSING HOMES The Lamont administration plans to move some residents living in Connecticut’s long-term care facilities to create dedicated spaces for those who have tested positive for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Under his latest executive order, anyone diagnosed positive in a hospital and later admitted to a nursing home will be monitored and assessed for 14 days in a segregated area with other residents who tested positive.  Meanwhile, any residents of some long-term care facilities who either test negative or display no symptoms will be able to voluntarily transfer to facilities where there are no residents with the virus. Also, under Lamont’s plan, some nursing homes will house only infected individuals.  There also are plans to create space in nursing homes that have recently closed, as well. ___ DETAINED IMMIGRANTS Advocates for immigrants being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in New England rallied in Hartford on Thursday, arguing the detainees are being held in unsafe conditions because of the outbreak. A convoy of vehicles, decorated with protest signs, circled outside U.S. District Court in Hartford, honking horns and calling for ICE to free Connecticut residents being held in the Bristol County Correctional Center in Dartmouth, Massachusetts.  A lawsuit filed with the help Yale Law School’s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy clinic argues the inmates there are being kept in unsanitary bunk rooms where social distancing is not possible.  “The more people ICE continues to arrest, the greater likelihood that COVID-19 sweeps through Bristol County, if it is not there already,” said Megan Yan, a Yale law student intern working on the case. “This continued detention is unjust, inhumane and unconstitutional.” Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson has dismissed the suit as “completely frivolous.” ICE officials have said they continue “to maintain confidence” in the jail but declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit. ___ Associated Press writers Pat Eaton-Robb and Chris Ehrmann contributed to this report.

"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - The COVID-19 outbreak has reached into North Carolina’s Legislative Building, where a cafeteria employee tested positive for the virus, the building’s manager said. The unidentified worker was sent home March 26 after showing symptoms and received the positive test result Wednesday, Legislative Services Officer Paul Coble wrote to legislative staff. The cafeteria closed Wednesday indefinitely for cleaning. Employees working with the person have been asked to self-quarantine.  Snack bars at the building and at an adjoining office building were being cleaned and expected to reopen Thursday for takeout only, Coble wrote.  Legislative Building cafeteria patrons had not been prevented from sitting down to eat , although very few had done so in recent days, as legislative activities have been curtailed dramatically. In contrast, Gov. Roy Cooper’s March 17 executive order barred dining inside restaurants statewide.  Coble said in an email that Cooper’s restriction didn’t apply to the legislature’s eateries, citing “separation of powers” between state government’s three branches. The legislative branch, for example, can set rules for its operations. Regular government oversight committee meetings have been canceled at the legislative complex since mid-March, and workers have been allowed to telecommute.

"NEW YORK (AP) - Cooped up at her Bronx home with her daughter and a niece because of the coronavirus pandemic, Mexican writer Valeria Luiselli says she has lowered the “volume and speed” of her life. She is arranging books in alphabetical order, planting legumes on her balcony and listening to old recordings from Argentinian author Julio Cortázar. Her rhythm has slowed but not the accolades and awards for her latest novel, “Lost Children Archive,” which last week was honored with the British Rathbone Folio Prize. The book, Luiselli’s third novel, is part fiction part documentary: A family’s American road trip mixed with the stories of migrant children along the Mexico-U.S. border. Luiselli accepted the prize at a ceremony held online because of the global coronavirus outbreak. In a phone interview with The Associated Press, the 36-year-old writer said she’s sad that she could not be in London to receive it in person but grateful to see people keeping the faith in books. “The fact that the literary community is still in full swing, even from their homes, and behind their screens, is moving and encouraging,” she said, speaking in Spanish.  “I think it is my duty, and the duty of every writer, whether is a science-fiction writer, a journalist, a poet, each at their own pace and within their own capacities, to document this moment,” she said.  “Lost Children Archive” has also won the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction, an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award, and a Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Literature. It is a finalist for The National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction. Luiselli’s inspiration came from the immigration crisis of 2014, when thousands of children were trying to enter the U.S. in search of asylum, fleeing poverty and violence in Central America. The author said she started paying attention to how that story was being told, both in the media or at casual conversations in diners in Arizona. “I started asking myself how (the migrant) children of this generation were going to eventually tell this story, what were they going to say about this reality - that on one hand was very real but on the other seemingly implausible - about thousands of children in a migratory limbo,” she said. In New York, she started volunteering with nonprofits as an interpreter in immigration court, writing down the interviews she did with migrant children so attorneys could help them out. That experience led to an essay about immigration, “Tell Me How It Ends,” in 2017. “Lost Children Archive” came in February 2019. Born in Mexico City, Luiselli grew up in South Korea and South Africa, among others, because of her father’s work in nongovernmental organizations and later as a diplomat. She speaks both English and Spanish and can write in either language. In addition to writing during her seclusion, she’s reading out loud to her family and taking photos.  “We are going to need this narrative fabric, some sort of fabric for us to lay down once we overcome this.”  ",'Lost Children' author: Writers must 'document' pandemic,"Thursday, April 2, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/2/lost-children-author-writers-must-document-pandemi/,washington_times
"Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on Thursday formally asked President Trump to appoint a military officer to oversee the federal government’s role in procuring and distributing goods in response to the escalating coronavirus epidemic. Mr. Schumer said companies’ voluntary efforts to produce ventilators and equipment are welcomed but that America can’t rely on a “patchwork” system. “It is long past the time for your administration to designate a senior military officer to fix this urgent problem,” Mr. Schumer wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump. The president recently invoked the Defense Production Act to order General Motors to produce ventilators, but Mr. Schumer said the “full capacity” of American industry hasn’t yet been harnessed. “That officer should be given full authority under the Defense Production Act (DPA) to complete and rapidly implement a plan for the increased production, procurement and distribution of critically-needed medical devices and equipment,” the senator said. Mr. Schumer said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who Mr. Trump has put in charge of coordinating the government’s DPA efforts, is “woefully unqualified” for the task. “The existence of a separate ‘shadow’ effort elsewhere in the White House, led by equally inexperienced and unqualified people, has made the Administration’s response even more confused and uncoordinated,” he said. That could be a reference to reports that White House adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner has tried to take a more leading role in the federal response to COVID-19 in recent weeks. Mr. Trump had responded earlier to the call from Mr. Schumer, which the senator also made on MSNBC Thursday morning, by saying there already is a “military man” in charge of distributing goods. Navy Rear Adm. John Polowczyk is leading the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) supply chain task force. “Somebody please explain to Cryin’ Chuck Schumer that we do have a military man in charge of distributing goods, a very talented Admiral, in fact. New York has gotten far more than any other State, including hospitals & a hospital ship, but no matter what, always complaining,” the president said on Twitter. “It wouldn’t matter if you got ten times what was needed, it would never be good enough,” the president continued. “Unlike other states, New York unfortunately got off to a late start. You should have pushed harder. Stop complaining & find out where all of these supplies are going.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday she’s formed a bipartisan committee to oversee the funds allocated for the coronavirus response. “The panel will root out waste, fraud and abuse; it will protect against price-gauging, profiteering and political favoritism,” Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, told reporters on a press call. “We need transparency and accountability.” The bipartisan oversight panel, dubbed the House Select Committee on the Coronavirus, will be chaired by Majority Whip James Clyburn. The panel will have subpoena power to ensure that some of the new programs in the stimulus don’t lead to waste or fraud, Mrs. Pelosi said. But it won’t overlap with an after-action review panel that some members are already pushing for. “Where there’s money, there’s frequently mischief,”  she said. The last package passed by Congress cost $2.2 trillion for loans to hard-hit businesses, funds for overwhelmed state and local officials and direct payments to the American public.

"The Democratic National Committee said Thursday it is moving its presidential nominating convention to late August, postponing it about a month due to fears around the coronavirus. The convention in Milwaukee had been scheduled to take place July 13 to July 16. It will now start on Aug. 17. The coronavirus pandemic has prompted widespread cancellations of large gatherings, from sporting events to concerts and conferences. The convention fell into that category. “In our current climate of uncertainty, we believe the smartest approach is to take additional time to monitor how this situation unfolds so we can best position our party for a safe and successful convention,” said Joe Solmonese, CEO of the Democratic National Convention Committee. “During this critical time, when the scope and scale of the pandemic and its impact remain unknown, we will continue to monitor the situation and follow the advice of health care professionals and emergency responders.” The Republican convention to renominate President Trump is scheduled to be held in Charlotte from Aug. 24-27.

"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich predicted Thursday that President Trump would be remembered by future generations as a “historic figure” for his response to the coronavirus crisis. “He is extraordinarily energetic. He is learning at an extraordinary pace,” Mr. Gingrich told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “And he’s an historic figure, and I think that by the time this is over, as he defeats the virus, pivots and relaunches the economy, people will realize how important it was that we had Donald Trump at this moment in American history.” At the same time, Mr. Gingrich blasted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for saying Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that “as the president fiddles, people are dying,” calling her “despicable.” “I think Pelosi has become despicable,” Mr. Gingrich said. “I think that her comment the other day comparing President Trump to Nero fiddling while Rome burned was just utterly, totally irresponsible, dishonest, and counter to what Americans need.” The Republican commentator and author was interviewed by phone from Rome, where he and his wife Callista Gingrich, the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, are waiting out the COVID-19 pandemic. Italy has been devastated by the novel coronavirus, with 110,574 cases and 13,155 deaths as of Thursday morning but Mr. Gingrich said he believed the situation may be improving. “It looks like the Italians may actually be very close to turning the corner,” he said. “The number of new cases has been going down for the last week or so, and they’re still going, there’s still new cases, but it’s not nearly as bad as it was a few weeks ago.” Day 21 — lockdown in Italy with @newtgingrich.

"Democratic frontrunner Joseph R. Biden, in blaming President Trump for rising unemployment Thursday, said the U.S. “has more coronavirus cases than anywhere in the world.” His comment came despite a U.S. intelligence community report shared with the White House that has concluded China concealed the extent of its outbreak by underreporting both its total cases and deaths. “Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation: for the months during which he continually neglected dire warnings from experts and downplayed the threat to us, and for the erratic and unacceptably slow federal response that has tragically lagged behind other countries,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. “Now we have more coronavirus cases than anywhere in the world, and that is dealing body-blows to our economy and to the welfare and well-being of millions upon millions of Americans.” The U.S. had more than 216,000 cases of COVID-19 as of Thursday, compared with more than 82,000 in China, according to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus resource center’s tracker. China had more than 3,300 deaths, a number widely disputed, compared with more 5,100 deaths in the U.S. The Labor Department said Thursday that unemployment claims soared to 6.6 million last week, a record that was double the previous week’s record, as the pandemic forced the shutdown of businesses across the country. Mr. Trump said Wednesday that he’d be happy to take a phone call from Mr. Biden offering advice on fighting the outbreak. The Trump campaign said the president “is leading the nation through the coronavirus crisis.”“But Joe Biden has decided to fill the role of the opposition, ineffectively sniping from the sidelines, stumbling through television interviews, and hoping for relevance and political gain,” said campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh. “Americans are facing a public health emergency and are worried about their jobs and the economy, but Joe Biden’s record and proposals prove that he is ill-suited for a role in this fight.” Mr. Murtaugh said Mr. Biden “oversaw the most sluggish economic recovery this country has seen since World War II” while vice president. “He supported disastrous, job-killing trade deals like NAFTA and TPP and his proposal to enact the economy-strangling Green New Deal as a response to this crisis is about the worst remedy imaginable,” he said. “On top of that, Biden has pledged to eliminate the Trump tax cuts, which cut taxes for the vast majority of American taxpayers.” He said Mr. Trump “has been hard at work, negotiating the relief package for unemployed workers and affected businesses and leading in this time of crisis.” “The president’s policies drove the American economy to the greatest heights in half a century, and he is the best person to lead us through this difficult period,” Mr. Murtaugh said.

"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - The COVID-19 outbreak has reached into North Carolina’s Legislative Building, where a cafeteria employee tested positive for the virus, the building’s manager said. The unidentified worker was sent home March 26 after showing symptoms and received the positive test result Wednesday, Legislative Services Officer Paul Coble wrote to legislative staff. The cafeteria closed Wednesday indefinitely for cleaning. Employees working with the person have been asked to self-quarantine.  Snack bars at the building and at an adjoining office building were being cleaned and expected to reopen Thursday for takeout only, Coble wrote.  Legislative Building cafeteria patrons had not been prevented from sitting down to eat, although very few had done so in recent days, as legislative activities have been curtailed dramatically. In contrast, Gov. Roy Cooper’s March 17 executive order barred dining inside restaurants statewide.  Coble said in an email that Cooper’s restriction didn’t apply to the legislature’s eateries, citing “separation of powers” between state government’s three branches. The legislative branch, for example, can set rules for its operations. Regular government oversight committee meetings have been canceled at the legislative complex since mid-March, and workers have been allowed to telecommute. The General Assembly is supposed to convene April 28.

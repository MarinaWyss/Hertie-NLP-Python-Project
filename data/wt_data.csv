"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic-controlled House, with President Trump’s support, early Saturday passed a bill to provide free testing for the coronavirus, as well as paid sick and family leave, strengthened unemployment insurance and increased food aid to ease the hardship on families. The vote was 363-40. The legislation will be taken up by the Senate next week. It would require paid leave for workers who contract the virus or who care for those who do and additional food aid for the poor and senior citizens. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, it causes more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus. The legislation includes: FREE CORONAVIRUS TESTING It requires private health insurance plans to provide free coronavirus testing and waives cost-sharing rules for testing provided to people covered by Medicare, Medicaid and federal retirement programs. Another $1 billion is provided to test people without health insurance. It boosts federal matching funds to state Medicaid programs by 6.2% to ease the financial strain on states. PAID SICK/FAMILY LEAVE It establishes a temporary coronavirus-related sick leave benefit paid by employers with fewer than 500 workers. Workers with the coronavirus would receive 100% or their wages if they have the coronavirus or are self-isolating and two-thirds of their pay when caring for family members. The benefit would expire in January 2021. It also permits 12 weeks of job-protected family or medical leave at two-thirds pay, though the first 14 days of the extended leave would be unpaid. In both cases, businesses would be reimbursed by the federal government through a refundable tax credit. FOOD AID It provides $1.3 billion in emergency food aid for low-income pregnant women and their young children, senior citizens and food banks. It allows states to provide food stamps to make up for lost school lunch benefits if their children are kept home from school and directs $100 million of the funds to U.S. territories. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak are already eligible for unemployment benefits, but the legislation provides $1 billion for additional caseloads and administrative costs to encourage temporarily furloughed workers to obtain unemployment benefits. PROTECTION FOR FIRST RESPONDERS The Occupational Safety and Health Administration would be required to issue a temporary rule requiring increased protections against the coronavirus.

"The federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., granted a request by House Democrats Friday to rehear cases over testimony from former White House Counsel Don McGahn and funds for President Trump’s border wall. Both cases are scheduled to be argued before the full circuit court on April 28. Democratic lawmakers in Congress have argued the president violated federal law by reallocating more than $8 billion from the Department of Defense to build the border wall. They also claim Mr. Trump abused his authority by denying the lawmakers from receiving testimony from Mr. McGahn during the impeachment inquiry.

"The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is calling on the Trump administration to “admit” that its ongoing pressure campaign against Iran is not working. The comments from Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, came just days after Iranian-backed military group Kata’ib Hezbollah launched an attack on a base north of Baghdad that killed two U.S. service members and one British soldier and wounded 14 others. The U.S. responded Thursday evening with airstrikes on five of the group’s weapons storage facilities that the Pentagon says “will degrade Kata’ib Hezbollah’s ability to conduct future strikes.” In a statement Friday evening, Mr. Menendez, the ranking member of the committee, said “that in attributing Wednesday’s attacks to Iranian-backed militia groups, the Trump Administration must admit its efforts to deter Iranian aggression are failing and American service members are paying the ultimate sacrifice.” The escalation in tension between Washington and Tehran quickly resurfaced just as the House approved a war powers resolution aimed at limiting the president’s authority to use force against Iran without explicit congressional approval. The bill — while expected to be vetoed by President Trump — “directs the President to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces for hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran or any part of its government or military, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force against Iran.” Mr. Menendez highlighted the bipartisan support for the resolution that allowed it to be approved by the Republican-held Senate and said this majority “has made clear it does not support an unnecessary war with Iran.”  ",Menendez calls on Trump to admit Iranian deterrence efforts are failing,"Friday, March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/13/menendez-calls-on-trump-to-admit-iranian-deterrenc/,washington_times
"In his quest to regain a Senate seat he once held, Jeff Sessions may have lost the endorsement he most coveted — the president’s — but he is racking up stamps of approval from many players in the conservative establishment. On Friday, the National Rifle Association backed Mr. Sessions’ bid to return to the Senate, an uphill fight in which the former attorney general trailed one time Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville in the March 3 primary. The two are now heading into a March 31 Republican runoff. The NRA’s backing came just two days after President Trump gave Mr. Tuberville his enthusiastic endorsement, driving a final stake through any pretension Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions maintained a political alliance or friendship. In Mr. Trump’s eyes, Mr. Sessions committed an unforgivable betrayal when, shortly after he got the attorney general position, he recused himself from the investigation into fraudulent charges the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. That led to the appointment of a special prosecutor who packed his office with supporters of Hillary Clinton and generally haunted the first three years of the Trump administration. No evidence of collusion was ever found. Nevertheless, the Sessions campaign has crafted itself as Trump loyalists, all behind a conservative lawmaker who could advance the president’s agenda better than a political neophyte and Alabama carpetbagger like Mr. Tuberville. “Powerful, well-funded national forces are bent on destroying our right to keep and bear arms,” Mr. Sessions said. “Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are working day and night to gut the Second Amendment. I have fought Schumer and Pelosi on this issue, and I have won, and I will do so again when I return to the Senate. “Alabama cannot afford to send an untested, unproven, weak-kneed greenhorn to the Senate who will get run over by Schumer and Pelosi,” Mr. Sessions added. Jason Ouimet, who heads the NRA’s Political Victory Fund, said endorsing Mr. Sessions was an easy choice. “Based on your strong leadership on Second Amendment issues as a U.S. senator and U.S. attorney general, you have earned the highest attainable rating, an A+ from NRA-PVF,” Mr. Ouimet said in the announcement. The winner of the Tuberville-Sessions runoff will face Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in November. Mr. Jones, who rode to office on a tide of out-of-state money in a 2017 special election to replace Mr. Sessions, is rated the most vulnerable senate incumbent by most political analysts. The myriad endorsements Mr. Sessions has collected reflect how the conservative establishment trusts him after he spent decades in Washington as a rock-ribbed Republican. Earlier this week, Mr. Sessions garnered support from the Eagle Forum PAC, which joined the endorsements from the Family Research Council PAC, the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, the Alabama Forestry Association and several conservative luminaries in the Yellowhammer state. But the establishment’s muscle may be hard pressed to push Mr. Sessions over the hurdle of Mr. Trump’s endorsement of his opponent, and the fact the March 3 primary saw a plurality of voters prefer either Mr. Tuberville or Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne who finished third.

"Count Sen. Bernie Sanders among the people who think President Trump should get tested for the coronavirus. During a press conference in Burlington, Vt., Mr. Sanders was asked whether Mr. Trump should get tested and release those results after reportedly  being around people who have been diagnosed with the virus. “I would,” Mr. Sanders said. “To the best of my knowledge I have not been in proximity to somebody who had the virus. If I knew that I was, I would get tested, and I think that holds true for the president.” During a press conference at The White House Friday, Mr. Trump said he sees no reason for that to happen because he has not exhibited symptoms of COVID-19.

"President Trump declared a national emergency to deal with the new coronavirus that’s swept the globe and hit the U.S., saying states will get federal money and face fewer obstacles in testing and caring for patients. “Two very big words,” Mr. Trump said from the White House Rose Garden. “No resource will be spared, nothing whatsoever.” The designation will invoke the Stafford Act and extend up to $50 billion in aid to states and municipalities. He also ordered states to activate emergency-operation plans. Mr. Trump said he is temporarily waiving interest on student loans held by federal entities and that he directed the Department of Energy to buy up oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Also, his administration will give hospitals and health centers the flexibility to see patients from afar through telehealth and waive certain licensing requirements, so doctors can’t help areas that need them. He’s also waiving restrictions that limit the number of hospital beds in each facility or the length of a patient’s stay. Mr. Trump also revealed he plans to be tested for the virus.

"The White House reached a sweeping agreement with congressional Democrats late Friday on a bill to provide relief to workers hurt by the coronavirus outbreak. “We are proud to have reached  an agreement with the Administration to resolve outstanding challenges,  and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act,”  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to her colleagues. After some last-minute wrangling, President Trump tweeted his support for the measure shortly before 9 p.m., clearing the way for a bipartisan vote. “This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers,” Mr. Trump said. “I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt.” He added, “I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES! I will always put the health and well-being of American families FIRST. Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!” Mrs. Pelosi had a dozen conversations with Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin throughout the day as they negotiated the details. The package includes free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured; two  weeks of guaranteed paid sick leave, as well as increased family leave;  increased spending on  unemployment benefits; more money to provide  school lunches to students whose schools are closed; and an increase in  Medicaid funding. Mr. Trump had been pushing for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year, but Democrats opposed it. Getting the White House’s approval means the Republican-controlled Senate would likely approve the measure sometime next week. Lawmakers are planning to take up an even larger emergency response bill on the coronavirus in the weeks ahead. Congress has already approved an $8.3 billion measure to help states with their initial emergency health care responses.

"Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont said the coronavirus crisis is exposing gaps in the nation’s “cruel” and “dysfunctional” health care system that leaves millions of people without coverage when they need it most and millions of others more susceptible to contracting the virus. Mr. Sanders said the virus is helping the public come to grips with the fact that it is time to make fundamental changes to the economy and health care system that lifts up the working-class, calling for paid family leave, overhauled trade deals and a guarantee of health coverage. “In my view, the most cost-effective way to reform our dysfunctional and cruel system is to move to a Medicare for All single-payer health care system and I think in the midst of this crisis more and more Americans understand the truth of that,” Mr. Sanders said at a press conference in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont. “It is nearly impossible to believe that anyone can still think it is acceptable to continue with a health care system that leaves tens of millions of people uninsured.” “The cruelty and absurdity of that view is more obvious in the midst of this crisis,” he said. “Let’s be clear, the lack of health care and affordable medicine does not only threaten the health and well-being of the uninsured, it impacts everyone who comes in contact with them. In fact, what this crisis is beginning to teach us is that we are only as safe as the least insured person in America.” Fears over the virus have changed the contours of the 2020 presidential race, with Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden taking the advice of health officials and deciding against holding campaign rallies and events with large numbers of people. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden are set to appear in their first one-on-one debate Sunday. Citing concerns over coronavirus, the Democratic National Committee and the event sponsors, CNN and Univision, announced the debate would be moved from Phoenix to Washington, D.C., and that there would be no live audience. Consequently, Mr. Sanders has relied on getting his message out at press conferences this week that have been streamed online and picked up by cable news networks. On Friday, Mr. Sanders said public health officials, doctors, and scientists should lead the response to the virus  - not politicians. The federal government must dramatically increase the availability of test kits, intensive care units, and doctors and medical personnel needed to combat the virus, while making sure the frontline workers are protected, he said. Mr. Sanders said the nation must take stock of the mistakes the government has made responding to the virus and what moves can be made to the federal government to make sure people are better equipped to face future challenges. Mr. Sanders drove home the point that he expects support for universal health care to increase and lamented how the nation’s trade deals have sent jobs overseas and made the nation reliant on foreign countries such as China for the supplies it needs to combat this sort of crisis. “People who are sick today, who woke up with symptoms of the coronavirus are saying, ‘You know I feel sick, but I can’t afford to go to a doctor,’ and when somebody is not treated for the virus, somebody who is unable to afford to go to that doctor, that means that the infection can spread to many others, putting us at risk,” Mr. Sanders said. “Now the lack of health insurance for many millions of people threatens other people as well.”  ","America ‘only as safe as the least insured person,’ Sanders says regarding coronavirus emergency","Friday, March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-only-safe-least-insured-bernie-sanders/,washington_times
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats will vote later Friday on a coronavirus relief package, with or without the support of the White House. “The American people expect and deserve a coordinated, science-based and whole-of-government response to keep them and their loved ones safe,” Mrs. Pelosi said at the Capitol. But she didn’t answer a reporter’s question about whether President Trump supports the bill. The president wants a cut in payroll taxes through the end of the year; Democrats haven’t included it in the measure. Mr. Trump said later that the White House was still negotiating with Democrats, but he wasn’t pleased with the bill. “We just don’t think they’re giving enough,” the president said. “They’re not doing what’s right for the country. We thought we had something, but all of a sudden they didn’t agree to certain things they had agreed to.” The package would make coronavirus testing free for everyone who needs it, allow for two weeks of paid sick leave and provide unemployment insurance for furloughed workers. “We can only defeat this outbreak if we have an accurate determination of its scale and scope, so that we can pursue the precise science-based response that is necessary to put families first,” Mrs. Pelosi said. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin has been negotiating nearly round the clock with Mrs. Pelosi on the bill. They spoke eight times on Friday alone.

"NEW ORLEANS — Louisiana postponed its scheduled presidential primary by two months Friday in response to the ongoing coronavirus health crisis, officials said.Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced the primary, slated to be held on April 4, will now be June 20.Mr. Ardoin is expected to provide more details at a press conference later Friday. While major professional and college sports events, along with many college campuses, have shut down, Louisiana is the first political event to be postponed because of the virus. The state had 33 presumptive cases of coronavirus as of Friday morning, with the biggest cluster of those — 23 — being New Orleans. Many of Louisiana’s Election Day commissioners are 65 or older, and to date the coronavirus has been most lethal to the elderly. In addition, 32 polling locations are in nursing homes of senior facilities, according to the secretary of state’s office. “This decision has been made out of an absolute abundance of caution for Louisiana’s voters, voting officials and the general public as a whole,” Mr. Ardoin said. The primary was formally switched when Mr. Ardoin’s request to move it to June 20 was approved by Gov. John Bel Edwards. Although it does not appear to have moved voting days because of health scares in the past, Louisiana has altered its election schedule because of major hurricanes and natural disasters, officials said.

"Sen. Bob Casey took a shot at the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus, saying Americans would have better luck purchasing a semi-automatic rifle than they would tracking down a test kit for the virus. “Right now in America, it is easier to get an AR-15 than a test kit for COVID-19,” the Pennsylvania Democrat said on Twitter. President Trump and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been widely-criticized for being too slow to react to the spread of the infection. On Friday, Mr. Trump has shifted the blame for the shortage of test kits onto the Obama administration and the CDC, arguing they left the nation unprepared for this sort of outbreak. A week ago, Mr. Trump said that, “Anyone who wants a test can get a test” and Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said there is “no testing kit shortage.” Democrats on Capitol Hill have vehemently disagreed.

"The coronavirus has started to infect more and more political ads — particularly attacks targeting Republicans on health care. Advertising Analytics, an independent ad tracking firm, highlighted the recent uptick in coronavirus-related ads in its weekly recap, pointing out that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was the first to run a pair of COVID-19-related television spots in his short-lived 2020 campaign, and outside groups aligned with Democrats have since followed in his footsteps. Fair Fight Action, a voting rights group created by former Georgia state Rep. Stacey Abrams, has accused Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who defeated Ms. Abrams in the state’s 2018 gubernatorial race, of seeking to “blow up” programs that “keep Georgia Safe.” “Kemp is proposing blowing up our criminal justice system, cutting millions of dollars, blowing up job training programs, blowing up mental health services blowing up health care funding for every Georgia county as coronavirus hits our state,” the narrator says in the ad. Sen. Steve Daines, Republican Montana, was the target of a coronavirus-inspired attack ad from Protect Our Care, a liberal health care group that advocates for Obamacare. “Too many Montana families go to sleep at night worried about health care — coverage, costs, now the fear of coronavirus,” the narrator says in the ad. “That doesn’t worry. Steve Daines.” The Health Care Education Project, meanwhile, is accusing President Trump in an ad of trying to cut health care that people will need to protect themselves from the virus. “Now Trump wants billions more health care cuts when we need it most,” the narrator says over a screenshot of Mr. Trump and a news headline “CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK.” It then pivots to a video clip from a press conference in which New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says, “There has to be a play where you don’t play politics.” “It has to end somewhere, and it should end with health care,” the Democrat says.

"The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee moved forward with a subpoena against a lobbying shop for records relating to the work former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s son, Hunter, did for a Ukrainian energy firm. The committee suddenly shifted its attention to Blue Star Strategies earlier this week instead of its former consultant, Andrii Telizhenko, who turned to conservative talk radio to make his case. Sen. Ron Johnson, committee chairman, notified his Democratic colleagues on Thursday that he was sending a subpoena to Blue Star for records of its work on behalf of Burisma Holdings, the firm connected to Hunter Biden. Mr. Johnson’s letter indicates he also wants Blue Star’s CEO and chief operating officer to testify before his committee. Lawmakers were expected to vote in committee on Wednesday to issue a subpoena to Mr. Telizhenko, but Mr. Johnson abruptly shifted course to focus directly on Blue Star itself. Mr. Johnson has reiterated the decision was made based upon the suggestion of “both Democrat and Republican members of our committee.” Mr. Telizhenko still wants to have his voice heard, and appeared on conservative radio host Glenn Beck’s program on Thursday. Mr. Telizhenko said he did not want to speak about Blue Star until he felt threatened and heard that if Mr. Biden wins the presidency Mr. Telizhenko may no longer be welcome in the United States. “I have emails, communications, with Blue Star Strategies throughout the time I worked for them, before and after, that I wanted to share with the Senate, which is relevant for the investigation,” Mr. Telizhenko told Glenn Beck. “There’s no Russia collusion here, it’s just documents.” Mr. Telizhenko said his information is covered by a nondisclosure agreement, which is why he cannot voluntarily turn his information over to the Senate in the absence of the issuance of a subpoena. No hearing has yet been scheduled for the testimony of Blue Star executives.

"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who had dinner with President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence last weekend, said Friday his second test for the coronavirus was negative. Mr. Bolsonaro made the announcement on his Facebook page after a major daily newspaper in Brazil reported that his first test was positive. His son Eduardo, a lawmaker who was also on the trip, told Fox News that his father’s initial test was positive. Eduardo Bolsonaro tweeted Thursday that Mr. Bolsonaro was tested but was “not exhibiting any symptoms of the disease.” The populist Brazilian leader has developed a bond with Mr. Trump and met with the president Saturday at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Mr. Bolsonaro’s top press aide, who also attended the meetings with Mr. Trump, also has tested positive for the virus. The White House said Thursday that Mr. Trump hasn’t been tested, and the president said he was not concerned about being in close proximity to someone with the virus. Mr. Bolsonaro was wearing a surgical mask Thursday while carrying out his official duties in Brazil.

"House Majority Whip James Clyburn said he considers President Trump to be a racist and that the U.S. “could very well go the way of Germany in the 1930s,” Axios reported Friday. Mr. Clyburn, South Carolina Democrat, made the remarks in a recent interview scheduled to air this weekend on the “Axios on HBO” cable program, the news site reported. “I used to wonder, how could the people of Germany allow Hitler to exist? But with each passing day, I’m beginning to understand how. And that’s why I’m trying to sound the alarm,” Mr. Clyburn said in an excerpt released ahead of the episode airing. The third-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives and one of the most influential congressmen on Capitol Hill, Mr. Clyburn has been frequently critical of Mr. Trump and his policies as president. Mr. Clyburn endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden right before South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary. The congressman has also previously drawn parallels between Mr. Trump and former Nazi leader Adolf Hitler on more than one occasion. “Having studied history and having taught history, I can only equate one period of time with what we are experiencing now and that was what was going on in Germany around 1934 right after the 1932 elections when Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor,” Mr. Clyburn said during a CNN interview in January 2018. “When I see and hear and experience what’s going on in the country today, I think back to that time, and I really believe that we as Americans had better get a handle on things. If we don’t, we could very well see ourselves going the way of Germany,” he said at the time. More recently, Mr. Clyburn reiterated that warning while speaking to NBC News last March. “Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor of Germany. And he went about the business of discrediting institutions to the point that people bought into” it,” Mr. Clyburn said last year. “Nobody would have believed it now. But swastikas hung in churches throughout Germany. We had better be very careful.” The full version of the recent interview with Mr. Clyburn will air Sunday on HBO, Axios reported.

"PHOENIX (AP) - Maria Chavira, a senior administrator in the Diocese of Phoenix, says Spanish-speaking Catholic parishes in her area are “bursting at the seams” and celebrates the emergence of Hispanics as the largest ethnic component of the church nationwide. Throughout the Southwest, where the surge has been dramatic, Roman Catholic leaders are excited by the possibilities - and well aware of daunting challenges.  Hispanics now account for 40% of all U.S. Catholics, and a solid majority of school-age Catholics. Yet Hispanic Americans are strikingly underrepresented in Catholic schools and in the priesthood - accounting for less than 19% of Catholic school enrollment and only about 3% of U.S.-based priests.  In the Phoenix diocese, there are than 700,000 Hispanics out of a total of 1.2 million Catholics. Yet out of more than 200 priests, Catholic researchers counted only seven American-born Hispanics.  Extensive efforts are under way to narrow the demographic gaps. They have been highlighted in a nearly completed four-year study  by U.S. Catholic bishops seeking to strengthen the church’s engagement with Hispanics.  ”We have a lot of opportunities,” said Chavira, who oversees the Hispanic Mission Office and other departments in the Phoenix diocese. “There may be a little turbulence ahead, but we’re going to make it.”  Chavira is among more than two dozen Catholic leaders and activists who shared their thoughts about the Hispanic Catholic phenomenon with The Associated Press, some in telephone interviews and others face-to-face during a reporting trip to Arizona and Texas’ Rio Grande Valley.  Evidence of the change can be seen each December, when thousands of Hispanic Catholics dance and march in downtown Phoenix to celebrate Our Lady of Guadalupe. It can be seen in fast-growing, heavily Hispanic communities in Phoenix’s western suburbs.  Nationwide, more than 1,200 Catholic schools have closed in the past decade, usually under financial stress. Yet in the suburb of Avondale, enrollment is surging at a handsome new Catholic high school.  The school, named for Pope John Paul II, opened in 2018. About 70% of its 220 students are Hispanic; plans call for rapid expansion to accommodate an enrollment of 1,000.  “We’re serving people who’ve been underserved in this nation,” said the principal, Sister Mary Jordan Hoover. “These young people are trying to learn to be the next teachers, the next administrators, writers, doctors. They’re dreaming big.”  The hopefulness contrasts with circumstances in some other regions. Hundreds of parishes have closed in the Northeast and Midwest. The clergy sex abuse scandal has forced more than 20 dioceses across the U.S. into bankruptcy since 2004, most recently in the Northeast. The scandals haven’t spared the Southwest. The dioceses in Tucson, Arizona, and in Santa Fe and Gallup, New Mexico, are among those that declared bankruptcy. But in states along the Mexico border, past scandals don’t diminish the excitement over a future Hispanic-accented Catholic church. More than 400 new parishes have opened since 1970 in the border states, and many Hispanic Catholics were elated by the recent election of Mexican-born Los Angeles Archbishop José Gómez as the first Hispanic president of the bishops’ conference.  “It’s the tale of two churches,” said Hosffman Ospino, a professor of Hispanic ministry at Boston College. “In Boston, I see a Catholicism that’s very reserved. In the Southwest it’s very public, very expressive.”  A major challenge for the Catholic hierarchy: persuading more Hispanic young men to become priests.  An example of that challenge: 30-year-old Diego Piña Lopez of Tucson. He’s devoted his life to the Catholic tenet of supporting the dignity of all people, including asylum seekers who visit Casa Alitas, the Catholic-run shelter in Tucson where he works.  Growing up, he sometimes considered becoming a priest, but opted instead to pursue graduate degrees in social work and public health. Why not the priesthood? “I wanted to have a family,” he said.  By the latest count of the bishops’ conference, there are about 37,300 U.S.-based priests. Among them are roughly 3,000 Hispanics - more than 2,000 of them foreign-born.  One problem, said Ospino, is that Hispanics in the U.S. have lagged behind other groups in regard to college-level education, limiting the pool of young men qualified for seminary.  But even as the second and third generations of many Hispanic immigrant families do pursue higher education, other factors are at play.  “With those generations, there’s extremely heavy pressure to think more about economic success than the glory of God,” said Daniel Flores, bishop of Brownsville, Texas. “We need to teach them the concept of service, rather than you need to earn as much as you can.”  Overall enrollment in Catholic schools in the U.S. has plummeted in recent decades, from more than 5.2 million in the 1960s to about 1.73 million this year. Of the current students, only 18.5% are Hispanic.  Experts cite several reasons. Many Hispanics in the U.S. come from Latin American countries where private schools, including Catholic ones, are viewed as bastions of the wealthy. With tuition averaging more than $5,000 for elementary grades and $10,000 for high school, Catholic education in the U.S. seems unaffordable to many families. And many Catholic schools are losing students to charter schools which are able to access government funds for their operations.  All these factors are present in the Brownsville, diocese, where Catholic school enrollment has dropped sharply in recent years in the face of tougher competition from charter and public schools.  One of the elementary schools fighting to maintain its enrollment is St. Mary’s Catholic School. Its principal, Ana Gomez, says 95% of her 350 students are Hispanic. She’s been able to keep enrollment stable with strategies taught by the Latino Enrollment Initiative, a program based at Notre Dame University. Tactics include ensuring that schools are culturally in sync with Hispanic families, and helping parents fit tuition into their budgets. About 80 St. Mary’s students now get some financial aid, Gomez said.  While the Hispanic population in the U.S. is sure to grow, the extent of the Catholic Church’s hold on them is uncertain. Last year, the Pew Research Center reported that U.S. Hispanics are no longer a majority-Catholic group, with 47% of them calling themselves Catholic, down from 57% in 2009. The number identifying as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” increased from 16% to 23%; those identifying as Protestant rose from 23% to 26%.  Melba Salazar-Lucio, a professor and migrant-rights activist in Brownsville, says today’s Catholic Church seems too rigid for many Hispanics. Her mother no longer attends church, she said, and her three grown children are no longer practicing Catholics.  “There are other denominations - they have more music, younger pastors who are more accepting of people’s ways,” Salazar-Lucio said. “The Catholic church is not going to be changing with the times.”  At a migrant outreach center in Nogales, Mexico, abutting the Arizona border, Jesuit priest Sean Carroll ministers every day to asylum seekers who dream of joining the ranks of Hispanic Catholics in the U.S.  “They are bringing their culture, their gifts,” he said. “The challenge for the church is to be open to receiving those gifts. How do we get them to see themselves as leaders? How do we get them to feel at home?”  ___  Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

"BAGHDAD (AP) - At the once bustling hub of the largest anti-government protest movement in Iraq’s modern history, crowds have dwindled, and donation boxes have sprouted up. Loudspeakers resound with calls by activists for funds to keep their hard-fought revolution alive.  The six-month-old movement has faced one setback after another, from the shifting positions of a mercurial Shiite cleric to an apathetic political class and, now, fears over an outbreak of the coronavirus  that Iraq’s decrepit health system has struggled to contain, with nearly 93 confirmed cases and nine deaths.  Where once Baghdad’s Tahrir Square had seen thousands every day, now only a few hundred protesters turn up. Morale has been dampened among young Iraqis who first took to the streets on Oct. 1 to decry rampant government corruption, poor services and unemployment.  Protesters have found it difficult to revive the strength of their leaderless movement after scoring victories early on, like pressuring lawmakers to pass a key electoral reform bill and forcing former Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi to step down. Assassinations, abductions and threats targeting prominent protesters have contributed to blunting the momentum.  A looming economic crisis linked to the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing political dysfunction could eventually bring a new jolt that inspires Iraqis back to the streets. But for the moment, the movement is looking at what went wrong. The difficulties of recent months caused the poles of authority among protesters to shift from the capital to the south, while some say shunning any form of central leadership was a mistake. In Tahrir Square, a group of young men recently shared a hookah pipe under a tarp by a tunnel replete with the wall art of their revolution. Together, they embodied the spirit that first brought many into Iraq’s central squares to protest. Marwan Ali, 23, had attended university to study communication but could only find work as a barber after graduation. Mohammed Abbas, 19, didn’t bother pursuing a higher education, convinced it wouldn’t secure a job. So in October he picked up a banner and joined the movement.  Hussein al-Hind, 22, was a teenager when he heeded a call by Iraq’s top Shiite cleric to take up arms and defeat the Islamic State group with what would later become the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Forces. He soon became disenchanted as his one-time war heroes joined the ranks of the political class by running in the May 2018 election.  The young men have also suffered the violence that has met the movement. Al-Hind showed off two bullet wounds from clashes with riot police; Abbas was detained by police for three days early on in the demonstrations; Ali’s family has received messages from unknown groups threatening his life.  Now, the future of their hard-fought protest movement depends on the ability of these youth to keep to the streets. When the conversation turned to the state of their movement, Marwan Ali took a moment’s pause.  “We are disappointed,” he said. Asked why he was still coming to Tahrir, he said, “This isn’t about the homeland anymore, we are here for the blood of our martyrs.” Over 500 people have been killed since October under fire by security forces who have used live ammunition, tear gas and recently pellet guns to disperse crowds.  In nearby Khilani Square, clashes still rage between a core group of protesters and security, with at least two demonstrators dead last week.  The movement was dealt a blow in January after radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who also heads a major political bloc, withdrew support after elites selected a prime minister candidate he backed, Mohammed Allawi. Al-Sadr’s reversal instilled a climate of fear in the square as militiamen affiliated with his group, which once protected protest sites, intimidated demonstrators who refused to back Allawi, activists said. Allawi has since withdrawn from the post. “We were tools in al-Sadr’s game,” said Kamal Jaban, an activist.  It was an eventuality that activists said they wanted to avoid when al-Sadr’s followers first joined the movement.  As early as November, protesters bristled at the question of leadership and were quick to diminish the credibility of those making claims of authority over them. They tore down stages built by political parties in protest plazas, fearing the fate of previous grassroots movements that fizzled out when co-opted by political actors.  Three months since, protesters said in hindsight the lack of core leadership had hobbled their movement, enabling figures like al-Sadr to do exactly what they had feared.  “There is no one to represent us, put pressure on the government,” said Ali, under the tarp in Tahrir.  Al-Sadr’s move also diminished Tahrir Square’s status as the central voice of the movement. Activists started looking to Haboubi Square in the southern city of Nasiriya for orders. Nasiriya’s protesters have been resilient against infiltration by political parties, partly due to support from local tribes.  In hindsight, said Ali, this weakened the movement.  “Tahrir Square became tainted with al-Sadr supporters,” he explained. “At first Nasiriya was listening to us, now we listen to them.”  It was Nasiriya that gave political elites a deadline to make progress on protester demands, prompting an escalation in demonstrations across the country. Later, calls from the southern city led protesters in Baghdad to block the strategic Mohammed al-Qassim highway. When Haboubi Square raised the image of activist Alaa Rikabi as their choice for prime minister, Tahrir did the same.  Other protesters said fatigue from months on the street was taking a toll as donations for food and supplies were running short and temperatures dropped over the winter. “Weak turnout was expected some time ago because the protesters who have been here for five months are tired, sleeping in cold and far from wor¬¬k, their families and school,” said Murtada Emad, a protester and university student at Babil College of Basic Education. “I left school, but my family is pressuring me to go back.” By February, protesters were marginalized as political bickering over Allawi’s government formation ignored the core demands of the street. Allawi withdrew as prime minister-designate on March 1 after failing to secure parliamentary support for his Cabinet.  Back in Tahrir, Ali Jumaili, 22, said all hope was not lost.  “Every day, I sit on the sidewalk with my friends and weep because of the weakening demonstrations,” he said. “The revolution will repeat itself with more vigor in the future.”  ",Iraq's protesters struggle to keep waning movement going,"Saturday, March 14, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/iraqs-protesters-struggle-to-keep-waning-movement-/,washington_times
"BEIJING (AP) - Courtney Huang fell in love with the U.S. as a nursing student in Texas. She ended up staying 13 years and wants to become a U.S. citizen. But Huang now finds her job, future, and dreams of citizenship on the line since the Trump administration barred entry last month to non-U.S. citizens and residents flying in from China over the coronavirus outbreak. With crucial deadlines looming, her plans look increasingly at risk. “I’m really scared,” Huang said. “I have a lot there. If I don’t go back, it’s just going to be very difficult.” The U.S. suspended visa processing in China on Feb. 3, citing limited staffing during the virus outbreak. No deadline extensions have been announced and it’s not known when the suspension will be lifted. That’s put hundreds of Chinese citizens applying for U.S. work visas in limbo, fretting as their jobs look increasingly at risk. Huang had returned to China to see her parents over the Lunar New Year holiday in late January. She had recently landed a new job in California and her work visa was on the verge of approval when the American Consulate in Shanghai announced it was returning everyone’s passports. After weeks of fretting and weighing her options at her parent’s home in eastern China, Huang flew to Thailand. She now plans to wait out a mandated 14-day self-quarantine before seeing if she can get her visa from the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok. Though Huang was born and raised in China, her whole life is now in Oakland, California, where she has an apartment, car, friends and job. With her Christian faith and gregarious, outspoken manner, the U.S. feels like home. “I feel like I fit in better there. Free speech, free religion,” Huang said. Clean air, better career opportunities for women and a liberal social environment were also draws, she added. Huang obtained a nursing degree in Texas, then a master’s degree in bioengineering from U.C. Berkeley. She’s on the verge of completing an M.B.A., with an eye toward settling permanently. Now, Huang is concerned those plans could fall apart. Though her new employers, a company that provides clinical support for physicians, are understanding, Huang worries that as the months go by, there’s a possibility she may lose her job - and with it, her right to work in the U.S. Like Huang, Kevin Yang, a Chinese doctoral student researching immunology at an American university, is also reconsidering his options. After moving to the U.s. eight years ago, Yang has returned home each winter holiday and had his student visa renewed without a hitch. This year, though, Yang became one of many Chinese citizens caught up in the brutal tussle between Beijing and Washington over trade and technology. When Yang applied for a visa in December, the State Department told him it was being delayed while they investigated his background for ties to the Chinese government. American officials have in recent years grown alarmed over the alleged theft of U.S. technology by China, casting a cloud of suspicion on Chinese citizens like Yang who work in the sciences. Told the check would take four weeks, Yang changed his flights and prepared to stay longer. Then in late January, the Chinese government began locking down whole cities to contain the virus. Soon after, Trump announced the U.S. travel ban. Yang got his passport back in the mail with no visa. American officials told Yang’s academic adviser that since Yang no longer had a visa, they could no longer pay his stipend or fund his research with federal grant money. Hospital surveys that Yang said he spent “thousands of dollars and thousands of hours” over two years to set up were now in peril, something he described as a crushing blow. “Maybe it’s time for me to start thinking about an alternative career,” Yang said, mulling the possibility he won’t be able to finish his Ph.D. “It’s like restarting my life.” Discouraging high-skilled foreigners from immigrating could undermine the U.S. economy and its global prominence, said Anastasia Tonello, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Nearly 2.5 million Chinese were in the U.S. as of 2018, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, and most are significantly better educated than the average American. China is also the main source of foreign students enrolled in U.S. higher education. While health and safety are legitimate concerns, blanket travel bans aren’t the answer, Tonello said. “I just don’t think this was thought through,” she said. “These are just such broad strokes and can cause so much damage.” The U.S. isn’t the only country currently restricting entry from China. Travelers face restrictions across the globe, from neighboring North Korea to far-flung New Zealand, Somalia, and Guatemala. Australia, a major destination for Chinese students and immigrants, also has banned arrivals and stopped issuing visas. Such restrictions have been loudly criticized by China’s Foreign Ministry, though Beijing frequently singles out the United States. Yang and Huang both say they understand why a travel ban could help contain the virus. But they say the U.S. halt on new visas - with no deadline extensions or other accommodations - is frustrating and unreasonable. Even more frustrating for Huang is the sense that the U.S. is trying to bar her from coming back. “I’m not being respected. I work in the states as a talent; I pay my taxes diligently,” Huang said. “This just makes me feel like, ‘Oh, maybe I’m just not welcome in the states.’” Even for Chinese with visas, the clock is ticking. Tom, a programmer from the epicenter of the outbreak, the city of Wuhan, had just obtained a master’s degree in computer science from Emory University in Georgia. He has a U.S. visa but got stuck in Wuhan after the city was quarantined. Under American law, foreign students have 90 days after graduation to start new jobs if they want to stay and work in the U.S. If Tom is still trapped in Wuhan by May, he’ll lose both his new job at Amazon and his chance to work in America altogether. “I’d have to start all over again,” Tom said, declining to provide his last name for fear it could affect his visa and career prospects. “I just worry every day about whether I can go back to America.” Tom says his family spent around $70,000 to send him to Emory for a shot at a better life in the U.S. He didn’t want to work in China, deterred by the Chinese tech industry’s notoriously-long hours, popularly known as “996” –9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. U.S. officials told him there was nothing he could do.  “We just want some help or advice,” Tom said. “Please don’t ignore us, it’s something completely out of our control. That’s the worst thing.” ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

"PHOENIX (AP) - The U.S. government says a new rule disqualifying more people from green cards if they use government benefits will not apply to immigrants with coronavirus or virus symptoms if they seek care.  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said late Friday that seeking treatment or preventive services won’t affect someone’s immigration status under the new, highly criticized public charge rule, which took effect last month and which punishes immigrants who need public assistance.  The agency acknowledged that some immigrants may fear seeking care in the wake of the virus, saying that it “will neither consider testing, treatment, nor preventative care” related to the virus in determining someone’s eligibility for permanent residency. It said that those who can’t work or attend school and must rely on public benefits during the duration of the virus outbreak and recovery can later explain and provide documentation and that it will be taken into consideration.  The announcement came after lawmakers and advocacy groups urged the government to suspend the rule during the coronavirus outbreak. Advocates say they have been fielding panicked calls from immigrants who are worried about the impact on their status if they seek health care.  Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles, said her group and others held a news conference urging immigrants to seek care if needed and reminding them that their health, and the health of their families, is most important.  “People are wondering about their vulnerability both in terms of disease but their vulnerability in terms of immigration status, in terms of being discovered,” she said. Salas said she doesn’t fully trust the Trump administration but feels confident that state, county and local authorities will support immigrants who come forward to seek the health care they need, regardless of their immigration status. Advocates have long derided the public charge rule, which punishes immigrants who are in the country legally and who are allowed to access some benefits, such as food stamps, for their American-born children.  As the coronavirus began to spread more widely in the U.S., supporters and lawmakers cautioned it could be detrimental to public health if some immigrants were too afraid to seek care.  Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights Boston, said his organization got a request for legal support from a woman who worked in hospitality industry in Chelsea, Massachusetts. The woman said her work schedule is in flux, and she doesn’t have a steady income. She wanted to apply for food stamps for her 9-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, but was too afraid. Now, with her son’s school closing down indefinitely, she was even more concerned.  “There is a tremendous reluctance, even among immigrant parents raising U.S. citizen children. There is a lot of fear surrounding the public charge rule, especially because immigration courts have remained open, creating a strong impression that removal proceedings trumps public health concerns,” Espinoza-Madrigal said.  On Thursday, Democratic lawmakers pressured Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, to suspend or disregard the rule during the virus outbreak. Cuccinelli said the public health exemptions written into the rule already addressed that issue.  U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, said the rule scares away people from seeking care, posing a public health risk for everyone. She tweeted after the new statement on Friday: “This is a huge win for immigrants, public health AND everyone!” ___ Associated Press reporter Amy Taxin contributed to this report   ",US: Immigrants can seek coronavirus care without fear,"Friday, March 13, 2020",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/13/us-immigrants-can-seek-coronavirus-care-without-fe/,washington_times
"WASHINGTON (AP) - Seattle’s immigration court will close down as the nation continues to grapple with managing the coronavirus pandemic, and several other large immigration courts will postpone certain hearings for immigrants who are not detained that often involve large groups.  The court in Seattle was temporarily shut down earlier this week over a report of a second-hand exposure to the virus and will remain shut until April 10. Seattle is among the areas hardest hit so far, with a cluster of deaths and dozens sickened. The number of cases in the U.S. was put at around 1,700 Friday, with about 50 deaths. But by some estimates, at least 14,000 people might be infected. According to a statement obtained by The Associated Press from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which manages the immigration court system, other courts will remain open where the virus has struck, including Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Newark, New Jersey, and Sacramento, California. But “master calendar” dates for those who are not detained will be postponed. Those hearings can include dozens of people in a single courtroom. “The agency continues to evaluate the dynamic situation nationwide and will make decisions for each location as more information becomes available,” according to the statement from EOIR, which is a division of the U.S. Department of Justice.  There are 68 immigration courts nationwide; the others will operate as scheduled but officials with EOIR said they are evaluating and will adjust as needed.                  The U.S. immigration courts  are dealing with a massive backlog of 1 million cases. There have been some delays of trials among the nation’s criminal courts, and some states have closed courtrooms as the virus spreads.  There have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the immigration system, but it’s not clear how frequently tests are being performed, if at all. There is often movement between detention facilities at the border, where some migrants enter the U.S. sick, and throughout the immigration system that has put employees on edge.  A union representing immigration judges has called for a temporary halt to the “master calendar” hearings. On Thursday, Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the head of the union, wrote to the leadership of EOIR asking for more measures be put in place to protect judges and employees.  “In the absence of uniform guidance, some immigration judges have attempted to implement their own risk mitigation strategies,” she wrote. “However, these efforts have been frustrated by a time-consuming bureaucratic process that is simply not sufficient in the current circumstances.” Tabbador also called the postponements in six cities “wholly inadequate to address the public health risk” and called on EOIR “to shut down all of these large group hearings in all immigration courts across the country.” In El Paso, Texas, some guards work shifts at both the long-term detention center and the public courts where people are not detained. On Friday, guards were seen interacting with two dozen migrants for a mass hearing in the non-detained court, which sits on the 7th floor of a building that also has public offices for the IRS and other federal agencies.  The migrants have been required to live in Mexico while they apply for asylum. They sleep in a network of shelters in Ciudad Juarez, along with migrants from other countries and other continents.  Separately on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it would temporarily suspend social visits at all of its detention facilities across the U.S. Officials said there were no detainees in ICE custody who had confirmed cases of COVID-19 and said canceling visitation was precautionary to “further safeguard those in our care.” ICE holds more than 37,888 immigrants in more than 130 facilities, including local jails and prisons. But unlike other detention centers, have wide discretion on who can be released while their cases wind through the courts.  The federal Bureau of Prisons also shut down visitation; inmates at all 122 federal correctional facilities across the country will no longer be allowed visits from family, friends or attorneys for the next 30 days. ___ Associated Press Writer Cedar Attanasio contributed to this report from El Paso, Texas.

"DETROIT (AP) - An expected guilty plea to corruption charges by former United Auto Workers President Gary Jones has been delayed due to the coronavirus and traveling concerns. Jones was to appear in federal court in Detroit on Thursday. He’s accused of conspiring with UAW cronies to embezzle more than $1 million. Defense attorney Bruce Maffeo told The Detroit News that he asked for - and received - a two-week delay and that the guilty plea now will come on April 2. Maffeo is from New York.

Some officials took kickbacks from union contractors. Jones was president for about 1 1/2 years until quitting under a cloud in November. The government said union money was spent on golf, cigars, spas, high-end lodging and liquor. Jones‘ alleged scheme goes back years to his time as the leader of a UAW regional office near St. Louis.

"LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) - Slovenia’s new, right-leaning government was sworn in on Friday, pledging stronger efforts to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. The 90-member parliament voted 52-31 to approve a coalition government led by Prime Minister Janez Jansa, leader of the anti-immigrant Slovenian Democratic Party and an ally of Hungary’s hardline Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Jansa, 61, promised a more concerted effort to contain the spread of the disease, criticizing the previous government which declared an epidemic on Thursday. The outgoing government “flunked the test in recent days,” Jansa said. “What was coming was underestimated and reactions were chaotic,” the official STA news agency quoted Jansa as saying.  Slovenia reported 141 cases of infections on Friday, with a surge of 45 new confirmed cases in less than 24 hours in the Alpine country of 2 million people that borders Italy, the focus of Europe’s coronavirus crisis.  Jansa’s predecessor, Prime Minister Marjan Sarec, was a rare liberal head of government in Central and Eastern Europe. He announced he was stepping down in January, citing lack of support for his minority government.  Sarec, a former actor and comedian, had called for an early election, but his two former coalition partners instead agreed to form a new government with Jansa.  Jansa served twice as the prime minister in the past. He was convicted of corruption in a verdict that was later overturned by Slovenia’s top court, before turning harshly anti-immigrant ahead of the 2018 election that followed the mass influx of migrants into Europe in 2015-16. Jansa’s SDS won the most votes in the 2018 parliamentary election, but other groups in parliament initially refused to cooperate with the party because of its right-wing policies. Analysts in Slovenia say Jansa somewhat has toned down his rhetoric to position himself as an acceptable political figure.

"CHICAGO (AP) — Joe Biden held a town hall in Illinois — or at least  tried to — from 800 miles away in Delaware. Bernie Sanders is staging  daily news conferences from Vermont, instead of his usual rallies around  the country with thousands of supporters. The global coronavirus pandemic has sent the 2020 presidential campaign into a virtual phase. Big rallies and handshakes are out. Virtual phone banks and town  halls are the new normal. Political parties and groups are canceling  in-person gatherings. States holding primaries in coming weeks have urged more voters to  cast ballots by mail and extended hours for early voting centers in an  effort to avoid election day crowds. On Friday, Louisiana’s governor  said he planned to postpone his state’s April 4  primary to June. The Biden campaign scrapped plans for a Chicago rally ahead of  Illinois’ Tuesday primary due to warnings from public and health  officials against large gatherings. Instead, the Democratic front-runner  was supposed to take questions Friday in a virtual town hall via  Facebook live. But it was a rocky start. The livestream started after Biden had  begun speaking, cutting off his introduction, and at one point Biden -  holding a cell phone in his hand - turned and walked partially off  camera, so viewers could no longer see his face. The stream lasted less  than five minutes before wrapping up, with the campaign apologizing for  “technical difficulties.” “I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the  connections,” Biden said after answering a question about protecting  endangered species. “There’s a lot more to say but I’ve already probably  said too much to you.” Sanders, Biden’s rival for the Democratic nomination, has been  holding daily press briefings from his home state, where he has blasted  President Donald Trump and his administration’s response to the virus.  Biden did the same in an address Thursday. Speaking to reporters Friday, Sanders was subdued - the emotional  opposite of the big rallies that have helped fuel his support at the  polls. He drew over 10,000 people at a Chicago rally on Saturday, before  officials starting warning against large events. Sanders said his team  has mastered the use of internet campaigning, livestreaming almost all  of its events already. COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and  cough, for most people. It can cause more severe illness, including  pneumonia, for some people, especially older adults and those with  existing health problems. Most people recover from it. Those with mild  illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness  may take three to six weeks to recover, according to the World Health  Organization. With the coronavirus causing a sea change in presidential  campaigning, candidates and their supporters worry that the virtual  events won’t have the same impact. “We do more rallies than anybody else, and (they’re) often very well  attended. I love to do them,” Sanders told reporters at a hotel in his  home state of Vermont. “This coronavirus has obviously impacted our  ability to communicate with people in the traditional way that we do.  That’s hurting.” In Chicago, Biden volunteer Lally Doerrer was preparing to have a few  other supporters over to her home Friday to watch the virtual town  hall. The retiree finished an online MBA program a few years ago and  said it helped familiarize her with technology like virtual classrooms  and the potential for it to reach many more people than a rally. And  while she believes canceling large gatherings is the right thing to do,  she doesn’t think the virtual events will have the same impact as when  people come together in person. “There is a common physical element that comes from being face to  face, or better yet marching side by side, and that’s what is lost in  this,” Doerrer said. At Biden headquarters, Friday is the last day before the campaign  moves to a work-at-home model for everyone, from the most senior  advisers to the newest organizer. The policy extends to field offices around the country, as well —  just as the campaign was looking to build out the campaign toward a  potential general election matchup against President Donald Trump. Trump  himself has canceled rallies, for now. Biden advisers are reluctant to talk about what the coming weeks may  look like, mostly because they don’t know. They’ve not announced a  public schedule beyond Friday’s town hall and a similar event in Miami  on Monday, both replacing scheduled rallies ahead of Tuesday primaries. If anything, those events are tryouts for a new style, while aides  continue monitoring public health advisories from the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention. In a staff memo, Anita Dunn, Biden’s top strategist, and Jen O’Malley  Dillon, his new campaign manager, said that as of Thursday, that  guidance still suggests that “small gatherings are safe,” as long as no  exposed persons participate. “We will continue to hold smaller events  like roundtables, house parties and press statements,” besides the  virtual events. It’s not the first time this election cycle that candidates have had  to get creative about reaching voters. Stuck in Washington for Trump’s  impeachment trial in the weeks before the kickoff Iowa caucuses, Sens.  Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar held telephone town halls with Iowa  voters, and Sanders held nightly online chats where he spoke to  supporters via live stream, offering updates on the impeachment trial  and his campaign. Klobuchar, who said over 12,000 Iowa voters participated in one of  her telephone town halls, also spoke via phone to voters in New  Hampshire, the second state to vote. Warren held similar calls with  voters in New Hampshire and South Carolina ahead of those states’  primaries, as she campaigned elsewhere. She suggested later while  campaigning in person that she’d reached thousands of voters that way,  but her campaign never released figures on how many people actually  dialed in. Biden has held at least one virtual fundraiser, a rather uneventful  telephone gathering on Dec. 5, when he called in and essentially  delivered a modified version of a stump speech that he’s since  overhauled. Last week, he called in to a fundraiser being held at a  private residence in northern Virginia. Donors heard in person from  former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who’s endorsed Biden, and Steve  Ricchetti, one of his closest and longest-serving advisers, before the  former vice president called in. ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta.
